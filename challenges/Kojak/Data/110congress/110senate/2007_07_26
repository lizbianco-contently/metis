Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period \nof morning business for an hour. Once that is closed, we will go back \nto the Homeland Security appropriations bill. There are no votes \nscheduled, although there are seven amendments pending. Perhaps we can \ndispose of some of those before lunch. We will certainly have some \nvotes during the day.\n  Another issue which I have mentioned on many occasions is the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations conference report. That report was to be \nfiled late last night. It is not available. It should be momentarily. \nWe will make sure Senators have the opportunity to look at that. It is \na large document.\n  Let's talk about this week. I know there is a trip scheduled this \nweekend. I contacted Senator Boxer last night and indicated to her I \nwasn't quite certain it would be able to take place. She was \nunderstanding and said I would have to do what I have to do, although \nshe was disappointed. Maybe the trip can still go. It is a bipartisan \ntrip to Greenland, led by Senators Boxer and Isakson.\n  We don't have a lot to do this week, but it could take a lot of time. \nWe have 2 days. It is Thursday. We need to finish Homeland Security \nappropriations. I had a conversation last night with Senator Cornyn. We \nwere waiting to get his language yesterday when we were trying to work \nsomething out for funding for the border. He had it written out in \nlonghand. Anyway, we don't have it yet, but I am sure we will get that \nsoon. Maybe we can complete that with a unanimous consent. Senator \nVoinovich indicated he wished to speak on it for a while but not long. \nSo we want to accommodate him.\n  So we want to finish the bill we are on, either today or tomorrow. \nThe other thing we need to do is complete the conference report. I hope \nwe don't have to file cloture on the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill, which I have said many times I don't want to do. It is an open \nprocess, where people can file amendments, and they have done that. We \nhope we don't have to file cloture also on the conference report. What \nI wish to do--and I indicated this on a number of occasions--is to be \nable to start SCHIP on Monday. It appears that is pretty well set, what \nwould happen when we get to that bill. It is a bipartisan bill that \nwould be brought to the floor. There are a number of Senators who have \nworked on a substitute--Senator Kyl, among others. That substitute \nwould certainly be the main topic of the debate. I am confident there \nwill be some other amendments offered, but that is the main issue as to \nwhether the substitute would pass.\n  So children's health, we need to do that next week. I hope we can \nstart it on Monday. Then the only other thing we need to do is to \ncomplete ethics and lobbying reform. As I have indicated, I wish to \nstart another appropriations bill, but that would not take a vote \nduring this session, though we would move to it before we leave. We \nwould only do WRDA, the conference report\n\n[[Page S10052]]\n\non WRDA. It is my understanding the conference is basically completed, \nbut we would only move to that if Senators Boxer and Inhofe indicated \nthey wanted us to do that. I understand they do. It has wide-ranging \nbipartisan support. But that wasn't in my original package and that \nwill not hold us up. The only thing that will hold us up is the bill we \nare on now, SCHIP, 9/11 Commission recommendations and the ethics and \nlobbying reform. So I hope we can complete those things in a timely \nfashion, and I hope we don't have to work this weekend. If we do \nbecause of cloture votes, then we will schedule those according to \nwhatever the standard procedure is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10052-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise with a great deal of joy and \nenthusiasm this morning, as the senior Senator from Maryland, to be a \npart of what all of Maryland is doing today. We are on the road to \nCooperstown. We are literally in our cars or renting transportation to \nbe heading to Cooperstown, and we are going to Cooperstown in our \nhearts, because on Sunday, our beloved all-around Marylander, all-\naround American hero, Cal Ripken, Jr. will be inducted into the Hall of \nFame.\n  We are so excited about this because we want the world to know Cal \nRipken as we know Cal Ripken. What a great guy. The world knows him as \na fantastic baseball player, and he certainly is. I will go into his \nrecord in a minute. But he is also a fantastic human being, a devoted \nfather, a faithful husband, a man of the community, giving his time and \nenergy to philanthropic work. When we call him the ``Iron Man,'' he \nabsolutely is.\n  Throughout his 21-year career, he has been the epitome of ``Iron \nMan,'' both on and off the field. I watched Cal going from being \nunknown to being the best known baseball player from Baltimore since \nBabe Ruth. I was there that last day at Memorial Stadium, when we \nclosed the stadium down, and I was there on opening day at Camden \nYards, and Cal was there, and I will watch him as he is inducted into \nthe Hall of Fame. For we Oriole fans, it was never ``if'' Cal would go \ninto the Hall of Fame, it was simply when.\n  Now, all baseball fans know about something called ``the streak.'' We \nremember the victory lap he took around Camden Yards on that very \nspecial night. As we were heading into that record-breaking, show-up-\nat-every-game Cal Ripken event, there was a countdown that was going on \nall over. At Camden Yards every day, they had the number when Cal would \ncome out on the field. In my own office in the Hart Building, I had a \ngreat big banner for our own countdown.\n  There he was: 2,632 consecutive games. During that time, he hit 431 \nhomeruns. He also started in 19 All-Star games. He won two American \nLeague Golden Glove awards, eight Silver Slugger awards, two American \nLeague Most Valuable Players, and the statistics go on.\n  But statistics don't tell the real Ripken story. We remember not the \nnumbers, but we remember the man--the strong, dependable presence of \nCal Ripken, Jr. Night after night, day after day, sometimes through \ninjuries, through the wide range of emotions and pressures experienced \nas a major leaguer, at every game there he was: at third base, at \nshortstop, smiling at doing his job and doing it well.\n  I remember that fateful night when Cal broke the Lou Gehrig standing \nrecord. To see that banner drop from 2,130 to 2,131 and hear the \nadmiration and the jubilation of the crowd in Baltimore is something I \nwill always remember. The sustained cheers were never ending as Cal, \nurged by Rafael Palmeiro, took a lap around the field. It was a proud \nnight for the Ripken family, for the Orioles, and for Maryland.\n  Mr. President, I wish you had been there that night. It was a magical \nnight. Families came from all over to that game. Now, when I walked \ninto Camden Yards, I thought maybe it would be a raucous night. Maybe \nit would be a spirit of New Year's Eve that we have in the Inner \nHarbor. But when you walked into Camden Yards, it was a quiet night. It \nwas a respectful night. It had an air of great dignity. People were \nbringing their children. They had come from all over. They knew that \nsomething very special was going to happen because of a very special \nman. That evening had as much dignity as the player himself.\n  Cal's accomplishments transcend well beyond the baseball field. His \ncharacter and demeanor are reflected in the successes he experiences \nevery day on the field and off the field. He shows up and gives his \nmaximum effort in every aspect. He puts his family above all. He is a \ncommunity philanthropist and is committed to living something called \nthe ``Ripken way.'' The Ripken way was something taught to him by his \nfather, that very well-known baseball manager, Cal Ripken, Sr. Now, \nthis Ripken way is something special. It isn't complex. Did the Ripkens \nhire a consultant or handlers to tell them about it? How did they do \nit? It came from their hearts, their experience, and their commitment \nto values.\n  The Ripken way is a value-driven leadership way. Its wisdom is to \nbuild great players and bind generations together. Here is what it is: \nNo. 1, keep it simple. No. 2, explain the why of what you are doing to \nthe people who are affected. Celebrate the individual. Make it fun and \nsweat those details and learn the little things so the big things can \nbe done the right way. It emphasizes clarity, simplicity and, most of \nall, personal integrity.\n  I think the Ripken way is being used all over Maryland. It is used in \nour businesses and in our homes. It is in our hospitals, where Cal and \nhis wife Kelly have contributed so much to children, and it is in our \nhearts today as we salute Cal Ripken and the wonderful honor he is \nreceiving.\n  He applies the Ripken way on the ballfield and off the ballfield. He \nhas established a foundation in his father's name: The Cal Ripken, Sr. \nFoundation, which helps young people learn not only baseball but the \nvalues of sportsmanship and the values of integrity, honor, and \nfidelity, the things that do build iron in your character. This is the \nlegacy which shapes Cal's life, and so he wants to pass it on. Cal may \nbe the local boy, but he is now an international hero.\n\n  There is no question that Cal has earned his way into the Hall of \nFame. We congratulate him on his very stellar career. We so admire his \nwork ethic and his commitment to community, to country, and for the \nwell-deserved honor of being inducted into the Hall of Fame. While Cal \nhas already achieved so much, I cannot help thinking about him that the \nbest is yet to come.\n  On behalf of Senator Cardin and myself, I will introduce to have \nreferred to the appropriate committee a resolution commemorating Cal on \nhis outstanding career in baseball and for his induction into the Hall \nof Fame.\n  Mr. President, these are tough times in the Senate. So when we can \ntalk about something that really does deal with honor, fidelity, a \ncommitment to\n\n[[Page S10053]]\n\ncommunity, a commitment to country, and showing up every day and \ngetting the job done, I think the way Cal would want us to tip our hats \nto him would be to step up to the plate and do our jobs and to do it \nthe Ripken way. That is what I would like to do.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska).

Mr. President, I understand there are only a few minutes \nremaining in morning business, which is our opportunity to talk about a \nwide range of topics. We have a lot of important business going on in \nthe Senate. We have the Homeland Security appropriations bill, which we \nwant to pass quickly to keep our Nation safe. Then we are going to turn \nto the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Most Americans recall after 9/\n11, we appointed a very good bipartisan group to come up with \nsuggestions to make America safer. Unfortunately, those suggestions \nhave not been acted on, and each year the commission gives the \nGovernment a failing grade when it comes to their compliance, so we \nwant to change that situation. This year, with the new Congress, we \npassed the implementation of these recommendations and hope to bring \nthose to the floor this week and have them enacted.\n  We also have pending major ethics reform. Most people are, \nunfortunately, inured to the prospect of stories of corruption in \nWashington. Some of the events that have happened over the last several \nyears have been horrendous, leading to the prosecution of Members of \nCongress and many lobbyists in town. It is time to change that \nsituation. We have a bill that will move us dramatically in the right \ndirection, the most significant ethics reform in the history of \nCongress. It has been caught up in a lot of political debate and \nwrangling. Now is the time to move it forward, enact it into the rules, \nthe law of the land, and apply it to the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Then next week comes a critically important bill. There are 47 \nmillion uninsured Americans, many of them children. Right now we have a \nprogram where we provide Federal funds to States so they can help us in \ninsuring those children. We have about 6 million children who are now \ncovered by this plan, kids who otherwise would not have health \ninsurance.\n  Incidentally, most of them are children of parents who are working, \nwho go to work every day. They are not poor enough to have the \nGovernment insure them, and they are not wealthy enough to insure \nthemselves. They get caught in the middle. Six million children have \nprotection today.\n  The program expires September 30. We want to make sure those kids are \nnot left without coverage, and we have another 9 million children who \nare eligible who have not been brought in. The Senate Finance Committee \nis going to expand the number covered from 6 million to 9 million \nnationwide.\n  I wish we could do more. We should cover them all. Why wouldn't we as \nAmericans want our kids to have basic health insurance protection? \nUnfortunately, even though our bill is bipartisan, it is reasonable, it \nis within our budget, the White House said the President will veto it. \nThe President's reason for vetoing the children's health insurance \nbill? It is hard to believe, but he says it is unfair to private health \ninsurance companies. Unfair to private health insurance companies? Most \nAmericans understand that for most of those companies, each year means \nhigher premiums and lower coverage, and many of those companies have \nfailed to come forward to find ways to bring Americans into health \ninsurance coverage. There are not going to be many tears shed for that \nindustry. We should have our concern and focus on the children who are \ngoing to be left behind when it comes to health insurance if the \nPresident vetoes this bill.\n  Next week we will focus on that legislation. We will try to get down \nand pass this, get together with the House of Representatives, and send \nit to the President as quickly as possible.\n  In August, we have a 3- or 4-week recess, which I assume we will be \ntaking most of, and then come back in September in the first week. \nThere are a lot of appropriations bills to consider at that time. We \nwill go back to the Defense authorization bill and a very important \nnational debate on the war in Iraq. The administration promises us \nSeptember 15 to give us a status report, as required by law.\n  Most of the indicators are that the violence continues in Iraq. The \nGovernment continues to disappoint us and, unfortunately, American \ndeaths continue to mount. That debate in September is going to be a \ncritical watershed debate. We need to have more Republican Senators \ncross the aisle and join us to call for a new policy in Iraq. So far 4 \nof the 49 Republicans have come to our side. We need 11. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to work for a cooperative \nbipartisan approach to a new direction in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last evening the majority leader and I had \nan exchange on the Senate floor with regard to a proposed amendment by \nour side that would enhance Federal spending on border security \nmeasures and interior enforcement by $3 billion. While it is fair to \nsay there was virtually universal support on this side of the aisle, \nthere was some objection on the other side of the aisle, so that \namendment was defeated.\n  Then the majority leader came back with a proposal that would strip \nsome of the language from that amendment, but nevertheless would commit \n$3 billion to border security. I told the majority leader that I \nbelieved it should also include a way to spend that money not just on \nthe border but also for interior enforcement of our immigration laws. \nIn particular, I mentioned the sad phenomenon of roughly 600,000 \nabsconders, people who have been ordered deported and who have simply \ngone underground rather than obey that lawful order from a court, or \npeople who have actually been deported and then reentered the country \nafter they have been deported. Both of those categories of individuals \nare known as absconders. They are, under the Immigration and \nNaturalization Act, felons.\n  I thought it was important that if we were going to be serious about \nenforcing our immigration laws we not just deal with the border, as \nimportant as that is, but we also deal with interior enforcement.\n  We were unable to reach an agreement last night, but I am pleased to \nsay the majority leader was generous enough to call me last night and \nto tell me he wanted to look more closely at the language we had \nproposed. I take it from some of his remarks this morning on the floor \nthat it is likely we will be able to reach some sort of agreement that \nwill see those funds in this bill, $3 billion, where the Federal \nGovernment will finally do what it has advertised and promised to do \nfor a long time, and that is to actually put the resources behind \nborder security and enforcement of our immigration laws, rather than \npromise a lot and deliver very little.\n\n  I am grateful to the majority leader for working with me on that \nissue. I am hopeful Senator Graham, who was the principal proponent of \nthe border security amendment yesterday that I was proud to cosponsor, \nwill be back here at 10:30 a.m. when we get back on the bill to talk \nabout that amendment. I hope we can reach an agreement. It will go a \nlong way toward beginning to regain the lost confidence and trust of \nthe American people when it comes to our broken immigration system.\n  If there is one diagnosis I would make from our immigration debate \nover the last few weeks, it has been that people do not trust the \nFederal Government to actually do what it promises to do in this area. \nWhere we have to start is on a firm foundation of border security and \ninterior enforcement and from that build to a more comprehensive \napproach that deals with all aspects of the problem.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10054-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10054]]\n                     ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about health care because \nwe are going to be on this issue next week. It seems to me there are \nthree things we all care deeply about in this country, no matter who we \nare or from where we come, and that is access to good quality education \nfor all of our children, a job for people who want to work, and access \nto quality health care.\n  The fact is, in my State, unfortunately, we have a health care crisis \nbecause about 25 percent of the population in my State does not have \nhealth insurance. So where they go for their health care is to the \nemergency rooms of the local hospitals, and that creates a lot of \nproblems because that is the most expensive health care, the emergency \nroom. People who go to the emergency room for their primary health \ncare, if it is not truly an emergency but they have nowhere else to \ngo--and you can hardly blame them--what it does is causes a lot of \nemergency rooms to go on divert status, and so true emergencies have to \ngo to a farther off location to get care, thus entailing some risk and \npotentially even loss of life as a result of the delays.\n  We have to tackle this problem. I know there are a lot of good ideas \nout there. We will be talking about some of those ideas next week when \nwe talk about the reauthorization of the SCHIP program, the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, that is important to my State and \nimportant to insuring children around the country.\n  The problem that has grown up in SCHIP is that, unfortunately, \nCongress's original intent to provide health insurance to low-income \nchildren, up to 200 percent of the poverty level, has simply been \novertaken by some States. I believe it is a total of 14 States now that \nuse that money, those Federal funds, Federal taxpayer funds, to \nactually insure adults, obviously not part of Congress's intent, which \nwas to focus on low-income children.\n  Additionally, the original concept of SCHIP was dedicated to low-\nincome children up to 200 percent of poverty level. We have seen \nproposals where some have said it ought to go up to as much as 400 \npercent of the poverty level, which, for a family of four, can mean an \nincome over $80,000 a year and a mandate that SCHIP be used to provide \nhealth insurance for people with incomes in excess of $80,000 a year \nfor a family of four.\n  The challenge I think we have is to make a decision between whether \nwe are going to continue to encourage access to private health \ninsurance, a market-driven response, or whether we are going to simply \nsay the Federal Government is going to take this whole matter over and \nwe are going to have a single-payer system, a national system for \nproviding health care. That, to me, is a very important debate.\n  Frankly, from my standpoint, I believe every American needs the \nresources and the ability to purchase health insurance. I think going \nto a single-payer, Washington-controlled health care system is simply \nnot the way to go. There are a number of ways we can approach this, and \nI hope this important debate we will have next week will address these \nissues.\n  I think we have to end Tax Code discrimination against those who \ncannot get health insurance through their employer by giving a tax \nbreak to every American so they can purchase their own health \ninsurance. Part of the problem is, people are frequently bound to an \nemployer. They are afraid to leave that employer lest they be precluded \nfrom getting another health insurance policy because of previous \nexisting conditions. So many people simply lack the portability of \ntheir health insurance, the ability to take it from job to job. In \neffect, they are bound almost to the extent of involuntary servitude \nwith their current employer. We have to change that by creating \nportability.\n  I think we need to give individuals the ability to take control of \ntheir health care needs and to continue to preserve something they \nthink is very important, and that is the relationship between the \npatient and their health care provider, along with the freedom to \nchoose what is in the best interest of that individual patient, rather \nthan to have the Government determine for them what kind of health care \nthey are going to get and perhaps ration it and create a huge, \nexpensive bureaucracy to do so.\n  I also hope part of this debate on reauthorization of the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program will allow us to look at what the \nultimate goals are of some of the proponents. One concern I have is \nthat the dramatic expansion of funding proposed by the Finance \nCommittee--in language we haven't yet seen--will be a precursor to one \nmore incremental step to a Government-controlled, Washington-centered \nhealth care bureaucracy, and that will make it harder and harder for us \nto provide the opportunity for individuals to purchase their own health \ninsurance, along with the right to choose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will just take a minute and then the \nSenator from Texas can speak. I told the Senator from South Carolina \nthat I was going to make a unanimous-consent request.\n  I say to my friend from Texas, what a difference a night makes. As \nyou know--as some know, not very many--Senator Cornyn and I, Senator \nGraham, and a few others were trying to work something out on border \nsecurity, and Senator Cornyn and I were the last two to speak on this \nissue. Like a lot of things around here, if you don't get your way, you \nkind of throw a tantrum a lot of times. I didn't get my way, so I \nthought I would throw just a little tantrum.\n  The evening has brought to my attention that I was wrong. Senator \nCornyn was right. I hate to acknowledge that, but that is basically \nvalid. Having said that, Mr. President, and swallowing a little bit of \npride, which I shouldn't have had, I now ask unanimous consent that \nwhen the Senate resumes consideration of H.R. 2638 today--which will be \nin just a few minutes--the time until 11:35 a.m. be for debate with \nrespect to the Graham-Pryor border security amendment--and that has the \nlanguage of the Senator from Texas in it--I would interrupt and say \nthat I have spoken to the distinguished Republican manager and told him \nI was going to offer this consent agreement--with the time divided as \nfollows: 30 minutes under the control of Senator Voinovich and the \nremaining time equally divided and controlled between Senators Graham \nand Pryor or their designees; that no amendments be in order to the \namendment prior to the vote; that upon yielding back of time, the \nSenate proceed to vote on the amendment, with no further intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to \nobject, I want to be sure that there is consent on this side among \nthose who are engaged in the debate, specifically the Senator from \nTexas and the Senator from South Carolina, so that they understand the \nproposed order and have no objections to it.\n  Mr. REID. Is our consent granted, Mr. President?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. We are getting his reaction to it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have no objection, and I appreciate the \ngenerous remarks of the majority leader and his willingness to work \nwith Senator Graham and me on this important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that out of our \nallotted morning business time I be granted 5 more minutes, and then I \nwill turn the floor over to my other colleagues who wish to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I appreciate that, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, one of the concerns I think many people have about the \ndramatic expansion proposed by the Senate Finance Committee's adding an \nadditional $35 billion on top of the existing $25 billion commitment \nfor State\n\n[[Page S10055]]\n\nhealth insurance plans in the SCHIP program is that it bears remarkable \nresemblance to a plan originally proposed by the health care task force \nof President Clinton, and particularly the one that has come to be \nknown--and I don't know whether she takes pride in this title or is \noffended by it, and I certainly don't mean any offense, but sometimes \nknown as Hillary Care.\n  This was a plan, as we will all recall, that grew out of a task force \nchaired by the then-First Lady which I think states very clearly its \ngoal to start the role of Federal control of health coverage with kids \nfirst, or children, and then to add employer groups, individuals, and \nthen Medicaid recipients. So that instead of the current 50 percent of \nhealth care in America today paid for by the Federal taxpayer and the \nFederal Government, it would grow to 100 percent, which would simply \npreclude any private marketplace and the individual choice that goes \nalong with it for individuals.\n  Mr. President, just so you don't take my word for it and that it is \nmade clear, I will offer from that task force report page 22, and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Clearly, in this document, you will see that it does say \nthat this proposal phases in universal coverage starting with Kids \nFirst. It says Kids First is really a precursor to the new system, and \nthen other populations it proposes to phase in are employer groups, \nindividuals, Medicaid recipients, and the like.\n  So I think that is what a lot of us are concerned about. And perhaps \nSenator Clinton, now that she is a Member of this body, will talk to us \na little bit about it and what her intentions are, what the intentions \nof the proponents are of the Finance Committee bill because there are \nsome very serious concerns.\n  I will yield in a moment to the Senator from South Carolina, who has \nbeen so active in this area, but I think, as he will explain, there are \na lot of us who would like to see not just additional money being \nprovided for children's health insurance but that literally we make as \nour goal to provide each and every American access to their own health \ninsurance, along with the individual choice and the freedom and the \nportability that will provide.\n  I know the Senator from South Carolina has done an awful lot of work \non it--I have learned a lot from him in this area--and I think it is an \nimportant time to start this critical debate, and not just stop with \nthe expansion of the SCHIP program, but to seek as our goal to provide \neach and every individual access to health care coverage of their own \nchoosing.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                     Option 3: Kids First Coverage\n\n       Implementation Start: January 1, 1995.\n       Phase-in: By Population, Beginning with Children.\n       Universal Coverage Achieved by: January 1, 2000.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       This proposal phases in universal coverage, minimizes the \n     financial burden of the program at the outset, and covers the \n     most vulnerable of our citizens--children--as quickly as \n     possible. Under this approach, health care reform is phased \n     in by population, beginning with children. Other populations \n     are phased in as follows: Employer Groups: July, 1997; \n     Individuals: January, 1998; Medicaid: January, 2000.\n       States may be granted a grace period under certain \n     circumstances.\n       This proposal is designed in two parts which will be \n     implemented simultaneously:\n       I. The quick coverage of children--``Kids First''; and,\n       II. the development of structures for transitioning to the \n     new system and the phasing in of certain population groups.\n       Part I, Kids First is really a precursor to the new system. \n     It is intended to be freestanding and administratively \n     simple, with States given broad flexibility in its design so \n     that it can be easily folded into existing/future program \n     structures. The Federal government, States, and the private \n     sector will play a role in its implementation and financing.\n       Part II of this proposal involves the development of \n     purchasing cooperative (PC) structures and the actual phase-\n     in of all other population groups within the PC system.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for helping \nto start a very important national discussion about how we get every \nAmerican insured. We can see in Washington, as we expand government \nhealth care, as we continue to expand unfunded liabilities into the \nfuture, and we add administrative costs, we are not covering people who \nneed to be covered still.\n  When we look at our Tax Code and realize that there has been a lot of \ninequity there, that we are helping some buy health insurance but only \nif they work for the right employer, we need to look at being fair with \nour Tax Code and developing a policy that will help every American have \na health policy they can own and afford and keep. We will be talking a \nlot more about health care later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10055-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10055-S10058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I wanted to talk about a couple of \namendments that I have to the Homeland Security appropriations bill \ntoday. First, I would like to bring up the matter of security itself \nand how it affects our ports. Certainly, it is unfortunate that we have \nto be here once again to talk about threats to our homeland, but that \nis the reality we face today.\n  The amendment I am talking about now has been filed. It is amendment \nNo. 2481. It will help us address some of the vulnerabilities and help \nsecure the American people. This amendment, No. 2481, which I will \nbring up later today, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security \nfrom using any funds to remove items from the list of offenses that \ndisqualifies individuals from receiving a transportation worker \nidentification credential--what we call the TWIC card.\n  Mr. President, we can spend all the money in the world screening \ncargo and hiring security personnel, but if someone working in our \nseaports looks the other way when something dangerous enters our \ncountry, all of our spending and all of our work is for nothing. \nSerious felons are prime targets for those trying to smuggle a nuclear \ndevice or a chemical weapon into our country, and we must close that \nsecurity gap.\n  My colleagues will no doubt recall that I have tried to address this \nissue two times in the past year, and both times my amendments received \noverwhelming support. Yet we have not yet seen a sufficient result from \nthe effort to secure the American people's safety.\n  Last fall, the Senate accepted an amendment I offered to the SAFE \nPort Act to close this dangerous loophole by codifying the Department \nof Homeland Security's rules banning serious felons from gaining access \nto the secure areas of our Nation's ports. In effect, it would have \nprevented these felons from obtaining this TWIC card. It was a \ncommonsense amendment, and I suspect that is why it was included in the \nSenate's bill, without any objection from any Senator here. Let me \nrepeat. It was included in the SAFE Port Act without objection.\n  I also suspect that is why no Senator has come forward to this day to \ntake credit for gutting the amendment when they went behind closed \ndoors in a conference with the House. The amendment that left this body \nwas a codification of disqualifying felonies, developed after an \nexhaustive process by the Department of Homeland Security, in \nconsultation with the Departments of Justice and Transportation.\n  The offenses listed are very similar to those that have worked well \nto protect our airports and hazardous materials shipments for years.\n  Unfortunately, the provision that came back to this body after the \nconference committee was a list of offenses so short and rare that the \nTWIC restrictions offered by the so-called SAFE Port bill are \nessentially meaningless. The conference committee chose not to ban \nmurderers, rapists, arsonists, smugglers, kidnappers, and hostage-\ntakers from accessing the most secure areas of our Nation's ports. In \nshort, they chose to override the expressed will of the Senate and make \nAmerica less secure.\n  I trusted that Senators chosen to sit in conference with the House \nwould act to protect items included by the Senate; especially those \nitems with unanimous or near-unanimous consent in\n\n[[Page S10056]]\n\nthis body that are critical to our homeland security.\n  But that trust was betrayed last fall, anonymously, behind closed \ndoors.\n  It is not only those backroom deals that bring me here to offer this \namendment today, but also the episode witnessed out in the open, on the \nSenate floor, during consideration of the 9/11 Commission bill in \nFebruary of this year.\n  At that time, I again offered an amendment to codify the Department \nof Homeland Security's final rule on TWIC disqualifying offenses. But \nthis time, I requested a rollcall vote, since the conferees clearly \ngave no regard to the unanimous voice of the Senate last fall.\n  This should have been another noncontroversial passage. However, \nknowing they would be forced to actually go on record this time around, \na separate side-by-side amendment preferred by Democrats and, no doubt, \ntheir allies in the labor unions, was introduced. Its language was less \nrestrictive, allowing the current or future DHS Secretary to modify--in \nother words, remove--disqualifying offenses on the list. It passed 58-\n37.\n\n  My amendment was voted on immediately after, and passed 94-2. An \narticle in the Roll Call newspaper from July 9 recounted the episode:\n\n       In February, 13 Democrats and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-\n     Vt.) voted against an amendment offered by Senator Jim DeMint \n     (R-S.C.) to prevent people convicted of terrorism or other \n     felonies from getting access to secure areas of American \n     seaports. But before the vote was over, they all switched to \n     ``yea.''\n\n  What happened was Democrat leadership made it clear to their caucus \nthat their version, allowing removal of felonies from the list, would \nreplace my language in conference. My Democrat colleagues switched to \nsupporting my version because they knew it was irrelevant; that it \nwould be ``taken care of'' behind closed doors, just like last time. \nAgain, the final vote in favor of my amendment was 94-2.\n  And it is not just the Senate that overwhelmingly supports my \nlanguage. The House of Representatives, just last week, voted 354-66 to \ninstruct conferees to include my language in the conference report.\n  The conference report for the 9/11 Commission bill is beginning to \ncirculate, and I understand that the conference committee has now \ndenied the will of the Senate and the House, by including language \nallowing the removal of serious felonies from the list of TWIC interim \ndisqualifying offenses.\n  The language has been watered down to reopen loopholes allowing \nsmugglers, arsonists, kidnappers, rapists, extortionists, and people \nconvicted of bribery, money laundering, and hostage taking to obtain \naccess to secure areas in our ports.\n  We have a chance now on this appropriations bill to ensure that \nwhatever is done to weaken these provisions on the 9/11 Commission \nbill, that it will not have the effect of weakening our port security \nthis year. We must not allow our constituents to be betrayed again by \ndeals made in secret.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment. Again, it prohibits the \nDepartment of Homeland Security from using any funds we are \nappropriating in this Act to remove items from the list of offenses \ndisqualifying individuals from receiving transportation worker \nidentification credentials, also known as TWIC cards. I will ask my \ncolleagues later in the day to support this amendment, and hopefully we \nwill have a vote on it.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the minority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Eight minutes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I would also like to address my amendment No. 2482.\n  This amendment would prevent the Government from shutting down when \nregular appropriations bills are not enacted. It would do so by \nautomatically triggering a continuing resolution that funds agencies at \ncurrent levels for up to 1 year. The amendment would begin automatic \nfunding on the first day of a lapse in appropriations and it would end \non the day the regular appropriations bill becomes law or the last day \nof the fiscal year, whichever comes first.\n  This would eliminate the must-pass nature associated with regular \nappropriations bills which often pressures lawmakers into accepting \nspending bills with objectionable spending.\n  The Democratic leader said at the beginning of the year that he would \nget all of the appropriations bills done before the end of the fiscal \nyear, but there are only 2 months left and we have not completed a \nsingle bill. This means we are going to eventually be faced with having \nto pass a bad bill or alowing parts of the Government to shut down. I \ncertainly don't support that and I know my colleagues do not either. \nThis amendment will prevent that kind of train wreck from ever \nhappening.\n  The President supports this amendment as I believe any President \nwould because it prevents their administration from being shut down. \nHis fiscal year 2008 budget says:\n\n       In the 22 out of the past 25 years in which Congress has \n     not finished appropriation bills by the October 1st deadline, \n     it has funded the Government through ``continuing \n     resolutions'' (CRs), which provide temporary funding \n     authority for Government activities, usually at current \n     levels, until the final appropriations bills are signed into \n     law.\n       If Congress does not pass a CR or the President does not \n     sign it, the Federal Government must shut down. Important \n     Government functions should not be held hostage simply \n     because of an impasse over temporary funding bills. There \n     should be a back-up plan to avoid the threat of a Government \n     shutdown, although the expectation is that appropriations \n     bills still would pass on time as the law requires. Under the \n     Administration's proposal, if an appropriations bill is not \n     signed by October 1 of the new fiscal year, funding would be \n     automatically provided at the lower of the President's Budget \n     or the prior year's level.\n\n  My amendment would create a safety net that would avoid crisis \nsituations that often pressure lawmakers into supporting spending bills \nthey would not otherwise support. This is a commonsense proposal and I \nencourage my colleagues to support it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I notice the presence on the floor of the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio, who is under the order to have a \nspecific amount of time for debate.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the \nHomeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee for giving me this \nopportunity.\n  Yesterday, when I heard the Senate was considering passing an \nadditional $3 billion in emergency spending to secure the border, I \nlooked into the situation very carefully and calculated that, with the \nfunding level the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee \nrecommended, we are already going to be increasing budget authority for \nborder protection and enforcement by roughly 23 percent over fiscal \nyear 2007. The President's budget had recommended $13.5 billion, an 11 \npercent increase in border protection budget authority over fiscal year \n2007. The Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, in their \nwisdom, decided to increase it by another $1.4 billion, which takes it \nto a 23 percent increase over fiscal year 2007. If the Graham amendment \npasses, we will have increased budget authority for this priority by \nalmost 47 percent over what we appropriated last year.\n  I let the majority leader know that I objected to having this \namendment for $3 billion in emergency spending considered by unanimous \nconsent. I thank him for the opportunity to object to it on the basis \nof a unanimous consent, and I am pleased this will be scheduled for a \nrollcall vote, I believe at 11:30.\n  Mr. President, as a senior member of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, and former chairman and now ranking \nmember of its Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the \nFederal Workforce, and the District of Columbia for the last 8 years, I \nrise today to speak against the proposal to allocate an additional $3 \nbillion in emergency spending for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  First, I want to make clear that I agree with my colleagues that we \nmust secure our border and provide the resources to do it. Had it not \nbeen for the fact that the previous administration and former \nCongresses failed to provide the money needed for border security, we \nwould not have the illegal immigration problem now facing our country.\n  That being said, this administration has religion and in the past \nseveral years has taken seriously the need to\n\n[[Page S10057]]\n\nsecure our borders. The President has recommended the funding necessary \nto get the job done.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the Department's overall budget has \ngrown more than 150 percent since the Department's creation merging 22 \ndisparate agencies; while total homeland security spending has more \nthan tripled since 2001. Of that total, border security and immigration \nenforcement represents approximately one-third of the Department's \nannual spending.\n  Since 2001, Congress has more than doubled funding for border \nsecurity, from $4.6 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $10.4 billion in \nfiscal year 2007. Including the $14.9 billion recommended by the \nAppropriations Committee, this figure would jump to a more than 220-\npercent increase in border security spending since 2001.\n  Through the Secure Border Initiative, a comprehensive and multi-year \nstrategic plan funded by Congress, the Department of Homeland Security \nis making substantial progress. I would like to take a moment to share \nwith you the achievements to date.\n  The number of border patrol agents has already been increased by \nnearly 40 percent, from about 9,700 in 2001 to 13,360 today. Congress \nhas appropriated funds to hire a total of 2,500 new agents this year, \nbringing the anticipated fiscal year 2007 year-end total to 14,819 \nagents. The fiscal year 2008 budget we are considering would provide \nfunds for an additional 3,000 border patrol agents, bringing the fiscal \nyear 2008 year-end total to nearly 18,000 border patrol agents. By the \nend of fiscal year 2008, we will have doubled the size of the border \npatrol since 2001.\n  As we continue to ramp up the number of border patrol agents, 6,000 \nNational Guard personnel have been deployed to the Southwest border as \npart of Operation Jumpstart. These personnel continue to assist Customs \nand Border Protection's efforts to secure the border.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has already gained effective \ncontrol of 380 miles on the southwest border, plans to achieve \neffective control of 642 miles by the end of calendar year 2008; and \nhas a strategic plan in place to gain control over the entire southwest \nborder by 2013.\n  The Federal Government has effectively ended the practice of ``catch \nand release'' through a combination of tough enforcement and increased \ndetention capacity.\n  We have more than doubled the number of immigration investigators.\n  The Federal Government has increased detention bed space by 46 \npercent.\n  We would all like to see these efforts move more quickly, but the \nreality is that it takes time to build fences, it takes time to build \nradar towers, and it takes time to hire and train quality border patrol \nagents. The executive branch has made clear that border security is a \nhigh priority and has developed a strategic plan to accomplish these \ngoals as quickly as realistically possible.\n  Today, while the Senate engages in debate, Customs and Border \nprotectorate agents will apprehend roughly 2,617 people crossing \nillegally into the United States. Immigration and Customs enforcement \npersonnel will house approximately 19,729 aliens in ICE detention \nfacilities. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center will train more \nthan 3,500 Federal officers and agents. These daily statistics are \nfurther evidence that progress is being made.\n  I recall the February 2007 hearing before the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee when Secretary Chertoff presented his \nbudget request for fiscal year 2008. The Secretary asked for $13 \nbillion to strengthen border security and immigration enforcement.\n  In justifying the administration's request, I can assure you that \nSecretary Chertoff was quite clear that he took very seriously his \nresponsibility to secure the border. His testimony detailed the \nprogress he had made, while outlining the Department's multiyear \nstrategic plan for continued improvements. In recognition of the \nchallenge, the Secretary acknowledged that we still had a long way to \ngo to objectively say to the American people that the border is secure. \nThe amount recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee in the \nbase bill ensures these goals will be met.\n  The Appropriations Committee reviewed the Department's budget request \nand in its wisdom decided that the President may not have provided \nample resources to the Department of Homeland Security. As a result, \nthe Appropriations Committee recommended $1.4 billion above the \nPresident's request for border security and enforcement, at a total of \n$14.9 billion, which is a 23 percent increase over fiscal year 2007. If \nyou include 3 billion more it will amount to a 47 percent increase.\n  I am confident that in addition to believing more money was needed \nfor the Department, the Appropriations Committee wanted to send a \nsignal to the American people that we have heard their cry to secure \nthe border.\n  The Department of Homeland Security requested $35.5 billion for \nfiscal year 2008, but this bill provides $37.6 billion, more than $2.2 \nbillion above what the Department says it needs. But now, the Senate is \nproposing to increase that amount by yet another $3 billion, so that \nthe total budget authority would surpass $40 billion. Some Senators \nclaim that this is OK because that $3 billion has been designated \n``emergency spending,'' as if using the emergency label is like waving \na magic wand so that it doesn't actually cost us anything. That is not \ntrue. At the end of the day, this amendment will increase the national \ndebt by $3 billion, regardless of what label you put on it.\n  I might add that the President said he would veto this bill because \nit includes an ``irresponsible and excessive level of spending.'' \nIrresponsible and excessive--words we in Congress disregard too often. \nObviously from his perspective, the $35.5 billion in net budget \nauthority for fiscal year 2008 that Secretary Chertoff requested from \nCongress was what he felt was needed to fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and continue the efforts to secure the border. I know the \nPresident wants to assure the American people that he has moved with \nurgency to secure the border before he leaves office. Border security \nwill indeed be part of this President's legacy.\n  In the simplest of terms, the Federal Government continues to spend \nmore than it brings in, and both the amendment and the underlying bill \ncontinue that practice. Over my 8 years in the U.S. Senate, I have \nwatched the national debt skyrocket 60 percent--from $5.6 trillion in \n1999 to $9 trillion today.\n  No one talks about the national debt anymore. But running the credit \ncard for today's needs and leaving the bill for future generations \nshould not be the policy of the U.S. Congress. It represents a \nrecklessness that threatens our economic security, our competitiveness \nin the global marketplace, and our future quality of life. If we decide \nwe absolutely need to spend $3 billion on something--and I support \nadequately funding border security--then we need to either raise more \nrevenue or cut other spending to pay for it. Simply adding it to the \nnational debt makes our country less secure in the long run.\n  How does continuing to borrow and spend make us less secure? Today, \n55 percent of the privately owned national debt is held by foreign \ncreditors--mostly foreign central banks. That is up from 35 percent \njust 5 years ago. Foreign creditors provided more than 80 percent of \nthe funds the United States has borrowed since 2001, according to the \nWall Street Journal. And who are these foreign creditors?\n  According to the Treasury Department, the largest foreign holders of \nU.S. debt are Japan, China, and the oil-exporting countries known as \nOPEC. Borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars from China and OPEC \nputs not only our future economy, but also our national security, at \nrisk. It is critical that we ensure that countries that hold our debt \ndo not control our future.\n  Why are we taking the fiscally irresponsible act that will add to our \nunbalanced budget and national debt? I am glad that the administration \nand Congress have placed the needed focus on this important priority, \nbut I want to ensure that we do not go too far in simply throwing money \nat this problem; money that cannot be effectively spent in fiscal year \n2008--which begins in October.\n  This money is not needed in light of the money the Appropriations \nCommittee has recommended, including the\n\n[[Page S10058]]\n\n$2.2 billion in additional spending over which the President has \nthreatened a veto. The Department is already spending one-third of its \nbudget on border security and immigration enforcement--a clear \nreflection of its priorities.\n  Next year, the Senate will review the President's budget request and \nthe Appropriations Committee will recommend funding levels. If next \nyear, we determine that more needs to be spent to continue to improve \nborder security and enforcement, fine. But let's not simply toss an \nadditional $3 billion out the window for fiscal year 2008.\n  I have the deepest respect for my colleagues, but I respectfully \ndisagree on appropriating an additional $3 billion in emergency \nspending. They know and I know that the sole reason for appropriating \nthese funds would be to convince the American people that Congress \ncares about securing the border--even though we know this additional \nspending exceeds what can possibly be spent in the 2008 fiscal year.\n  The question I ask is: How dumb do they think the American people \nare? Don't they realize that the American people will see through this \ncharade and realize we are pulling a fast one on them?\n  How cynical can we be? The American people want us to work harder and \nsmarter and do more with less and will be very angry that we are simply \nthrowing money at a problem in a manner designed to make them feel good \nin the short term. This is the type of game playing that has caused our \napproval ratings to slump to all-time lows.\n  When something comes along that we decide we must spend more money \non--and border security could very well be one of those things--then we \nneed to be prepared to pay for that additional spending by either \nbringing in more revenues or cutting other spending. I ask my \ncolleagues not to support this fiscally irresponsible act that will \nsurely diminish our credibility with the American people.\n  I thank the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nHomeland Security for this opportunity. I hope some of my colleagues \nhave an opportunity to understand why I think what we are doing here \ntoday is absolutely fiscally irresponsible. I am extremely pleased that \nthis administration and this Congress is taking border security \nseriously. This attention is long overdue. I know all of us are trying \nto convey to the public that we are finally acting to secure the \nborder. There is no one more ardent about that than I am. But let me \nremind my colleagues that the Department of Homeland Security has \npresented this Congress with a multiyear strategic plan for improving \nborder security and enforcement, called the Secure Border Initiative. \nThe Appropriations Subcommittee recommendations have fully funded the \nDepartment's request for what they believe they can accomplish in \nfiscal year 2008.\n  I have been on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee since I came to the Senate. I was part of creating the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. I have spent many hours with Secretary \nChertoff and other Department officials. I really believe the money \nthat has been recommended by the Homeland Security Appropriations \nSubcommittee is adequate to get the job done during fiscal year 2008, \nin line with the Department's multiyear strategic plan. And we will \nreevaluate this situation for fiscal year 2009, and fiscal year 2010, \nand so on. But I do not think we should go through the charade of \nmaking the American people believe we are really sincere about securing \nthe border by spending another $3 billion of emergency spending when \nthe substantial funding that has already been recommended for fiscal \nyear 2008 will get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I believe under the agreement the \nremaining time will be controlled by myself and the Senator from \nArkansas; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2638, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2638 ) making appropriations for the \n     Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2008, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Byrd/Cochran amendment No. 2383, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Landrieu amendment No. 2468 (to amendment No. 2383), to \n     state the policy of the U.S. Government on the foremost \n     objective of the United States in the global war on terror \n     and in protecting the U.S. homeland and to appropriate \n     additional sums for that purpose.\n       Grassley/Inhofe amendment No. 2444 (to amendment No. 2383), \n     to provide that none of the funds made available under this \n     act may be expended until the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     certifies to Congress that all new hires by the Department of \n     Homeland Security are verified through the basic pilot \n     program authorized under section 401 of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n     or may be available to enter into a contract with a person, \n     employer, or other entity that does not participate in such \n     basic pilot program.\n       Cochran (for Alexander/Collins) amendment No. 2405 (to \n     amendment No. 2383), to make $300 million available for \n     grants to States to carry out the REAL ID Act of 2005.\n       Schumer amendment No. 2416 (to amendment No. 2383), to \n     evaluate identification card technologies to determine the \n     most appropriate technology for ensuring the optimal \n     security, efficiency, privacy, and cost of passport cards.\n       Schumer amendment No. 2461 (to amendment No. 2383), to \n     increase the amount provided for aviation security direction \n     and enforcement.\n       Schumer amendment No. 2447 (to amendment No. 2383), to \n     reserve $40 million of the amounts appropriated for the \n     Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to support the \n     implementation of the Securing the Cities Initiative at the \n     level requested in the President's budget.\n       Schumer/Hutchison amendment No. 2448 (to amendment No. \n     2383), to increase the domestic supply of nurses and physical \n     therapists.\n       Dole amendment No. 2462 (to amendment No. 2383), to require \n     that not less than $5,400,000 of the amount appropriated to \n     U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement be used to \n     facilitate agreements described in section 287(g) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       Dole amendment No. 2449 (to amendment No. 2383), to set \n     aside $75 million of the funds appropriated for training, \n     exercise, technical assistance, and other programs under the \n     heading State and local programs for training consistent with \n     section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       Cochran (for Grassley) amendment No. 2476 (to amendment No. \n     2383), to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     establish reasonable regulations relating to stored \n     quantities of propane.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11:35 \na.m. shall be for debate on the Graham-Pryor amendment, with 30 minutes \nunder the control of the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, and the \nremainder of the time equally divided and controlled by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Mr. Graham, and the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. \nPryor.\n\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2480 to Amendment No. 2483\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, consistent with the unanimous consent \nagreement, we will be talking about an amendment that was discussed \nlast night. Senator Cornyn had some language changes to the amendment \nthat have now been adopted. I believe it makes it a much stronger, \nbetter amendment.\n  What we are trying to do here is add $3 billion to go toward securing \nthe border, and I believe that is a homeland security event. So it is \ncertainly an amount of money that is large in nature but goes to \nsomething that is large in nature in terms of our national security \nneeds.\n  In terms of Senator Voinovich and his concerns about spending--I \nadmire him greatly. He has been a constant, serious, thoughtful voice \nabout controlling spending. This is an emergency designation, which \nmeans it is an off-budget item. I think Senator Voinovich has every \nright in the world to be concerned about how the Congress is spending \nmoney in a way for the next\n\n[[Page S10059]]\n\ngeneration to pick up the bill, but I would argue there is a time for \nemergencies in business life and personal life and legislative life, \nand this is one of those times.\n  This is an emergency kind of manufactured by Washington. It is \nsomething that should have been done 20 years ago. Now we have taken up \nimmigration in a serious way. We had an extensive debate not long ago, \nand we were not able to get comprehensive immigration reform, but I \nthink most Americans believe losing operational control of the U.S.-\nMexican border is a national security issue of a serious nature, and \nthey applaud our efforts to put money into securing the border between \nthe United States and Mexico. That is exactly what this amendment does.\n  If there were ever a legitimate emergency in this country, I think \nthis would be one of those times because we have lost control of our \nborder. In the age of terrorism, what does it mean for a nation like \nthe United States, which is being pursued by a vicious enemy that knows \nno boundaries, to lose control of its border?\n  It means that you are opening yourself up to attack. Now, most of the \npeople who come across the border come here to work. This amendment \ndoes not deal with that. Hopefully, it will slow down how you get into \nthe country. Hopefully, it will control who comes into the country--\npeople coming to work illegally or people coming across the border to \ndo us harm, it would make it more difficult.\n  But the idea of employment and the magnet of employment is not \naddressed by this amendment. We need a temporary worker program. We \nneed employer verification systems so people cannot come here and \nfraudulently get jobs. That is not dealt with in this amendment. But \nthis amendment is a great first step to controlling people coming \nacross our border and overstaying their visas. I think it is a step \nthat will get a large bipartisan vote.\n  What does it do? The $3 billion in emergency spending will allow us \nto hire 23,000 Border Patrol agents to go report for duty; more boots \non the ground, more people patrolling our border making it harder for \nsomebody to come across illegally. We should have done this a long time \nago.\n  This amendment allows the hiring of a substantially larger number of \nBorder Patrol agents, four unmanned aerial vehicles that will allow us \nto patrol isolated areas of the border by having new technology in \nplace--the unmanned aerial vehicle has been a very effective tool in \ncontrolling illegal border crossings--one hundred and five ground-based \nradar and camera towers. We need walls along the border in urban areas \nwhere you can walk across the street, but technology in the desert and \nother areas of the border has proven to be a good investment. This \namendment seriously increases the amount of technology to detect \nillegal border crossings; 300 miles of vehicle barriers, where people \ncan drive up and down the border with vehicle lanes, where the Border \nPatrol can patrol that area in question and make it a more effective \npolicing regime; 700 miles of border fence. We have approved the \nfencing. This would actually completely fund 700 miles of fencing. The \nborder is, I believe, over 2,000 miles. Why 700 miles? Seven hundred \nmiles would allow us to control crossings where you can literally walk \nacross the street. The technology we are putting into place through \nthis amendment will control other areas. The additional boots on the \nground will help in all phases.\n  On the catch-and-release program, where you catch someone, turn them \nloose, and they come right back, well, we are trying to deal with that \nproblem by increasing detention beds to 45,000, so when we catch \nsomeone, we can detain them and deport them--without them never showing \nup to their hearing.\n  The Cornyn addition will allow this $3 billion to be used in interior \nenforcement in a way to go after people who have absconded, who have \nbeen deported, who have been issued orders but have left and they are \non the run. We can track them down and bring them to justice.\n  Overall, this amendment is money well spent. I am sorry it has to be \nspent in an emergency fashion, but it is an emergency. The reason this \nis an emergency, we have let it get out of hand. The goal of this \namendment is operational control of the U.S.-Mexican border.\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2480 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for himself, \n     Mr. Enzi, Mr. Gregg, Mr. McCain, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n     Sununu, and Mr. Cornyn, proposes an amendment numbered 2480 \n     to amendment No. 2383.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                      DIVISION B--BORDER SECURITY\n\n                 TITLE X--BORDER SECURITY REQUIREMENTS\n\n     SEC. 1001.

Con. Res. 21 (110th Congress).\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nHutchison as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield to Senator Cornyn to speak on this topic for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to express my gratitude to Senator\n\n[[Page S10060]]\n\nGraham for his strong leadership on this issue. I know Senator Pryor, \non the other side of the aisle, is the principal Democratic cosponsor.\n  I concur with what Senator Graham said. The necessity for this \nparticular amendment is occasioned by the neglect of the Federal \nGovernment over the last 20 years at meeting its commitment to do \nwhatever is necessary to keep the American people safe.\n  This has become, of course, a national focus in a post-9/11 world, \nwhen we have to know who is coming across our borders and what their \nintentions are. We cannot any longer assume people are coming across \nfor benign reasons or are simply economic migrants because we know the \nsame broken borders that allow a person to come across who wants to \nwork in the United States can be exploited by human smugglers or drug \ntraffickers and potentially even those who want to come here and commit \nacts of terrorism in the United States.\n  Yesterday, I made a part of the Congressional Record, by unanimous \nconsent, the first of a four-part article written in the San Antonio \nExpress News, documenting the movement of what are called special \ninterest aliens; that is, individuals who are coming to America, from \ncountries where terrorism is flourishing, through our broken southern \nborder.\n  The particular story that is documented talks about a young Iraqi who \ntraveled from Damascus, Syria, to Moscow, to Havana and then to \nGuatemala and then up through the southern border, our southern border \nwith Mexico, into the United States. Thank goodness this individual did \nnot appear to be committed to a life of terrorism, but it demonstrates \nthe kind of vulnerability we have in this country, and it is important \nwe do everything possible to protect it.\n  I am pleased with the majority leader's agreement to now allow us to \ninclude the use of these funds for interior enforcement because we know \n45 percent of the illegal immigration in this country occurs not from \npeople who violate the border but people who enter legally, then \noverstay and then go underground. So I am grateful to the majority \nleader and am pleased to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to speak \nabout amendment No. 2480, the Graham-Pryor amendment. Let me first say \nthe legislation Senator Graham and Senator Pryor have brought to the \nfloor this morning, in terms of an amendment, is essentially the same \nlanguage and has the same legislative provisions we had in the \ncomprehensive immigration reform package. They are good aspects of that \nlegislation that allow us to move forward with securing and fixing our \nborders.\n  As we went through the immigration reform debate, we said we had to \ndo three things: First, we needed to enforce and fix our borders; \nsecondly, we needed to enforce our laws within our country; and, \nthirdly, we needed to figure out a realistic solution to the reality \nthat we have 12 million undocumented workers who are here in this \ncountry today.\n  This amendment takes a part of those principal components and \naddresses it in a very effective way. Indeed, when you look through the \nlanguage, what it does is it says we will hire 23,000 additional Border \nPatrol agents; we will have 4 unmanned aerial vehicles and 105 ground-\nbased radar and camera towers; we will have 300 miles of vehicle \nbarriers and 700 miles of fence; we will have a permanent end to the \ncatch-and-release policy and additional funding to enhance employment \nverification; we will have increased removal and detention of visa \noverstays and reimbursement to State and local governments for \nimmigration expenses.\n  So that all is good. It addresses one of the fundamental components \nof immigration reform. So I am supportive of what we are trying to do \nhere. I do wish to let my good friend and colleague, Senator Graham, \nand my good friend, Senator Pryor, know that the concern I have with \nthe amendment, notwithstanding the fact that I will support it, is that \nit is all focused on the southern border.\n  While it may be, and it is true our borders are broken, it is not \njust the border between Mexico and the United States that is broken. We \nhave the same kinds of problems in our ports, we have the same kinds of \nproblems along our northern border. This is, frankly, unfair in terms \nof focusing only on the Mexican border. We have to fix all our borders, \nnot just the Mexican border.\n  So while I will be supporting this amendment, I also intend to offer \nanother amendment that will address the other broken borders we have in \nour country because I think that is a way to be fair about it. It is \nthe only way in which we will ultimately achieve the objective we have, \nwhich is dealing with the national security of the United States of \nAmerica. You cannot have national security when you have broken \nborders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I am very pleased that Senator Graham and \nothers have come together to increase and enhance our border security \nin this country. We all know in this Chamber we have tried very hard to \nreform our immigration system that we have on the books.\n  In fact, I have been very vocal saying I am for immigration reform. I \nthink we need to do that. But so far we have not been able to get that \ndone in the Senate. I believe, honestly, we need more involvement with \nthe White House in trying to get that done.\n  But regardless of that, today one of the things that came through to \nme loudly and clearly from the people in Arkansas is we need to secure \nour border. People do not want to wait 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, \nwhatever it may be, to have border security; they want us to start \nworking on that now.\n  That is what we are trying to accomplish with this amendment today. \nAgain, I am very pleased that Senator Graham, a true South Carolina \nconservative Member of this body, someone whom we all respect, someone \nwho, even though he has impeccable conservative and Republican \ncredentials, is willing to reach across the aisle to work with others \nto try to get good things done for his State and for our country. He \nand Senator Cornyn of Texas and many others have worked on this issue. \nI am very pleased to be part of a bipartisan solution on border \nsecurity.\n  One of the things I like about this legislation is it adds $3 billion \nfor border security. That means we will get 23,000 additional full-time \nborder agents, we will get new border-monitoring technology, we will \nget 300 miles of vehicle barriers, we will get 700 miles of fence. That \nis funded by this amendment. We will get 105 radar and camera towers, \nand we will get resources to detain an additional 45,000 illegal \nimmigrations who are in this country right now.\n  It also includes money to help with some internal matters in this \ncountry, to help do some processing and look at employee issues and \nemployer issues, et cetera.\n  This is a good amendment. I think one of the things I heard loudly \nand clearly from the immigration debates we had on the Senate floor was \npeople in Arkansas want us to secure the border first, let's enforce \nthe laws we have on the books. They have been on the books for a long \ntime, and we have not done a very good job of enforcing those laws.\n  When I say ``we,'' I mean the administration. The will to try to \nenforce the laws we have on the books has not been there. I am not \ntrying to point fingers. It is not only this administration; we can go \nback for a couple of decades.\n  Regardless of that, I am not trying to point fingers. Right now I \nwant to look forward. I want to add to this amendment an additional $3 \nbillion for border enforcement to enhance this Nation's security.\n  I encourage my colleagues to look at this, give it very strong \nconsideration, and support this amendment. It is bipartisan. We have a \nnumber of Senators who were on it originally, a number more have been \nadded as we go today. So I would, in closing, recommend to my \ncolleagues that they give this very strong consideration. It will allow \nus to enforce the laws we have on the books, it allows us to enhance \nour border security in very real and very meaningful ways. I think it \nis what the American public wants.\n\n[[Page S10061]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that \nthe time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the border security \namendment No. 2480. As the immigration bill came to a close, there was \none thing that was very clear--there was unanimity and support for the \nissue of border security. The issue of protecting our border is one we \nall understand. The American people understand. It needs to be done. \nThat was one of the many things that was in that bill that was undone \nthat needed doing.\n  I believe today we do a great thing by moving this issue forward. We \nhave a great threat of terrorism, the continued flow of illegal \nimmigrants. We need to do all we can to secure our border.\n  This amendment will provide an increase in resources to improve our \nsecurity by building our physical presence and surveillance on the \nborder itself. It requires within 2 years of enactment that we secure \noperational control over the southern border between the United States \nand Mexico, and it allows the Border Patrol and U.S. Customs to hire \nand train and report for duty 23,000 full-time agents. I believe this \nis a step in the right direction. The United States, in addition to \nthat, will deploy four unmanned aerial vehicles. These are essential \nfor electronic surveillance in order to fully protect our southern \nborder. In addition, the U.S. shall engage in the catch and return of \nillegal aliens. We know that a great many of those who are here \nillegally have simply overstayed their visas. This also permits \ninterior enforcement in order to be able to be successful in \nimplementing strong border and interior enforcement. Ninety days from \nenactment of this bill and every 90 days thereafter, the administration \nshall report to Congress on the progress. If the progress isn't on \ntrack, the report will include specific recommendations for fixing the \nproblem. That is essential because for too long we have known we had a \nproblem. We have thrown money at the problem, and the solutions have \nnot always been what we wanted. Regardless of our position on the issue \nof immigration, all of us can coalesce around the idea that border \nsecurity is essential to the rights of a sovereign nation. The \ndeployment of additional border agents, the end of catch and release, \nthe provision of additional space in beds, interior enforcement to \nensure we can begin to move forward to ensure those who have overstayed \ntheir visas, we understand how that happens and we keep track of that, \nand not allow them to occur. It is all part of what we need to do in \norder to ensure we have a safe and secure country.\n  Giving the American people the security and understanding that the \nGovernment is serious about border enforcement and about interior \nsecurity, we then will be able to move forward with phases of the \nimmigration reform act that did not come to pass. There was a lack of \ncredibility that our Government has with the people with respect to our \nseriousness of purpose in border enforcement. This amendment is a step \nforward. We are putting the dollars that it needs, in addition to the \nspecific direction it ought to have, as well to ensure that we will \nhave the kind of border security all Americans expect and want so that \nwe can then move forward with the other phases of immigration reform \nthat are so desperately needed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The President pro tempore is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senate yesterday attempted to add $3 billion in \nemergency spending to secure our borders. I supported that effort. \nUnfortunately, rather than voting on the substance of the amendment, it \nwas necessary for the Senate to vote on a procedural matter. In order \nto provide for the orderly processing of appropriations bills in the \nSenate, it was essential to vote to sustain the ruling of the Chair \nunder rule XVI. However, I still believe it is important that we not \nmiss this opportunity to provide robust funding to secure our borders \nand to enforce our immigration law. Therefore, I support the amendment \nproviding $3 billion--that is $3 for every minute since Jesus Christ \nwas born--get that, hear me, $3 for every minute since Jesus Christ was \nborn--in emergency spending to hire, train, and equip Border Patrol \nagents and immigration enforcement officials, procure additional \ndetention beds, expand our immigration enforcement efforts on the \ninterior, construct border fencing infrastructure, and technology, and \nother steps to secure our borders.\n  This $3 billion will not be encumbered by controversial legislative \nand policy issues. Instead, it will be used in support of already \nauthorized activities such as hiring Border Patrol agents, building \nfencing and other border technology, and enforcing the immigration laws \nalready on the books.\n  Specifically, this amendment will hire, train, and equip at least \n5,000 new Border Patrol agents, in addition to the 3,000 new agents \nfunded in the underlying bill. It will procure more than 4,000 \nadditional detention beds, in addition to the 4,000 new beds funded in \nthe underlying bill. It will hire more than 1,000 new immigration \ninvestigators and detention and removal personnel to perform interior \nenforcement activities such as expanding the work site enforcement \ninvestigation. It will increase the number of Criminal Alien Program \nand Fugitive Operations teams to locate and remove the over 630,000 \nfugitive alien absconders whom a judge has already ordered to be \nremoved. It provides an additional $1 billion for border fencing, \ninfrastructure, and technology.\n  Finally, it provides funds to procure additional helicopters, fixed-\nwing aircraft, marine vessels, and other border surveillance equipment, \nas well as funds to construct additional border stations in which our \nBorder Patrol agents work. This amendment is balanced, and it is \nfocused on meeting the immediate border security needs while enforcing \nour current immigration law.\n  I urge my colleagues on my left and my colleagues on my right to \nsupport the amendment.\n  I thank all Senators, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I understand Senator Sessions wishes to \nspeak. He is on the way. As soon as he gets here, we will gladly yield \nback any time that is remaining. I wish to make a couple comments about \nthe amendment.\n  No. 1, in terms of spending, it is one of those situations where the \ncountry finds itself in an emergency that maybe shouldn't have been an \nemergency to begin with because we have neglected our border security \nobligations.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Specter, Coleman, and Lincoln \nas cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We are where we are as a nation. We have a porous border. \nEvery time a supplemental bill comes through on Iraq, it gets the votes \nfrom this body that it needs to become law, because all of us \nunderstand, whether we disagree with the policies in Iraq, that once \nthe soldiers and warfighters are there, our troops are there, there are \ncertain things that have to flow from their presence, and we designate \na lot of money for the Iraqi operation as emergency spending; I believe \nrightfully so.\n  Well, I would argue to anybody, Republican or Democrat, that one of \nthe big chinks in our national security armor is a porous border \nbetween the United States and Mexico, and this $3 billion will really \nhelp in a serious way. It is serious money to deal with a serious \nproblem that is truly an emergency. It will add more boots on the\n\n[[Page S10062]]\n\nground. It will add agents for there to be a total of 23,000 border \nsecurity agents on the border, which is a tremendous increase over what \nwe have now. I think it is like 13,000 or 14,000.\n  But the technology in this bill will be a force multiplier. The \ntechnology we spend money to secure will allow the force in place to be \nmultiplied by a factor of many because the technology literally \nleverages the boots on the ground in a tremendous way.\n  The 45,000 additional bedspaces will stop a program that is really \nthe wrong message to send--catch and release: We catch you. We release \nyou back. You come again. Now we have bedspace to detain people to make \nsure they do not flee, and they are deported for coming across the \nborders illegally.\n  It is an effort to basically deal with a problem that has been a long \ntime in the making. There is money that will have a beneficial \nconsequence to securing our borders. The term ``operational control'' \nis a military term. I look at this effort to secure our borders in many \nways as a military operation.\n  I hope this amendment gets a strong bipartisan vote. I understand \nSenator Voinovich's concern about the emergency designation in spending \nmoney offline, but this is one of those times I think it is justified.\n  To the administration, I understand your concerns about spending, but \nyou have sent hundreds of millions of dollars in requests over--\nbillions of dollars--to the Congress to make sure we have the money \nnecessary to secure Iraq for our troops' point of view. Now it is time \nto spend $3 billion to secure our borders here at home.\n  I hope the body will understand this is a step forward. It does not \nsolve the problem. We still have a magnet of employment that has to be \ndealt with. We need a temporary worker program. We need a lot of things \nthis amendment does not cover. But this is a great start in providing \noperational security to a porous border that in the age of terrorism is \nreally not only an emergency but a national disgrace.\n  I hope the taxpayers at large will see this as a serious effort to do \nsomething about a problem which has huge consequences over time if left \nunaddressed. So I appreciate Senator Reid working with us and Senator \nCornyn making it better and my good friend from Arkansas, Senator \nPryor, for helping us move the ball down the road.\n  If this bill ever gets to conference, which I hope it will, I hope \nthis provision is left standing as is because if there is a retreat \nfrom this, from the money, and from the designations in this amendment, \nI think it would be considered a retreat in terms of regaining \noperational control of our borders.\n  So with that, I believe Senator Pryor wishes to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Byrd \nas a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added \nas a cosponsor to the Graham-Pryor amendment, which is currently the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The senior Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time in the quorum call be evenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Graham \namendment to the Homeland Security appropriations bill. This is an \nissue which has been with us for years now, an issue of border security \nwhich we simply, as a group of policymakers, have not addressed in the \nright way. That became pretty obvious during our debate on the \nimmigration bill several weeks ago. All of us heard from our \nconstituents back home that while overall immigration reform may be \nneeded in due course, what we need to do immediately is to take action \nto make sure our borders are, in fact, actually secure. That is the \nfirst step in real immigration reform.\n  Senator Isakson and I sent a letter to the administration imploring \nthem to take action on this issue. We have asked the administration to \nsend an emergency supplemental to the Senate and the House requesting \nthat certain measures to secure our borders be enacted and adequately \nfunded.\n  What Senator Graham has done with this amendment is a step in the \nright direction toward ensuring that our borders--particularly our \nborder to the south--are made secure.\n  I am a little bit disappointed we cannot go any further because what \nSenator Isakson and I have asked the administration to do in its \nsupplemental request to this body would be to include the creation of a \nbiometric identification card so all of those folks who cross the \nborder in a legal way would have that identification card and any \nemployer who sought to hire any of those individuals would know that \nthey are here legally. If you hired them otherwise, it would be at your \nown peril.\n  There are some technical reasons why Senator Graham could not add \nthat provision in here. It is going to require more money, No. 1, plus \nsome other issues regarding the rules of this body. So I am hopeful \nthat there are some additional measures we will take up after we, \nhopefully, adopt this amendment overwhelmingly, get this bill into \nconference, out of conference, and on the desk of the President.\n  So I applaud my colleague from South Carolina, as well as Senator \nPryor, who I know has worked very hard on this particular measure. This \namendment does many of the things Senator Isakson and I have asked for, \nand we are very hopeful this will get to the desk of the President \nimmediately. This will answer one of those questions a lot of us heard \nduring the immigration debate from our constituents; that is, why don't \nyou enforce the laws that are on the books today? Well, here is the \nanswer: We do not have the money to do it. This will give us the money \nto do some of those things.\n  So I urge all of my colleagues to look very favorably on this \namendment. Let's take the first right step to secure the borders. Then \nwe can come back and deal with the overall remaining immigration issues \nthat are outstanding.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nLincoln, Baucus, and Webb be added as cosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think the Senator from New Hampshire and \nthe Senator from Alabama would like to speak. We have until 11:35.\n  I ask the Senator from New Hampshire, would you like 5 minutes?\n  Mr. GREGG. Thank you.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. To be followed by the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama and the Senator from \nNew Hampshire have a total of 7 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be evenly \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from South \nCarolina for reaching this understanding on how to proceed relative to \nmaking sure our borders are secure.\n  The language in this amendment, which adds a significant amount of \nmoney to support the expansion of the boots on the ground and the \ntechnology on the border, is critical to the\n\n[[Page S10063]]\n\nfirst step--which has been related here by a number of individuals--of \nsecuring the border as part of our effort to get comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  I think we all understand the American people are asking the \nquestion, Why isn't the border secure? This has been an effort that has \nbeen ongoing for a number of years now, to make the border secure. But \nthis amendment we are taking up now would be the final downpayment on \nwhat is necessary to accomplish that goal.\n  We know what we need in order to secure the border. It is more border \nagents, it is more physical fencing but a lot more virtual fencing, it \nis more detention beds, and it is more ICE agents. It is also necessary \nto have in place the law these individuals need in order to enforce the \nborder and pursue people who come into this country illegally and who \nmay be inappropriately here and who are committing crimes here. \nUnfortunately, that language was not included in this amendment. That \nlanguage was stripped out yesterday. But still, getting the resources \nin place in order to support the border is the first critical step, and \nthis bill does that.\n  I have been working on this issue for a long time, both as past \nchairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee and as \npast chairman of the Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations \nSubcommittee in the Appropriations Committee, as have Senator Cochran \nand Senator Byrd. There has been a strong commitment on the part of the \nAppropriations Committee to accomplish these goals. But there has \nalways been additional resources needed in order to fully fund border \nsecurity. Now, with this amendment, we will actually put in place those \nadditional resources.\n  I congratulate the Senator from South Carolina for bringing this \nprocess to closure. I congratulate the majority leader for reaching a \nconsensus here that could be bipartisan. As Senator McConnell said last \nnight, this is a positive, bipartisan effort to try to step forward on \none of the most critical issues we have as a nation, which is making \nsure the people who come into this country come into the country \nlegally.\n  So it is the end of a long road, quite honestly, relative to the \nresponsibility of Congress. We will now have put in place the necessary \nresources to secure the border. The question now becomes whether those \nresources will be effectively used. Certainly, we will have to use all \nour oversight capability to ensure that occurs, but at least we have \naddressed our responsibility of making sure the funds are there to \nsupport the necessary additional boots on the ground, the additional \nexpansion of security along the border in the form of virtual fencing \nand in the form of physical fencing, and the additional detention beds \nnecessary to make sure that when someone is apprehended for coming into \nthe country illegally, they are not simply set off on their own \nrecognizance to appear in court someday but are actually restrained in \na place so they can be returned back to the nation they came from in an \norderly manner, which is critical.\n  So this is a good bill and good language. I am glad we are making \nthis progress on it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the requirements of fencing, additional \nBorder Patrol agents, bedspaces for those who have been detained who \ncome here illegally are not there as an end in themselves. Our goal--\nour real goal--must be to create a change in the mindset of what is \nhappening at the border, to reach that tipping point in which the world \nknows our borders are not wide open, that it is exceedingly difficult \nto penetrate them illegally and they are unlikely to be successful. As \na result, we can move from the current situation--in which over a \nmillion people last year were arrested coming into our country \nillegally--and see those numbers drop off, to reach that tipping point, \nwhere the world knows that border is not open.\n  We have talked about it for all the 10 years since I have been in the \nSenate. Presidents have talked about it. They have campaigned on it. \nMembers have talked about it. But we have not done anything about it. \nThat is why the American people are not happy with us.\n  So I think this legislation will do some things of significance. It \nwill fund 700 miles at the border and complete that process. Why it has \ntaken as long as it has I am not sure, but work is being done right \nnow, although not a lot has been accomplished so far. I am told that \npretty soon we will see the fencing come up that we have authorized and \nthat the work is continuing on. So it will be 700 miles. That is really \nprogress, I have to say, but it is not the final installment. We are \ngoing to have to do more in the years to come. It is actual fencing, \nplus virtual fencing also.\n\n  So I am pleased we have made a concrete step forward with this \nfunding. It will allow us, if the executive branch uses it wisely, to \ntransform in a significant way the open border system we now have to a \nlawful system. That would be good for America in terms of creating a \nlawful system of immigration, and it will be good for the people who \nsend us their money and expect us to do what we promise to do and that \nwe actually get serious about it and start taking steps in that \ndirection.\n  With regard to fencing, other countries use fencing significantly. \nSpain is constructing quite a lot of fencing on their African border. \nOther countries are doing so in the EU. Hong Kong has a border \nsituation that they have dealt with through fencing. It is not anything \nunusual. It is the normal course when you have a wide open border \nbecause what happens is, a fence will multiply many times the \neffectiveness of a Border Patrol officer.\n  I ask my colleagues how you would be able to control hundreds of \nmiles of border if you are just standing out there by yourself. If the \nperson trying to come in knows they have to cross a fence, they will \nhave a much harder time and be much easier to apprehend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to pick up on some of the \ncomments my colleagues on the Republican side have made on this \namendment. One of the things Senator Sessions just mentioned is that \nthis is a concrete proposal. I know he didn't intend the play on words, \nbut this is concrete. We are talking about adding real border \nenforcement. It is real. It is bricks and mortar. It is physical \nbarriers. It will definitely slow the influx of people coming into this \ncountry who are not playing by the rules.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans. \nWe have been adding cosponsors this morning to this legislation. I want \nto thank all of my colleagues who participated. I need to give a \nspecial thanks to Senator Harry Reid who helped pull this amendment \ntogether. To put $3 billion on border enforcement on the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations makes perfect sense. It makes perfect sense in \nterms of good government, and it makes perfect sense to the people all \nacross this Nation.\n  One of the messages I heard loudly and clearly during the immigration \ndebate which we finished a few weeks ago is, people want more border \nenforcement. They want the U.S. Government to secure our border. There \nis no doubt about that; this is something the Federal Government has \nfailed to do or has been pretty lax in trying to do over the last \nseveral years. Again, this didn't start with the Bush administration. I \nthink it has probably gotten worse during this time, but it goes back \nseveral administrations. I am not here to point fingers today.\n  By voting for this amendment today, Senators would add 23,000 \nadditional full-time border agents. We would add new border monitoring \ntechnology. We would add 300 miles of vehicle barriers, 700 miles of \nfence, 105 radar and camera towers. We would add resources to detain \n45,000 illegal immigrants.\n  So this is, as Senator Sessions said, a concrete step in the right \ndirection. This is good public policy. I know we have broad bipartisan \nsupport for this legislation. I want to thank my colleagues for giving \nthis strong consideration, and I ask that they look at this legislation \nbefore we vote in just a few minutes.\n  Before I sit down, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Landrieu and\n\n[[Page S10064]]\n\nSenator McCaskill be added as cosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as \ncosponsors Senators Alexander, Dole, Domenici, and Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would the Senator add me as a cosponsor?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely. The Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, and \nSenator Coburn from Oklahoma also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to thank my good friend from \nArkansas. It has been a pleasure working with him and all of my \ncolleagues. Senator Gregg has been working on this issue for many \nyears. Senator Cornyn's addition to the amendment last night has made \nit far better. If no one else would like to speak----\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nFeinstein as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Graham amendment No. 2480.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            Subpoenas Issued\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate Judiciary Committee is \nissuing subpoenas to political operatives at the White House for \ndocuments and testimony related to the committee's ongoing \ninvestigation into the mass firings of U.S. attorneys and the \npoliticization of hiring and firing within the Department of Justice. \nThis is not a step I take lightly. For over 4 months I have exhausted \nevery avenue seeking the voluntary cooperation of Karl Rove and J. \nScott Jennings but to no avail. They and the White House have \nstonewalled every request. Indeed, the White House is choosing to \nwithhold documents and is instructing witnesses who are former \nofficials--not current officials but former officials--to refuse to \nanswer questions and provide relevant information and documents.\n  We have now reached a point where accumulated evidence shows that \npolitical considerations factored into the unprecedented firing of at \nleast nine U.S. attorneys last year. Testimony and documents show that \nthe list was compiled based on input from the highest political ranks \nin the White House, including Mr. Rove and Mr. Jennings. And today I \nwill subpoena Mr. Rove and Mr. Jennings. The evidence shows that senior \nofficials were apparently focused on the political impact of Federal \nprosecutions and whether Federal prosecutors were doing enough to bring \npartisan voter fraud and corruption cases. It is obvious that the \nreasons given for these firings were contrived as part of a coverup and \nthat the stonewalling by the White House is part and parcel of that \nsame effort. Just this week, during his sworn testimony, Mr. Gonzales \ncontrasted these firings with the replacement of other U.S. attorneys \nfor ``legitimate cause.''\n  The White House has asserted blanket claims of executive privilege, \ndespite testimony under oath and on the record that the President was \nnot involved. The White House refuses to provide a factual basis for \nits blanket claims. The White House has instructed former White House \nofficials not to testify about what they know and instructed Harriet \nMiers to refuse even to appear as required by a House Judiciary \nCommittee subpoena. The White House has withheld relevant documents and \ninstructed other witnesses not to produce relevant documents to the \nCongress but only to the White House.\n  Last week, the White House did much to substantiate the evidence that \nit is intent on reducing U.S. attorneys and Federal law enforcement to \nmerely another partisan political aspect of its efforts when it \ndispatched an anonymous senior official to take the position that the \nU.S. attorney for the District of Columbia would not be permitted to \nfollow the statutory mechanism to test White House assertions of \nexecutive privilege by prosecuting contempt of Congress. In essence, \nthis White House asserts its claim of privilege is the final word, that \nCongress may not review it, that no court can review it and that this \nWhite House, unlike any White House in history, is above the law.\n  Two days ago, during an oversight hearing with Mr. Gonzales, the \nsenior Senator from Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, rightly asked:\n\n       Mr. Attorney General, do you think constitutional \n     government in the United States can survive if the President \n     has unilateral authority to reject congressional inquiries on \n     grounds of executive privilege and the President then acts to \n     bar the Congress from getting a judicial determination as to \n     whether that executive privilege is properly invoked?\n\n  There can be no more conclusive demonstration of this \nadministration's partisan intervention in Federal law enforcement than \nif this administration were to instruct the Justice Department not to \npursue congressional contempt citations and intervene to prevent a U.S. \nattorney from fulfilling his sworn constitutional duty. In other words, \ntelling the U.S. attorney: Violate your oath of office; don't carry out \nyour sworn constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws and \nproceed pursuant to section 194 of title 2 of the United States Code. \nThe President recently abused the pardon power to forestall Scooter \nLibby from ever serving a\n\n[[Page S10065]]\n\nsingle day of his 30-month sentence for conviction before a jury on \nmultiple counts of perjury, lying to a grand jury, and obstruction of \njustice. Stonewalling this congressional investigation is further \ndemonstration that this administration refuses to abide by the rule of \nlaw.\n  This stonewalling is a dramatic break from the practices of every \nadministration since World War II in responding to congressional \noversight. In that time, Presidential advisers have testified before \ncongressional committees 74 times voluntarily or compelled by \nsubpoenas. During the Clinton administration, White House and \nadministration advisers were routinely subpoenaed for documents or to \nappear before Congress. For example, in 1996 alone, the House \nGovernment Reform Committee issued at least 27 subpoenas to White House \nadvisers. The veil of secrecy this administration has pulled over the \nWhite House is unprecedented and damaging to the tradition of open \ngovernment by and for the people that has been a hallmark of the \nRepublic.\n  The investigation into the firing for partisan purposes of U.S. \nattorneys, who had been appointed by this President, along with an \never-growing series of controversies and scandals have revealed an \nadministration driven by a vision of an all-powerful Executive over our \nconstitutional system of checks and balances, one that values loyalty \nover judgment, secrecy over openness, and ideology over competence.\n  What the White House stonewalling is preventing is conclusive \nevidence of who made the decisions to fire these Federal prosecutors. \nWe know from the testimony that it was not the President. Everyone who \nhas testified has said that he was not involved. None of the senior \nofficials at the Department of Justice could testify how people were \nadded to the list or the real reasons that people were included among \nthe Federal prosecutors to be replaced. Indeed, the evidence we have \nbeen able to collect points to Karl Rove and the political operatives \nat the White House.\n  A former political director at the White House made a revealing \nadmission in her recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwhen she refused to answer questions citing the oath she took to the \nPresident. In this constitutional democracy, the oath taken by public \nofficials is to the Constitution, not any particular President of any \nparticular party. The Constitution itself provides the oath of office \nof the President. Every President since George Washington has shown to \n``preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.'' \nThe oath for other Federal official is prescribed by Congress through \nstatute and provides that every Federal officer's duty is not to \nsupport and defend any particular President or administration but ``to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States'' and ``to \nbear true faith and allegiance'' to our founding principles and law.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order so that the Senator can be \nheard?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we have order? Take conversations outside \nthe Chamber, please.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope the Senator will say that again.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will. The witness testified that she had taken an oath \nto the President. I reminded her the oath is to the Constitution, not \nto any particular President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia, the \nconstitutional authority in this body, knows that every President since \nGeorge Washington has sworn to preserve, protect, and defend the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. `` . . . to support and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States'' and ``to bear truth fair and allegiance'' to our \nfounding principles and law, not to a particular political party or to \na President.\n  I pointed out to Ms. Taylor that the oath I have been privileged to \ntake as a U.S. Senator is likewise to the Constitution. I proudly \nrepresent the people of Vermont. I know it is a privilege to serve as a \ntemporary steward of the Constitution and the values and protections \nfor the rights and liberties of the American people that it embodies. \nMy oath is not to a political party and not even to the great \ninstitution of the U.S. Senate but to the Constitution and the rule of \nlaw. As a former prosecutor, I feel strongly that independent law \nenforcement is an essential component of our democratic government, and \nthat no one is above the law.\n  Despite the constitutional duty of all members of the executive \nbranch to ``take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,'' the \nmessage from this White House is that the President, Vice President, \nand their loyal aides are above the law. No check. No balance. No \naccountability.\n  The law says otherwise. The criminal contempt statute, 2 U.S.C. Sec.  \n194, provides that if a House of Congress certifies a contempt \ncitation, the U.S. attorney to whom it is sent has a ``duty'' and \n``shall'' ``bring it before the grand jury for its action.'' For this \nWhite House to threaten to intervene in an effort to preempt further \ninvestigation, cover up the truth and avoid accountability is an insult \nto the rule of law. This law was duly passed by both Houses of Congress \nand signed by a duly elected President of the United States. It is \nderived from law that has been on the books since 1857, for 150 years.\n  The Bush-Cheney White House continues to place great strains on our \nconstitutional system of checks and balances. Not since the darkest \ndays of the Nixon administration have we seen efforts to corrupt \nfederal law enforcement for partisan political gain and such efforts to \navoid accountability.\n  Given the stonewalling by this White House, the American people are \nleft to wonder: What is it that the White House is so desperate to \nhide? As more and more stories leak out about the involvement of Karl \nRove and his political team in political briefings of what should be \nnonpartisan government offices, I think we have a better sense of what \nthey are trying to hide. We have learned of political briefings at over \n20 government agencies, including briefings attended by Justice \nDepartment officials. This week, the news was that Mr. Rove briefed \ndiplomats on vulnerable Democratic districts before mid-term elections. \nWhy, Senator Whitehouse properly asked at our hearing yesterday, were \nmembers of our foreign service being briefed on domestic political \ncontests? Mr. Gonzales had no answer. Similarly, why were political \noperatives giving such briefings to the Government Services \nAdministration, which rents government property and buys supplies? In \nher testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the former \npolitical director at the White House ultimately had to concede that \nher briefings included specific political races and particular \ncandidates being targeted.\n  In this context, is anyone surprised that the evidence in our \ninvestigation of the firings of U.S. attorneys for political purposes \npoints to Mr. Rove and his political operations in the White House? \nDespite the initial White House denials, Mr. Rove's involvement in \nthese firings is indicated by the Department of Justice documents we \nhave obtained and from the testimony of high-ranking Department \nofficials. This evidence shows that he was involved from the beginning \nin plans to remove U.S. attorneys. E-mails show that Mr. Rove initiated \ninquiries at least by the beginning of 2005 as to how to proceed \nregarding the dismissal and replacement of U.S. attorneys. The evidence \nalso shows that he raised political concerns, including those of New \nMexico Republican leaders, about New Mexico U.S. Attorney David \nIglesias that may have led to his dismissal. He was fired a few weeks \nafter Mr. Rove complained to the Attorney General about the lack of \npurported ``voter fraud'' enforcement cases in his jurisdiction.\n  We have learned that Mr. Rove raised similar concerns with the \nAttorney General about prosecutors not aggressively pursuing voter \nfraud cases in several districts and that prior to the 2006 mid-term \nelection he sent the Attorney General's chief of staff a packet of \ninformation containing a 30-page report concerning voting in Wisconsin \nin 2004. This evidence points to his role and the role of those in his \noffice in removing or trying to remove prosecutors not considered \nsufficiently loyal to Republican electoral prospects. Such manipulation \nshows corruption of Federal law enforcement for partisan political \npurposes.\n\n[[Page S10066]]\n\n  Documents and testimony also show that Mr. Rove had a role in the \nshaping the administration's response to congressional inquiries into \nthese dismissals, which led to inaccurate and misleading testimony to \nCongress and statements to the public. This response included an \nattempt to cover up the role that he and other White House officials \nplayed in the firings.\n  Despite the stonewalling and obstruction, we have learned that Todd \nGraves, U.S. attorney in the Western District of Missouri, was fired \nafter he expressed reservations about a lawsuit that would have \nstripped many African-American voters from the rolls in Missouri. When \nthe Attorney General replaced Mr. Graves with Bradley Schlozman, the \nperson pushing the lawsuit, that case was filed and ultimately thrown \nout of court. Once in place in Missouri though, Mr. Schlozman also \nbrought indictments on the eve of a closely contested election, despite \nthe Justice Department policy not to do so. This is what happens when a \nresponsible prosecutor is replaced by a ``loyal Bushie'' for partisan, \npolitical purposes.\n\n  Mr. Schlozman also bragged about hiring ideological soulmates. Monica \nGoodling likewise admitted ``crossing the line'' when she used a \npolitical litmus test for career prosecutors and immigration judges. \nRather than keep Federal law enforcement above politics, this \nadministration is more intent on placing its actions above the law.\n  The Senator from Washington has been very good to let me have this \ntime. With our service of these subpoenas, I hope that the White House \ntakes this opportunity to reconsider its blanket claim of executive \nprivilege, especially in light of the testimony that President was not \ninvolved in the dismissals of these U.S. attorneys. I hope that the \nWhite House steps back from this constitutional crisis of its own \nmaking so that we can begin to repair the damage done by its untoward \ninterference with federal law enforcement. That interference has \nthreatened our elections and seriously undercut the American people's \nconfidence in the independence and evenhandedness of law enforcement. \nMr. Rove and the White House must not be allowed to continue \nmanipulating our justice system to pursue a partisan political agenda. \nApparently, this White House would rather precipitate an unnecessary \nconstitutional confrontation than do what every other administration \nhas done and find an accommodation with the Congress. If there are any \ncooler or wiser heads at the White House, I urge them to reconsider the \ncourse they have chosen.\n  There is a cloud over this White House and a gathering storm. I hope \nthey will reconsider their course and end their cover up so that we can \nmove forward together to repair the damage done to the Department of \nJustice and the American people's trust and confidence in Federal law \nenforcement.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on a matter of personal privilege.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for one moment, I say to the leader.\n\n\n                       Explanation for Not Voting\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to indicate that on the last vote, \nSenator Wyden and I were in the Budget Committee on the confirmation \nhearing of Mr. Nussle. We called over to ask that the vote be held so \nthat we could come to the floor and cast our votes. If I had been here, \nmy vote would have been ``yea'' on the Graham amendment. I want the \nRecord to reflect that fact. Senator Wyden should also be recognized \nfor a similar purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on a matter of personal privilege, I \nassociate myself with the remarks of Senator Conrad. I will be very \nbrief.\n  We were in the middle of critical issues. I was asking about a \nprogram that is a lifeline to the rural West, the county payments \nprogram where the administration is trying to change 100 years of \nhistory, and on a bipartisan basis the Senate indicated it wants to \noppose that program.\n  Had I been here, I would have, as Senator Conrad, voted for that \nmeasure, strongly supporting efforts to strengthen border security.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto proceed for a few moments as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia objects?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield just \nfor a second? The Senator said ``for a few moments.'' How long is that?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Probably about 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is fine. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n\n             Condolences to Senator Norm Coleman and Family\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me notify all Members of the Senate \nthat Senator Norm Coleman's father passed away this morning. Therefore, \nhe missed the vote that we just had and will be missing votes for the \nremainder of this week. I know I speak for all Members of the Senate in \nsending our condolences to Senator Coleman and his family at this very \nsad time. We look forward to having him back in the Senate in due time.\n\n\n                  Nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to make a few observations about \nthe nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Over the past few days, members of the Democratic leadership \nhave commented about Judge Southwick's nomination. These comments have, \nin my view, mischaracterized his record and his service to the people \nof his State. Worse still, some of our Democratic colleagues have made \ninsinuations about the commitment of this fine man to the principle of \nequal justice for all. These gross insinuations are, of course, at odds \nwith the views of his peers and his home State Senators, both of whom \nactually know him.\n  So over the next several days, we will continue to set the record \nstraight, as the ranking member did so ably yesterday, to ensure that \nthe Senate does not treat dishonorably an honorable man, a fine judge, \nand a courageous war veteran. Judge Southwick deserves more from this \ncountry than insinuation and innuendo. This leads me to a much broader \npoint.\n  My friend, the majority leader, and I have an understanding--at least \nI believe we had an understanding--as to how this Senate would treat \njudicial nominees in general. A fundamental component of that \nunderstanding is that individual nominees will be treated fairly. That \ncommitment to fair treatment may be in serious jeopardy with the \nSouthwick nomination.\n  I remind my colleagues that the Judiciary Committee unanimously \napproved Judge Southwick for a lifetime appointment to the district \ncourt just last fall, but it is now threatening to kill his nomination \non a party-line vote in committee. The only material change in Judge \nSouthwick's qualifications between last fall and now is the rating of \nthe American Bar Association, the Democrats' gold standard for judicial \nnominees. The ABA has actually increased its rating of Judge Southwick. \nIn other words, they have given him a higher rating for the circuit \ncourt than for the district court. Judge Southwick was rated ``well \nqualified'' for the district court. He is now rated ``unanimously well \nqualified,'' which means every single member of the committee who took \na look at his credentials for the circuit court found Judge Southwick \nwell qualified. That is the highest possible rating one can achieve for \na judicial nomination from the American Bar Association.\n  It goes without saying that for committee Democrats to oppose Judge \nSouthwick for the circuit court after having supported him for the \ndistrict without any change in the man's record would certainly fall \nfar short of treating the man fairly.\n  I encourage my Democratic colleagues to think hard about the \nimplications of unfair treatment for Judge Southwick for this Congress \nand, for that matter, for future Congresses.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, Senator Landrieu joined me in including \nimportant language in the Senate report that accompanies the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008. This language \naddresses a serious trade problem that is affecting the United States \nand many of its most critical industries. Our report language directs \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection to undertake a more vigorous \napproach to collecting unpaid antidumping and countervailing duties \nwhich are owed the United States under the U.S. trade laws.\n  In our report language, the Appropriations Committee directs CBP to \nwork with the Departments of Commerce and Treasury and the Office of \nthe U.S. Trade Representative to increase the collection of duties owed \non unfairly traded U.S. imports. CBP--Customs and Border Protection--is \ndirected to provide an annual report to the committee within 30 days of \neach year's distributions under the Continued Dumping and Subsidies \nOffset Act. The CBP report must summarize the Agency's efforts to \ncollect past-due amounts and to increase current collections, \nparticularly with respect to cases involving unfairly traded U.S. \nimports from China.\n  The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Act--also known as the Byrd \namendment--was enacted on October 28 in the year of our Lord 2000. It \nprovides that assessed duties received pursuant to either an \nantidumping or a countervailing duty order must be distributed by \nCustoms to affected domestic producers for certain expenditures that \nthe producers incurred after the order was put in place.\n  On June 4, 2007, CBP transmitted to Congress a fiscal year 2006 \nreport on annual antidumping and countervailing duties collected on a \ncase-by-case basis. The report stated that while CBP distributed nearly \n$400 million to more than 1,700 affected domestic producers in fiscal \nyear 2006, a whopping--hear me--a whopping $146,391,239.89 was due but \nnever--never--collected. Astoundingly, the amount of uncollected \nantidumping and countervailing duties not collected since 2000 is \napproaching $700 million.\n  Let me read that again. Hear me now. Astoundingly, the amount of \nuncollected antidumping and countervailing duties not collected since \nthe year 2000 is approaching $700 million, with the largest uncollected \namount, over $400 million, owed in a single case: dumped crawfish tail \nmeat from China.\n  On June 20, 2007, CBP advised that, since October 1, 2001, CBP has \nsimply ``written off'' $30.3 million in uncollected antidumping and \ncountervailing duties. The greatest amount written off, again, was in \nthe case of crawfish meat from China, where CBP wrote off nearly $7.5 \nmillion. That is a lot of money. This is money that otherwise would \nhave been distributed directly to eligible U.S. crawfish producers. \nThis means these funds will never be distributed to the hundreds of \ndeserving American families to whom they are owed. What a shame.\n\n  Have Senators heard of Moon Landrieu? That was this Senator's father, \nSenator Landrieu. I would like to ask my esteemed colleague from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu, if she is similarly concerned about our \nGovernment's failure to collect these funds, recompense which is now \nlost--to whom? To Louisiana's honest and hard-working crawfish farmers \nand processors.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank Senator Byrd, because I am extremely concerned \nabout this situation and hope we could find a remedy. I commend the \nSenator for his work over many years, to try to make sure our trade \nlaws are fairly enforced and that agreements we have entered into, with \ncountries such as China and others, are followed. But in this instance, \nas the Senator has so eloquently stated in this discussion this morning \non the floor, this situation is not being handled correctly. Our \nindustries, particularly in Louisiana, that he has mentioned, our \ncrawfish producers have lost more money from the failure of U.S. \nimporters to pay duties owed by China than any industry in our Nation. \nIn Louisiana alone--I know it might be hard for people to believe this, \nbut as spring rolls around, it will become quite evident--we have 3,300 \ncrawfish farmers in our State and over 40 processors who employ a \ntremendous number of people and contribute hundreds of millions of \ndollars to our economy. The Senator from West Virginia understands our \nGovernment has failed to collect almost $70 million for this industry \nalone. This is antidumping duties on crawfish tail meat from China owed \nto the processors in my State and to our crawfish\n\n[[Page S10068]]\n\nfarmers. There are additional funds that are owed.\n  It is my understanding--and the Senator from West Virginia is very \naware--that our Customs officials are required to collect these duties, \nbut they are not being collected. Many of these importers simply close \nup shop, they change their names, they move offshore, they reorganize, \nand evidently we are not able to collect the money that is owed to us. \nIt is a great detriment to this particular industry and to others.\n  I have expressed concern over the years. We are going to continue to \npress this issue. We will continue in Congress to work to solve this \nproblem. I feel very strongly that our U.S. Secretary of Commerce, \nSecretary Gutierrez, and the U.S. Trade Ambassador, Susan Schwab, \nshould take this up directly with the China Ministry of Foreign Trade \nand Economic Cooperation. China sought to become a WTO member. It is my \nfirm belief, if China wants to receive the benefits that accrue to them \nthrough WTO, they should enforce them and help us, and we should do a \nbetter job of making sure the importers abide by the rules we have \nagreed to.\n  I was very pleased to see in response to concerns raised by the \nSenate, GAO recently announced it has begun an indepth investigation as \nto why our Government cannot seem to collect duties owed to U.S. \nindustries on goods imported from China.\n  Since 2003, the total amount of uncollected duties on all antidumping \ncountervailing duty orders for all countries totaled $630 million. Of \nthis amount, $485 million, or 77 percent of the total, relates to 34 \nspecific antidumping and countervailing duty orders that have been \nimposed by the United States on agriculture and aquacultural imports \nfrom all countries. Of that $485 million, 73 percent relate to six \nantidumping orders that have been imposed on U.S. agricultural and \naquacultural imports from China alone.\n  While the biggest duty noncollection problem in my State relates to \nthe crawfish industry, as the Senator from West Virginia most certainly \nknows, Louisiana also is experiencing a problem with our catfish \nfarmers. I see the senior Senator from Mississippi. This affects \nMississippi, it affects Arkansas, it affects Alabama. We were unable to \ncollect almost one-third of the fees that are owed to our catfish \nfarmers.\n  These are hard-working businesspeople who work long hours, who are \ntrying to run these industries and abide by all environmental \nregulations, pay their taxes, abide by all the wage and hour laws in \nthis country. When we enter into trade agreements, the least our \nGovernment can do is enforce them. That is what I come to the floor to \nexpress my concern about, through this colloquy with the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  I commend the Senator for his tireless work. We are going to press on \nthis issue of noncollection. I hope, even if this Subsidy Offset Act \nexpires, our Government will continue to collect the money that is owed \nto us during the time this act was in effect. It means a great deal to \nthe small businesses in my State, to crawfishers and catfish producers \nequally. I am hoping we can make some progress and do not continue to \nhave our trade laws undermined in this way.\n  I thank the Senator for this time on the floor and I thank him for \nhis continued work on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2505 to Amendment No. 2468\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order. I send an \namendment to the desk.\n  Mr. VITTER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2468 is pending. The clerk will \nreport.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I make a point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself and \n     Mr. Conrad, proposes an amendment numbered 2505 to amendment \n     No. 2468.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Relating to bringing Osama bin Laden and other leaders of al \n                           Qaeda to justice)\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n       Sec. 536. (a) Enhanced Reward for Capture of Osama Bin \n     Laden.--Section 36(e)(1) of the State Department Basic \n     Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2708(e)(1)) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new sentence: ``The Secretary \n     shall authorize a reward of $50,000,000 for the capture or \n     killing, or information leading to the capture or death, of \n     Osama bin Laden.''.\n       (b) Status of Efforts To Bring Osama Bin Laden and Other \n     Leaders of Al Qaeda to Justice.--\n       (1) Reports required.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, and every 90 days \n     thereafter, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of \n     Defense shall, in coordination with the Director of National \n     Intelligence, jointly submit to Congress a report on the \n     progress made in bringing Osama bin Laden and other leaders \n     of al Qaeda to justice.\n       (2) Elements.--Each report under paragraph (1) shall \n     include, current as of the date of such report, the \n     following:\n       (A) An assessment of the likely current location of \n     terrorist leaders, including Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-\n     Zawahiri, and other key leaders of al Qaeda.\n       (B) A description of ongoing efforts to bring to justice \n     such terrorist leaders, particularly those who have been \n     directly implicated in attacks in the United States and its \n     embassies.\n       (C) An assessment of whether the government of each country \n     assessed as a likely location of top leaders of al Qaeda has \n     fully cooperated in efforts to bring those leaders to \n     justice.\n       (D) A description of diplomatic efforts currently being \n     made to improve the cooperation of the governments described \n     in subparagraph (C).\n       (E) A description of the current status of the top \n     leadership of al Qaeda and the strategy for locating them and \n     bringing them to justice.\n       (F) An assessment of whether al Qaeda remains the terrorist \n     organization that poses the greatest threat to United States \n     interests, including the greatest threat to the territorial \n     United States.\n       (3) Form of report.--Each report submitted to Congress \n     under paragraph (1) shall be submitted in a classified form, \n     and shall be accompanied by a report in unclassified form \n     that redacts the classified information in the report.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, point of order. What is the pending \nbusiness before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Landrieu amendment, No. 2468, with the \nDorgan second degree.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have sent a second-degree amendment to \nthe desk to the Landrieu amendment. My second degree will not strike \nher amendment. As a matter of fact, it will add at the end of her \namendment the provisions of an amendment I had offered on Defense \nauthorization. I am to chair the Democratic Policy Committee luncheon \nin a few minutes so I am not able to speak at length about this \namendment. I intend to do that at some later point.\n  I wish to mention what Senator Landrieu has described in her first-\ndegree amendment, the interest in having as our major policy goal here \nwith respect to the fight against terrorism, the destruction of and \nelimination of the leadership of al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden. My \namendment is one I had offered, as I said, to the Defense authorization \nbill, previously. It is an amendment that requires a quarterly \nclassified report to be offered to the Congress that would tell us what \nis being done to bring to justice the leadership of al-Qaida.\n  The reason for offering that is quite simple. A week ago, we had a \nnew National Intelligence Estimate, an NIE, given to the Congress in \nclassified and unclassified form; an NIE that was reported to the \nAmerican people. The reports were not particularly surprising but in \nsome ways stunning. The report says the greatest terrorist threat to \nour homeland, in this country--the greatest terrorist threat to our \nhomeland is al-Qaida and its leadership. It also says al-Qaida and its \nleadership is in a secure hideaway or safe harbor.\n  I ask the question for which there is no answer: Why, nearly 6 years \nafter \n9/11/2001, in which Osama bin Laden boasted about engineering the \nmurder of thousands of innocent Americans--why, after 6 years, is there \na safe harbor or secure hideaway anywhere on this planet for the \nleadership of al-Qaida and for Osama bin Laden? That, in my judgment, \nis a failure.\n  We have a lot of briefings in this Congress; some of them classified, \ntop secret briefings. There are no briefings\n\n[[Page S10069]]\n\nthat I am aware of on what is being done or what has not been done to \nbring to justice, to apprehend, and eliminate the leadership of al-\nQaida. Those briefings do not exist. One of the reasons that perhaps we \nhave not seen progress in bringing to justice and eliminating the \nleadership of al-Qaida is the President himself said: I don't think \nmuch about that. I don't think much, don't care much about Osama bin \nLaden.\n  If you believe the intelligence estimates, they are today planning \nadditional attacks against this country. Yesterday, we woke up to the \nnews that there are apparently dry runs, they think--our intelligence \npeople think there are dry runs being made in our airports with various \nthings packed in luggage by terrorists who want to do potential attacks \nlater. We hear all these reports and the question remains: Why is it \nthe leadership of the organization that poses the greatest terrorist \nthreat to this country has a secure hideaway somewhere or a safe haven \nsomewhere? There ought not be a square inch of ground on this planet \nthat is safe for those who murdered Americans on 9/11, for those who \npose the greatest threat to this country. That is intolerable.\n  The Defense authorization bill will come back to the floor of the \nSenate, I guess. This amendment I have offered is in that piece of \nlegislation. But to make certain this amendment becomes law and gets to \nthe desk of the President for signature, I have offered it to this \nappropriations bill. I understand it fits better on Defense \nauthorization. My hope is that is where it will wind up on the \nPresident's desk.\n  It seems to me we went through agonizing debates and passionate \ndebates on the floor of the Senate about the war in Iraq. I respect \neverybody's opinion on those issues. But while we have soldiers who got \nup this morning and strapped on body armor and got in humvees and then \nwent and knocked door to door in Baghdad in the middle of a civil war, \nwhere Shias are killing Sunnis and Sunnis are killing Shias and Shias \nand Sunnis are both killing Americans--while that happened this morning \nin the middle of a civil war, we have the greatest terrorist threat to \nthis country apparently in a safe harbor or secure hideaway. That ought \nnot exist. First things first. Let's fight the terrorists first and \ndefeat the terrorists first. That ought to be the first and most \nimportant priority and responsibility. If they are the greatest threat \nto this country, let's eliminate that threat. That ought to be the goal \nof this country. That is why I offer this amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Senator, tell the Senate about his amendment again. Let me \nhear about the amendment again.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment has two parts to it. No. 1, \nit increases the reward for the elimination of the al-Qaida leadership \nand Osama bin Laden, and, No. 2, it required a quarterly classified \nreport to be made to the Congress, every quarter, from this \nadministration and from any administration, to say what they are doing, \nto tell us what they have been doing to try to apprehend and bring to \njustice and eliminate the leadership of the greatest terrorist threat \nto this country.\n  Is it too much to ask that we ought to be informed?\n  Mr. BYRD. No.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We ought to understand what is being done or what is not \nbeing done. I think the American people have a reason to ask the \nquestion: Why, nearly 6 years later, do we now read--and I have read it \non a number of occasions in unclassified versions of classified reports \nthat say--there is a secure hideaway for Osama bin Laden and the \nleadership of al-Qaida?\n  There is a secure hideaway. There is safe haven. Now, why should any \nplace on this Earth be secure or safe for those who would attack this \ncountry?\n  Mr. BYRD. Where? Where? Where is that, Senator?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, the intelligence reports indicate that somewhere \nbetween Pakistan and Afghanistan, in the tribal-controlled mountainous \nregions, there is some sort of safe hideaway or secure hideaway or safe \nhaven, as they call it. I have flown over this region. I have looked \ndown, and I know there is no border. You cannot tell what country you \nare in. I have flown over the region that they call tribal-controlled \nbetween Afghanistan and Pakistan. There is no evidence of a country \nboundary. It is a tough country, tough region, I understand that.\n  But if we now have al-Qaida reconstituting and rebuilding training \ncamps, which they are doing--they are recruiting new recruits, they are \nbuilding training camps, they are planning attacks against the West, \nplanning attacks against the United States of America, and doing so in \na secure hideaway or safe haven--then I say that is wrong. It ought to \nbe job No. 1 for this country to eliminate the leadership of al-Qaida \nthat represents the greatest threat to our country.\n  That is the purpose of this amendment, to say we want that to be the \noverriding and overarching goal, and we want reports, classified \nreports every single quarter of what has been done or what has not been \ndone because I do not believe, frankly, this has been a significant \npriority.\n  It certainly should have been. If it has not been in the past, at \nleast let's make it so in the future.\n  Mr. BYRD. I compliment the Senator on his statement. Am I a cosponsor \nof this amendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to say that Senator Conrad joins me in this \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd be added as a \ncosponsor as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As I said, I have to chair the Democratic policy \ncommittee luncheon in just a moment. I wanted to make a comment on the \namendments that have been offered, and perhaps after the policy \ncommittee luncheon, if these issues are still pending, I will be able \nto comment.\n  Senator Vitter has offered an amendment dealing with prescription \ndrugs. Senator Cochran has second-degreed that amendment, as I \nunderstand it. I believe we ought to have access to lower priced \nprescription drugs, FDA-approved prescription drugs.\n  Lower priced prescription drugs exist in virtually every other \ncountry of the world. Why should the American consumer not have the \ncapability to acquire them under our current rules? I would say that we \nalready have a circumstance where we are allowed about a 90-day supply \nof drugs, if someone walks across the border or drives across and comes \nback with a personal use, 90-day supply. Very few Americans live close \nenough to the border to be able to do that. But we have an amendment \nthat is a broad bipartisan amendment; 30-some Members of the Senate \nhave worked on it, cosponsored it. This will not be the legislation in \nwhich we consider that amendment, I do not expect.\n  The amendment that Senator Vitter has offered, as second-degreed by \nSenator Cochran, would simply restate current rules; that is, currently \nwhat is allowed. It would simply restate current rules, which I assume \noffends no one but accomplishes nothing as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding there are 11 \namendments pending on this bill. There are points of order that lie \nagainst several of them. And the managers will make those whenever they \nsee fit. I hope that those people who have other amendments pending \nwould agree to short time agreements on them and accept a time for \nvoting. Maybe the managers can even accept some of them.\n  This is a bill we want to finish today. It is an important piece of \nlegislation. It has been improved in many different ways, not the least \nof which is this border security legislation that was passed earlier \ntoday. So I hope that Democrats and Republicans who offered these \namendments will contact the managers and agree on a reasonable period \nof time so we can vote. It is 1 o'clock in the afternoon. It is \nimportant we do this.\n  I do not want to sound like a stuck record, but we have to finish \nthis legislation before we go home in August. We have to finish the \nSCHIP bill before we go home in August. We have a 9/11 conference \nreport we have to finish before we go home in August. We have the \nethics and lobbying reform we have to finish before we go home in \nAugust. We are going to do that.\n  Everybody should understand--and, of course, I mentioned on the floor \nabout the bill that Senators Boxer and\n\n[[Page S10070]]\n\nInhofe have worked on dealing with WRDA, which is so important to the \nwhole country, but certainly important to the western part of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me say that on the amendment I just offered, I would \nbe glad to a 10-minute time agreement when we get ready. I expect we \nwill not need a recorded vote on that. But I know, as the Senator from \nNevada is pointing out, we had an objection to even the motion to \nproceed on this bill, which was strange to me. Why would anybody have \nobjected to proceeding?\n  Now we get a bill on the floor, and Senator Byrd, Senator Cochran, \nthe chairman and ranking member, I know they want to get this done. I \nbelieve we ought to get these appropriations bills through and out of \nhere. This is a good bill.\n  I hope this afternoon Senators can come and offer the amendments. I \nhope we can get this bill done today. It is not just this bill, we have \ngot a lot of appropriations bills we have to do. So the Senator from \nNevada, the majority leader, has an important message: We need to get \nthis appropriations bill done. It deals with homeland security after \nall.\n  Mr. REID. That is a really good example to set for the other people \noffering amendments. I would also say, as I said on the Senate floor \nthis morning, there is an extremely important congressional delegation \nthat is scheduled to be in Greenland this weekend. I would really \nlike--first of all, I would like to have gone on the trip. But there \nare 10 or 11 Senators scheduled to go on that trip. I hope that trip \ncan take place. But we are going to have to get this legislation done.\n  If we get some idea that there is a real stall going on here, we will \nhave to file cloture on the conference report dealing with homeland \nsecurity, the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and that vote would not \ntake place until Saturday. So we are doing our best to work through all \nof this. But I want everyone to know, as I have said here so many \ntimes, we have a very few things to do, but we are going to do them. \nAnd it is no bluff. We have a whole month to complete everything in \nAugust. I hope people will help us work through that so that is not \nnecessary.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like for our majority leader to say \nthat again.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to do that for my distinguished friend, \nthe senior Senator from the State of West Virginia, of the West \nVirginia hills.\n  We have four things to do for sure: the bill we are on now, this \nappropriations bill, children's health, the conference report on the 9/\n11 Commission recommendations, and the message that we are going to get \nfrom the House on ethics and lobbying reform. Those four things are \nessential.\n  The luxury we would have is also to complete WRDA. The conference \nreport is important. We should be able to do that quickly. We got a \nhuge vote when it came out of here.\n  These are the things that we must do before we leave. This is not \nanything new that I just sprung on anybody. That is something that I \nhave been saying for a long time. We have made great progress. I am \nvery happy with it. We were able to get Wounded Warriors done. We were \nable to get the pay raise for the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines. We were also able to pass for the first time in 3 years the \nhigher education bill--that is important--reconciliation, getting the \nbiggest change in how students are able to go to our schools in our \ncountry since the GI bill. We have a few things we need to do, and we \nreally need to do it.\n  I repeat, it is almost 1 o'clock on Thursday. I will be happy to work \ninto the night to complete this bill. I say that the managers of the \nbill says it all, Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran. They are the best \nwe have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, taking the distinguished majority leader's \nwords to heart, I would like to ask the Senate to return to the Vitter \namendment to try to dispose of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Would the Senator repeat his request?\n  Mr. VITTER. The request is to return to the Vitter amendment to \ndispose of that and proceed with the business of the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. What is the number of the amendment?\n  Mr. VITTER. Amendment No. 2488, which is pending.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would object at this time and suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. I renew my unanimous consent request to go back to \namendment No. 2488.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, at this point I send a modification to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, just to be transparent and clear to \neveryone, this modification of my amendment takes out a specific \nprovision limiting the amendment to a 90-day supply.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the modification.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 69, after line 24, add the following:\n       Sec. 536.  None of the funds made available in this Act for \n     U.S. Customs and Border Protection or any agency or office \n     within the Department of Homeland Security may be used to \n     prevent an individual from importing a prescription drug from \n     Canada if--\n       (1) such individual--\n       (A) is not in the business of importing a prescription drug \n     (within the meaning of section 801(g) of the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 381(g))); and\n       (2) such drug--\n       (A) complies with sections 501, 502, and 505 of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 351, 352, and 355); \n     and\n       (B) is not--\n       (i) a controlled substance, as defined in section 102 of \n     the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802); or\n       (ii) a biological product, as defined in section 351 of the \n     Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262).\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I will be happy to explain exactly what \nthe modification is. The modification simply takes one phrase out of \nthe previous version of my amendment. And that single phrase in the old \nversion of my amendment limited the amendment to a 90-day supply of \nprescription drugs.\n  That limitation is now taken out of my amendment. That is the only \nthing the modification does. Now, the purpose of the modification is to \nnow make it a pure funding limitation amendment so that it is not \nsubject to the point of order of authorizing on an appropriations bill.\n  That is the full explanation of the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect \nto the Landrieu amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Landrieu amendment is pending.\n  Mr. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCASKILL). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to walk \neveryone through where we are right now.\n  About 15 or 20 minutes ago, the majority leader came over to the \nSenate to talk to us about moving quickly through the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill that is now on the floor because, as he described, \nwe have many\n\n[[Page S10071]]\n\nitems of business that need to be accomplished before the Senate goes \ninto recess for the August break. He asked the managers of this \nlegislation, Senators Byrd and Cochran, to work with Senators who have \npending amendments to move them through in an orderly fashion so we \ncould possibly finish this bill by tonight and go on to the rest of the \nbusiness that needs to be completed.\n  In complying with that, Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran and myself \nworked out an agreement to begin to deal with some of those amendments. \nThat is how we work in the Senate. We would never finish everything if \nwe didn't take some time to have conversations to figure out how we can \nwork through amendments in an orderly fashion.\n  There are 11 amendments currently pending that we are trying to work \nour way through. One of those amendments is an amendment offered by the \nSenator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter, which he had a right to come and \noffer. It was not the pending matter. The pending matter was the \nLandrieu amendment, second degreed by the Dorgan amendment.\n  In order to get to the amendment offered by Senator Vitter, we had to \nagree by unanimous consent to set that aside. We talked to the Senator \nand agreed on a process to dispose of his amendment. Senator Byrd, \nSenator Cochran, Senator Vitter, and I were here to come to an \nagreement that Senator Vitter would offer his amendment. He understood \nthat a point of order lay against that regarding whether it was a rule \nXVI. He understood that Senator Cochran's second-degree amendment also \nwas in the same procedural difficulty.\n  The agreement was that we would agree to lay the amendment aside, \nSenator Vitter would set aside the amendment, go to his amendment, and \na point of order would lie against it, as well as a point of order \nagainst the second degree offered by Senator Cochran. It sounds \ncomplex, but the upshot was, it would dispose of the amendment, a point \nof order would lie against it, and we would move on to the other \nnumerous amendments that now lay before the Senate.\n  In this body, it is extremely important that we all have the \nopportunity to work out these agreements so we can work through bills \nin an orderly fashion. I assumed that would be the case, that we had \nall agreed upon that and that would be the order this would go to.\n  Unfortunately, when the Senator rose to ask to set aside the \namendment, according to the agreement we agreed to, I did not object. \nThe Senator went to his amendment, and instead of going through the \nprocess we had all agreed upon, he sent a modification to the desk that \nchanged his underlying amendment and meant that it no longer had a \npoint of order lying against it.\n  That is a difficult position it puts us all in because we have 11 \namendments, possibly more, to get through. If we can't come to an \nagreement and trust each other on how the process is going to move \nforward and go outside that, we are not going to be able to get through \nthese amendments, because this Senate really is based on trust.\n  So, Madam President, we are now in the parliamentary position where \nwe have gone back to the regular order. Another amendment is pending. \nIf we move through these in proper fashion, the amendment offered by \nSenator Vitter will now be at the end of 12 amendments that are now in \norder. At some point we will get to it, but we now are in a difficult \nposition of: How do we move through all these other amendments that are \nbeing offered? How do we deal with all the other Senators who are going \nto come to the floor and ask us to work through these amendments, if we \ncannot have an agreement that this Senate--when Senators stand on the \nfloor and agree to it--knows that is what will occur? So we find \nourselves in a very difficult position.\n  I see the majority leader is on the Senate floor and will yield to \nhim if he would like to make a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I gave a talk a week ago tomorrow to a \ngroup of people. It was a church meeting. There were adults and young \nadults there. I told them about my experience serving in the Congress. \nI have served in the House, and I have served in the Senate. It is not \nlike when I practiced law.\n  When I practiced law, you put everything in writing. We do not do \nthat in the Congress. We do not do that in the Senate. Your word is \nyour bond. If a Republican Senator or a Democratic Senator--it does not \nmatter--if you tell them you are going to do something, that is the way \nit is.\n  To show how powerful and important that is, Alan Bible was a Senator \nfrom Nevada who served 20 years and became ill. He retired. When he \npassed away--there was a plane that was always available to take \nSenators to funerals. The plane was scheduled to go to Nevada so \nSenators could attend Alan Bible's funeral.\n  There was a Republican on that airplane, Ted Stevens. The reason he \nwas on that airplane was there was a vote very important to Ted Stevens \ndealing with Alaskan oil. Alan Bible had given his word he was going to \nvote with Ted Stevens. There was tremendous pressure on Alan Bible. \nAlan Bible's vote was the essential vote, and he withstood all the \npressure and voted with Ted Stevens. That is the reason Ted Stevens \nwent to Reno, NV: to honor the life of Alan Bible because he kept his \nword.\n  That is what we do in this Senate. We keep our word. It does not \nmatter with whom you make an arrangement; if you tell him you are going \nto do something, if you tell her you are going to do something, that is \nthe way it is.\n  So my disappointment in what has happened in the last few minutes \nis--it appears Senator Murray said it in a more discreet fashion than I \nam going to say it. Somebody did not keep their word. And that, I \nsuggest, should be worked out. I think if someone in this body is known \nto have broken their word--and I was part of the little conversation \nright here--you do not take advantage of people. There are a lot of \nrules that allow you to take advantage of people, but you cannot do \nthat.\n  So this is not appropriate. This is wrong. And I would hope that the \nSenator from Louisiana would kind of retrace his steps and back off and \nput us back where we should be. If that is not the case, and he chooses \nnot to do that, I think it is going to be a difficult time, I would \nsuggest, for him making other arrangements with Senators in the future \nbecause that is how we do business here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President--while the majority leader is here, and \nthe managers of the bill--the parliamentary position in which we now \nfind ourselves is that the amendment that is now before the Senate \nunder the regular order is the Dorgan amendment to the Landrieu \namendment.\n  Senator Dorgan was on the floor a few minutes ago and said he would \nbe willing to agree to a 10-minute debate time and a vote. I know the \nmajority leader has several issues that are going on. I would like to \nask the managers of the amendment how they would like to proceed at \nthis point.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I have no \nobjection to proceeding to a vote at whatever time the majority leader \nsuggests.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if the Republican floor staff would check \nto find out if we could do the vote at 1:50, 2 o'clock. Two o'clock is \nfine? Two o'clock.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nvote at 2 o'clock on or in relationship to the Dorgan amendment to the \nLandrieu amendment that is currently pending, with the time equally \ndivided between now and 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, we are not in a quorum call.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 15 \nminutes prior to the vote be equally divided between those in favor of \nthe amendment and those opposed to it. Senator Dorgan is in favor of \nit, so he would get 7\\1/2\\ minutes. Is that appropriate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and\n\n[[Page S10072]]\n\nask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2448 Withdrawn\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, on behalf of the Senator from New York, \nMr. Schumer, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendment No. 2448.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I rise to express my disappointment with \nwhere we find ourselves on the pending bill. We are debating the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. The bill includes over $14 \nbillion--spelled with a ``b''--for border security. By a vote of 89 to \n1, we just approved $3 billion in emergency funding for border \nsecurity. I note that the bill also includes $1.7 billion for FEMA \ndisaster relief to help fund the response to Hurricane Katrina.\n  The Senator from Louisiana--where is he? Do you want to hear me? Come \non out. I want to say it in front of you.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is now holding up this bill over a \nlegislative matter that is not germane to the measure. As the manager \nof the bill, I thought we had reached an accommodation on how to \ndispose of the matter.\n  Instead, the Senator from Louisiana--where is he? He was here a \nmoment ago.\n  I thought we reached an accommodation on how to dispose of the \nmatter. Instead, the Senator from Louisiana offered a new amendment--a \nnew amendment.\n  Is he here? All right. I want to say it in his presence.\n  Instead, the Senator from Louisiana offered a new amendment. I am \ndisappointed that the Senator from Louisiana has decided to delay \nconsideration of a bill that includes critical funds for aiding the \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Did you hear me? Where is that Senator?\n  I am disappointed----\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you for the courtesy.\n  First of all, let me say to the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, I have the utmost respect for him. I just want to clarify \nthat it certainly is not my intent to delay anything. I am happy to \nproceed with votes on this bill--all votes that are lined up, and other \nvotes.\n  I would also like to make this offer, if it would clarify or help \nheal the past situation. I apologize if anything was miscommunicated \nregarding the last hour or so. But if it would help heal that, I would \nbe happy to withdraw my pending amendment as long as I was given the \nopportunity and assured of an opportunity to file a new amendment, \nwhich is germane, and that could be made pending. And, of course, in \nthat context, I would have no objection to anyone, including Senator \nCochran, being able to offer a second-degree amendment on that \namendment.\n  So I would be happy to withdraw my pending amendment as long as I \ncould be given the opportunity to submit an amendment that could be \nmade pending rather than have the clock run out or have proceedings and \nvotes on the bill happen before that amendment would be made pending.\n  But, again, my main point is, it is certainly not my intent to delay \nthis bill, or any votes on amendments or the bill, and I am eager to \nproceed with all of those.\n  I thank the Senator for the courtesy of yielding.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, we have not seen any amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. I will be happy to provide a copy of what that new \namendment would be. I would be happy to do that right now.\n  Mr. BYRD. Spell it out on the floor in front of everybody. What is \nthe amendment?\n\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum so that we may be \nable to see the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Again, I would remind my colleagues that we are \ncurrently debating the Dorgan amendment to the Landrieu amendment. \nSenator Kerry is on the floor and wishes to speak. I yield him the time \nuntil 1:45 when it will be equally divided at that time. So the Senator \nhas 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, last November was one of those truly rare \nmoments in the short history of our country and our democracy. Any \npolitical science student taking a freshman lecture, of course, will \nhear how incredibly hard it is to remove entrenched congressional \nmajorities. They know the statistics about how hard it is to defeat \nincumbents around here. It doesn't happen that often. But sometimes, \nthe American people rise up in one moment, as they did last November, \nand they make history. Just six times in our 230-year history has one \nparty lost both Houses of Congress, and 2006 was the first time the \nRepublican Party failed to win a single House, Senate, or gubernatorial \noffice previously held by the Democrats.\n  We Democrats have been in that predicament. In 1994, Democrats woke \nup to a landslide defeat some people thought would never come. It \nwasn't always easy, it wasn't always collegial, but we listened and we \nlearned. Together, we reached across the aisle to balance the budget \nand reform welfare. We wrestled with why we had lost, and we wrestled \nwith what we had to do in order to come together--not just as a party \nbut as a country.\n  Evidently, some people still haven't wrestled with what happened last \nNovember 7.\n  Last November, Americans were appropriately angry. They saw our young \nmen and women in uniform paying the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq for a \nfailed policy that was stuck on autopilot. They saw the number of \nAmericans without health insurance skyrocket to 45 million, with more \nhard-working Americans joining them every day. They saw record-high oil \nprices and global climate change--a reality denied and deferred and no \nserious national effort to address these issues. They saw staggering \ncorruption and no accountability for the way the people's House had \nbeen turned into a refuge for the special interests. Americans saw a \npolitics and a party that was broken, and they rejected the \nstubbornness, cynicism, corruption, and failed policies that made \n``Washington'' a dirty word. They voted for a change.\n  President Bush seemed to get the message the day after the 2006 \nelection when he said to America:\n\n       The message yesterday was clear. The American people want \n     their leaders in Washington to set aside partisan \n     differences, conduct ourselves in an ethical manner, and work \n     together to address the challenges facing our Nation.\n\n  The President said he got the message, but the question has to be \nasked: What have Republicans done since then? Where are they 6 months \nafter their worst electoral defeat in 50 years? What happened to the \nPresident's postelection statements when measured against the \nPresident's actions and those of the Republican minority in the Senate? \nThose actions tell a very different story. Before the dust had settled, \nbefore defeated Republicans had even cleaned out their offices, this \nPresident and his remaining allies in Congress have made a calculation, \non issue after issue, that they would just set out to stop everything \nfrom happening and then they would turn\n\n[[Page S10073]]\n\naround and they would ask: Why is nothing happening under the \nDemocrats? This is a pure political calculation. It is wrong for the \ncountry, and I respectfully would suggest, ultimately, it will be wrong \nfor the party. They would rather spend their time attacking Harry Reid \nthan attacking the Nation's problems. Delay is no longer just a former \nRepublican leader; it has become a Republican way of life.\n  We have been busy debating progress in Iraq around here and measuring \nbenchmarks. I can't help but think as we talk about measuring \nbenchmarks that pretty soon the Iraqi Government is going to wonder \nwhether the Republican caucus is going to meet any of its benchmarks or \nany of the country's benchmarks.\n  For 6 months now, the Democratic majority has worked in good faith to \ndeliver on our promises to the American people. Because of the \nDemocratic majority, the minimum wage earner in America now makes 70 \ncents an hour more than they did under a Republican Congress--and soon \nthey will be making $2 more. The longest streak without a raise in the \nminimum wage in the history of the minimum wage has ended but not \nbefore 4 months of Republican obstruction cost each minimum wage earner \nin America around $500 in earnings.\n  We passed legislation to make college more affordable and cut \ninterest rates in half for millions of Americans with student loans. We \nstood up to powerful special interests and raised the fuel efficiency \nof our automobiles by 10 miles per gallon. Twenty years had passed \nsince Washington raised the fuel standards, but Democrats took on the \nspecial interests and got it passed. We passed funding for stem cell \nresearch. We passed the 9/11 Commission recommendations. We passed \nethics and lobbying reforms.\n  Just yesterday, we passed legislation that will fix many of the \nshortfalls in our care for injured troops and veterans, and, over yet \nanother White House veto threat, we also passed a 3.5-percent raise for \nmembers of the military. Most importantly, we passed legislation \ndemanding that the President face reality and begin redeploying troops \nfrom Iraq.\n  Regrettably, there is, on almost every one of these issues, today as \nI stand here a gap between how many of those policies that are aimed to \nhelp everyday Americans, which enjoy the majority support of the \nSenate, and how many have actually been signed into law. Why? One \nsimple reason: The President and his allies in Congress have decided to \nuse every means at their disposal just to slow it down and block it, to \nstand for a policy of obstruction and obstruction and obstruction, not \naccomplishment for the American people. They have vetoed and \nfilibustered and killed bills in conference. They have wasted days and \ndays with procedural motions and delays that have nothing more to do in \ntheir purpose than to waste time and squander the trust and patience of \nthe American people and, ultimately, to hope to be able to blame it on \nthe Democrats.\n  Just look at what they have blocked. They vetoed a Senate bill \ndemanding a new strategy in Iraq. They vetoed a stem cell research \nbill, science that could prove crucial to cures for 100 million \nAmericans with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or diabetes or other \ndiseases. Now, another veto is threatened on children's health care--of \nall things, children's health care--a veto threat on a bill the \nPresident hasn't even read, because he was worried about the price tag. \nWell, we are talking about our children's health, and the bill offered \njust $7 billion each year for uninsured children, while we spend 1\\1/2\\ \ntimes that amount every month in Iraq. Those are just the bills which \nmade it to the President's desk.\n  Senate Republicans blocked a vote on a bill to allow the Federal \nGovernment to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for 43 million \nAmericans on Medicare. Republicans are blocking the passage of a bill \nthat would provide crucial funding for the intelligence community. They \nare blocking ethics bills that would mark the most sweeping ethics \nreform since Watergate. They don't have the votes to stop it, so they \nare pulling a procedural maneuver and refusing to appoint conferees in \norder to hammer out the final details of the bill.\n\n  The Republicans are now setting records for filibusters and \nobstruction. The Senate record for filibusters is being set already, \nand it is only halfway through this term. To paraphrase Winston \nChurchill: Never, in the field of Senate legislation, was so much \nprogress blocked for so many by so few.\n  Actually, they have made history, I suppose, because thanks to the \nSenate Republicans, L.A. is no longer the center of gridlock in \nAmerica--it is right here. On issue after issue, the Republicans have \nchosen to filibuster--and to do so just 2 short years after they \ndeclared the filibuster, as their then-leader, Bill Frist, said in late \n2004, ``nothing less than the tyranny of the minority.'' After \nexpressing outrage at the mere hint of a Democratic filibuster last \nsession, the Republicans have suddenly become the principled champions \nof so-called minority rights in the Senate, but minority rights apply \nto legitimate filibusters for legitimate issues, not a policy of \nobstruction to stop everything that comes along.\n  After threatening the so-called ``nuclear option'' when Democrats \nstood up to defend the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, they have \nintroduced a filibuster to stop everyday business in the Senate. Almost \neverything the majority leader tries to do here now requires us having \na cloture vote in order to prevent a filibuster. In fact, the \nrubberstamp Republicans of the previous 7 years have now become the \nroadblock Republicans. The party of Abraham Lincoln has become the \nparty of redtape--vetoes, filibusters--any means necessary to deny the \nwill of the majority of the Senate and the vast majority of the \nAmerican people.\n  If you don't believe me, listen to what the minority whip, Senator \nTrent Lott, told a reporter just this April. He said:\n\n       The strategy of being obstructionists can work or fail, and \n     so far, it is working for us--\n\n  The ``us'' being the Republican Party and the minority in the Senate.\n  Well, I think the Senator is looking at it the wrong way. The \nquestion isn't, Is it working for Republicans, is it working for \nDemocrats? The question is, Is it working for the American people? Is \nit working for the millions of low-income children whose health care \nfunding the President has threatened to veto? Is it making us safer \nwhen you block the funding for the intelligence agencies? Is this \nobstructionist strategy working for the 12 million Americans forced to \nlive in the shadows of American life while our borders stay broken? Is \nit working for the 554 soldiers who have died in Iraq since Republicans \nfirst blocked a measure to redeploy troops last February?\n  Instead of the Senate's highest shared principles of consensus and \nbipartisan accomplishment, the Republicans have chosen the lowest \ncommon denominator--a zero sum game in which they are willing to gamble \nthe American people's loss for Republican gain. The Republican strategy \nseems to be to slash the tires of the Senate and then wonder why we are \nstill stuck on the side of the road and blame somebody else for that \nproblem.\n  Let me be clear what I am criticizing here. I support the right of \nthe minority to filibuster. In fact, I have done so myself. Every \nSenator in this body has that right. I support that right. But when \nfilibustering not for the principle of the issue at hand but for the \ngeneric, broad strategy of stopping what happens here so you can blame \nthe party in charge for not being able to finish the work, that is \nunacceptable.\n  The rights of the minority in the Senate ought to be protected, but \nthey also ought to be used responsibly too. Do I have a problem with \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SAlazar). Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent for a few more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, obstruction for obstruction's sake is not \nin the best traditions of this great institution. It is the worst kind \nof cynical political calculation. I think all of us on our side would \njoin in voting to protect the right of the minority to be able to \nfilibuster. We all understand that what goes around comes around, and \nthe time may come when we again may be in the minority. We Democrats \ndon't want to use the nuclear option. We are\n\n[[Page S10074]]\n\nnot even talking about it. We want to pass bills. We want to pass bills \nthat are supported by a majority of people in the Senate, including \nRepublicans, and certainly supported by the majority of Americans.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues that there is a better way to do \nbusiness. We can work together and actually do something positive for \nthe American people. All of us know this is a uniquely challenging \nmoment for this country. We face new threats and hurdles no generation \nhas faced before. We ought to be working together to solve those \nproblems. The only chance this Senate has to make a real contribution \nto history is to make a bipartisan contribution. That is the only way \nthe Senate meets its own expectations.\n  Some of the great legislative accomplishments in recent memory came \nunder mixed Government, when both sides of the aisle came together.\n  In 1981, Ronald Reagan saw that Social Security was in danger of \ngoing bankrupt and placed a call to the Democratic speaker of the \nHouse, Tip O'Neill. They realized that at the end of the day, nobody \nwould solve it if they didn't. So they got together and took the \npolitics out of a tough and unpopular vote. The deal they struck kept \nSocial Security afloat. Neither man could have done it without the \nother. Neither party could have done it without the other.\n  We all know the limits of a politics of division, of partisan \nsectarianism. A politics of division can rush our country into war, but \nit cannot sustain our trust or the war itself. A politics of division \nhas no answer for 12 million undocumented workers in our houses, \nfields, and factories. It has no answer for 45 million Americans with \nno health insurance, no answer for icecaps that are melting or a failed \npolicy in Iraq. The politics of division is bad for America--from the \nParkinson's patient to the undocumented immigrant to the soldier in \nIraq. Nobody is benefiting from Republican obstructionism.\n  It is also bad for the Senate. This Senate has been known as the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world. But there is nothing \ndeliberative about partisan sabotage. There is nothing deliberative \nabout blind obstructionism.\n  The ongoing debate we have here is about much more than Senate \nprocedure. At its core is a debate, really, about where we are headed \nin our relationship with each other, Republicans and Democrats. All of \nus go home and hear from our constituents about how they have lost \nfaith in Washington. All of us want to do right by the people who \nelected us and try to make life better for the American people.\n  Any Senator who has been here for a period of time has watched the \ndecline of the quality of the exchange on both sides of the aisle in \nthis institution. I have seen colleagues stand up against it. I \nremember when Senator Gordon Smith, in the middle a painful debate on \nIraq, said:\n\n       My soul cries out for something more dignified.\n\n  I think a lot of Senators on both sides of the aisle are concerned \nfor the Senate. Voters want a debate over ideas, not a war of words; a \nchoice of direction, not a clash of cloture votes. The stalemate we \nhave now is not what the Senate is renowned for. This is called, as I \nsaid, the greatest deliberative body in the world, a place where people \non both sides can find common ground and get good things done for other \npeople.\n  Ultimately, we are accountable to the American people--accountable \nfor false promises, accountable for failure to address issues we \npromised to address, whether it is energy independence or military \nfamilies who lose their benefits. We are accountable.\n  Mr. President, a filibuster to stop all progress, then claim \nDemocrats aren't doing anything, is a failed strategy. It is a failure \nbecause it doesn't put the American people first. I believe the \nAmerican people will hold a party of obstruction accountable. I hope \nthat will change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2505\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that by unanimous \nconsent, we have a vote scheduled at 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I know of no opposition to the amendment I have offered. \nAre there those on the minority side seeking to use time against the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes under the unanimous \nconsent order.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nConrad be recognized for 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it has been 2,144 days since 9/11. We all \nremember the day our Nation was attacked. That attack was led by Osama \nbin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida. At the time, the President said:\n\n       This act will not stand. We will find those who did it. We \n     will smoke them out of their holes. We will bring them to \n     justice.\n\n  Mr. President, 2,144 days have passed, and still we have not brought \nOsama bin Laden or al-Zawahiri or the rest of the top leadership of al-\nQaida to justice. These are the people who led the attack on our \ncountry. It wasn't Saddam Hussein and Iraq; it was Osama bin Laden and \nal-Qaida. Yet this Nation lost focus under the leadership of this \nadministration.\n  I think the most striking story of all is this from the USA Today in \nlate March 2004:\n\n       In 2002, troops from the 5th Special Forces Group who \n     specialize in the Middle East were pulled out of the hunt for \n     Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to prepare for their next \n     assignment: Iraq. Their replacements were troops with \n     expertise in Spanish cultures.\n\n  Mr. President, there are not a lot of Spanish speakers in Afghanistan \nor in Pakistan. That is where Osama bin Laden is still lurking, still \nhiding, still waiting to strike our country.\n  This amendment says: Let's remember who attacked America, and let's \nfinish business with him and his al-Qaida network.\n  Mr. President, we have now learned this week, according to the New \nYork Times, that a 2005 raid on al-Qaida chiefs was called off at the \nlast minute by Secretary Donald Rumsfeld:\n\n       The mission was called off after Rumsfeld rejected an 11th \n     hour appeal from Porter Goss, Director of the CIA. Members of \n     the Navy Seals unit in parachute gear had already boarded C-\n     130 cargo planes in Afghanistan when the mission was \n     canceled.\n\n  This amendment says: Let's put the focus back on Osama bin Laden and \nal-Qaida. Let's finish business with the people who attacked America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to use the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that we have a 2 \no'clock vote on this amendment. This amendment is one Senator Conrad \nand I had offered on the Defense authorization bill. That bill, as you \nknow, is no longer on the floor of the Senate. So we offer it now to \nthis legislation. Just as my colleague from Louisiana has previously \noffered an amendment with respect to the objective and the priority of \neliminating the leadership of al-Qaida, this amendment we offered about \n2 weeks ago would do two things: increase the reward for Osama bin \nLaden and the leaders of al-Qaida; No. 2, and most important, it would \nrequire quarterly top-secret classified briefings to this Congress \nevery quarter about what is or is not being done to bring to justice, \nto capture, or kill the leadership of al-Qaida.\n  Why do we want to do this? It has been nearly 6 years since thousands \nof Americans were murdered--innocent Americans murdered by Osama bin \nLaden and al-Qaida. They boasted about engineering the murder of \ninnocent Americans.\n  Here is what last week's National Intelligence Estimate says:\n\n       Al-Qaida is and will remain the most serious terrorist \n     threat to the homeland.\n\n  That doesn't need much interpretation. The most serious threat to our \nhomeland is al-Qaida.\n\n       We assess the group has protected or regenerated key \n     elements of its homeland attack capability, including a safe \n     haven in the Pakistan federally administered tribal areas, \n     operational lieutenants, and its top leadership.\n\n  Does anybody in this country believe there ought to be a safe haven \non this\n\n[[Page S10075]]\n\nplanet for those who boasted about murdering thousands of innocent \nAmericans? Does anybody believe there ought to be secure hideaways or a \nsafe haven for the leadership of al-Qaida that, today, in the mountains \nsomewhere, are planning attacks against this country?\n\n  Why, after 6 years, are we not successful in bringing to justice and \nlimiting the leadership of al-Qaida? It is not as if we don't know all \nof this.\n  This is in June:\n\n       Al-Qaida regroups in new sanctuary on the Pakistan border.\n       While the U.S. presses on in its war against insurgents \n     linked to al-Qaida in Iraq, bin Laden's group is recruiting, \n     regrouping, and rebuilding in a new sanctuary. . . .\n\n  This is from the New York Times in February:\n\n       Terror officials see al-Qaida chiefs regaining power.\n       Senior leaders from al-Qaida are operating from Pakistan \n     near the Afghan border, according to American intelligence \n     and counterterrorism officials.\n\n  How much more do we need to understand? We have soldiers in Iraq \ngoing door to door in Baghdad in the middle of a civil war, where Sunni \nand Shia are killing each other and Sunni and Shia are both killing \nAmerican soldiers. In the middle of a civil war, we have soldiers going \ndoor to door in Baghdad and, in the meantime, we have al-Qaida building \ntraining camps in a secure hideaway between Pakistan and Afghanistan. \nAnd today, this afternoon, they are planning additional attacks against \nour country. That is unbelievable to me.\n  Mr. President, in August 2001, the Presidential daily briefing given \nto this President said the following:\n\n       Bin Laden Determined to Strike in the U.S.\n\n  That was the title. Nearly 6 years later, we now have intelligence \nassessments with this title:\n\n       Al-Qaida better positioned to strike the West.\n\n  That is what I call failure.\n  We must succeed. That is why we ask with this amendment for quarterly \nclassified top-secret briefings to this Congress to tell us what they \nare doing or what they are not doing to bring to justice and to \neliminate the leadership of al-Qaida. It is unbelievable to me that \nOsama bin Laden, who boasted of attacking this country, now apparently \nis in a secure hideaway or a safe haven. Nowhere on this small planet \nshould there be somewhere safe for the leader of the organization or \nthe leadership of the organization that launched the attack on this \ncountry in 2001. It is unbelievable to me that we are in this \nsituation.\n  Now, the President said this when asked about it:\n\n       I don't know where bin Laden is. I have no idea and really \n     don't care. It is not that important and it is not our \n     priority.\n\n  Those are the words of President Bush.\n  Let me read the words of the National Intelligence Estimate of last \nweek that came out from this administration:\n\n       Al-Qaida is and will remain the most serious terrorist \n     threat to the homeland.\n\n  Maybe we ought to modify that statement of the President because it \nought to be our priority. That is what this amendment is about. It \nshould have been our priority 4 years ago, 5 years ago. It ought to be \nour priority today. I know of no more important priority for this \ncountry than dealing with the leadership of al-Qaida and eliminating \nthe greatest political threat and the most serious terrorist threat to \nour homeland. That is what our amendment does.\n  I hope the Senate will once again agree to this amendment and \nestablish this as a preeminent priority for this country.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding no time remains and \nwe will go to a vote immediately; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nas under the previous order.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes on this subject, and then we can go to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Reserving the right to object, will the Senator modify \nher request to allow me 2 minutes before we go to the vote?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify her request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. What is the Senator's request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has asked for 2 \nminutes. The Senator from South Carolina has asked to modify that \nrequest for 2 minutes.\n  Does the Senator from Louisiana so modify her request?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, in fairness, as I have seen Republican \namendments taken down with rule XVI, I raise a point of order that the \npending amendment constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill and \nviolates rule XVI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we consider \nthe amendment I have offered, notwithstanding rule XVI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The point of order is well \ntaken and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I appeal the ruling of the Chair and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I believe I have the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are in the twilight zone. We are on an \nappropriations bill. An amendment was offered subject to a point of \norder. The point of order was raised and sustained by the Chair. And \nnow the person who won wants to appeal the ruling of the Chair.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the leader. We were rushed, and I didn't have a \nchance to explain what I was trying to do. As I was listening to the \ndebate of the last couple of days, I have seen rule XVI used against \nLindsey Graham's bill. I have seen other Republican bills, such as \nDavid Vitter's, taken down because it violated rule XVI, legislating on \nan appropriations bill. Yet when I heard Senator Dorgan's amendment, I \nrealized there was a double standard. We were being inconsistent. It \nwas OK to legislate on a Democratic bill but not a Republican bill. My \nintent was to make a point, to raise a point of order that Senator \nDorgan's amendment does violate rule XVI. But when the Chair ruled, I \nappealed the ruling of the Chair, which the Parliamentarian said she \ndid not hear. But what I wanted to vote on was the ruling of the Chair \nto establish are we going to use rule XVI against Republicans but not \nDemocrats; are we going or are we not going to have a fair debate?\n  Obviously, our preference would be not to be legislating on \nappropriations bills, but if we are going to do it for some, we should \ndo it for all.\n  In this case, I say to the leader, my hope had been to vote on an \nappeal of the ruling of the Chair, which I had asked for, but was not \nrecognized apparently, before we went into a quorum call.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, you won. The rule XVI you raised and \nyou won. The amendment falls. And it is a Democratic amendment.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I had asked for the yeas and nays on appealing the ruling \nof the Chair because that was my intent, to question whether we should \nbe legislating on appropriations bills. That was more of a vote on rule \nXVI than it was the Dorgan amendment. That is what I was here for, to \nask for a vote on appealing the ruling of the Chair,\n\n[[Page S10076]]\n\nwhich was my language: ``I appeal the ruling of the Chair and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.''\n  Mr. REID. Just a second; I have the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada and others were in \nthe well a moment ago when Senator DeMint indicated what he wanted was \na vote on my amendment. I said that is fine, withdraw your objection \nand we will have a vote on my amendment. Apparently, that is not what \nhe wanted because the Senator offered an objection relative to rule \nXVI. The Chair sustained the Senator's objection, and because the \nSenator won, he was not satisfied and wanted to do something further.\n  I don't have the foggiest idea what might be the motivations here. If \nthe Senator from South Carolina wants a vote on my amendment, all he \nhas to do is withdraw his objection, and we can have a vote in 30 \nseconds. If there is some other nefarious purpose here, then maybe the \nSenator might explain it to us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that is why I said I think we are kind of in \na twilight zone here. The Chair is not partisan. The Parliamentarians \nwho serve at our pleasure, Democrats and Republicans, are not partisan. \nThey go by the rules and the precedents set in this body.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the distinguished majority leader yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my friend. I will say to my \nfriend, he and I were on this floor and we danced this tune once \nbefore. It took us 4 years to unwind from it. That is why the vote \nyesterday was so important.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is what I wish to comment on, Mr. President, if the \ndistinguished Senator will yield briefly. Without getting into the \nsubstance or without questioning anybody's motives, it is important \nthat we understand--and I can put this in the form of a question to the \nmajority leader--if, in fact, this appeal of the ruling of the Chair \nshould succeed, that would do away with rule XVI, as I understand it, \nand then we would all have a grand old time legislating on \nappropriations bills.\n  Before the leader responds, let me say there are pent-up feelings on \nthis side, probably on your side: Well, we can't get the authorizations \nand some of the language we want and the appropriations bills may be \nabout the only thing moving through here, in some respects, and we want \nto have an opportunity to legislate on appropriations bills. But here \nis part of my concern, honestly. I don't think we can win that battle \nagainst the other side. I suspect you all would wind up legislating \nmore than we would on appropriations bills.\n  Mr. President, I think we need to calm down around here. There is a \nrule on the books for a reason. For good reason we took an action that \nknocked it out a few years ago. I learned painfully what a mistake that \nwas. We should not be legislating on appropriations bills. You can make \na good-faith effort around here if you want to do that. I think this \naction would cause some consequences we would not want, if we look at \nit in the future.\n  Am I stating this correctly, I ask the majority leader?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, our roles were reversed too many years ago \nwhen I had his job and he had my job, and it was a very difficult time. \nEven everything being in order, to move these appropriations bills is \nhard, and then anybody can offer anything on them. The key to these \nappropriations bills is you deal with matters of appropriation, not \nsome of the subjects people have thrown into them all the time.\n  As my friend said, there is a lot of frustration. The House can move \na lot of authorizing legislation. We cannot over here. So there is a \ntremendous temptation to stick in these appropriations bills all kinds \nof authorizing legislation that shouldn't be on appropriations bills.\n  I plead to my friend from South Carolina: It doesn't prove anything \nto have us vote on something--you have already won. I will also say \nthis. The only partisan nature of raising points of order is we try--it \nusually works out that way--if there is a Republican who violates a \npoint of order, a Democrat who is the manager of the bill will raise a \npoint of order; if it is a Democrat, then a Republican will raise a \npoint of order. That is the only partisan nature of raising points of \norder.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the distinguished majority leader yield \nbriefly?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I feel a necessity at this point--and I will \nfollow it with a question--to also say that I understand the right of \nthe Senator from South Carolina to do this procedure. I am not \nquestioning that at all. I think the result would be one that would not \nbe good for the institution, and I think we would be abusing it on both \nsides.\n  But also I want to emphasize the right of a Senator to modify his own \namendment. I wasn't here when the discussions took place with regard to \nSenator Vitter's modifying of his own amendment, and I know that has \ncaused some consternation.\n  Mr. President, if I could say to the majority leader, wouldn't it be \nbetter for this institution if we would not get in the position of \nquestioning each other's motives? I realize we have to be honest with \neach other, and I understand what everybody is doing. I understand the \namendment on Osama bin Laden. Yes, we want to catch him, and I know \nthere is a lot being done--and I won't get into the intelligence--and I \nunderstand what Senator DeMint is doing, but I would hope this would \ngive us an opportunity, in a bipartisan way, for the sake of this \ninstitution, to step back, to calm down, and to stop trying to do these \nthings to each other on both sides of the aisle.\n  I am grandstanding, and I apologize, but my purpose is to try to say \nto the institution, to our people, I hope we will find a way to avoid \nthis. I think it would be a mistake, and I assume the majority leader \nagrees with that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague, calling on his \nyears of experience, to try to settle things down.\n  I would say that, perhaps with Senator Vitter, giving him the benefit \nof the doubt, maybe there was a misunderstanding in the conversation. \nThat is totally possible. Maybe he didn't understand the rules. Maybe \nhe didn't do one thing and say something else, and I accept that, if in \nfact that is the case.\n  So I think what we should do is, I am going to ask a quorum call be \nstarted, and then we will huddle over here and see if we can work all \nthis out.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, due to the good work of my friend from \nMississippi and others, on both sides, here is what we are going to do. \nThere has been a point of order raised against the Dorgan amendment, \nand that has been sustained. So that amendment will fall. And in the \norder of amendments filed, Senator Vitter's is at No. 11 or 12; OK?\n  Senator Vitter, when he had his conversation with Senator Cochran, \nSenator Murray, and me, was under the impression he could still modify \nhis amendment. We thought differently. It was just a misunderstanding. \nMaybe we have been around here too long--I shouldn't say ``we.'' Maybe \nI have been around here a long time and just accept things for the way \nthey appear to be and not sometimes the way they are. Senator Vitter \nhas said there was nothing nefarious in what he did. He just assumed he \ncould automatically modify that. And under the rules, he could.\n  So we will go back right where we were. No one is accusing Senator \nVitter of anything that is illegal or unethical. It was simply a \nmisunderstanding among the four of us. So anything I have said earlier \ntoday, based on my misunderstanding of him and what his thoughts were, \njust forget about them because based on the conversation I have had \nwith him in the last few minutes, that wasn't the case. So I shouldn't \nhave been as upset, and\n\n[[Page S10077]]\n\nSenator Murray shouldn't have been as upset as she was. Senator Cochran \nwas his usual stoic self trying to lead us in the right direction, \nwhich we didn't go.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the majority leader.\n  First of all, I appreciate those words very much, and I certainly \nwant to reiterate that I never thought I was waiving what I considered \nmy ability as a Senator to modify my own amendment and try to get a \nvote on my own amendment in the form I would like. So I appreciate the \ncomments of the leader in that regard.\n  I also want to point out that I was actually modifying the amendment \nin order to get rid of this point of order and the fact that it, in a \nprevious form, would have legislated on an appropriations bill, which \nwe are trying to avoid. So I was trying to avoid that with regard to my \namendment.\n  But I appreciate the comments, and I look forward to moving forward.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, Mr. President, let me say, I haven't mentioned his \nname but, of course, the distinguished Republican leader, being \ninvolved in this little huddle that took place, had a tremendous \ninfluence on our ability to work this out. I would say--and I hope I \ndon't jinx anything we are working on now--what I would really like us \nto do is to see if in the foreseeable future we can work out a time on \nthis bill for final passage. No one has had any amendments being \nprohibited. If people don't want to have final passage in the next 24 \nhours or so, that's fine.\n  As I have said before, I don't want to file cloture. We can just keep \ngrinding through the weekend, but I would rather not do that.\n  Sometime today we are going to see if we can move to the conference \nreport that Senator Lieberman has so masterfully brought back to us \ndealing with the 9/11 Commission recommendations. He, of course, worked \nwith Senator Inouye and others to get this done, and so we will do that \nat a later time. But I wish everyone would work--certainly the two \nmanagers of the bill--to see when would be an appropriate time to see \nabout a time for final passage.\n  Remember, we have this bill to complete. We have to work on \nchildren's health. We have two conference reports--there may be three \nconference reports--and that is all we have to do. But we have to go \nthrough all the procedural hurdles, and that may take longer than any \nof us wants to get through in the next few days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished minority \nwhip, Mr. Lott, for pointing out for the Senate a few moments ago the \nimportance of rule XVI. I also want to thank the junior Senator from \nSouth Carolina for understanding, as well, that is a rule that has \noccasionally been reversed and restored in the Senate, and I think it \nis important to most of us that it continue to be in effect.\n  I also thank the majority leader and Senator Vitter for the colloquy \nwe just heard. I think it is entirely possible for us to conduct our \nbusiness in a civil fashion. I think we have just experienced a good \nexample of the Senate working together on a bipartisan basis to get \nback together and to begin to move forward and finish this bill as soon \nas possible. Certainly, I share the views of the majority leader that \nwe need to wrap up this bill in the very near future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank all our colleagues for working \nwith us to a point where I hope now we can start working through the \namendments.\n  I call for regular order at this point, and I would remind all of us \nthat I have about 12 or 13 amendments that have been offered. I know \nseveral other Senators have asked to be recognized to offer amendments. \nWe want to work our way through all of these in a timely manner in \nregular order. We will be doing that this afternoon. So I ask Senators \nto stay close by the floor so we can move them through as quickly as \npossible. Hopefully, we can get time agreements on them in short order \nand dispose of them in whatever way is appropriate.\n  At this time, I call for regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2468\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Landrieu amendment is the pending \namendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order against the \nLandrieu amendment, that it is legislation on an appropriations bill, \nin violation of rule XVI.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, how much time do I have to speak on the \namendment? Is there any time allocated on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is not debatable.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, at this point we would like to move to \nregular order. The next amendment pending is the Grassley-Inhofe \namendment.\n  I understand the Senator from Louisiana would like 2 minutes just to \ndiscuss the amendment that just fell, so I ask unanimous consent that \nshe have 2 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \nask the distinguished minority manager of the bill for just 10 minutes \nto speak on my amendment, and then he can speak on the point of order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order has been raised.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, in the interest of comity, I will agree, \nbut may I bring up two amendments that have already been filed while I \nam here?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I object at this time. I have a number of Senators who \nare asking us to call up amendments. We would like to work with all of \nyou to do that in a regular fashion. Maybe we can do that after the \nSenator from Louisiana is speaking, but at this point we are going to \nallow the Senator from Louisiana to speak and then move back to regular \norder, which will then be the Grassley-Inhofe amendment, No. 2444.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest propounded by the Senator from Louisiana?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair, and I can appreciate the situation \nwe are in with the point of order being raised against the amendment, \nbut as you know, Mr. President, I offered this amendment in good faith \nlast night and spoke at some length on the amendment. I was under the \nimpression that before we voted I would have the opportunity to speak \non the amendment. Since that didn't happen, I appreciate the goodwill \nof my colleagues to at least allow me 5 minutes to speak, although the \namendment has a point of order called against it.\n  My amendment actually proposes $25 million on this appropriations \nbill. I don't know where else to appropriate money except on an \nappropriations bill, and that is basically what my amendment does. It \nis a two-page bill, and it appropriates $25 million to the CIA to give \nthem some extra resources to try to track down the No. 1 terrorist and \nhis network that is threatening our country.\n  This amendment was prompted not out of politics or spite, it was \nprompted out of last week's National Intelligence Estimate that has \nbeen referred to now several times on both sides of the aisle. This did \nnot come from a Democratic think tank or a Republican think tank, it \ncame from the National Intelligence Estimate that says the al-Qaida \nnetwork is as strong as it was before 9/11 and that Osama bin Laden is \nstill the No. 1 target.\n\n  I offered an amendment in good faith and reached out to my colleagues \nto say we are on homeland security, could we find $25 million to \nappropriate some additional funding to the CIA? I know there are other \nresources, some of them are classified and some of them are not--and to \nclearly restate the policy that Osama bin Laden remains the foremost \nobjective of the United States in the global war on terror and \nprotecting the U.S. homeland, the foremost is to capture and kill Osama \nbin Laden.\n  I understand the point of order. I understand technically the \nParliamentarian would probably rule against me.\n\n[[Page S10078]]\n\nBut for the purposes of the constituents I am representing I wish to \nsay I am trying but am blocked to appropriate $25 million more on a \nHomeland Security bill to give it to the CIA to help protect us from \nthe No. 1 terrorist, according to our intelligence reports. That is all \nI wished to say.\n  I thank my colleagues for allowing me that moment of the record. I \nknow the Senator wants to go back to regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken and the \namendment falls.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the Grassley amendment No. \n2444 be temporarily set aside; that we proceed to the Alexander-Collins \namendment No. 2405.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2405, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment described by Senator Murray be modified. The modification is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 40, after line 24, insert the following:\n\n\n                        REAL ID GRANTS TO STATES\n\n       Sec. __.  (a) For grants to States pursuant to section \n     204(a) of the REAL ID Act of 2005 (division B of Public Law \n     109-13; 119 Stat. 302), $300,000,000.\n       (b) All discretionary amounts made available under this \n     Act, other than the amount appropriated under subsection (a), \n     shall be reduced a total of $300,000,000, on a pro rata \n     basis.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 hour of \ndebate, equally controlled in the usual form, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the vote, and upon use or yielding back of \nthe time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher courtesy. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his help with \nthis amendment, facilitating its coming to the floor last night at a \nlate hour. I am grateful to him for that.\n  This is an amendment which I described on the Senate floor yesterday. \nIt is an amendment involving REAL ID. I am offering the amendment with \nseveral cosponsors, including Senator Collins of Maine, Senator Warner, \nand Senator Voinovich. It is my intention to use about 10 minutes of \nour 30 minutes on this side and to reserve the rest of that time for \nSenators Collins, Warner, and Voinovich, if they choose to come to the \nfloor in support of this.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kyl of Arizona be \nadded as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this amendment would provide $300 \nmillion in funding to the States to implement the program known as REAL \nID. It is offset with a .8-percent across-the-board cut in the rest of \nthe bill. The total pricetag of the rest of the bill, the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill, is about $37.6 billion.\n  I will have a word to say about the offset in a moment. I know the \nSenator from Washington will have a few more words to say about the \noffsets when her time comes. I would prefer another offset, but I will \ntalk about that a little later.\n  First, let me describe again what the amendment does. I would ask the \nChair if I can be informed when 10 minutes has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, after 9/11, the 9/11 Commission \nrecommended that in light of the terrorism our country faces, we begin \nto study how we can have more secure identification cards. A number of \nthe terrorists had stolen cards or had fraudulent cards or had ID cards \nthat were not real.\n  As a result of that, the Congress passed the Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorism Prevention Act at the end of 2004 which established a process \nby which we could look at the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. It \nestablished a negotiated rule-making process.\n  Because most of the ideas about ID cards involved State and local \ngovernments, all of them involved issues of privacy, all of them \ninvolved the possibility of great inconvenience to most Americans, this \nnegotiated rule-making process would basically create a seat at the \ntable for representatives of all the affected groups and try to work \nout the most sensible thing to do.\n  I have historically been opposed to the idea of an ID card. When I \nwas Governor of Tennessee, I twice vetoed the photo driver's license \nbill because I thought it was an infringement on liberty. But the \nlegislature overrode me, I accepted it, and today, after 9/11, I agree \nit would be wise for our country, with a combination of terrorism and \nthe difficulties within immigration, to have more secure identification \ncards.\n  The question is, which one? Then suddenly, in 2005, along came an \nappropriations bill for our troops, and in the middle of it, the House \nof Representatives stuck something called the REAL ID Act, which set \nminimum standards for State driver's licenses as an effort to deter \nterrorists from easily obtaining that form of identification.\n  Well, that could be a good idea. But there are 245 million Americans \nwith driver's licenses or ID cards. Many of us send those in by mail or \nonline to renew them. Last year in the State of Tennessee, for example, \nthere were 1.7 million driver's licenses issued. There are 53 driver's \nlicense identification stations. I believe the only group of people who \ncould have passed REAL ID in the dead of the night, without any \nhearings, were Congressmen who had never been to a driver's license \nexamining station in Tennessee or maybe in their own State, because \nthese are not State employees who are trained in catching terrorists. \nThey are not equipped to deal with the large number of new \nresponsibilities, in a State which is going to have REAL ID, that \ninclude having to come in person to that driver's license office and \nshow a number of documents, including the Social Security card and a \nvalid U.S. passport.\n  We would have to prove, I would have to prove, that I am lawfully a \ncitizen of the United States. Our family has been here for 12 \ngenerations. Senator Salazar has been here for 13 generations. The \nPresiding Officer has written a book about the number of generations \nhis family has been here. We would have to go down to one of these \ndriver's license stations and prove we belonged here. Nobody else ever \nhad to do that before in my family that I know about. But in an age of \nterrorism, we might have to do that.\n  At the very least, I would think we would want to do one of two \nthings: One would be that in the Senate, in the Homeland Security \nCommittee or other appropriate committees, we might want to think about \nwhether there might be other ways to come up with a better secure \nidentification card, rather than add that to the burden of the driver's \nlicense.\n  For example, most of the problems that surround the immigration bill \nhave to do with work, people coming into this country illegally to get \na job. That is what most of it is about. Senator Schumer and Senator \nGraham have a piece of legislation that would create a secure Social \nSecurity card.\n  Now, I wonder if, over a period of years, having workers with a \nSocial Security card that is secure, includes biometrics, and a good \nemployer verification system, might not be a more sensible way for us \nto improve the question of whether we have secure identification cards.\n  There is the idea of more passports. Already we have a backlog \nbecause of the number of American who are getting a passport. But \npassports are a more secure identification. Maybe there should be a \nsecure travel card we could use when we travel on airplanes. For \nexample, there are a couple million\n\n[[Page S10079]]\n\nof us at a time who are up in the air. If we all had one of those \ncards, you begin to add all those up--you may have some driver's \nlicenses that are more secure, a secure work card, a passport and a \ntravel card, a variety of secure cards would begin to avoid the terrors \nwe imagine from a ``Big Brother'' national ID card.\n\n  We remember what happened with that sort of thing in Nazi Germany and \nin South Africa, where you had to carry around a wallet and a portfolio \ndescribing how mixed your blood might be so they can determine your \nrace. We do not want that in the United States.\n  So that would be the kind of discussion we should have had in \nhearings before any of this was adopted. We were going to have that \nwith the negotiated rule-making process, before suddenly this so-called \nREAL ID card comes through here at night and we have to vote for it, up \nor down, or not send any money to support the troops fighting in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  We can get an idea of what the REAL ID surge might cost by looking at \nwhat is happening right now with the passport backlog in the United \nStates. There were 12 million passports issued in 2006. This year there \nare going to be 17 million because of new travel requirements. The \nPassport Office employees are working hard, but they grossly \nunderestimated, or we did, what the new demand would be.\n  As a result, there was a backlog of 3 million passports in March. \nToday it is 2.3 million. The turnaround time used to be 6 weeks, now it \nis 12 to 14 weeks on regular service and 4 to 6 on expedited service. \nWe have destroyed summer vacations, we have ruined weddings and \nhoneymoon plans, we have disrupted business meetings and educational \ntrips. People lost days of work waiting in line. If we think the \npassport backlog has created consternation, imagine what it is going to \nbe like when 245 million Americans, many who have been used to renewing \ntheir driver's licenses by mail, many who have thought of themselves \nand their parents and grandparents as good, legal Americans, have to go \nto their driver's license station with a pack of documents and prove \nthey are legally here.\n  Then they might get right up to the door and somebody says: You \nforgot one thing, and they have to go all the way back home, get it, \nand stand back in line again. I bet we get more calls on that than we \ndid on immigration.\n  There is another problem I would like to describe. It is one I am \ntrying to address with this amendment. I am trying to provide three \nhundred million dollars next year to help States who wish to comply \nwith REAL ID pay for it. Now, not all States will take advantage of \nthis because 17 States have already\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska.) The Senator has used \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will continue with my time because I do not see \nSenator Collins or Senator Warner or Senator Voinovich. I will take \nanother 4 or 5 minutes. If they don't come, then I will give back my \ntime, except a minute or two to the Senator from Washington and let the \nSenator from Washington be recognized.\n  But let me talk about the money a minute. Seventeen State \nlegislatures, including Tennessee, have passed legislation against REAL \nID. We do not want it. We want something else. But for those who do \nhave it, they have to get cracking because it says here: States have to \nbe ready to comply with these new measures by May of next year.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has not even issued final \nregulations about what the compliance must be. But the Department, \nthanks to the good work of Senator Collins and others with an amendment \nwe had earlier this year, has agreed to grant waivers to States for \ndelayed implementation. So States have a little bit of time to work on \nthis, if they choose to.\n  But 17 States do not want to. However, we have a principle here \ncalled federalism. Much of it is incorporated in the 10th amendment to \nthe Constitution. I see our constitutional expert, the Senator from \nWest Virginia, on the floor. When I was Governor, I said on the floor \nmany times, nothing made me madder than when some Congressman or \nSenator would stand up with a big idea, pass it, hold a press \nconference taking credit for it, and send the bill to me. I would have \nto either raise tuition or cut this or change that, and then that same \nCongressman would be home making a big speech about local control the \nnext weekend.\n  I did not like that. It was called unfunded Federal mandates. I have \nalso stated many times on this floor that the Republican Congress got \nelected in 1994 running against these mandates. They stood on the steps \nof the Capitol in 1994 with Newt Gingrich. They said: No more unfunded \nmandates. If we break our promise, throw us out. Maybe that is one of \nthe reasons they did throw us out, because we forgot that promise.\n  We forget it with REAL ID because, according to the National \nGovernors Association, implementing it would cost $11 billion over 5 \nyears. The Department of Homeland Security itself expects the cost to \nreach $20 billion over 10 years.\n  Today, the Federal Government has appropriated only $40 million for \nthe States to comply with those mandates, even though it could cost $20 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  We are not supposed to be doing that. If we want to require it, we \nshould pay for it. My view of unfunded mandates is we ought to either \nfund REAL ID or we ought to repeal it. We should not require it unless \nwe are going to pay for it. I see the Chair, the distinguished former \nGovernor himself, the Senator from Nebraska. When I described how I \nfelt about unfunded mandates as Governor of Tennessee, I imagine he \nfelt exactly the same way. I have sought, working with Senators \nCollins, Warner, Voinovich, and Kyl, to identify a way to begin to deal \nwith this issue of the unfunded Federal mandate. That is where this \n$300 million amendment comes from.\n  The National Governors Association met last weekend. They issued the \nfollowing statement regarding REAL ID:\n\n       If Congress is truly committed to transforming REAL ID into \n     a reasonable and workable law that actually increases the \n     security of our citizens, it must commit the Federal funds \n     necessary to implement this Federal mandate. As the Senate \n     considers the Homeland Security appropriations bill for \n     fiscal year 2008, the Nation's Governors urge Senators to \n     support Senator Alexander's efforts to begin funding the \n     mandates imposed by REAL ID. States estimate the cost of REAL \n     ID will exceed $11 billion over 5 years, including $1 billion \n     in up-front costs merely to create systems and processes \n     necessary to implement the law and prepare to re-enroll all \n     245 million driver's license and identification cardholders. \n     To date Congress has appropriated only $40 million to assist \n     States.\n\n  I only have one more point to make. Then I will yield the floor and \nreserve the remainder of the time.\n  The chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the ranking member \nallowed me to discuss this and bring up this amendment during committee \ndeliberations. I thank them for that. I offered offsets from other \nfunds that States were receiving. A majority of the members of the \ncommittee didn't like the offsets. That is not so unusual in the world \nin which we live. My amendment was defeated in the Appropriations \nCommittee. I am coming to the floor with a different offset. It is 0.8 \npercent across the board cut in the rest of the bill. I know very well \nthat the chairman of the committee and the chairman of the subcommittee \nand other Senators don't like that offset, but I suggest to my \ncolleagues that there are others of us who don't like underfunded \nFederal mandates. If the Congress is going to impose on the States a \n$20 billion cost over 10 years, then we should pay for it. We have only \nappropriated $40 million.\n  As the Governors said, it is time for us to move ahead and \nappropriate $300 million this year, only a downpayment on what we \nshould pay, and if the offset we adopt today is not the one the \nchairman and others would prefer, then perhaps there is an opportunity \nduring conference on an this appropriations bill of $37.6 billion to \nmake that adjustment.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for giving me a chance to bring the \namendment to the floor. I will yield the floor and wait to see if \nSenator Collins or others decide to come. If they do not come, I will \nyield back the rest of my time except for 2 minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very able Senator from Tennessee\n\n[[Page S10080]]\n\nfor his amendment. It highlights another shortcoming in the President's \nbudget. When it comes to homeland security, the President--and I speak \nmost respectfully of the President; I always do--likes to rob Peter to \npay Paul. Regrettably, in an effort to help States deal with the cost \nof REAL ID, the able Senator proposes to do the same thing. The able \nSenator proposes to do the same thing by using an across-the-board cut. \nI don't like across-the-board cuts. That cuts into programs that hit a \nlot of people, all good people.\n  I rise to oppose the amendment. The President's budget fails to \naddress the mandate imposed on States by the REAL ID Act. According to \nthe National Governors Association, it will cost States $11 billion to \nimplement the REAL ID Act.\n  Yet the budget did not include one thin dime to help the States with \nthis Federal mandate. Meanwhile, the Department has let $35 million \nwhich Congress appropriated in 2006 for REAL ID implementation sit in \nthe Federal Treasury unspent for almost 2 years.\n  Let me say that again: The Department has let $35 million--that isn't \njust chickenfeed--which Congress appropriated in 2006 for REAL ID \nimplementation to sit in the Federal Treasury unspent for almost 2 \nyears. I share the concern of the Senator that this law, which was \njammed down Congress's throat in an unamendable war supplemental, will \nimpose serious costs on our States. However, given that there is $35 \nmillion still sitting at the Department and that we have no request \nfrom the White House, this bill is not the place to fix this problem.\n  This amendment would hamper the Department's ability to secure the \nNation. For example, this cut would result in the reduction of 416 \ntransportation security officers at the same time air travel has been \nincreasing approximately 3 percent each year and the TSO workforce has \ndecreased or stayed flat each year. It would also occur at a time when \nthe aviation sector is at a heightened alert status. Let me say that \nagain: It would also occur at a time when the aviation sector is at a \nheightened alert status. The Federal air marshals would reduce coverage \nof critical flights. The Coast Guard would be unable to respond to \nprojected search-and-rescue cases, thus endangering the lives of \ncitizens and property, interdict a projected increase in migrants, \nmarijuana, and cocaine, and remediate anticipated oil and chemical \nspills, further degrading our natural resources. This cut would delay \nthe recapitalization of the Coast Guard's fleet, further exacerbating \nmaritime and aviation operational gaps.\n  The President's budget requested--and the committee supports--funding \nfor 3,000 new Border Patrol agents. Furthermore, this reduction would \ncut that increase in agents to 24. Additionally, the National Guard \nforces currently supporting Operation Jump Start on the southwest \nborder assisting the Border Patrol will begin leaving the border this \nsummer. Once again, the Border Patrol will be forced to move agents \nback from the border to perform administrative duties.\n  Additionally, the committee's bill includes funding to support a \ntotal of 4,000 new detention beds, bringing total detention beds to \n31,500. Moreover, this reduction would cut that increase by 32 beds. \nAre you listening? Given that the average length of stay in a given \ndetention bed is approximately 40 days, losing 32 beds means we have \nlost the space to detain approximately 300 illegal aliens annually. Are \nyou still listening? We have spent the past 2 months debating \nimmigration reform and the need for detention beds. A cut like this \nturns that debate on its head.\n  The President's budget requested and the committee bill supports \nfunding of $1 billion--that is $1 for every minute since Jesus Christ \nwas born--for fencing infrastructure and technology along our still \nporous border.\n  If we have learned nothing during the debate on the immigration bill, \nit is that the American people and a majority of the Senate want to \nsecure our borders. Let me say that again: If we have learned nothing \nduring the debate on the immigration bill, it is that the American \npeople and a majority of the Senate want to secure our borders. A cut \nlike this moves us in the exact opposite direction. First responders' \nState formula grants would be cut below the fiscal year 2007 enacted \nlevel; ironically, the level approved under a Republican-controlled \nCongress.\n  The practical implication of this will be: First responders will go \nwithout up-to-date personal protective equipment; fewer critical \ninfrastructure facilities, including chemical and nuclear, will have a \nsecurity buffer zone; public transportation, a known target by \nterrorists overseas, will be less secure.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thought the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee made a very compelling argument about this amendment, which \nhe has offered. We have heard him discuss his ideas on federalism, and \nthere is no better proponent of clear thinking on that issue than the \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  But what occurred to me when I was sitting here is that I have heard \nsome of these arguments before. I started thinking back to the hearings \nthat were held and the markup sessions that were held in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the committee of legislative \njurisdiction, when the Department of Homeland Security was being \ncreated by Congress to more effectively--with a better Federal \norganization of talent and wherewithal--cope with the challenges from \nthreats to the security of our homeland. Many of these issues were \ndiscussed in great detail.\n  I remember the Senator from Connecticut, in particular, Mr. \nLieberman, being in a position of leadership on the committee at that \ntime. We had other talented Senators working on that authorizing \nlegislation.\n  What is happening to us, I am afraid, is as we get about the business \nof implementing the changes in our laws that were made by the creation \nof this new Department, and the creation of new agencies to implement \nand carry out these responsibilities in a coherent way--the \npolicymakers have their guidance from that legislation, but we now here \nare considering an appropriations bill. We are not at a point where we \nare going back and reviewing in an oversight hearing or in a \nconsideration of changes that ought to be made in the law. We are \nappropriating the funds to give to the Department and the agencies that \nwere created and given these responsibilities.\n  So to come in now with an amendment--and I hate to argue against this \namendment because the eloquent argument on its behalf was very \nimpressive, but this is the wrong vehicle and this is not the right way \nto deal with the problem. If we have made an error in requiring too \nexpensive, too stringent, too illogical, unworkable requirements or \nlaws, let's change them. Let's change them. But let's not try in an \nAppropriations Committee to halfway fund our needs. We do not have the \nmoney to pay for this program. That was pointed out very clearly.\n  The REAL ID program is hugely expensive, and at some time there will \nbe a day of reckoning. Maybe we are fast getting there. We have heard \nthe warnings. I think we should heed the warnings and urge the \nlegislative committee to think about modifying the authorities and the \ndirectives that are contained in the law--make it affordable, for one \nthing; decide, are State and local governments going to share the \nresponsibility for these costs or is the Federal Government going to \nbuild up a huge Federal deficit trying to pay for the costs on an \nannual basis through the annual appropriations bills.\n  Well, anyway, as my law school dean used to say, it is not a horse \nthat is soon curried. This is something that is going to take some time \nand effort, and we need to rise to the challenge the Senator from \nTennessee presents to us and come up with a more thoughtful and \nworkable and affordable way to deal with this issue.\n  So I am going to oppose the amendment because I think it should be \ndone legislatively, and the problem cannot be solved with adding money \nand adding new language which is legislative in nature. I hope the \nSenate will carefully review the options we have and try to do the \nresponsible thing.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the REAL ID Act was legislation forced \nthrough Congress as an add-on to the emergency supplemental bill passed \nin May 2005, without any Senate hearings\n\n[[Page S10081]]\n\nor debate, but the implications of the Act are enormous. In addition to \nnumerous privacy and civil liberties concerns, REAL ID is an unfunded \nmandate that could cost the States in excess of $23 billion.\n  As hearings in the Judiciary Committee and Homeland Security and \nGovernment Affairs Committee have shown, REAL ID is far from being \nready for primetime. In fact, the Department of Homeland Security has \nnot even released final regulations directing the States on REAL ID \nimplementation. With 260 million drivers in this country, I do not see \nhow we could have the massive national databases required by REAL ID up \nand running in the next 5 years--much less in fiscal year 2008.\n  On top of that, even though they are not even in production yet, REAL \nID cards are rapidly becoming a de facto national ID card since they \nwill be needed to enter courthouses, airports, Federal buildings, and \nnow workplaces all across the country. In my opinion, REAL ID raises \nmultiple constitutional issues whose legal challenges could delay final \nimplementation for years, and we should not support the Alexander-\nCollins amendment.\n  In May, the Department of Homeland Security Data Privacy and \nIntegrity Advisory Committee expressed concern over several items in \nthe REAL ID proposed regulations and said that they pose serious risks \nto individual privacy by: failing to establish a standard for \nprotecting the storage of personally identifiable information; failing \nto provide methods for Americans to inquire or complain about the \ncollection, storage, and use of personal information and remedy errors; \nfailing to require notifying consumers of information collection and \nuse by the State; failing to require that individuals have a choice \nover secondary use of that information; and failing to assure that the \ninformation collected for a specific purpose is used only for that \npurpose.\n  Congress should not fund the REAL ID program until the Department of \nHomeland Security makes fundamental reforms to the program and stops \nforcing such onerous provisions on the States. In addition, with this \namendment offset by an across-the-board cut from all DHS programs, I \ndon't think we should be robbing from other critical Homeland Security \naccounts--where we have seen real gains in securing our country--to pay \nfor just 1 percent of the floundering REAL ID program.\n  REAL ID is not popular in our States, and opposition spans the \npolitical spectrum, from the right to the left. A large number of \nStates have expressed concerns with the mandates of the REAL ID Act by \nenacting bills and resolutions in opposition.\n  Seventeen States have enacted statutes or resolutions against REAL \nID, including Hawaii, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Montana, North Dakota, \nColorado, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois, New Hampshire, Maine, \nArkansas, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina.\n  Washington, Georgia, Oklahoma, Montana, South Carolina, New \nHampshire, and Maine have gone so far as to indicate that they intend \nto refuse to comply with REAL ID.\n  Ten States have had statutes or resolutions pass one chamber of their \nlegislature, including Oregon, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Wyoming, \nMinnesota, Louisiana, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n  Another 10 States have had statutes or resolutions introduced in \ntheir legislatures, including Alaska, Texas, Wisconsin, Michigan, \nKentucky, Ohio, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Maryland.\n  The reaction to the numerous privacy concerns and unfunded mandates \nof the REAL ID Act is a good example of what happens when the Federal \nGovernment imposes itself rather than working with the States to build \ncooperation and partnership. Since so many States have risen up in \nopposition to REAL ID, we should not fund this failed program, and I \nurge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I know Senator Collins, Senator \nVoinovich, Senator Warner, and Senator Kyl--all cosponsors of the \nbill--had hoped to speak, but I am not sure any of them are able to \ncome now, so I wish to reserve 2 minutes prior to the vote, but other \nthan that, I say to the managers and to the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee that on this side we are ready to go forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we do have one other Senator who wants to \ncome and speak on this amendment. I think he will be here shortly.\n  If there are no other Senators who want to speak at the moment, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time \nbe charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, so everyone knows what is happening, \nSenator Tester is going to be here in a minute to speak for several \nminutes. Senator Alexander has a few minutes remaining. At the end of \nthat time, we will be moving to a vote on the underlying amendment, so \nI hope all Senators are close by the floor.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Montana is in the Chamber and I \nask him how much time he is going to use.\n  I believe the Senator from Montana will be using 5 minutes. Senator \nAlexander will be using a few. So a vote will be imminent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nAlexander amendment. It is a bad idea. The amendment would take away \n$300 million from port security, rail security, and all the grant \nprograms that fund the first responders in each of our home States. It \nwould rob the Border Patrol, Customs Enforcement, and the Coast Guard \nof the resources they need to keep our Nation safe. It would be robbing \nPeter to pay Paul.\n  The amendment would take $300 million and give it to departments of \nmotor vehicles. Let me say that again. This amendment takes funds off \nthe border, and gives funds to departments of motor vehicles. That is \nbecause the REAL ID Act will require every citizen to obtain a new \ndriver's license from your State. To do that, you will need a birth \ncertificate, your Social Security card, and some way of verifying your \ncurrent address. It applies to everyone.\n  It will require States to reissue more than 245 million driver's \nlicenses--let me say that again. It will require States to reissue more \nthan 245 million driver's licenses--only after certifying that the \nperson requesting the document is an American citizen or in the country \nlegally. States are also being asked to build a whole new set of \ndatabases and other information technology to link up with the Federal \ndatabase and with other States.\n  All in all, the national ID system will cost $23 billion--with a \n``B''--$23 billion for the States to implement, and we are going to \ntake away $300 million from port security and rail security and first \nresponders in our home States and think that is going to make a \ndifference.\n  This amendment would only provide 1.3 percent of that $23 billion \ncost. That does nothing to help the States. In fact, it is an afront to \nthem to say ``we hear your complaints,'' and then provide them with a \n1-percent solution.\n  Beyond the funding issues this amendment creates, endorsing REAL ID \nwould be a real mistake. The REAL ID Act puts massive new Federal \nregulations on the States. From new databases and fraud monitoring, to \nnew network and data storage capacity, the States will be tasked with \nan enormous range of new regulations and new requirements.\n  Once REAL ID becomes effective, every State's department of motor \nvehicles will have to play immigration official. DMV workers will be \ntasked with reconciling discrepancies in Social Security numbers with \nthe Social Security Administration. Departments of motor vehicles will \nhave to require proof of ``legal presence'' in the United States from \nimmigrants.\n  REAL ID also creates enormous privacy concerns. REAL ID is a national\n\n[[Page S10082]]\n\nID card. Make no mistake about that. Every citizen who wants to get on \na plane, who wants to enter a Federal building, and, possibly, who even \nwants to get a job will have to be a part of it. We should not be \nfunding something such as that without a real debate in Congress about \nthe wisdom of such a program.\n  One month ago, 52 Senators voted to prohibit the expansion of REAL ID \nin the immigration bill. I hope we do not retreat from that progress by \nsuddenly agreeing to this amendment to fund--at a 1-percent level--REAL \nID. The way to improve our country's homeland security is not by \noutsourcing it to the States' Department of Motor Vehicles. Our \nsecurity is improved by hiring more border agents, strengthening \nCustoms and the Coast Guard, and ensuring local law enforcement has the \ntools they need to prepare for and respond to terrorist threats.\n\n  This amendment sets the wrong priorities for homeland security, and I \nurge its defeat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if I might ask the managers of the \nbill, if I am not mistaken, after my 2 minutes, we can proceed to a \nvote?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator repeat his request?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I am not mistaken, after the 2 minutes I have, we \nmay proceed to a vote?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct. He can speak for 2 minutes, and I will \nthen make a motion at the end of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I agreed with the last half of the \nSenator from Montana's statement, but the first half was an eloquent \nargument for a $20 billion unfunded mandate for the States of Montana \nand Nebraska and Tennessee and everybody else. If we are going pass it, \nwe ought to fund it. And if we are not going to fund it, we ought to \nrepeal it. That is my position.\n  We passed the law in 1995, the Federal Unfunded Mandate Act, but the \nREAL ID program imposes on the States, according to the Department of \nHomeland Security, an up to $20 billion unfunded mandate. It will \nrequire up to 245 million of us to go in and prove we are lawfully here \nand stand in line at our driver's license offices. Seventeen States \nhave said they don't like it, including mine.\n  The National Governors Association meeting in Traverse City, MI, last \nweek generated a letter to all of us saying: If you are going to \nrequire it, fund it. That is what we are beginning to do.\n  If you think the passport backlog is a big problem, wait until the \ndriver's license backlog comes if we don't properly fund REAL ID or \nrepeal it. There will be weddings. There will be vacations. There will \nbe honeymoons. There will be trips. But there will be work days messed \nup. There will be a lot of mad Americans, and rightly so.\n  So this amendment would make a small installment payment of $300 \nmillion for the REAL ID program we imposed on the States. Surely the \nconference can find, in a $37.6 billion bill, $300 million to do what \nwe are supposed to do. If we require it, we should fund it. The \nRepublican Congressmen were right in 1994 when they said it, and if we \ncan't remember that, they should throw us out.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on behalf of myself, Senator Collins, Senator \nWarner, Senator Kyl, and Senator Voinovich, the cosponsors of this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback), the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Coleman), \nand the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. \nColeman) would have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar).

Madam President, on rollcall 279, I voted ``nay.'' It was \nmy intention to vote ``yea.'' I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to change my vote. It will not affect the outcome of the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I came in at the end of the vote \nintending to vote against Senator Alexander's amendment and did not \nlook close enough. It was actually a tabling motion. So I would not \nwant to vote to table Senator Alexander's amendment.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 279, I voted ``nay.'' \nIt was my intention to vote ``yea.'' Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be allowed to change my vote since it will not affect the \noutcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above orders.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Rule XVI\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me make one additional point I did \nnot make earlier in the discussion in the Senate, and I think it is an \nimportant point to make.\n  There was a suggestion on the floor of the Senate by a Senator \nearlier that rule XVI has been applied in this Senate in a manner that \nwas unfair. That is simply not the case. Every Senator has the right to \nraise the issue of rule XVI if someone is trying to legislate on an \nappropriations bill. It was done, as another Senator suggested, with \nrespect to Senator Graham; it was done with respect to something they \noffered on the floor. Everyone has that right.\n  But let me make this point: It is not unusual to legislate on an \nappropriations bill in circumstances where what is being done is \nsomething that is done almost by unanimous consent, a provision that \neveryone agrees with, a provision that is noncontroversial. That is\n\n[[Page S10083]]\n\nnot unusual at all. That happens all the time.\n  Now, I am frankly surprised there is anyone in this Chamber who would \ndisagree with the proposition that we ought to get quarterly \nclassified, top-secret reports on what is happening to try to eliminate \nthe al-Qaida leadership that apparently is now in a safe haven in the \ntribal area of Pakistan. I didn't expect that to be controversial. I \ndidn't expect there would be one person in this Senate who would \ndisagree with that. But, apparently, there is. He has that right. But \nit is an unfortunate circumstance that we had a situation that allows, \nor a situation that persuades someone to stand up on the floor and say \nthere is a double standard on rule XVI. There is no double standard. \nThere is not one person in the Senate who believes that, outside of the \nperson who said that. There is no double standard. The standard is \napplied in exactly the same way to every Senator.\n  What is unusual to me is objecting to the standard of allowing what \nnormally would be uncontroversial, or noncontroversial provisions--\nincluding this one, saying it ought to be our top priority to eliminate \nthe leaders of al-Qaida, and that the Administration should give \nCongress quarterly reports on what is being done to address the \ngreatest terrorist threat to our country. I am flabbergasted. I am \nenormously surprised that would be controversial with anyone in the \nSenate. I would expect 100 Senators would agree with that proposition, \nbut one, apparently, does not.\n  So we will have that debate again. We will have the debate at another \ntime. As I said earlier, we have already added the same amendment to \nthe Defense authorization bill. That was an amendable bill. That bill \nhas been taken from the floor at this point, but I assume it will come \nback.\n  I did wish to make the point on behalf of every Senator, except the \nperson who said this, that there is no double standard on rule XVI. \nThose who suggest that, profoundly misunderstand, apparently, the rules \nof the Senate. But there should not be a misunderstanding in this \nSenate about the urgency of at least 99 Members of the Senate wanting \nto go after and eliminate the leadership of al-Qaida. I would hope that \nwould represent everyone's determination.\n  Al-Qaida is the terrorist organization that represents the greatest \nterrorist threat to this country, right now, according to the National \nIntelligence Estimate; and al-Qaida and its leaders are the ones who \nboasted about murdering 3,000 or more innocent Americans on 9/11/2001.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, what is the pending business? Madam \nPresident, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the Grassley amendment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2444, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Grassley amendment, No. 2444, is the pending \namendment. I understand that there is a modification at the desk. Is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The amendment (No. 2444), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 69, after line 24, insert the following:\n       Sec. 536.  None of the funds made available to the Office \n     of the Secretary and Executive Management under this Act may \n     be expended for any new hires by the Department of Homeland \n     Security that are not verified through the basic pilot \n     program required under section 401 of the Illegal Immigration \n     Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. \n     1324a note).\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I believe that amendment is agreed to \nat this time, as modified.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, this amendment has been reviewed. We \nhave no objection to proceeding to consider the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2444), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2416 Withdrawn\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, am I correct under regular order the \npending amendment is now Schumer amendment No. 2416?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \nSchumer amendment No. 2416 that is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2461, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I understand now under regular order \nthe next pending amendment is Schumer amendment No. 2461, and there is \na modification at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, we have talked with the minority. I do \nbelieve this amendment, as well, is agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, there is no objection to proceeding to \nconsider that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2461), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 19, line 26, strike ``$524,515,000'' and insert \n     ``$521,515,000''.\n       On page 18, line 2, strike ``$5,039,559,000'' and insert \n     ``$5,042,559,000''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2447\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, under regular order the next amendment \nis Schumer amendment No. 2447. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I believe that amendment also has been agreed to on both \nsides.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, we have no objection to proceeding to \nconsider the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2447) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2462\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, under regular order is the next item of \nbusiness the Dole amendment, No. 2462?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, at this time we are hoping Senator Dole \ncan be on the Senate floor. We are working our way through these \namendments really well at this point. We do have a number of Senators \nwho have their amendments in order. I advise all of them to stay close \nby the floor. We are trying to work our way through them. As soon as \nSenator Dole arrives on the floor, we will try to work out an agreement \nwith her and hopefully move forward.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2476 Withdrawn\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendment No. \n2476.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2497\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President. I have an amendment that I will offer at \nthe appropriate time.\n  Madam President, in this technological age of vehicle barriers, \nground-\n\n[[Page S10084]]\n\nbased radar, camera towers, and unmanned aerial vehicles, I am pleased \nto note that the U.S. Border Patrol still guards America's southwest \nborder in a timeless and very American manner, on horseback.\n  Unfortunately, sometimes these horses are injured or simply are no \nlonger fit for such rigorous service. When that happens, the Border \nPatrol must make the decision to either put the horse out to pasture, \nor, in some cases, as the only humane option, to relieve the poor \nanimal's suffering and put it to sleep. Before that happens, my \namendment would ensure that the Border Patrol provides the trainer or \nhandler of the horse with an opportunity to adopt it.\n  This is a very simple amendment. The Bureau of Land Management within \nthe Department of the Interior already has a horse adoption program, \nwhich I encourage the Border Patrol to use as a model for creating its \nown program. My amendment would also ensure that such an adoption \nprogram includes appropriate safeguards to ensure that a horse, once \nadopted, is not sold for slaughter or treated inhumanely. This \namendment would make 20 horses available for adoption per year within \nthe Homeland Security Department. It is the humane and decent thing to \ndo for these noble animals which help to secure our borders and keep \nour citizens safe.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment when it is offered later today.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise today to praise the work of \nSenator Byrd, Senator Inouye, Senator Cochran, Senator Stevens, Senator \nMurray, and the entire Appropriations Committee for the work they have \ndone on the Homeland Security Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008. \nThis is a strong bill. It is an essential bill to protect our homeland.\n  Our foremost duty here in the Congress is to make sure we are \nprotecting America, and this bill is a significant step in the right \ndirection. I agree with Senator Byrd and the majority leader that this \nmust be the first appropriations bill for this fiscal year and that we \nmust pass it this year. I hope we will pass it later today.\n  A government's primary responsibility is in the protection of the \nhomeland and keeping its citizens safe from attack. This bill will help \nus secure our borders, train and support our first responders, prevent \nthe transport of nuclear materials, and strengthen our defenses against \nterrorists.\n  We need not look far to understand the threats that face this \ncountry. September 11 brought the specter of terrorism to the front \ndoor of America. September 11 illustrated tragically and horribly the \ngreat threat extremist groups can pose to the United States. But \nSeptember 11 is not the only terrorist attack we or our allies have \nendured in recent times. In 2002, a bomb in Bali killed 202 people and \nwounded 209. In 2004, bombs on trains in Madrid killed 191 people and \nwounded over 2,000. In 2005, attacks on London's Underground killed 52 \ncommuters and injured 700. The list goes on and on.\n  The State Department reports that the number of incidents of \nterrorism worldwide has grown dramatically in recent years. Between \n2005 and 2006, the number of incidents rose from 11,000 to over 14,000. \nThree-fourths of these incidents resulted in death, injury, or \nkidnapping. All told, terrorism claimed the lives of more than 74,000 \npeople around the world last year.\n  Americans today know that they are not immune from attack. We know \nAmerica is not immune from attack. We also know violent extremism is \nposing a growing threat to our society and to that of our allies. \nAmericans expect their Government to respond to these threats with \nadequate resources, sound policies, and strong leadership.\n  Unfortunately, our homeland is not as secure as it should be. A \nrecent survey revealed that national security experts on both sides of \nthe aisle agree that we have not come as far as we should have over the \nlast 6 years. They agree that the Department of Homeland Security is \nunderperforming. They agree that intelligence reform has not been \neffective. And they agree that too few resources are being allocated to \nthe defense of our homeland and our Nation.\n  The reports of holes in America's armor, from inadequate rail \nsecurity to insufficient funding for screening at ports, along with the \nGovernment's recent record of failed responses to national disasters, \nsuch as the bungled leadership of Hurricane Katrina to a lack of \nNational Guard equipment when a tornado tore through the State of \nKansas--those incidents underline the urgency of passing a strong and \nsmart bill that funds our homeland security.\n  I wish to briefly describe three ways in which the additional funding \nin this bill is vital for our security.\n  First, the funding levels allow us to improve security at the border \nand to enforce our immigration laws. Just a few weeks ago, during our \nimmigration debate on this floor, we all agreed that we must get \ncontrol of our border and know who is coming into this country. Now it \nis time for us to walk the walk. The bill before us would allow us to \nhire additional Border Patrol agents to protect our borders. It also \nincludes funds for additional border fencing, infrastructure, and \ntechnology to monitor the vast open spaces we need to monitor and \ncontrol. It also provides an additional $475 million for enforcement of \ncustoms and immigration laws within the United States. Our Nation is \nand must be a nation of laws.\n  Second, I am proud that this bill supports our first responders--the \nfirefighters, peace officers, nurses, and volunteers who rush in when \nothers rush out. They serve us by devoting their time, their skills, \ntheir courage, and oftentimes their lives. We owe them the tools and \nresources they need to do their jobs. The bill before us provides money \nfor State and local emergency preparedness programs, money for \nfirefighter assistance grants in this program and funds for emergency \nperformance grants.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill restores funds to our first \nresponder and State training programs for law enforcement and \nfirefighter operations that the President had proposed to cut. This \nbill, however, funds these provisions, and that includes $525 million \nfor the State Homeland Security Grant Program, $375 million for law \nenforcement and terrorism prevention grants, $560 million for \nfirefighter equipment grants, and $140 million to hire firefighters.\n  I wish also to note that the bill makes a serious investment in the \nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center, the crown jewel of training \ncenters for the law enforcement community. A bipartisan group of us \nadded a provision to the 9/11 Commission bill to create the Rural \nPolicing Institute at FLETC to address the particular law enforcement \nneeds of rural America. This was a need that I saw. It was very clear \nto me as attorney general for Colorado. The rural sheriffs and peace \nofficers whom I spoke with during all of the time that I was attorney \ngeneral and in crafting the Rural Policing Institute legislation agreed \nthat the Rural Police Institute would be a valuable addition to FLETC.\n  The $220 million in this bill for FLETC will help ensure that our \npeace officers continue to get the highest level of training they need \nas we deal with the reality we find in the post-9/11 world. It is going \nto be the eyes and ears and skills of the nearly 800,000 peace officers \nof America who will protect our homeland from the vicious kinds of \nattacks we saw in New York on 9/11, the vicious kinds of attacks that \ntook 150-plus lives in Oklahoma City some years ago. So we must do \neverything we can to support our men and women who are in law \nenforcement at both the local and State level. This legislation does \nthat.\n\n  Finally, in addition to providing better protection along our borders \nand ports and more tools for law enforcement and first responders, this \nbill helps us to prepare to recover from an attack or a disaster.\n  FEMA's response to Hurricane Katrina sounded the alarm bells for all \nof us. Unfortunately, not everyone seems to have heard them. Not only\n\n[[Page S10085]]\n\ndoes FEMA need better leadership and serious Congressional oversight, \nbut it now needs the resources to do this job. The bill before us would \nprovide $6.9 billion for emergency preparedness and response activity. \nThat is a significant amount of additional money beyond what the \nPresident requested. Almost half of those dollars would go out to \nStates and local preparedness programs.\n  Once again, I wish to reiterate my appreciation for the bipartisan \nleadership which Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran, Senator Murray, \nSenator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and the other members of the \nAppropriations Committee have shown on this bill.\n  It is right that this is the first appropriations bill that we \nconsider because our homeland security must come first before \neverything else. The threat of attack on our soil is as great as it \never has been, and this bill is an important step toward ensuring \nAmerica's first responders have the tools and the equipment and \ntraining they need to keep America safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I rise to compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado. In his statement, he is right on when he is \ntalking about the fact that there is no other bill we have pending in \nthe Senate that is more important than the bill we are considering here \ntoday, the funding of the Department of Homeland Security and the \nagencies which are charged with the responsibility of carrying out the \nauthorizations that have been passed earlier creating the Department \nfollowing the 9/11 attacks on our country.\n  This is serious business. I compliment the Senator on the manner in \nwhich he is carrying out his duties as a new member of this body--\nrelatively new member. He has important committee assignments, and we \nappreciate the commitment he has shown during consideration of this \nbill and the discussion of amendments and the offering of amendments to \ntry to help make sure that the work product we produce is the best we \ncan produce for our great country and our homeland.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the current \namendment be set aside and I be permitted to speak on two amendments \nthat I will call up, intend to speak on, and then ask that they be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2503 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I call up amendment 2503 and ask that Senators Kyl and \nGraham be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Martinez], for himself, Mr. \n     Kyl, and Mr. Graham, proposes an amendment numbered 2503 to \n     amendment No. 2383.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the issuance and use of social security cards with \nbiometric identifiers for the establishment of employment authorization \n                             and identity)\n\n       On page 69, after line 24, add the following:\n       Sec. 536.

I ask unanimous consent that Senators Kyl and Graham be \nadded as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. In the course of the immigration debate, it became \nclear that one of the issues about interior enforcement that was so \ndifficult for us to get our arms around was the issue of identifying \nwho was here. It was the issue of duplicative Social Security numbers \nand cards and the ease with which those intent upon breaking the law \ncould fraudulently create a Social Security card. It seems to me the \ntime\n\n[[Page S10086]]\n\nhas come for us to consider a biometric Social Security card. It would \nbe a Social Security card that would fix this problem for interior \nenforcement and one that would be a foundational step toward having the \nkind of serious interior enforcement the American people want.\n  One of the things we heard over and over is, why don't we enforce the \ncurrent law. The reason we cannot enforce current law is because there \nisn't a national way in which we can identify who is here legally and \nwho is not when they apply for a job. It isn't fair to put employers in \na position of employing someone about whom they may wonder whether they \nare here legally but that they wouldn't know because there is no \nverifiable way of finding out. They also would have no way of knowing \nwhether in fact the card they were being presented was a real one or a \nfraud.\n  It would make substantial steps in securing and improving the \nemployee verification system. This amendment would allow employers and \nemployees alike to be sure their employment was lawful. It would \nprovide a card with a photograph of every lawful guest worker, \npermanent resident or citizen that matches up with a photograph on file \nwith the Social Security Administration or the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. It would also allow for phasing in this new card over a \nperiod of 10 years, upon which only biometric Social Security cards or \na U.S. passport or green card would be valid for employment \nauthorization purposes. It does not affect the use of driver's licenses \nfor establishing identity. It does not become a national ID card. \nRather, this amendment only addresses the use of the Social Security \ncard which we already use and sets standards to protect against the use \nof fake Social Security cards. No lawful American or foreign visitor \nshould have any legitimate concern. A new biometric card will go a long \nway toward ensuring that documents used for employment authorization \nare secure and fraud resistant. This card would help weed out \nfraudulent documents currently in circulation supporting illegal \nemployment in our country.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2503 Withdrawn\n\n  My understanding is this amendment, if offered today, would be \nsubject to a rule XVI. It does in fact attempt to legislate and \nattempts to correct a serious problem we face in the country today.\n  At this time I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2413 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I call up amendment No. 2413.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Martinez] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2413 to amendment No. 2383.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require that all funds for State and local programs be \n                        allocated based on risk)\n\n       On page 35, line 20, strike ``which shall'' and all that \n     follows through ``3714):'' on line 26 and insert the \n     following: ``which shall be allocated based solely on an \n     assessment of risk (as determined by the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security) as follows:\n       ``(1) $900,000,000 for grants to States, of which \n     $375,000,000 shall be for law enforcement terrorism \n     prevention grants:''.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. This is an amendment in which the senior Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Nelson, joins as a cosponsor. It is one that is \ntremendously important to make sure we have the best security for our \nNation we can possibly have. The concept of this amendment is \nstraightforward. It directs Homeland Security dollars to areas where \nthe threat of attack by terrorists is the greatest.\n  It was no accident that when the terrorists attacked our Nation on \nSeptember 11, they picked powerful, high-profile and heavily trafficked \ntargets. Terrorists target areas where they can inflict the most damage \nand get the most attention. For those reasons, they focus on urban \nareas and areas of national importance or those that are, naturally, \nhighly populated. One of the things that often gets overlooked is when \nyou look at only the population in a certain place, oftentimes we \noverlook places such as Florida. In Florida, we have 70 million people \nfrom all over the world and certainly from all over the United States \nwho visit as tourists. During any given day there are hundreds of \nthousands of tourists all over the State of Florida. This only adds to \nthe population of our State at any given point in time.\n  On March 18, 2003, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed a no-\nfly zone over the Walt Disney world resort area because, according to \nthe FAA, the Disney parks are a potential target of symbolic value. In \na similar instance, Port Everglades in Broward County actually has more \npassengers, freight, and people moving through it than even the port of \nMiami. All of the cruise ships, tankers, and shipping traffic out of \nthe Miami area actually sail from Broward County. These examples \nhighlight the issues associated with regional influx. They underscore \nthe need for additional security resources.\n  The whole State of Florida, in fact, now plays host to 77 million \ntourists a year. That is on top of the 17 million persons who call \nFlorida home. We cannot overstate the importance of regional concepts \nand that models created by this amendment will encourage funding to be \nspent not only on our major cities but also on those regional centers \nthat require by their nature special protections. On this issue, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff has weighed in with a \nconsistent message.\n  In a letter the Secretary says:\n\n       Funding our first responders based on risk and need gives \n     us the flexibility to ensure our finite resources are \n     allocated in a prioritized and objective manner. The \n     Department of Homeland Security strongly supports \n     authorization language that would distribute Federal homeland \n     security grant funds based on risk and need, rather than on \n     static and arbitrary minimums.\n\n  At this time I do not intend to pursue this amendment and would in a \nmoment ask that it be withdrawn. My understanding is that the 9/11 \nbill, the bill that gives life to many of the recommendations of the 9/\n11 Commission, is going to be accepted or is going to be voted on and \naccepted by the Senate. In that bill there will be a much better \ndistribution of dollars in a way that is more in keeping with the risks \nour Nation faces.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2413 Withdrawn\n\n  With that in mind, I will at this time ask that the amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2404\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I wish to take an additional moment to speak about \namendment 2404 which will be considered later today.\n  Many other countries, including Israel, Canada, Japan, the United \nKingdom, and the Netherlands, have successfully demonstrated how an \ninternational registered traveler program can work to ensure security, \nfocus attention on lesser known travelers, and provide a smoother and \nmore predictable travel schedule for repeat travelers. Amendment No \n2404 attempts to create an international registered travelers program.\n  This amendment would authorize the Department of Homeland Security to \nestablish an international registered traveler program to expedite the \ninspection of frequent U.S. and international travelers arriving by air \ninto the United States.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security is accordingly authorized to \nimpose a reasonable fee to cover the costs associated with establishing \nand maintaining such an expedited inspection process and is tasked to \ncoordinate such a program with the Department of State.\n  The Transportation Security Administration and private industry \ndeveloped the Registered Traveler program here in the U.S. to provide \nexpedited security screening for passengers who volunteer to undergo a \nTSA-conducted security threat assessment in order to confirm that they \ndo not pose or are not suspected of posing a threat to transportation \nor national security. It has been quite successful. I believe this is \nsomething that can work.\n  If we can create an international version, it will go a long way in \nhelping to develop more strategic ties with our allies abroad and show \nopenness to investment and travel in America.\n\n[[Page S10087]]\n\n  We fight all the time for travelers who have options to travel \nanywhere in the world to come to our country to be tourists. Certainly \ntourism areas in our country such as Florida, but like many others, \nWashington, DC, New York City, many national parks out West, many of \nthe beautiful areas of our States are natural attractions for foreign \ntravelers. But the foreign traveling public has options of where to go. \nPart of the decisionmaking process is cost and ease of traveling. I \nbelieve this is a well-thought-out amendment which will enhance our \nnational security while at the same time allowing travelers to more \neasily find their way to our country in order to enhance the travel and \ntourism industry, which is of great importance in terms of our own \ntourism dollars, which keep many Americans employed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for no longer than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Craig are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe the pending amendment is the \nDole amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a second-degree \namendment to the Dole amendment, No. 2442.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this second-degree amendment is a modest \nbut important amendment. It would ensure that $2.5 million of the $51 \nmillion in this bill that is set aside for 287(g) training--and I will \nexplain 287(g) training, but it is basically training of State and \nlocal law enforcement officers by Federal officials so that they can be \nof assistance to Federal officials----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator suspend a moment. The \nParliamentarians are having a discussion about this amendment, which \nmay be helpful.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I withdraw the second-degree amendment \nthat I offered earlier, recognizing that there is some parliamentary \nquestion about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, what I believe we should do, and the \npurpose of the amendment that I offered and am hoping we will be able \nto get accepted in some fashion, is modest, but it is an important \nstep. It will require that $51 million be set aside in the underlying \nbill that is before us today for section 287(g) training; that is, \ntraining State and local law enforcement officers to be of assistance \nto Federal immigration officers, and that $2.5 million of the $51 \nmillion could be used to reimburse State and local training expenses.\n  Now, there are 65 pending training agreements out there right now, \nsome of which are being executed and some of which are waiting to be \nexecuted. I would like to explain why I think this is important, fair, \nand commonsensical. It is something we should do.\n  Section 133 of the Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility \nAct of 1996 is codified as section 287(g), the Immigration and \nNationality Act, the INA, and it has commonly been known as the 287(g) \nprogram. Under this program, States and localities can ask the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to enter into a memorandum of \nunderstanding. That is like a treaty between the State and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. They enter into these agreements.\n  The Presiding Officer, as a former U.S. attorney, knows how these \nMOUs are. They enter into these agreements, and the agreements \nessentially provide that their local law enforcement officers be cross-\ntrained to work with Customs enforcement.\n  The program clearly has not expanded at the pace we originally \nenvisioned, but the tide is beginning to turn as to these issues and \nhow we deal with the problem of illegal aliens. So today the number of \nillegal aliens in the United States is a staggering number. It is \nestimated at between 10 million to 12 million, with another estimated \n800,000 arriving in our country each year. Last year, we arrested over \n1 million.\n  One solution to address the problem is to increase partnerships \nbetween Federal immigration authorities and State and local authorities \nthrough such programs as the 287(g) program. It is something I know a \nlittle bit about. I was a U.S. attorney in Alabama for 12 years. I was \nattorney general for 2 years, and I traveled around the State and met \nwith local law enforcement officers as attorney general and as U.S. \nattorney. Since I have become a Senator, I have asked them about how \nthings work if they apprehend somebody they believe to be illegally in \nour country.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what they tell me without virtually any \nexception, except as we are seeing through this 287(g) program. But, \nfundamentally, what they have been telling me is they let them go. That \nis not just true in Alabama; it is true all over America. Local law \nenforcement officials who apprehend people they have every reason to \nbelieve--maybe absolute proof--that they are here illegally routinely \nare allowing the people they apprehend--maybe it is DUI, maybe it is \nfor an accident or whatever, a domestic dispute--whatever it is, they \nare letting them go because somehow they have gotten the message that \nnobody will come and pick them up, and they don't know how to do it or \nwho to call and what the processes are. That is what the 287(g) program \nis designed to deal with.\n  Now, it has been odd to me since I have sought to do something about \nthis for quite some time, well before the comprehensive immigration \nreform bill was introduced in this Senate over a number of years ago to \ndeal with it, there is always an objection. It was out of that \nobjection that I made the comment one time that people will vote for \nany kind of immigration reform, as long as it is a reform that would \nnot work. If you produce something that will actually work and actually \nhelp the system get better and more lawful, somebody objects. It \nbecomes a big deal. So I think this is a commonsensical thing.\n  Our State and local officers are in the best position on a daily \nbasis to come in contact with those unlawfully present here. We don't \nhave Federal ICE agents, immigration agents throughout the country. \nBorder Patrol people are just on the border. If you can get past the \nborder--and that is one of the attractions of trying to get past the \nborder--if you can get past it, you have a pretty good chance of being \nhome free for some time.\n  I think we have about 5,000 Federal ICE immigration agents inside our \ncountry, but only about 2,000 of those are actively involved in \nenforcement operations. We have 600,000 to 800,000 State and local law \nenforcement officers, sheriffs, police officers, State troopers. They \nare out there on the roads every day.\n  Now, this bill and the training it provides on a 287(g) does not \ntrain and does not ask that the State and local officers do anything \nthey don't want to do. They will not be compelled to participate in \nanything they choose not to participate in. It is a voluntary \nparticipation agreement. They are not called upon to participate in \nconducting raids to try to identify and find people who might be here \nillegally. Our goal would be to provide a situation in which they could \nassist the ICE officers during the course of their ordinary duties. If \nthey come upon someone likely to be an illegal alien, they would take \nthe proper steps, after they have been trained, to identify whether \nthey are, in fact, illegal and take the appropriate steps in\n\n[[Page S10088]]\n\nconjunction with ICE to handle it in the proper manner.\n  Because of an interest I had in it for some time, the State of \nAlabama, I am proud to say, became the second State in the Nation to \nenter into one of these agreements. Our Governor, Bob Riley, thought it \nwas the right thing to do. He is an excellent Governor. He took steps \nto do it some years ago.\n  To date, we have trained 60 State troopers in 3 classes of 20 each, \nand the Federal Government trained these troopers at the Center for \nDomestic Preparedness in Anniston, AL. But let me tell my colleagues \nwhat happened to the State as a result of their partnership and \nwillingness to assist the Federal Government. They have to pick up the \ncosts of this training. Each class costs Alabama an average of $40,000, \nfor a total of $120,000 in State money, all designed to help ensure \nthat our State troopers are knowledgeable on all of the correct, fair, \njust, and legal ways to deal with illegal entrants into our country, \nand to be able to assist the Federal agents in doing their duties.\n  I think one reason we have seen a fairly slow expansion of the 287(g) \nprogram is the fact that it costs the States a bunch of money. Now we \nhave $51 million set aside here in this program for training. But they \nare not paying any of it, apparently, as of this date to refund the \nStates for their costs of training. It takes some number of weeks in \nthis training--more than I think is justified. It is 6 weeks, my \ncounsel tells me. It is 6 weeks that they have to go through a training \nprogram.\n  I have to tell my colleagues, if you go through any town in the \ncountry, whether it is Alabama or anywhere else, and you are a Senator, \nand you are speeding through that town and you are drunk, some 19-year-\nold, 20-year-old police officer can put you in jail, put your rear end \nin the Bastille. He doesn't have to have special training on how to \narrest a Senator. But we are going to give special training to our \nlocal police officers on how to arrest somebody who is not even a \ncitizen of the United States of America. That is what Homeland Security \nwants and that is what they believe. Six weeks, in my view, is too \nmuch, for heaven's sake. But they want 6 weeks of training and they \nmake them cross designated and very intense partners in this program. \nBut if you take a police officer off the streets for 6 weeks, that is a \ndrain on the State and local police departments, and we ought to be \nable to compensate them some for it, in my view.\n  Let me tell you what happened in my State. It has been rather \nremarkable. In the first 18 months of operation, the Alabama MOU has \nresulted in the seizure of over $689,000 in cash in connection with \ncriminal immigration offenses. Pretty good action there. As of last \nyear, the training of those troopers had already resulted in 54 \nindictments, including those for illegal entry, false claims to \ncitizenship, fraudulent documents, and visa fraud. It resulted in 33 \nconvictions, including Social Security fraud, prior deported aggravated \nfelons, and visa fraud. These are in Federal Court, not State court. \nYou cannot try people in State court for immigration offenses. They are \npicked up by the Federal prosecutors and they have to meet some \nseriousness standard before they would actually be prosecuted in \nFederal Court.\n  In addition to those I mentioned, there are six Federal charges \npending disposition, including aliens with firearms. There are 13 \nFederal charges pending indictment. So this is a matter that has the \npotential to help us identify those who are here illegally and those \nwho may pose a threat to our country. It could well be that the next \nperson planning an attack somewhere in the United States may be one of \nthose picked up because, as we know, of the 18 hijackers, several of \nthem were picked up--some more than once--by State and local officers. \nBut they had no way to access or did not access the actual history of \nthese individuals to find out whether they were here legally and might \notherwise be subject to arrest. If that had occurred and our system had \nworked effectively, it is conceivable that the case could have been \nbroken before 9/11 occurred.\n  The 9/11 Commission did point out that we need to do a far better job \nin this area. The 9/11 Commission recommended we implement State and \nFederal training and law enforcement cooperation and enhance that \nability. That was one of their firm recommendations. We have not done \nthat to any significant degree at this point.\n  The first State to be accepted with an MOU was Florida. They also \nhave a history of an effective program under 287(g). The ICE program \nprovides local law enforcement with comprehensive training and, once \ncertified, the officers remain basically under ICE's supervision under \nall matters relating to immigration. To address concerns voiced by \nimmigrant interest groups, Federal, State, and local enforcement have \nengaged in significant outreach efforts with local immigrant \ncommunities and have not engaged in sweeps for undocumented aliens.\n  One of the greatest testaments to the success of a program is that in \nno instance has a complaint been filed against law enforcement officers \nas a result of the actions under this memorandum of understanding. It \nhas gone extremely well without the kind of complaints that people have \nsuggested might happen, and it has been an asset to the Federal \nGovernment and should be continued. It is already part of our law. We \nhave provisions that allow for it. We have money set aside--$51 million \nin one area and $5 million in another area--but we don't have \nprovisions to help the States defray the cost of their training.\n\n  Now, I will remind my colleagues of some of the objective reports \nsince 9/11 that are important to us. One is the Hart-Rudman report. The \nreport is entitled ``America Still Unprepared--America Still in \nDanger.'' They found that one problem America still confronts is that \n``700,000 local and State police officers continue to operate in a \nvirtual intelligence vacuum, without access to terrorist watchlists.'' \nThe first recommendation of the report was to ``tap the eyes and ears \nof local and State law enforcement officers in preventing attacks.''\n  On page 19, the report specifically cited the burden of finding \nhundreds of thousands of fugitive aliens living among the population of \nmore than 8.5 million illegal aliens living in the United States. They \nsuggested that the burden could and should be shared with the 700,000 \nlocal, county, and State law enforcement officers if they can be \nbrought out of the information void.\n  The final report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon \nthe United States, the 9/11 Commission, released in the summer of 2004, \nalso recognized the important role of State and local law enforcement \nofficers in immigration law enforcement. Again, let me remind you, we \nhave only a couple of thousand actively engaged Federal investigators \ninside our country to actually enforce immigration law. So how do we \nexpect to intercept some of the individuals who may be plotting this \nvery moment to attack? They may be here with false documents, or they \nmay have gotten into the country legally and overstayed. How are we \ngoing to find them if we don't welcome the participation of State and \nlocal law enforcement officers? In the 9/11 Commission report, the \nsection titled ``Immigration Law and Enforcement,'' the Commission \nfound this:\n\n       [T]oday, more than 9 million people are in the United \n     States outside the legal immigration system.\n\n  Some say it is 12 million, but they say more than 9. Nobody can \ndispute that. They continue:\n\n       There is a growing role for State and local law enforcement \n     agencies. They need more training and work with Federal \n     agencies so they can cooperate more effectively with those \n     Federal authorities. . . .\n\n  To achieve that necessary collaboration, we must first clarify the \nauthority delegated to each level of law enforcement and make it clear \nthat State and local officers have authority to and are welcome to \nparticipate actively in the enforcement of immigration law.\n  My amendment will do that. It is something that is overdue, and we \nshould do it. I remain a bit baffled by the objections that continue to \nbe raised on this. I had occasion last year to participate with my \nchief counsel, who is here with me--Cindy Hayden--to prepare a law \nreview article for the Stanford Law Review on the question of the \nauthority of State and local law enforcement officers. It is somewhat \ncomplex, but it is not disputed that State and local law enforcement \nhave the authority to detain people who\n\n[[Page S10089]]\n\nhave come into our country illegally across our borders. They cannot \nprosecute them. They can detain them only for a reasonable period of \ntime. They have to turn them over to Federal agencies. But they are \nable, with regard to criminal immigration offenses, to conduct such \ndetentions as a complement to and as a part of their historic ability \nto assist in the enforcement of existing Federal law--and, indeed, \ncitizens can make citizen arrests for violations in some instances. \nThis has been a part of the law.\n  What is somewhat confused is that we have perhaps 40 percent of the \npeople enter into our country legally, but overstay. Maybe that large a \npercentage of our illegal population are visa overstays. The Court of \nAppeals in California--our Nation's clearly most liberal, the Ninth \nCircuit--concluded that local officers do not have the authority to \ndetain those visa overstayers. If you break across the border, that is \nclearly a criminal offense and detention can be had for that, they say, \nbut not for the others. Two other circuits--the Tenth and Fifth--seem \nto indicate otherwise.\n  The Department of Justice did a memorandum at one point that said \nthere was not authority for the detention of people in our country who \nhave not committed criminal violations of immigration law. Then that \nopinion was withdrawn. So the matter is confusing. There was an article \nin the Washington Times newspaper about it yesterday. The article \nquoted one of the people as saying there are gray areas here. There was \nan article in the Huntsville, AL, newspaper about a meeting with the \npolice and the lawyers and the city council about what they could do to \nparticipate in the enforcement of laws with regard to those in our \ncountry illegally. The lawyers told them there is some confusion there.\n  Well, it is not hard for us to clear up that confusion. The House of \nRepresentatives tried to do it in their first bill last year, so they \nmade it a felony to overstay and enter the country illegally. That \nresulted in an uproar and people saying we are going to make felons of \nthem and that was awful, so there was a big retreat from that. We have \nto figure out the best way to proceed with it.\n  My view is two things need to occur. We need better training of our \nState and local law enforcement that goes into their existing power so \nthey know what they are able to do and they don't overreach; second, we \nneed to pass legislation. But this is an appropriations bill and we \ncannot legislate on an appropriations bill. We are not able to offer an \namendment that would change or would clarify what the powers of the \nlocal law enforcement are.\n  We should make it quite clear that they have the power to detain \nanyone in our country illegally. They can detain a Governor. They can \ndetain a mayor. They can detain a Senator. Why can't they detain \nsomebody who is not a citizen and is in the country illegally?\n  What do the American people think about this? Americans strongly \nvalue our heritage as a nation of immigrants. Americans openly welcome \nlegal immigrants and new citizens. They value the character, the \nability, the decency, and the strong work ethic of so many of those who \nhave come to our country. However, it is also clear that Americans do \nnot feel the same way about those who violate our laws. The fact is, a \nlarge majority feel that State and local governments should be aiding \nthe Federal Government in stopping illegal immigration.\n  A Roper poll titled ``Americans Talk About Illegal Immigration'' \nfound that 88 percent of Americans agree and 68 percent strongly agree \nthat Congress should require State and local government agencies to \nnotify INS, now ICE, and their local law enforcement when they \ndetermine that a person is here illegally or who has presented \nfraudulent documentation.\n  Additionally, 85 percent of Americans agree and 62 percent strongly \nagree that Congress should pass a law requiring State and local \ngovernments and law enforcement agencies to apprehend and turn over to \nthe INS illegal immigrants with whom they come in contact.\n  So this amendment I have offered is far less reaching. Those numbers \nspeak volumes about the instincts and the understanding of the American \npeople about the enforcement of laws in America.\n  It is important to note that these responses were collected in \nresponse to questions about requiring State and local law enforcement \naction. The amendment I have offered does not require that, although it \nis mightily frustrating to see cities and certain jurisdictions open, \ncall themselves sanctuary bodies, and assert to the whole world that \nnot only will they not help in any way to enforce the law but will, in \nfact, not cooperate with the enforcement of Federal laws in their \njurisdiction. To me that is inexcusable. It is an affront to our \nhistory as a lawful society, and I am troubled by it.\n  Again, the first step is we should do a better job of training local \nand State law enforcement officers, and, second, we should clarify \ntheir jurisdiction. If we do not do that, I don't think we are very \nserious about bringing under control illegal immigration in America.\n  I did offer a second-degree amendment earlier, and I withdrew it. I \nask unanimous consent that I be allowed to modify Senator Dole's \namendment to include the language I proposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, there are a number \nof amendments we expect to be called up shortly. For the information of \nall Senators, we are working through the order we have in front of us \nright now. Staff is working through a number of amendments we think \nwill be agreed to. At that point, we can work through the final \namendments, and we will talk with the Senator about offering his \namendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and thank Senator Murray.\n  I do feel strongly about this issue. We have talked about it for \nquite a number of years. It is time for us to get this matter settled \nand fixed. It is overdue. I look forward to working with the Senator.\n  I thank the Chair. I see other Senators have arrived.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thune are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. THUNE. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have consulted with the Democratic manager \nof this bill, I have spoken to Senator Cochran, Senator McConnell. We \nare going to plow on to finish this bill tonight.\n  Now, we have worked long and hard the last couple of weeks, late \nnights, and we may have to have one tonight. We really need to finish \nthis legislation for all of the reasons we have all talked about \nbefore, not the least of which is we have so much to do next week that \nwe have to finish this tonight. We also have some other things we are \ngoing to try to do, but everyone should be aware of that. Do not plan \non going home for dinner tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are making progress. We have been \nworking through a number of amendments over the past several hours. I \nthank the majority leader, the minority leader, as well as the managers \nof the bill in helping us move forward.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2496, withdrawn\n\n                    Amendment No. 2488, as modified\n\n  I would just reiterate what Senator Reid said earlier. I am happy \nthat we\n\n[[Page S10090]]\n\nhave finally resolved the issue regarding the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana. I believe we are at the point now where we can move \nforward on that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Cochran second-degree amendment No. \n2496 be withdrawn; that the Vitter amendment No. 2488, as modified, be \nagreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  Mr. REID. And following the vote on that, that the Senator from \nLouisiana be recognized for 10 minutes to speak on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2488), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, let me thank both the majority leader and \nthe Democratic manager of the bill, Senator Murray, for their work, for \ntheir amicable resolution of this issue. I think it is a very good \nbipartisan, productive, amicable result. I appreciate all of you \nworking together in that regard.\n  I also extend my thanks to Senator Cochran, the Republican manager of \nthe bill, who was also very helpful in that regard in coming to a \nproductive, amicable resolution. I appreciate all of that work.\n  I just wanted to underscore the importance of what we have done \nbecause I think this is a very important issue for the people of \nLouisiana, for the people of the entire United States.\n  Last year, on this very same bill, I joined with you, Mr. President, \nand we were successful in passing an amendment on the Senate floor, and \nthen in the conference committee we were successful in passing a \nversion of that out of the conference committee into law. That was an \nimportant step forward at the time to ensure we would not have Federal \nagents, we would not have the heavy hand, if you will, of the Federal \nGovernment coming down to rip out of people's grasp--U.S. citizens--\npharmaceuticals they had bought properly in Canada as they were coming \nback into our country. I think the policy of doing that in the past was \noutrageous, particularly considering the sky-high prices American \nconsumers face in the United States and the very different lower prices \nthey face in Canada. So that step forward a year ago was very \nimportant.\n  I think what we just agreed to a few minutes ago, what will be on \nthis bill, is an even more significant step forward because compared to \nwhat came out of conference and what was signed into law last year, \nthis takes two additional steps.\n  First of all, we are no longer saying it is limited to prescription \ndrugs on the person of an American citizen. What that means is that we \nare also including protection of Internet and mail order sales. That is \nenormously important for you, Mr. President, representing the State of \nFlorida, and for me, representing the State of Louisiana. It is one \nthing for folks in Minnesota to travel to Canada and to come back; it \nis obviously a very different thing for folks in Florida or Louisiana \nto physically travel to Canada and come back. So compared to what we \ngot passed into law last year, this is far broader and far more \nsignificant because it also covers mail order and Internet sales.\n  The second big difference is, again, what we passed last year was \nlimited to a 90-day supply, and what we are passing on the Senate floor \nright now has no such limitation. Again, I think that is another \nsignificant step forward, a significant expansion of the law on the \nroad to full-blown reimportation.\n  Again, I thank everyone who was involved in this very productive \nresolution. We got a resounding vote a year ago--68 to 32. We got, \ntechnically, even a better vote today, in the sense that it was voice \nvoted, unanimous consent, so technically unanimous. We got a much \nbroader provision today, which I think is a very important step forward \non the road to my ultimate goal, which is full-blown reimportation with \nall the requisite safety provisions and authorizing language that would \nbe involved.\n  Of course, we cannot do that authorizing legislation on this bill \nbecause it is an appropriations bill, but we can, we should, we must, \non another vehicle soon, very soon, absolutely this year. I look \nforward to continuing to work with you, Mr. President, with other \nleaders on this issue, Senator Snowe, Senator Dorgan, Senator Thune, \nSenator DeMint, and many others who completely support the ultimate \nobjective of full-blown drug reimportation to allow American consumers \nunbridled access to safe, cheaper prescription drugs, including by mail \norder and the Internet.\n  Again, I believe the step we are taking here tonight, compared to \nwhat we were able to pass into law through the Vitter-Nelson amendment \nlast year, is an important additional step in removing the limitation \nthat it has to be on your person, so saying we can do it by mail order \nand the Internet, and by removing the limitation of a 90-day supply.\n  With that, I again thank all of the participants for this very \npositive, amicable, bipartisan resolution of the issue on this bill. I \nlook forward to continuing to walk down this path toward the ultimate \ngoal I share with you and so many others on the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Unanimous Consent Request--5849\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority \nleader, following consultation with the Republican leader, may at any \ntime proceed to consideration of Calendar No. 127, S. 849, the Openness \nPromotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007; that the \nbill be considered under the following limitations: that there be a \ntime limit of 2 hours of general debate on the bill, with the time \nequally divided and controlled between the chair and ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee or their designees; that the only amendment in \norder be a Leahy-Cornyn technical amendment, which is at the desk; that \nupon the use or yielding back of time, the amendment be agreed to, the \nbill as amended be read three times, and the Senate vote on passage of \nthe bill, with the above occurring without further intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there are \nongoing discussions with both sides of the aisle as well as the \nadministration to come up with bipartisan, consensual language on this \nissue and that we are unable to clear the agreement at this time. \nTherefore, on behalf of several Republican senators, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I understand Senator Cochran has expressed \nthe sentiments of some on his side of the aisle. I would like to say \nfor the record that we have made this proposal for several months now. \nI think those who are trying to move this issue have shown \nextraordinary patience in trying to reach an accommodation, and this is \nno reflection on the Senator from Mississippi, who was not involved in \nthis debate, that I know of. It only is a plea to those who are \nconsidering the merits of this legislation to try to do so in a timely \nfashion.\n  Mr. President, I would like to reiterate what the majority leader \nsaid earlier for those following the debate. If there are Members of \nthe Senate of either political party who have pending amendments on the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill, we encourage you to come to the \nSenate floor as soon as possible and be prepared to call up your \namendment. We are going to stay in session tonight until all amendments \nare disposed of. We will vote on final passage this evening, whatever \ntime that may be. We hope it will not be a late-night session, but when \nthere are many amendments pending and no Members on the floor, it is a \nfrustrating situation for everyone.\n  So I hope that those who have amendments they care about will come \nforward as soon as possible, come to the floor and work to try to \nresolve those amendments, withdraw these amendments, or bring them to a \nvote.\n\n[[Page S10091]]\n\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SANDERS). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2462\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the pending amendment, I believe, is the \nDole amendment No. 2462; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe the amendment has been agreed \nto on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2462) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2449 Withdrawn\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the next pending amendment is the Dole \namendment No. 2449. I believe that is the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments be called up by the individual Senators, with the \nfollowing time agreements, with no intervening action: amendment No. \n2481, by Senator DeMint; amendment No. 2516, by Senator Salazar; \namendment No. 2498, by Senator Sanders; that the Senators be allowed to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes, with no intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, with that we now have three Senators who \nwill be calling up amendments.\n  I again say to any Senator who has an amendment they want to offer \ntonight, we are moving quickly to final passage. In a few minutes, we \nwill have a number of amendments that have been agreed to on both \nsides. We will be calling those up.\n  Between now and then, the Senators I referred to will be speaking to \ntheir amendments and calling them up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2481 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2481.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMINT] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2481 to amendment No. 2383.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to remove offenses from the list \n  of criminal offenses disqualifying individuals from receiving TWIC \n                                 cards)\n\n       On page 69, after line 24, insert the following:\n       Sec. 536.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be obligated or expended by the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security to remove offenses from the \n     list of criminal offenses disqualifying individuals from \n     receiving a Transportation Worker Identification Credential \n     under section 1572.103 of title 49, Code of Federal \n     Regulations.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I had an opportunity this morning to speak \nbriefly about this amendment, and in the interest of time I will be \nbrief again.\n  This amendment is about the security of our ports. Two times within \nthe last year this body passed a bill that would prohibit access to \nconvicted felons of secure areas of our ports. We passed it once in the \nSAFE Port Act, and that amendment was diluted when it came back. Also, \nwe will find in the 9/11 Commission bill that will come back--we had \npassed it and put it in as part of that bill--it has been once again \ndiluted.\n  This needs to be a serious consideration. We can spend billions and \nbillions of dollars on screening and all kinds of equipment, but if one \nperson in our ports turns away from something being shipped in and does \nnot do the proper inspection and lets something in, we could be in a \nlot of trouble as a country.\n  So this amendment simply does not allow the Secretary to use funds to \neliminate any of the felonies listed in the amendment. Please keep in \nmind, this list of felonies is one that has been adopted by the \nHomeland Security agency. It is very similar to the lists we use in our \nairports, which have protected us for a number of years.\n  It is very important we recognize that people who have been \nsusceptible to criminal activity can be susceptible again. This is not \nthat we do not want to give people a second chance, but second chances \nshould not be at the expense of the security of this country.\n  So this amendment would disallow the use of funds to water down and \neliminate any of the felonies listed in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's list of those who are denied access to what we call the TWIC \ncards, which are the transportation worker identification cards.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The DeMint amendment No. 2481.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I may call up an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2516 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2516 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar], for himself and \n     Mr. Menendez, proposes an amendment numbered 2516 to \n     amendment No. 2383.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. BORDER SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR LAND AND MARITIME \n                   BORDERS OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Operational Control of the United States Borders.--\n     Notwithstanding any provision in this Act, the President \n     shall ensure that operational control of all international \n     land and maritime borders is achieved.\n       (b) Achieving Operational Control.--The Secretary of \n     Homeland Security shall establish and demonstrate operational \n     control of 100 percent of the international land and maritime \n     borders of the United States, including the ability to \n     monitor such borders through available methods and \n     technology.\n       (1) Staff enhancements for border patrol.--The United \n     States Customs and Border Protection Border Patrol may hire, \n     train, and report for duty additional full-time agents. These \n     additional agents shall be deployed along all international \n     borders.\n       (2) Strong border barriers.--The United States Customs and \n     Border Protection Border Patrol may:\n       (A) Install along all international borders of the United \n     States vehicle barriers;\n       (B) Install along all international borders of the United \n     States ground-based radar and cameras; and\n       (C) Deploy for use along all international borders of the \n     United States unmanned aerial vehicles, and the supporting \n     systems for such vehicles;\n       (c) Presidential Progress Report.--\n       (1) In general--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and every 90 days thereafter, the \n     President shall submit a report to Congress detailing the \n     progress made in funding, meeting or otherwise satisfying \n     each of the requirements described under paragraphs (1) and \n     (2).\n       (2) Progress not sufficient.--If the President determines \n     that sufficient progress is not being made, the President \n     shall include in the report required under paragraph (1) \n     specific funding recommendations, authorization needed, or \n     other actions that are or should be undertaken by the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\n     SECTION 2. APPROPRIATIONS FOR SECURING LAND AND MARITIME \n                   BORDERS OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       Any funds appropriated under this Act shall be used to \n     ensure operational control is\n\n[[Page S10092]]\n\n     achieved for all international land and maritime borders of \n     the United States.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMartinez and Senator Graham be added as cosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I note at the outset this amendment is \nsponsored by Senator Menendez, myself, Senator Graham, and Senator \nMartinez.\n  What it does, in a very simple statement, is say any funds we \nappropriate under this legislation with respect to our border security \nshould be used to ensure the operational control that needs to be \nachieved for all our international land and maritime borders of the \nUnited States.\n  This is an important amendment because the earlier amendment, which I \ncosponsored with Senator Graham, focused on the appropriation of moneys \nto go to the southern border, the border between Mexico and the United \nStates. The fact is, those of us who are here working on homeland \nsecurity should care and do care about making sure we have secure \nborders to this country, including our land and our maritime borders.\n  So what this amendment does is it directs that these expenditures of \nmoneys can be spent in securing our land borders to the north and to \nthe south as well as our maritime borders of the United States of \nAmerica. It is an amendment which is important, and there is an \nimportant statement to be made here. Much of the attention we have been \ngiving to the southern border, in terms of the broken borders we are \ntrying to fix in this immigration debate, has taken away the needed \namount of attention we should be focused on with respect to the other \nborders.\n  The fact is, we have a very broken system of immigration. We have a \nvery broken system of our borders today in the United States of \nAmerica. But it is not just the border with Mexico that is broken. It \nis also the border between the United States and Canada, and it is also \nour maritime borders that need additional security. So it is my hope \nthat with this amendment we will be able to put attention on our \nmaritime borders as well as our northern border.\n  I wish to give a couple of examples about why it is that this \namendment is needed. If you look at the number of examples we have with \nterrorists and other people who would wish to do us harm, they come in \nfrom across the borders, many of them come into this country legally \nand then they overstay their visas.\n  One example of what we know from the north, and that is in December \nof 1999, the Jordanian police foiled a plot to bomb hotels and other \nsites frequented by American tourists. It was a U.S. Customs agent on \nthe U.S.-Canadian border who arrested the person who was smuggling \nexplosives intended for an attack on Los Angeles International Airport. \nSo when we talk about homeland security and we talk about securing our \nborder to the south, it is equally important we are securing our border \nto the north, and it is equally important we are securing our maritime \nborders as well.\n  Another example: Recently, a human smuggling ring running \nundocumented work immigrants into the United States from Canada was \ndismantled. This was a human smuggling ring that was bringing \nundocumented workers through Canada. That ring was responsible for \nbringing dozens of Indian and Pakistani immigrants into the country.\n  So I think these are examples that demonstrate if we are going to \nsecure our borders, it is not just the border between Mexico and the \nUnited States that needs to be secured; it is all the borders of the \nUnited States of America.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Menendez, Senator Martinez, \nSenator Graham, and me in the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent agreement, the \nSenator from Vermont is now recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is Salazar amendment No. \n2516.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside so I can call up an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2498 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I call up the Sanders-Feingold amendment \nNo. 2498 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself and Mr. \n     Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 2498 to amendment \n     No. 2383.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit funds made available in this Act from being used \n  to implement a rule or regulation related to certain petitions for \n        aliens to perform temporary labor in the United States)\n\n       On page 69, after line 24, add the following:\n       Sec. 536. Prohibition on Use Funds for Rulemaking Related \n     to Petitions for Aliens.\n       None of the funds made available in this Act may be used by \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security or any delegate of the \n     Secretary to issue any rule or regulation which implements \n     the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking related to Petitions for \n     Aliens To Perform Temporary Nonagricultural Services or Labor \n     (H-2B) set out beginning on 70 Federal Register 3984 (January \n     27, 2005).\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by commending Chairman Byrd \nand Ranking Member Cochran for their outstanding leadership on this \nexcellent piece of legislation. The fiscal year 2008 Homeland Security \nappropriations bill will make this country safer, and I thank Chairman \nByrd and Senator Cochran for their hard work in crafting this bill.\n  The amendment I am offering now is, in fact, a very simple amendment. \nAs you know, there is strong concern all over this country about the \nincrease in poverty and the decline of the middle class. It seems to \nme--at a time when we are hemorrhaging millions of good-paying jobs; at \na time when Americans are losing, by the millions, their health \ninsurance, when moms cannot afford affordable childcare, people are \nlosing their pensions--we have to do everything we can to make sure the \npolicies we implement do not hurt low- and moderate-income families and \nmake a bad situation even worse.\n  On the contrary, this Congress has to do everything we can to make \nsure we lift up wages--we lift up working conditions--and not push them \ndown. Unfortunately, the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of Labor have proposed regulations that, if implemented, \ncould have a significant negative impact in terms of lowering wages and \nworking conditions for American workers.\n  Specifically, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department \nof Labor have proposed regulations that would eliminate the labor \ncertification process and replace it with a labor attestation process. \nState workforce agencies and the Department of Labor as a whole would \nno longer be involved in certifying that employers applying for H-2B \nvisas are not displacing American workers or adversely affecting the \nwages or working conditions of U.S. workers.\n  The proposed regulations, for the most part, would only require \nemployers to attest--to attest--to the Department of Homeland Security \nthat they are following the law. All they have to do is say: I am \nfollowing the law. Trust us. In other words, the Federal Government \nwould take employers at their word that they are complying with the \nlaw, with little, if any, oversight.\n  Among other things, the proposed regulations fail to ensure H-2B visa \nwork is temporary in nature. H-2B work is supposed to be temporary. The \nproposed regulations fail to ensure that no qualified American worker \nis available for H-2B positions. In other words, the employer is \nsupposed to go out and make sure there are not American workers \navailable for that position. The proposed regulations fail to require \nthat H-2B employers do not adversely affect U.S. wages and working\n\n[[Page S10093]]\n\nconditions, all of which are required by current law. In other words, \nthe law says an employer cannot pay low wages which have the impact of \nlowering wages for all workers in that area.\n\n  Now, let me very briefly read to my colleagues what the AFL-CIO has \nwritten about these regulations:\n\n       The proposed regulations would significantly weaken the \n     ability of the Department of Labor and the Department of \n     Homeland Security to meet the statutory requirements of the \n     H-2B program as established by Congress and would establish a \n     new regulatory system that would be arbitrary and capricious. \n     Current administrative procedures have so far failed to \n     adequately protect H-2B workers, domestic workers, and the \n     domestic labor market. The proposed regulations, rather than \n     addressing and remedying these fundamental flaws in current \n     procedures, would only further undermine the administration's \n     ability to ensure the H-2B program operates in full \n     compliance with the law and in a rational manner. The \n     proposed regulations are not only unacceptable to the AFL-CIO \n     and to worker and immigrant advocates as a matter of public \n     policy--if enacted, they would also constitute an unjustified \n     and unauthorized derogation from the administration's \n     responsibilities under the law.\n\n  In addition, according to a recent report by the Southern Poverty Law \nCenter entitled ``Close to Slavery,'' H-2B workers are routinely \ncheated out of wages; forced to mortgage their futures to obtain low \nwage, temporary jobs; held virtually captive by employers or labor \nbrokers who seize their documents; forced to live in squalid \nconditions; and denied medical benefits for on-the-job injuries.\n  The amendment I am offering today would prohibit the Department of \nHomeland Security from using any of the funds in this act to implement \nthese proposed regulations.\n  Given the serious abuses of the H-2B program by many employers \ndocumented by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the strong \nopposition of working people from all over this country, I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this amendment. We have a bad \nsituation now. Let us not make it worse.\n  Simply put, we must make sure that labor protections for American \nworkers and for foreign workers who are temporarily working in our \ncountry--we must make sure these regulations are strengthened, not \nweakened. Over the long term, I will be introducing legislation to \naccomplish that goal. But in the interim, we must not take a major step \nbackwards in terms of protecting both U.S. workers and guest workers \nfrom unscrupulous employers. That is what this amendment is all about, \nand I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  With that, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLieberman be allowed 10 minutes to call up an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2407 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my friend \nSenator Murray from Washington State. I call up amendment No. 2407.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for himself \n     and Mrs. Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 2407 to \n     amendment No. 2383.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To provide funds for the Interoperable Emergency \n                     Communications Grant Program)\n\n       On page 35, line 20, strike ``$3,030,500,000'' and insert \n     ``$3,130,500,000''.\n       On page 39, line 21, strike the colon, insert a period and \n     add the following:\n       (4) $100,000,000 for grants under the Interoperable \n     Emergency Communications Grants Program established under \n     title XVIII of the Homeland Security Act of 2002; Provided, \n     That the amounts appropriated to the Department of Homeland \n     Security for discretionary spending in this Act shall be \n     reduced on a pro rata basis by the percentage necessary to \n     reduce the overall amount of such spending by $100,000,000.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is introduced by the \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Collins, the ranking member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, and myself. At this time I wish to ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator McCaskill of Missouri be added as an original \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer knows, in a \nshort while this evening, the Senate will consider the conference \nreport, which has brought together the so-called 9/11 legislation \npassed by both the House and the Senate. I am very pleased, as I will \nsay when that matter comes up, that the conferees have reached an \nagreement, because I believe this bill will greatly enhance the \nsecurity of the American people, protecting them from natural disasters \nand also, God forbid, from a terrorist attack. This conference report \nwill enact remaining unenacted or inadequately enacted recommendations \nof the 9/11 Commission.\n  Specifically in regard to this amendment, the conference report will \ncreate, if favorably adopted, a new interoperability emergency \ncommunications grant program to help Federal, State, and local \nresponders achieve comprehensive interoperability.\n  My colleagues know the need from which this amendment arises, and, in \nfact, some of the tragic experiences from which it arises. On September \n11 at the World Trade Center and the Towers, we know as a matter of \nfact that lives were lost because the heroic emergency response \npersonnel--the firefighters, the police officers, the emergency medical \npersonnel--simply could not communicate with one another because their \nsystems did not allow them to do that. During Hurricane Katrina, there \nwas a breakdown because of the catastrophic impact of that natural \ndisaster in the very operability of communications.\n  We have heard from experts on how best respond to these disasters and \nof the crying need for investment in making our communications systems \ninteroperable. Our State and local emergency response officials, \nelected officials, tell us this is a crying need. The fact is it is a \nneed that is very hard, particularly for local governments, to satisfy. \nAnybody who has ever dealt with a municipal budget looks at the budget \nof the firefighters, the police departments--these are personnel-\nintensive budgets. There is not enough left over for what might be \ncalled capital investments, equipment investments. So this need for \ninteroperable communications, which will save lives, without question, \nwill simply not be met fast enough if we leave it to the local \ngovernments.\n  Now, in the 9/11 Commission bill which we will consider later, this \ninteroperability emergency communications grant program is not only \ncreated but authorizes the expenditure of $1.6 billion for this purpose \nover the next 4 years. This Homeland Security appropriations bill \nbefore us makes a substantial increase over the President's budget in \nfunding for homeland security, $2\\1/4\\ billion. It is absolutely the \nright thing to do. It is absolutely the necessary thing to do to \nprotect the American people from disaster and/or a terrorist attack. \nHowever, the bill before us does not include any money for \ninteroperability of communications at the local level.\n  Perhaps because this conference report we are going to consider \ntonight was not adopted when the Homeland Security Appropriations \nSubcommittee reached its judgments, I will say for the record that the \nSenate itself earlier this year, in the Senate budget resolution, \nsupported $400 million in dedicated funding for this program, with \npassage of that budget resolution, in anticipation, I believe, of this \nnew program.\n  What this amendment, offered by the Senator from Maine and myself and \nthe Senator from Missouri, does is to provide $100 million to fund a \nfirst payment to fund this new interoperability emergency \ncommunications grant program. It is a kind of downpayment at a \nmeaningful level; not as much as is necessary, but a beginning to this \nprogram. The authorization in the conference report is important. It \ntakes a critical step forward. But it must be funded, or it will not \nmean anything to our first responders and those of the rest of us in \nAmerica who depend on them for our protection.\n\n[[Page S10094]]\n\n  I wish to note as an indication of the urgent need for this kind of \nfunding that the following first responder groups have written and \nexpressed their support for this amendment: the International \nAssociation of Firefighters, the International Association of Fire \nChiefs, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the \nAssociation of Public Safety Communications Officials International, \nthe Congressional Fire Service Institute, and the National Volunteer \nFire Council. All of these folks representing millions of first \nresponders around America are asking for this funding.\n  I will report to my colleagues that the House has included $50 \nmillion as a first payment to fund this interoperability communications \nfund in its Homeland Security appropriations bill. I hope my colleagues \nwill help us do our part, now that we are about to authorize the fund \nlater tonight by adopting this amendment.\n  I ask when the vote is taken on this amendment that it be taken by \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want our colleagues to know we are \ntrying to work as diligently as possible to move forward at this time. \nThe Senator from New Jersey wants 10 minutes to speak, and after that I \nthink we can start moving on some of the amendments. So I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from New Jersey to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate my distinguished colleague \nfrom Washington State providing the time.\n  I rise in strong support of the Salazar-Menendez amendment. I expect \nfrom all of the voices I have heard in our debate about immigration as \npart of this Homeland Security bill that we will have resounding \nsupport for this amendment, because I know those who want to protect \nthe United States at its border crossings are going to want to protect \nall of its border crossings.\n  I have heard a lot about our challenges along our southern border, \nbut I have heard nothing about our challenges along our northern \nborder. In that respect, I think it is important to call the attention \nof the Senate to the fact that over the last several years, according \nto official reports, the Congressional Research Service tells us there \nhave been nearly 69,000 individuals who have crossed over the northern \nborder and, of course, that number is small in comparison because we \ndon't have the Border Patrol agents on the northern border to be \ndealing with the interdictions that would be called for.\n  So while there are 13,488 Border Patrol agents in the entire force, \nthere are only 965 agents along the northern border. That northern \nborder has over 5,525 miles of border between the United States and the \nNorth, significantly more than the 1,993 miles along the southern \nborder. Yet over 69,000 people have crossed, to our knowledge, because \nif you divide out the number of Border Patrol agents at any given time \non the northern border, they are looking at patrolling hundreds and \nhundreds of miles for a fraction of what is the Border Patrol on any \ngiven shift. Therefore, what that number tells us is that while \nthousands cross on the northern border, we don't even know the \nmagnitude of it, because we are not paying attention. We are not paying \nattention on the northern border.\n  I will remind my colleagues that it was Ahmed Ressam in 1999, \nDecember of 1999, the millennium bomber, who came in through the \nnorthern border of the United States. We don't seem to be concerned \nabout the northern border. What Senator Salazar's and my amendment \nsimply does is to make sure that we are, in fact, looking at all of our \ninternational borders and allocating the resources appropriately.\n  Now, unless this debate is about something more than protecting the \nUnited States, we should have a resounding vote. Because if you are \nconcerned about one terrorist coming through a border, you should be \nconcerned about a border that is far more porous, far greater in \nlength; the one that actually has a history of having someone who \nsought to commit an act of violence within the United States crossing \nthat northern border--one that is totally undermanned in the context of \nprotecting that border and, obviously, it means we have far greater \nnumbers than the 69,000; at the same time, one in which we have \nactually seen the number of Border Patrol agents decrease. We have a \nmandate in the 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act \nthat mandated that the Canadian border receive increases in Border \nPatrol agents equal to 20 percent of the Border Patrol agents that \nexist. And, ultimately, we have seen a reduction during fiscal year \n2005-2006 in the total number of Border Patrol agents by nearly 9 \npercent.\n\n  So we have a history of people crossing the border, a history of the \nmillennium bomber. Yet we have a decrease in Border Patrol agents who \nare on the northern border. You are either for protecting the country \nor you are not. By the way, if I were a terrorist, and I wanted to get \ninto the United States, and the bottom line is that I know they are \ngoing to put everybody down at the southern border, guess what. I would \nbe coming through the northern border because with over 5,500 miles and \nwith only 965 total Border Patrol agents for three shifts around the \nclock for that whole stretch, that makes it a much greater percentage \nfor me to be able to come over the northern border than to face the \nchallenges of the southern border.\n  I know our colleagues here who care so much, as we do, about the \nnational security and the defense of this country are going to give \nthis amendment an overwhelming vote. I expect it to be accepted by a \nvoice vote. If the answer is no, we are not concerned about the \nnorthern border, then I have to question the motives of some in this \ndebate because we are either concerned about the security of the \ncountry or we have a certain prejudice over a certain part of what we \nconsider a threat to the United States. Porous borders are a collective \nthreat. But when we focus all of our time and attention at one end, \nlet's leave a wide gaping hole on the other part, the one that has over \n2\\1/2\\ times more territory to cover and has probably 10 percent of all \nthe Border Patrol agents in the country.\n  I am sure this will be accepted by voice or we will have an \noverwhelming vote because the absence of having an overwhelming vote to \nmake sure we protect our country indicates to me that the concern of \nsome is not about protecting our country, the concern of some is that, \nin fact, they have a concern about who comes to this country--not \nbecause they seek to provide an act of terrorism, but because of who \nthey are. So I think this will be a defining moment in which we can \ncollectively work to protect our country, make sure we have the \nappropriate resources and allocations of them to the northern border as \nwell as the southern border, make sure that we fill up all of our \nsecurity gaps and, therefore, strengthen the security of the country. \nIn the absence of that, many of us will have to question what this \ndebate has really been about.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 8:30 this \nevening, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the following \namendments in the order listed; that no amendments be in order to any \nof the amendments in this agreement prior to the vote; that there be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to each vote: \nLieberman amendment No. 2407, Sanders amendment No. 2498, Salazar \namendment No. 2516, and DeMint amendment No. 2481.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n[[Page S10095]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, I ask the managers of \nthe bill if there is going to be another set of amendments on which we \nare going to vote tonight.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from \nLouisiana and the Senator from Oklahoma both would like to call up an \namendment, but in the intervening time between now and 8:30, we welcome \ntalking with the Senators to set up some time for those who want to \ncall up their amendments to do so.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, are there only two other \namendments that are to come up?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. No, there are a number of amendments beyond the four I \njust mentioned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I take 30 seconds to explain why? I \nhave no objection to the text of the Salazar amendment and have talked \nwith Senator Salazar about it. My understanding is that it has the same \nrule XVI germaneness objection to it that is being posited against an \namendment of mine, which I think also is not objectionable. I want to \nmake sure all amendments are treated the same that have the same \nobjection to them.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold his \nobjection, I inform him that when the Salazar amendment is pending \nbefore the Senate, he will be able to offer a rule XVI point of order \nif he so wishes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I understand there was a unanimous consent \nrequest to consider the amendment. I was in the cloakroom at the time \nand had to come out. Perhaps I misunderstood.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The amendment will be called up for a vote, and a rule \nXVI point of order could be raised at that point on the amendment. We \nare simply setting up these amendments to consider at that time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I registered my objection, and I continue to \ndo so, but I am happy to try to work something out.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, isn't it true that we don't have to have \nunanimous consent to proceed to a vote? This is all that is being \nasked. We are not asking to adopt these amendments, but we are simply \nsetting up an order and a time for the voting to begin. I just didn't \nwant anybody to misunderstand what is being asked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I revise my unanimous consent request: \nthat at 8:30 this evening, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to \nthe following amendments--we will remove the Salazar amendment--and \nthat no other amendments will be in order: Lieberman amendment No. \n2407, Sanders amendment No. 2498, and DeMint amendment No. 2481.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to be added to the \nunanimous consent request. I am very unclear as to whether there will \nbe an objection to me offering an amendment. I would like it added to \nthe list. The Senator from Mississippi said we don't need unanimous \nconsent to file my amendment. I want my amendment to be filed and will \ntake a vote up or down.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I add to the unanimous consent I already put in place \nthat following this order being put in place, between now and 8:30 p.m. \nthat Senator Coburn and Senator Landrieu be allowed to call up their \namendments and speak for 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Is it the intention of the Senator from Washington--\nwhile I understand this is simply for the purposes of an order, are we \nexpecting, regardless of the order, a vote to be called on the Salazar \namendment?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. May I respond to the Senator? Their amendment is one of \nthe pending amendments. The yeas and nays have been ordered on it. So \nbefore this bill is finally adopted, their amendment will be in order \nat some point.\n  We are trying to move our way through, Mr. President, to the end of \nthis evening. The majority leader has said we will finish this bill \ntonight. There are a number of amendments that are pending. We hope to \ndispose of all of them before it gets too late this evening.\n  I again ask unanimous consent as I said before.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2442 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and appreciate her \nconsideration in giving me an opportunity to call up an amendment even \nthough we are not going to debate it. We will put it in the pending \nfile. I understand that. I thank her for her courtesy.\n  I ask that the pending amendment be set aside and that amendment No. \n2442 be brought up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself and Mr. \n     DeMint, proposes an amendment numbered 2422 to amendment No. \n     2383.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n           (Purpose: To prohibit funding for no-bid earmarks)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a)(1)(A) None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act may be used to make any \n     payment in connection with a contract awarded through a \n     congressional initiative unless the contract is awarded using \n     competitive procedures in accordance with the requirements of \n     section 303 of the Federal Property and Administrative \n     Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 253), section 2304 of title \n     10, United States Code, and the Federal Acquisition \n     Regulation.\n       (B) Except as provided in paragraph (3), none of the funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may be \n     used to make any payment in connection with a contract \n     awarded through a congressional initiative unless more than \n     one bid is received for such contract.\n       (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, none \n     of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this \n     Act may be awarded by grant or cooperative agreement through \n     a congressional initiative unless the process used to award \n     such grant or cooperative agreement uses competitive \n     procedures to select the grantee or award recipient. Except \n     as provided in paragraph (3), no such grant may be awarded \n     unless applications for such grant or cooperative agreement \n     are received from two or more applicants that are not from \n     the same organization and do not share any financial, \n     fiduciary, or other organizational relationship.\n       (3)(A) If the Secretary of Homeland Security does not \n     receive more than one bid for a contract under paragraph \n     (1)(B) or does not receive more than one application from \n     unaffiliated applicants for a grant or cooperative agreement \n     under paragraph (2), the Secretary may waive such bid or \n     application requirement if the Secretary determines that the \n     contract, grant, or cooperative agreement is essential to the \n     mission of the Department of Homeland Security.\n       (b)(1) Not later than December 31, 2008, the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security shall submit to Congress a report on \n     congressional initiatives for which amounts were appropriated \n     during fiscal year 2008.\n       (2) The report submitted under paragraph (1) shall include \n     with respect to each contract and grant awarded through a \n     congressional initiative--\n       (A) the name of the recipient of the funds awarded through \n     such contract or grant;\n       (B) the reason or reasons such recipient was selected for \n     such contract or grant; and\n       (C) the number of entities that competed for such contract \n     or grant.\n       (3) The report submitted under paragraph (1) shall be made \n     publicly available through the Internet website of the \n     Department of Homeland Security.\n       (c) In this section:\n       (1) The term ``congressional initiative'' means a provision \n     of law or a directive contained within a committee report or \n     joint statement of managers of an appropriations Act that \n     specifies--\n       (A) the identity of a person or entity selected to carry \n     out a project, including a defense system, for which funds \n     are appropriated or otherwise made available by that\n\n[[Page S10096]]\n\n     provision of law or directive and that was not requested by \n     the President in a budget submitted to Congress; and\n       (B) the amount of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available for such project.\n       (2) The term ``executive agency'' has the meaning given \n     such term in section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement \n     Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403).\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a fairly simple amendment. I plan \non offering this on every appropriations bill. What it says to the \nAmerican people is we know we are going to do certain things to send \nprojects home. What this says is if you do that, then there ought to be \na competitive bid on the project rather than a sweetheart deal to \nwherever it is going.\n  It is a very simple amendment. It says if we are going to send \nsomething home through an earmark, then the process of expending that \nmoney ought to be on a competitive bid basis so we get good value for \nthe American taxpayer--no cost-plus, just competitively bid.\n  With that, I reserve my debate for a later time and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2525 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, in the underlying bill, which makes a \ntremendous amount of progress, in my opinion, with protecting the \nhomeland--increasing funding for port security, transportation, et \ncetera, and I have said publicly and privately my great thanks, on \nbehalf of the people of Louisiana whom I represent, to the leaders \nmanaging this bill--in the underlying bill, there is a provision that \nsome of us have worked very hard on to help expedite the rebuilding of \nschools in the gulf coast area.\n  As you know, 2 years this August is the anniversary of Katrina and \nRita. Literally hundreds of schools were destroyed. As I said a \nthousand times on this floor and will continue to say, the Federal \nGovernment was simply overwhelmed by the catastrophic nature of this \nevent, the scope of which had never been seen. So I offer this \namendment, and send one to the desk that I am speaking of now to help \nfix one very small problem with actually one school.\n\n  The underlying bill sets up a process--and I am very grateful to the \ncommittee, Republicans and Democrats, who supported a new process--and \nactually FEMA was very helpful in supporting a new process--to help us \nrebuild the schools faster, better; not at greater expense to the \ntaxpayer but a better way to deal with this catastrophic disaster.\n  However, if this amendment I am offering right now does not pass, \nthere will be one school that is left out of this fix, and that is why \nI offer it, on behalf of a very small parish in south Louisiana, a \nschool I happened to visit, a school that thought they had one \nagreement with FEMA but, evidently, there was a great misunderstanding.\n  This school has 500 children who go here, and they have had a very \ndifficult time over the last 2 years, so I offer this amendment for \nthem. It is extremely small, when compared to all the amendments my \ncolleagues are offering, but it would help them to get their small \nschool district back up and running. That is the essence of what the \namendment does. As I say, it will affect basically one school in New \nIberia Parish.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2525 to amendment No. 2383.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with \nthe reading of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To require regional evacuation and sheltering plans)\n\n       On page 69, after line 24, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 536. EVACUATION AND SHELTERING.\n\n       (a) Regional Evacuation and Sheltering Plans.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 360 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency, in coordination with the heads \n     of appropriate Federal agencies with responsibilities under \n     the National Response Plan or any successor plan, States, \n     local governments, and appropriate nongovernmental \n     organizations, shall develop and submit to Congress, regional \n     evacuation and sheltering plans that--\n       (A) are nationally coordinated;\n       (B) incorporate all appropriate modes of transportation, \n     including interstate rail, commercial rail, commercial air, \n     military air, and commercial bus;\n       (C) clearly define the roles and responsibilities of \n     Federal, State, and local governments in the evacuation plan; \n     and\n       (D) identify regional and national shelters capable of \n     housing evacuees and victims of an emergency or major \n     disaster in any part of the United States.\n       (2) Implementation.--After developing the plans described \n     in paragraph (1), the Administrator of the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency and the head of any Federal agency with \n     responsibilities under those plans shall take necessary \n     measures to be able to implement those plans, including \n     conducting exercises under such plans as appropriate.\n       (b) National Sheltering Database.--The Administrator of the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency, in coordination with \n     States, local governments, and appropriate nongovernmental \n     entities, shall develop a national database inventorying \n     available shelters, that can be shared with States and local \n     governments.\n       (c) Cost-Benefit Analysis.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator of the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency, in consultation with the heads of \n     appropriate Federal agencies with responsibilities under the \n     National Response Plan or any successor plan, shall conduct \n     an analysis comparing the costs, benefits, and health and \n     safety concerns of evacuating individuals with special needs \n     during an emergency or major disaster, as compared to the \n     costs, benefits, and safety concerns of sheltering such \n     people in the area they are located when that emergency or \n     major disaster occurs.\n       (2) Considerations.--In conducting the analysis under \n     paragraph (1), the Administrator of the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency shall consider--\n       (A) areas with populations of not less than 20,000 \n     individual needing medical assistance or lacking the ability \n     to self evacuate;\n       (B) areas that do not have an all hazards resistance \n     shelter; and\n       (C) the health and safety of individuals with special \n     needs.\n       (3) Technical assistance.--The Administrator of the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency shall, as appropriate, provide \n     technical assistance to States and local governments in \n     developing and exercising evacuation and sheltering plans, \n     which identify and use regional shelters, manpower, \n     logistics, physical facilities, and modes of transportation \n     to be used to evacuate and shelter large groups of people.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``emergency'' \n     and ``major disaster'' have the meanings given those terms in \n     section 102 of ther Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \n     Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122).\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2407\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, shortly the Senate will vote on an \namendment Senator Lieberman and I have offered to provide $100 million \nin badly needed funding for a new emergency communications grant \nprogram. This program is about to be authorized in the Homeland \nSecurity bill we have recently completed the conference negotiations \non, and which I anticipate will be cleared either tonight or tomorrow \nmorning.\n  When we look at the needs of our first responders, interoperability \nof communications equipment is at the top of their list. We saw on 9/11 \nthat firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical personnel \nlost their lives because of an inability to communicate due to \nincompatible equipment. We saw it again in the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina, where police could not communicate with firefighters, who \ncould not communicate with emergency medical personnel.\n  Unfortunately, achieving interoperability is an expensive, lengthy, \nand difficult process, and it is one our State and local governments \nneed assistance in meeting. The proposal Senator Lieberman and I have \nput forth is a pretty modest proposal. The Homeland Security conference \nreport authorizes a $400 million program. The budget resolution did as \nwell for this year. What we are asking for is a modest downpayment of \n$100 million. It is offset by a modest reduction in other accounts.\n\n[[Page S10097]]\n\n  Let me say that this amendment does have the strong support of our \nfirst responder community. It has been endorsed by the International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs, the Congressional Fire Services Institute, \nthe International Association of Firefighters, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, and the Association of Public Safety \nCommunications Officials International.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that endorsement letters from \nthose organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                 of Fire fighters',\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2007.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins: On behalf of \n     the nation's more than 280,000 professional fire fighters and \n     emergency medical personnel, I am writing to express our \n     support for your amendment to the 2008 Homeland Security \n     Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008 providing $100 \n     million for grants to improve emergency communications.\n       The Department of Homeland Security's 2006 National \n     Interoperability Baseline Survey found that first responder \n     agencies have made some progress towards achieving \n     interoperability. However, the failure of emergency personnel \n     to communicate with each other along the Gulf Coast in the \n     wake of Hurricane Katrina provides a stark example of just \n     how much work remains to ensure that first responders have \n     adequate communications capabilities in emergencies.\n       The new grant program dedicated to improving first \n     responder communications, established in the 9/11 Commission \n     Act, will help states achieve this critical goal. By \n     permitting funds to be used to assist with a variety of \n     activities, including activities to achieve basic \n     operability, this new program will enable states and regions \n     to overcome their own unique communications challenges, and \n     ensure a solid foundation upon which to build an \n     interoperable communications network.\n       The ability of first responders to communicate with each \n     other, as well as with state and federal authorities, is \n     integral to any effective, coordinated emergency response. \n     The Lieberman-Collins amendment will provide a down payment \n     on our commitment to help America's first responders \n     communicate during an emergency.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this vital issue and your \n     continued strong support of our nation's fire fighters.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Harold A. Schaitberger,\n     General President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From the APCO International]\n\n    APCO Supports Lieberman-Collins Communications Interoperability \n                               Amendment\n\n       The Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials \n     (APCO) International supports Senators Lieberman and \n     Collins's amendment to appropriate $100 million for a new \n     Interoperable Communications Grant Program.\n       Since 2002, our nation has had to overcome the devastation \n     caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf Coast, \n     which showed the operational vulnerability of emergency \n     communications systems. The issue was not only \n     interoperability but also operability. Due to the lack of \n     operable emergency communications systems, command and \n     control of the disasters was almost non-existent.\n       Five years after September 11, 2001 APCO International \n     finds that, while there have been significant accomplishments \n     to report on issues affecting public safety communications, \n     there is also a disturbing lack of progress. Multiple \n     nationwide surveys indicate there are significant shortfalls \n     in communications operability and interoperability in many \n     regions and locales with many contributing factors. The \n     lessons learned from 9/11 and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita for \n     emergency communications are simple. Be prepared. \n     Preparedness, planning and training are the key elements to \n     achieving operability and interoperability during day-to-day \n     activities and disasters.\n       Preparedness involves planning and implementing current and \n     effective technology solutions. Preparedness involves \n     coordination and mutual aid agreements with surrounding \n     jurisdictions, state and federal government agencies. \n     Preparedness involves making sure your personnel and \n     equipment are able to function during any emergency and meet \n     the unexpected challenges that may arise at any time. \n     Preparedness is making sure the daily operations of the \n     emergency communications center are adaptable to any \n     unexpected situation. Preparation also includes adequate \n     funding for planning and operations.\n       We strongly believe this amendment will provide the funding \n     needed to vastly enhance our Nation's operability and \n     interoperable emergency communications systems and we hope \n     that your Senator can support this amendment.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                               of Fire Chiefs,\n\n                                        Fairfax, VA, Mar. 2, 2007.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lieberman: On behalf of the nearly 13,000 \n     chief fire and emergency officers of the International \n     Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I would like to express \n     our support for several major provisions included in S. 4, \n     the Improving America's Security Act of 2007. I appreciate \n     the hard work and dedication your committee has put into this \n     legislation, and I urge the Senate to move expeditiously \n     towards its passage.\n       The IAFC is proud to endorse the information sharing \n     programs outlined in Title I of the bill. These programs, \n     which include guidelines to help integrate the fire service \n     into fusion centers and a fellowship program designed to \n     improve the exchange of intelligence data between government \n     entities, constitute a significant step forward in our \n     nation's homeland security efforts. By ensuring that fire \n     departments and other emergency response providers \n     participate directly in fusion centers, Title I will open new \n     doors for nontraditional information gathering, enhanced \n     capabilities assessments, and better coordination between the \n     fire service and law enforcement in planning for and \n     responding to major disasters. Simply put, these changes will \n     make our information sharing programs more effective and our \n     country safer.\n       Additionally, the IAFC strongly supports the operable and \n     interoperable communications programs defined in Title III. \n     The IAFC is working with partners in public safety on \n     numerous fronts to strengthen the voice and data \n     communications capabilities of first responders throughout \n     the United States. Accomplishing this goal requires adequate \n     spectrum for responders to communicate, as well as funding \n     for purchase and installation of the equipment necessary to \n     utilize the available spectrum. At present, substantial \n     action remains to be taken by the federal government on both \n     fronts, and Title III of S. 4 will make a positive \n     contribution by authorizing over $3 billion for the Emergency \n     Communications Operable and Interoperable Grants program.\n       Furthermore, the IAFC supports the critical infrastructure \n     provisions set forth in Title X of the Improving America's \n     Security Act. The IAFC looks forward to working towards Title \n     X's critical infrastructure goals through the partnership \n     model currently reflected in the National Infrastructure \n     Protection Plan (NIPP). In particular, we believe that \n     ensuring adequate protection for human elements--as well as \n     physical and cyber elements--will be an essential part of the \n     critical infrastructure protection efforts carried out by the \n     fire service under this title.\n       Finally, the IAFC strongly believes that however grant \n     reform measures (such as those described in Title II) are \n     resolved in this legislation, the final product should \n     preserve the all-hazards nature of the FIRE and SAFER Act \n     grant programs. These programs were created with an emphasis \n     on equipping the fire service with the tools, equipment, \n     training, staff, and other resources needed to respond \n     effectively to all types of emergencies--whether natural or \n     man-made, great or small. In its present form, section \n     2002(c) of the Improving America's Security Act fully \n     protects the FIRE and SAFER Act grant programs, and any \n     changes to the grant reform section should preserve section \n     2002(c) as it is currently written.\n       As the primary fire service leadership organization in the \n     United States, the IAFC would like to thank you and your \n     dedicated staff for your work thus far on S. 4. The IAFC \n     stands ready to provide you with information and support as \n     the Improving America's Security Act of 2007 moves forward in \n     the legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Chief James B. Harmes,\n     CFO, President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 7, 2007.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins: On \n     behalf of our organizations, we urge you to consider the \n     following issues as conference negotiations on H.R. 1, the \n     Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act, and S. \n     4, the Improving America's Security Act get underway. \n     Individually and collectively, we appreciate the support you \n     have shown for the fire and emergency services through your \n     work on this critical homeland security legislation.\n       Over the past sereral years, the question of how homeland \n     security grant funding should be distributed has been an \n     extremely contentious issue. While we do not have a position \n     on how this matter should be resolved, we do ask that you \n     make sure that the FIRE and SAFER Act grant programs are not \n     affected by reforms included in the conference report. The \n     FIRE and SAFER Act grant programs were created with an \n     emphasis on equipping the fire service with the tools, \n     equipment, training, staffing, and other resources needed to \n     respond effectively to all types of emergencies--whether \n     natural or man-made,\n\n[[Page S10098]]\n\n     great or small. Section 2002 of each bill fully protects \n     these programs, and any compromise grant reform section \n     should preserve these safeguards.\n       A second issue of critical importance to the fire service \n     is the ability to communicate effectively. As you know, first \n     life responders throughout the United States are currently \n     facing major challenges in the area of wireless \n     communications. Fortunately, both H.R. 1 and S. 4 create new \n     grant programs designed to help address this problem. In \n     crafting the final version of the communications grant \n     program, we ask you to retain the $3.3 billion authorization \n     total included in S. 4, ensure that funding is available for \n     both operable and interoperable communications projects, and \n     build in flexibility allowing funding to be used for systems \n     in a wide range of operating frequencies. Furthermore, we \n     urge you to ensure that these grants utilize the Department \n     of Homeland Security's SAFECOM grant guidance and fund all of \n     the areas defined in the SAFECOM ``Interoperability \n     Continuum,'' including governance.\n       In addition to seeking progress on the issues above, the \n     first responder community also wishes to see a well-prepared \n     private sector that will voluntarily take its share of \n     responsibility for emergency preparedness and business \n     continuity. The voluntary private sector preparedness program \n     outlined in S. 4, which relies on standards such as the NFPA \n     1600 Standard on Disaster/Emergency Management and Business \n     Continuity Programs, would enable our nation to better \n     protect lives and property. This initiative complements other \n     first responder disaster and emergency preparedness plans and \n     is critical for a robust homeland security policy. \n     Accordingly, we believe that the Senate-passed language \n     should be retained in the conference report.\n       Finally, we strongly urge you not to include provisions in \n     the conference report that would establish new federal \n     mandates for re-routing of hazardous materials around urban \n     areas. While we understand that local re-routing may be \n     necessary on a case-by-case basis, federal mandatory re-\n     routing regulations would create additional dangers by \n     shifting hazardous materials to rural areas that may not be \n     as well-staffed or equipped to deal with an incident. In \n     addition, re-routing hazardous materials would keep them in \n     transit for a longer amount of time, which would increase the \n     risk and the potential for an incident to occur. Larger, \n     urban fire departments are generally in a better position to \n     handle these incidents, because they have more specialized \n     equipment and other resources.\n       Again, thank you for your attention to these pressing \n     homeland security issues.

Joseph Lieberman,\n     Hon. Susan Collinsm,\n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins: On \n     behalf of the nation's more than 280,000 professional fire \n     fighters and emergency medical personnel, I applaud you for \n     your efforts to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 \n     Commission. We are especially grateful that you included in \n     your proposal provisions to reform our nation's Homeland \n     Security Grant Program and enhance first responder \n     communications.\n       The establishment of the new grant program dedicated to \n     improving communications operability and interoperability is \n     vital to protecting the health and safety of our nation's \n     fire fighters. Permitting funds to be used to assist with a \n     variety of activities, including activities to achieve basic \n     operability, will enable states and regions to overcome their \n     own unique communications challenges.\n       Provisions ensuring that states provide local governments \n     and first responders homeland security funding in an \n     expedited manner, and permitting a portion of funds to be \n     used for the payment of overtime and backfill costs will \n     allow communities to take full advantage of this invaluable \n     federal assistance.\n       The Improving America's Security Act also demonstrates your \n     strong commitment to America's fire service. By guaranteeing \n     that members of the fire service are involved in local \n     planning to determine effective funding priorities, and by \n     maintaining FIRE and SAFER grants as separate and distinct \n     programs, you properly ensure that America's fire service \n     will continue to receive funding to fulfill its vital role in \n     local emergency preparedness.\n       Thank you for your leadership on these vital issues. We \n     appreciate your willingness to work closely with the IAFF in \n     developing the Improving America's Security Act, and look \n     forward to continuing our work together on behalf of our \n     nation's emergency response personnel.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Barry Kasinitz,\n                                   Director, Governmental Affairs.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, again, I hope our colleagues will take a \nhard look at this amendment and will decide it warrants their support \nto address one of the major problems that has hampered emergency \nresponse, decreased the effectiveness of those who are putting their \nlives on the line, and truly can be a matter of life and death.\n  Let me end my comments by applauding, nevertheless, the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Subcommittee for their hard work. Senator Byrd, \nSenator Murray, and Senator Cochran have done a terrific job on a very \ndifficult issue, but this is an attempt to make their good work even \nbetter.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There are now 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on the \nLieberman amendment. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to inform the Senate that I \nbelieve both sides are in agreement that the Lieberman amendment is \naccepted. I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the yeas and nays on the \nLieberman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, may I first thank Senator Murray, \nSenator Cochran, and our colleagues for their support. This is an \nimportant amendment. It is a bipartisan amendment. The Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill could not have funded the Emergency Grant \nProgram set up by the 9/11 bill, which we have not passed yet, so I \nappreciate very much their support. This amendment is supported by \nalmost all of the first responder groups--firefighters, police \nofficers, volunteer firefighters, et cetera--because they desperately \nneed funding to help them make their communication systems \ninteroperable.\n  Thanks to our colleagues on both sides. Senator Collins and Senator \nMcCaskill and I join in those thank yous.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). If there is no further debate, \nthe question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2407) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2498\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. What is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business before the Senate under \nthe unanimous consent agreement is the Sanders amendment, on which \nthere are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, what the H-2B program provides is that \nguest workers may come into this country on a temporary basis if no \nqualified U.S. worker is available for that position and that the wages \npaid to H-2B employees do not adversely impact U.S. wages and working \nconditions. Unfortunately, the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of Labor have proposed regulations that would eliminate the \nlabor certification process and move toward a process which has \nvirtually no enforcement mechanisms and which simply takes the \nemployer's word as to\n\n[[Page S10099]]\n\nwhether they are obeying these regulations. In other words: Trust us, \nwe are doing the right thing.\n  This is absurd. This amendment would simply prohibit the Department \nof Homeland Security from using any of the funds in this act to \nimplement these proposed regulations. This amendment is supported by \nSenator Feingold as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  One minute is allowed under the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Is the time yielded back? In the opinion of the Chair, the time is \nyielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback), the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Coleman), \nand the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. \nColeman) would have voted ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 280 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--6\n\n     Brownback\n     Coleman\n     Dodd\n     Johnson\n     McCain\n     Obama\n  The amendment (No. 2498) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are now to the DeMint amendment No. \n2481. That is the pending item.\n  I believe the Senators on this side are ready to accept this \namendment, and if the Senator wants a voice vote, we are more than \nhappy to do it.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays were previously ordered. Who \nyields time? Two minutes is allowed.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I could not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I have asked for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, over the last year this body has taken a \nstrong bipartisan stand to make our ports more secure. After the \nDepartment of Homeland Security established regulations to bar felons \nfrom the secure areas of our ports, the Senate passed an amendment by \n94 votes to codify that regulation into law.\n  These regulations are very similar to the ones we use at our \nairports. Unfortunately, our strong stand on the Senate floor was \ndiluted in conference with the House.\n  My amendment would prohibit the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security from using any funds appropriated in this bill from \nbeing used to delete or modify any of the lists of felonies in the \nregulation.\n  I would encourage all of my colleagues to be consistent and vote \nagain yes for this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we didn't hear what the Senator said. Does \nthe Senator want to say it again?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Am I correct in that I have another minute to do the same \nthing again?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can summarize.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I can summarize. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the \nSenator for demanding order.\n  This is a very important amendment. There is no need to spend \nbillions of dollars keeping our ports secure if we are going to allow \nserious felons to work there. We all know that. We voted already, 94 to \n2, for this exact same provision, only in an appropriations bill. In \norder not to attract rule XVI, this is just to prohibit the use of \nfunds in eliminating or deleting or changing any of the list of \nfelonies for 1 year.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote yes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I expect that most of the Members on our \nside will be voting for this. We had been willing to accept it without \na vote. But having said that, I hope once we accept it on this bill, it \nmeans that we will not have to have a vote later this evening on a \nmotion to recommit on the 9/11 Commission because once we vote on this \nand it is part of this package, it will mean, hopefully, we will not \nhave to deal with it on the next bill that we will be considering \ntonight, the 9/11 Commission. So with that I will be voting aye. I urge \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Obama), are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback), the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Coleman), \nand the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. \nColeman) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 93, nays 1, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 281 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--93\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--1\n\n       \n       Specter\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--6\n\n     Brownback\n     Coleman\n     Dodd\n     Johnson\n     McCain\n     Obama\n  The amendment (No. 2498) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, as \nthe majority leader said, we are going to go to final passage tonight \nno matter what it takes. We are working our way through the amendments.\n  I am going to proceed to two amendments that I believe are agreed \nupon by Senator Salazar and Senator Kyl that I believe will be adopted \nby voice vote.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I have not made a unanimous consent request, I would \nsay.\n  We are working with the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, on an \namendment she intends to offer. Meanwhile, we are working to put \ntogether a final package of agreed-upon amendments that will take us \nabout 20 minutes to put together. Hopefully, at that time we will have \na vote on final passage. So I would like all Senators to know we are \ngoing to work our way through several amendments over the next 20 \nminutes or half hour and, hopefully, be at a point where we can move to \nfinal passage on this bill.\n  Mr. President, with that, we now have an agreement on both the \nSalazar and Kyl amendments. I send both----\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Can we have order in the Chamber.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, just to notify the Senator, I have not \nasked for unanimous consent. I say to the Senator, we will get to her \namendment.\n\n\n        Amendments Nos. 2516, as Modified; and 2518, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, we now have an agreement on both the Salazar and Kyl \namendments. I send both amendments to the desk, as modified, and ask \nunanimous consent that they be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Without objection, amendment No. 2516, is modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following\n\n     SECTION 1.

Is there further debate on the Kyl amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2518), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we \nare now working with the Senator from Louisiana who has an amendment \nthat is pending, on how we are going to dispose of that. We will work \nthat out over the next several minutes. We have a number of other \namendments we have been working with Senators on that I believe will be \nagreed upon on all sides. Again, our staffs are working diligently. I \nexpect it will take them the next 15 or 20 minutes. At that time, we \nhope to have all the amendments before the Senate and move to final \npassage on this bill.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF SENATE ON IMMIGRATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On June 28th, 2007, the Senate, by a vote of 46 to 53, \n     rejected a motion to invoke cloture on a bill to provide for \n     comprehensive immigration reform.\n       (2) Illegal immigration remains the top domestic issue in \n     the United States.\n       (3) The people of the United States continue to feel the \n     effects of a failed immigration system on a daily basis, and \n     they have not forgotten that Congress and the President have \n     a duty to address the issue of illegal immigration and the \n     security of the international borders of the United States.\n       (4) People from across the United States have shared with \n     members of the Senate their wide ranging and passionate \n     opinions on how best to reform the immigration system.\n       (5) There is no consensus on an approach to comprehensive \n     immigration reform that does not first secure the \n     international borders of the United States.\n       (6) There is unanimity that the Federal Government has a \n     responsibility to, and immediately should, secure the \n     international borders of the United States.\n       (7) Border security is an integral part of national \n     security.\n       (8) The greatest obstacle the Federal Government faces with \n     respect to the people of the United States is a lack of trust \n     that the Federal Government will secure the international \n     borders of the United States.\n       (9) This lack of trust is rooted in the past failures of \n     the Federal Government to uphold and enforce immigration laws \n     and the failure of the Federal Government to secure the \n     international borders of the United States.\n       (10) Failure to uphold and enforce immigration laws has \n     eroded respect for those laws and eliminated the faith of the \n     people of the United States in the ability of their elected \n     officials to responsibly administer immigration programs.\n       (11) It is necessary to regain the trust of the people of \n     the United States in the competency of the Federal Government \n     to enforce immigration laws and manage the immigration \n     system.\n       (12) Securing the borders of the United States would serve \n     as a starting point to begin to address other issues \n     surrounding immigration reform on which there is not \n     consensus.\n       (13) Congress has not fully funded some interior and border \n     security activities that it has authorized.\n       (14) The President of the United States can initiate \n     emergency spending by designating certain spending as \n     ``emergency spending'' in a request to the Congress.\n       (15) The lack of security on the international borders of \n     the United States rises to the level of an emergency.\n       (16) The Border Patrol are apprehending some, but not all, \n     individuals from countries that the Secretary of State has \n     determined have repeatedly provided support for acts of \n     international terrorism who cross or attempt to cross \n     illegally into the United States.\n       (17) The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating a \n     human smuggling ring that has been bringing Iraqis and other \n     Middle Eastern individuals across the international borders \n     of the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of Senate that--\n       (1) the Federal Government should work to regain the trust \n     of the people of the United States in its ability of the \n     Federal Government to secure the international borders of the \n     United States;\n       (2) in order to restore the credibility of the Federal \n     Government on this critical issue, the Federal Government \n     should prove its ability to enforce immigration laws by \n     taking actions such as securing the border, stopping the flow \n     of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States, and \n     creating a tamper-proof biometric identification card for \n     foreign workers; and\n       (3) the President should request emergency spending that \n     fully funds--\n       (A) existing interior and border security authorizations \n     that have not been funded by Congress; and\n       (B) the border and interior security initiatives contained \n     in the bill to provide for comprehensive immigration reform \n     and for other purposes (S. 1639) introduced in the Senate on \n     June 18, 2007.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 2500, as modified\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SECURITY CENTER OF \n                   EXCELLENCE.\n\n       If the Secretary of Homeland Security establishes a \n     National Transportation Security Center of Excellence to \n     conduct research and education activities, and to develop or \n     provide professional security training, including the \n     training of transportation employees and transportation \n     professionals, the Mineta Transportation Institute at San \n     Jose State University may be included as a member institution \n     of such Center.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2524\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for security associated with the national \n                           party conventions)\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.

Amounts provided by this section are \n     designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     204 of S. Con. Res. 21 (110th Congress).\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I believe those are all the amendments to come before \nthe Senate.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2521\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on May 4, Greensburg, KS, was devastated \nby a tornado. Our thoughts and prayers are very much with the many \nfamilies affected by this disaster, and we fully support their \nrebuilding efforts.\n  I strongly support the amendment offered by Senator Roberts and \nSenator Brownback to the Homeland Security appropriations bill that \nwould allow Greensburg to hire the essential workers it needs to help \nrebuild the town.\n  The protections in current law governing national emergency grants \nunder the Workforce Investment Act serve an important purpose. They \nensure that the program is targeted to help workers who need it most, \nand is not used to displace public sector workers with workers that do \nnot receive the same wage and merit system protections.\n  Greensburg, however, faces unique circumstances. In the wake of the \ndisaster, this small city has an obvious need for professionals--such \nas zoning experts, planning professionals, and building inspectors--\nwith expertise that is not readily available in the area. In these \nunique circumstances, the waivers provided for in this bill are a \nreasonable response. It is obviously not, however, a precedent for \nfuture recipients of these emergency grants.\n  I hope very much that these waivers will do as much as possible to \nhelp the people of Greensburg restore their city and rebuild their \nlives, and I wish them well in the years ahead.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2474\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, my amendment is an amendment I wish I \ndid not have to offer. It is necessary, unfortunately, because of the \nadministration's continued plan to outsource or privatize critical \ncomponents of our homeland security.\n  I am proud to have Senators Kennedy, Schumer, Lautenberg, Akaka, \nMenendez, Kerry, Mikulski, Cardin and the chairman and ranking member \nof the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee \nrespectively, Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins, as cosponsors of \nthis amendment.\n  This amendment also has the endorsement of the American Federation of \nGovernment Employees. I will ask to have printed in the Record their \nletter of support.\n  Mr. President, the most recent key judgments of the National \nIntelligence Estimate were crystal clear: our homeland is under a \n``heightened threat environment'' and that al-Qaida is undiminished in \nits goal in attacking us here at home.\n  At the very same time, despite a lot of tough rhetoric, the Bush \nadministration wants to cut the only Federal agency responsible for \nprotecting nearly 9,000 nonmilitary Federal buildings nationwide.\n  The Federal Protective Service, or FPS, protects more than 1.1 \nmillion Federal employees located in more than 2,100 communities across \nour country.\n  While protecting Federal buildings, the FPS also monitors the \nqualifications and performance of 15,000 privately contracted security \nguards.\n  In 1995, after the Oklahoma City bombing, the General Services \nAdministration and Congress concluded that FPS required 1,480 field \npersonnel to do its duty.\n  After 9/11, as we face even greater threat, as we have rightfully \nheightened our security and vigilance here at home, the Bush \nadministration has slashed FPS personnel to fewer than 1,200. If it has \nits way, the administration will cut that number to 950 in 2008.\n  Just today, we learned that the FPS has recently issued an internal \ndocument, entitled ``Increased Risk of Terrorist Attack This Summer'' \ndetailing high-risk threats to Federal buildings and employees.\n  The inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security, Richard \nL. Skinner, investigated the FPS. Among the disturbing findings: Only a \ndozen FPS employees are tasked with checking the credentials and \nperformances of the 5,700 guards in the DC area--``an inadequate \nnumber'' according to the audit; 30 percent of contract security guards \nin the sample had at least one expired certification, security \ncontractors failing to perform security services according to terms and \nconditions of their contracts.\n  The report concluded that many of the deficiencies cited occurred \nbecause FPS personnel were not effectively monitoring the contract \nguard program.\n  On May 1, 2007, Jim Taylor, the deputy inspector general for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security testified before the House Committee on \nHomeland Security and stated that further reductions in the FPS ``could \nlead to uneven effects across the nation, perhaps place some facilities \nat risk.''\n  Last month, contract security guards did not show up for work at the \nDepartment of Education and two Food and Drug Administration offices. \nThe contract guards' employer had not paid 400 employees in a month, \nciting financial difficulties. But FPS did pay the company for its \nservices. It turns out that the company's president served 5 years in \njail for bank fraud and money laundering. According to company's \ngeneral manager, the president of the company used company money to pay \nfor luxury condos here in the District of Columbia and in Myrtle Beach, \nSC.\n  This latest episode only underscores the importance of not cutting \nthe Federal Protective Services staff, but increasing it. It not only \nsaves us from wasting Federal resources--it could save lives.\n  My amendment would stop the Department of Homeland Security from \ncontinuing to downsize the Federal\n\n[[Page S10111]]\n\nProtective Service. The amendment would require the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to assure that the workforce of the Federal \nProtective Service includes no fewer than 1,200 commanders, police \nofficers, and special agents engaged on a daily basis in protecting \nFederal buildings.\n  This amendment does not require an offset or any additional spending. \nFPS operations are solely funded through security fees and \nreimbursements paid for by Federal agencies. The amendment would \nrequire the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of \nHomeland Security to adjust Federal building security fees as necessary \nto ensure full funding of not fewer than 1,200 in-service commanders, \npolice officers, inspectors, and special agents at the Federal \nProtective Service.\n  Mr. President, security on the cheap is no security at all. Our \nNation faces serious threats--this Congress should demand a response by \nthe Bush administration commensurate with the danger--and the \nPresident's own rhetoric. I ask my colleagues to join me to ensure that \nthe Federal Protective Services has the personnel needed to do its job \nand that we do not send the message that our Federal buildings are \nexposed.\n  Mr. President, last week's key judgments of the National Intelligence \nEstimate made clear that al-Qaida has ``protected or regenerated key \nelements of its Homeland attack capability'' and is now as strong as it \nwas in 2001.\n  I commend the work of Senator Byrd and the members of the \nAppropriations Committee for putting together a Homeland Security \nappropriations bill that supports tough and smart measures to make our \ncountry more secure. This is a must-pass piece of legislation that we \ncannot afford to delay and I urge my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle not to obstruct this critical legislation so we can implement \nthese measures to make our country more secure.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter to \nwhich I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            American Federation of\n\n\n                                Government Employees, AFL-CIO,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the American Federation of \n     Government Employees, AFL-CIO, I urge you to support Senator \n     Clinton's amendment to the FY '08 Homeland Security \n     Appropriations bill to insure that our nation's federal \n     buildings are adequately protected. For the past several \n     months the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Immigration \n     and Customs Enforcement has been implementing a proposal to \n     eliminate over 350 commanders, police officers, and special \n     agents from the Federal Protective Service (FPS). Experienced \n     law enforcement officers have been actively encouraged to \n     leave the agency. leaving vulnerable countless federal \n     buildings that once receive around-the-clock FPS protection.\n       The Bush Administration is attempting to unilaterally alter \n     the mission of this critical homeland security agency despite \n     the demonstrated need for high security at federal buiidings \n     and complexes. It would be hard to forget that day in April \n     1995, when domestic terrorists Timothy McVeigh and Terry \n     Nichols drove up to the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma \n     City and unleashed the first major terrorist attack in the \n     U.S. In the post-9/11 world in which we live, to eliminate \n     the law enforcement and antiterrorism activities of the \n     Federal Protective Service is unthinkable.\n       The Senate Appropriations Committee included strong \n     language opposing the FPS plan and the House calls it an \n     unfunded mandate and requires the agency to negotiate \n     security agreements with every impacted state and local law \n     enforcement agency, yet the Department continues to press \n     forward with its misguided, dangerous initiative.\n       For this reason it has become necessary to require the \n     Department to maintain a specified level of manpower in order \n     to insure our continuing safety. In order to assure that the \n     FPS is restored to its full complement of personnel, Senator \n     Clinton will offer an amendment to the Homeland Security \n     Appropriations bill that requires the Department to maintain \n     a minimum of 1200 total in-service personnel (Commanders, \n     Inspectors, Police Officers and Special Agents). This is \n     based on a field staffing level for FPS of 1480 which was \n     GSA's target until 2003.\n       The Federal Protective Service is an often overlooked, yet \n     critical component of our overall homeland security safety \n     net. The GAO has been asked by the Chairman and Ranking \n     Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs Committee to conduct a review of FPS funding and \n     other issues. We strongly believe that in view of that \n     pending study, fundamental reform of the FPS mission, such as \n     the Administration is proposing, is inappropriate and should \n     be stopped.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Beth Moten,\n                               Legislative and Political Director.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2487\n\n  Mr. President, I would have called up amendment No. 2487.\n  This amendment is also cosponsored by Senator Dorgan.\n  Mr. President, in a little over a week, the Transportation Security \nAdministration plans to lift its ban on disposable butane lighters, a \ndecision that is both ill-advised and ill-considered. Lifting the ban \non these lighters defies common sense and ignores the TSA's own \nrecommendations.\n  In March 2005, a TSA spokesman said, ``The threat posed by lighters \non board is valid.'' TSA has warned that al-Qaida and those seeking to \ndo us harm intend to use everyday household items to conceal explosives \nand detonate them on board airliners.\n  In fact, the TSA actually wanted to go further than banning lighters \nalone. The TSA wanted to ban matches, too. But the Bush administration \ndemanded that the TSA conduct cost-benefit analysis before banning \nmatches, another decision that calls into question the commitment \nwithin the administration to matching security rhetoric with smart \nsecurity policies. Even the CEO of the Zippo Company, a company that \nmanufactures disposable butane lighters, expressed support for the \nlighter ban stating, ``We're never going to get lighters back into the \ncabin in carry-on baggage. We never really argued with the TSA on that \nbecause we don't want to compromise safety in any way.''\n  And we all remember, in December 2001, when Richard Reid, the so-\ncalled ``Shoe Bomber,'' attempted to murder 197 people onboard an \nAmerican Airlines flight when he attempted to set off explosives hidden \nin his shoe using a box of matches. According to the FBI, Reid likely \nwould have been successful if he had used a butane lighter.\n  The TSA claims that lifting the ban will free up time for security \nofficers to focus on finding more high threat items. However, the TSA \nis not lifting the ban on all lighters. Passengers will still not be \nallowed to carry torch lighters or cigar lighters onboard an aircraft.\n  The result? Instead of banning all lighters, security officers will \nnow have to differentiate between disposable butane lighters and other \nlighters in every single piece of luggage that they have to inspect. \nEven on the TSA's own website the difference between what is acceptable \nand what is not is hard to discern.\n  And this justification has been tested before, when the TSA lifted \nthe ban on small scissors and knives. In April, the Government \nAccountability Office released a report on that decision. The GAO found \nthat it is unclear whether lifting that ban ``had any impact on \nTransportation Security Officers' ability to detect explosives--a key \ngoal for the change.''\n  The decision to lift the ban on disposable butane lighters makes \ninspecting luggage more difficult, makes the rules more complicated, \nand makes the skies more dangerous.\n  So, let's briefly summarize the TSA's decision. You can bring a \ndisposable butane lighter but not a cigar lighter or a torch lighter. \nYou can bring a fueled lighter onboard but you cannot check it in your \nluggage. You can bring explosive liquid in the form of a fueled butane \nlighter but cannot bring a large tube of toothpaste in the form of \ntoothpaste. And you don't need the lighter anyway because you cannot \nsmoke onboard. It seems that common sense has left the gate at the \nTransportation Security Administration.\n\n  Mr. President, my amendment would have continued to prohibit butane \nlighters onboard an aircraft until the TSA provides Congress a report \nidentifying all anticipated security benefits and any possible \nvulnerabilities associated with allowing butane lighters into airport \nsterile areas and onboard an aircraft, as well as any supporting \nanalysis justifying their conclusions.\n  Further, my amendment would have required the GAO to conduct an \nassessment of the report submitted by TSA to Congress. Until these \nreports were conducted, the ban on butane lighters would remain in \nplace.\n  My amendment has the support of the 55,000-member Association of\n\n[[Page S10112]]\n\nFlight Attendants. I will ask that a letter from the Association of \nFlight Attendants be printed in the Record.\n  Flight attendants are on the front lines in the event of a terrorist \nattack involving aircraft. They are our first responders onboard and \nunderstand what could constitute a dangerous tool in the hands of a \ndetermined terrorist. After September 11, 2001, keeping weapons--and \nany device that could be used as a weapon--off passenger airplanes is \nnot ``security theatre.'' It is security, plain and simple.\n  My amendment also has the endorsement of the Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association, which represents over 25,000 Federal law \nenforcement officers, including Federal Air Marshals. I will ask that \ntheir letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  In their letter, they say that ``allowing butane lighters onto \ncommercial aircraft would jeopardize the safety of both the flying \npublic and the Federal Air Marshals who protect them.''\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in support of this amendment. Let's \nrestore common sense and do all we can to limit the kinds of potential \nweapons terrorists may employ onboard aircraft.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I \nreferred by printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Association of Flight\n\n\n                                     Attendants--CWA, AFL-CIO,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2007.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of the 55,000 members from \n     20 Airlines represented by the Association of Flight \n     Attendants--CWA, I am writing to express our support for your \n     efforts to reinstitute the ban on lighters onboard passenger \n     aircraft. We look forward to working with you to reinstitute \n     this common sense security measure.\n       As the first responders onboard passenger aircraft, we were \n     extremely frustrated with the decision by the Transportation \n     Security Administration (TSA) in December of 2005 to lift the \n     ban on scissors, screwdrivers and other tools that could be \n     used as potential weapons onboard the aircraft. Such a move \n     by the TSA was shortsighted and not in the best interest of \n     the overall security of passenger aircraft and our aviation \n     system. Furthermore, they failed to take into consideration \n     the concerns of flight attendants, those that are jeopardized \n     the most by reintroducing these dangerous items into our \n     workplace.\n       This recent TSA decision to lift the ban on lighters is no \n     different. It is yet another shortsighted move on their part \n     to supposedly free up screener time to check for other, more \n     dangerous, items. If the shoe bomber, Richard Reid, had a \n     lighter during his efforts to bring down an American Airlines \n     flight he most likely would have succeeded. The ban on \n     lighters was a common sense move to prevent another tragedy \n     and must be reinstated.\n       Flight attendants are in a unique position, as the first \n     responders onboard all passenger aircraft, to know what could \n     constitute a dangerous tool in the hands of a determined \n     terrorist. We remain adamant that TSA must reinstitute its \n     ban on small blades and tools and this recent decision to \n     allow lighters onboard the aircraft should be reinstated.\n       Again, we look forward to working with you to reinstate \n     this common sense safety procedure.\n           Respectfully,\n                                               Patricia A.

Hillary Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: As the President of the Federal Law \n     Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), representing over \n     25,000 Federal law enforcement officers, I wish to offer our \n     support for continuing the ban on butane lighters on \n     commercial aircraft.\n       A decision to change the ``Prohibited Item List'' and allow \n     butane lighters on commercial aircraft could have potentially \n     life threatening consequences. If in the well known ``shoe \n     bomber case'' Richard Reid had used a butane lighter the \n     results might have been catastrophic.\n       Both the flying public and TSA screeners have become \n     accustomed to the ban on butane lighters and a change now \n     would only create confusion among them. Furthermore, allowing \n     butane lighters onto commercial aircraft would jeopardize the \n     safety of both the flying public and the Federal Air Marshals \n     (FAMs) who protect them.\n       We fully support your efforts to keep butane lighters on \n     the ``Prohibited Item List'' however we continue to have \n     concerns about certain items that have been removed in the \n     past. The safety of Federal law enforcement officers who fly \n     armed to prevent terrorist attacks should never be \n     compromised. The safety of the flight crew and the flying \n     public is of paramount importance to all of us.\n       If I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact \n     me at 917-738-2300.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Art Gordon,\n                                               National President.\n\n\n           funding for mass transit and commuter rail systems\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Byrd, concerning the amendment I have filed to the pending bill \non the floor regarding the use of Transit Security Grant Program \nfunding for mass transit and commuter rail systems across the Nation. \nMy fellow home State Senator, Mr. Specter, is a cosponsor of this \namendment. As the chairman is aware, the Southeastern Pennsylvania \nTransit Authority, SEPTA, is the fifth largest public transportation \nsystem in the Nation. SEPTA's mulimodal transit system provides a \nnetwork of fixed-route service, including bus, subway, subway-surface, \nregional rail, light rail, trackless trolley and paratransit service. \nThe SEPTA service area includes the heavily populated southeastern \nPennsylvania counties of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and \nPhiladelphia. This area encompasses approximately 2,200 square miles. \nSEPTA serves over one-half million customers daily and provides over \n303 million passenger trips annually. The safety and security of its \npassengers, infrastructure and equipment is a priority for SEPTA and it \nis a priority for me.\n  The current SEPTA communications system does not permit communication \ninside the system's 20-mile commuter tunnel network and underground \nconcourses. This puts significant limits on SEPTA's ability to deal \nwith emergencies that occur in its underground facilities. To address \nthis matter, SEPTA is working to develop a system that will allow the \nAuthority to effectively participate in all emergency response and \nrecovery actions which may occur in the system's tunnel network. This \nproject will enable SEPTA to take measures to enhance safety and \nsecurity.\n  Based upon my conversations with SEPTA officials, I understand that \nit has been unable to fully utilize Federal homeland security funds in \npast years for this initiative. SEPTA officials report that Federal \nrestrictions require expenditure of homeland security funds within a 3-\nyear time period. SEPTA officials further report that implementing a \nsystem-wide underground communications network, including appropriate \nuse of capital investment planning and effective procurement practices, \nis not possible within this existing time frame. SEPTA has therefore \nbeen unable to make the progress it desired on this project.\n  Given the potential consequences of current restrictions, it was my \nhope that an amendment expanding the timeframe for expenditure of \nfiscal year 2008 Transit Security Grant Program funds from the existing \n36 months to 48 months be adopted to enable transit systems across the \nnation, including SEPTA, to use their available funds in a more \nflexible manner.\n  It is my understanding that the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, as well as the chairman of the authorizing committee, the \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, has several concerns \nregarding this amendment. I fully appreciate the valid points they \nraise and look forward to working with them to come to an appropriate \nsolution. I would note that the distinguished Member from West Virginia \nhas been very supportive of assistance in providing appropriate Federal \nfunding for important homeland security initiatives in my home State \nand I wish to convey my gratitude.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Member from Pennsylvania for his \nremarks on the amendment he has filed. The safety and security of our \nNation's mass transit systems is a critical priority for me. We only \nneed be reminded of the terror attacks in Madrid on a commuter rail \nsystem in 2004 and in London on the underground system in 2005 to \nappreciate the magnitude and urgency of the threat to our transit and \nrail networks.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague to help ensure that \nSEPTA, and all mass transit and commuter rail systems, have the \nnecessary resources to ensure their safety and security, including \nfacilitation of communications\n\n[[Page S10113]]\n\nbetween first responders in the event of an attack. To the extent that \nthe SEPTA system faces a unique challenge with regard to flexibility \nand duration of use of their existing Federal funds, I look forward to \nworking with you and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to find an \nappropriate solution that meets the legitimate safety needs of the \npassengers and employees of the system.\n\n\n                          the northern border\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the PATRIOT Act required that DHS triple \nthe number for border patrol agents at the northern border, the Trade \nAct of 2002 required 285 additional customs inspectors for the northern \nborder and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 \nincluded a provision that authorized an increase of 2,000 U.S. border \nprotection agents each year from FY2006 through FY2010 and further \nrequired that 20 percent of the increase in agent manpower each fiscal \nyear be assigned to the northern border. However, nearly a third of \nthose agents have not been deployed to the northern border. According \nto the Congressional Research Service, the gap between the authorized \nlevel of Customs and Border Protection officers at the northern border \nand the actual number of officers deployed there will be roughly 1,517 \nin FY2008.\n  I am pleased that the Senate just passed the Graham-Pryor amendment \nthat will provide $3 billion for border security and 23,000 full time \nagents to our borders. I ask my friend from West Virginia, the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, is it the intent of the amendment to \nprovide those assets to both the northern and southern borders, and, to \nfurther implement the authorizations I mentioned, to deploy more agents \nto the northern border?\n  Mr. BYRD. I appreciate my friend from Michigan's concern about the \nnorthern border and tell him that yes, the amendment is meant to \nincrease staffing at both of our borders and it is not the intent of \nthe amendment to favor one border over the other. The Appropriations \nCommittee has been clear in its support for the Border Patrol and its \nmission of preventing entry into the Untied States of illegal aliens, \nterrorists, weapons of mass destruction and other illicit goods or \nindividuals. Further, in recognition of the importance of security at \nour northern border, the Appropriations Committee has directed the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to assign to the Northern Border 20 \npercent of the net increase in agents in fiscal year 2008.\n  Mr. TESTER. I thank Senator Byrd for this important clarification. I \nthank Senator Levin for being such a leader on this issue. I think it \nis important that people understand that this is not an issue that the \nnorthern states just decided to raise in the interest of getting our \nfair share. It is a matter of national security. The 9/11 Commission's \nreport cites a lack of balance in manpower between the northern and \nsouthern borders. They note that the would-be terrorists in the \nmillennium plot were detained on the northern border.\n  This is not about being parochial. This is about our national \nsecurity. This is about making sure that we have the resources to stop \na terrorist from bringing materials for a dirty bomb in from Canada. \nIt's about stopping the flow of illegal immigrants and illegal drugs \nlike meth and marijuana that come in from the north each year.\n  So I thank Chairman Byrd for clarifying that the additional Border \nPatrol personnel and funding contained in the Graham-Pryor amendment is \nnot just going to go to the southern border, but will go to both of our \nborders. This amendment is vital to our homeland security, and I think \nthat if the northern border gets 20 percent of the resources outlined \nin the amendment, we will have really done something significant to \nenhance the security of our 4,300 mile border with Canada. And so I \nthank the authors of the amendment, one of whom is here with us.\n  Senator Graham, can you clarify that the intent of your amendment was \nto make additional Border Patrol agents and funding available for both \nthe northern and southern border?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. My friend from Montana is correct. The intent of the \namendment was to improve our security and increase assets at both the \nnorthern and southern borders.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2481\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to explain my vote \nagainst the DeMint amendment no. 2481 to the Fiscal Year 2008 Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Act.\n  I voted against the DeMint amendment because it prohibited the \nSecretary from modifying the existing list of crimes disqualifying \nsomeone from receiving a Transportation Worker Identification \nCredential when circumstances warrant a regulatory change. Sound public \npolicy requires flexibility on such matters and Congress can rely on \nthe Secretary, a Cabinet official, to exercise sound discretion. If the \nSecretary fails to do so, Congress can always intervene and change the \nlaw.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I voted in favor of tabling the \nAlexander-Collins amendment on the REAL ID Act, Senate Amendment 2405, \nbecause I wanted to prevent reducing by almost 1 percent critical \nFederal spending on port and rail security, first responders' \nresources, and other homeland security protections. Rail infrastructure \nis the most widely attacked terrorist target in the world, and we must \nincrease, not decrease, funding for our railroads. Similarly, port \nsecurity is a top priority in our antiterrorism campaign, and I opposed \nthis effort to divert funding from protecting our ports. I appreciate \nthe work of my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee to \ncraft a balanced spending bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I support the fiscal year 2008 Department \nof Homeland Security, DHS, appropriations bill. The underlying \nlegislation provides $37.5 billion--$2.3 billion more than the \nPresident requested--to help DHS defend against what the recently \ndeclassified National Intelligence Estimate, NIE, concluded will be ``a \npersistent and evolving terrorist threat over the next three years.''\n  The President, however, has threatened to veto this bill and hold up \nessential security funding because its funding level is slightly above \nhis budget request. After years of underfunding homeland security, \ncutting taxes for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class, and \nfailing to veto one pork-laden spending bill passed by the GOP \nCongress, it is hard to take the President's sudden conversion to \nfiscal responsibility seriously. He has long since proven his appetite \nfor spending beyond our means and has lost the support of his fiscally \nconservative base.\n  In crafting this and other spending bills, the Democratically-\ncontrolled Congress is meeting our needs while adhering to pay-as-you-\ngo rules which will help stem the record deficits of the last 6 years. \nThis critical legislation funds important programs to protect the \nborder, improve aviation security, fund and train first responders, and \nprovide disaster relief to the States, and it does it without busting \nthe budget.\n  I am especially pleased that the bill provides $1 billion above the \nPresident's budget request for State and local grant programs such as \nthe Urban Area Security Initiative and Port Security Grant Program. \nThis will ensure that Massachusetts and other strategically important \nStates receive an increase in counterterrorism funding in 2008. I \nremained concerned, however, that DHS still does not award grants \nsolely according to risk. Given the sobering conclusions of the NIE, we \ncannot afford to misallocate homeland security grants. I thank Chairman \nByrd and Senator Cochran for accepting an amendment that I offered \nwhich requires the Government Accountability Office to review the \nmethodology the department uses to rank States and cities according to \nrisk. Congress needs to know this information so that it can make \ninformed decisions regarding the Department's grant policies.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Byrd and Senator Cochran for accepting \nmy amendment to create a pilot program to test automated document \nauthentication technology at ports of entry. The technology DHS uses to \nauthenticate foreign travel documents is unfortunately no better now \nthan on 9/11. It simply checks personal information against databases \nwhich we know are not always accurate. In keeping with the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission, this pilot program will \nhopefully compel DHS to deploy technology that can detect security \nfeatures and distinguish between real and fraudulent travel documents. \nDHS is spending millions to implement the US-VISIT\n\n[[Page S10114]]\n\nand Western Hemisphere Initiative but has yet to test technology that \ncan authenticate the documentation that visitors will be required to \nprovide under those programs. It is imperative that DHS conduct this \npilot program as soon as possible and improve its ability to detect \nfraudulent travel documents.\n  The Senate also adopted a bipartisan amendment to add $3 billion in \nemergency spending to help DHS hire more Border Patrol agents, \ndetention beds, and monitoring equipment along the border which we all \nagree it needs. This amendment, while important, is not a substitute \nfor finishing work on comprehensive immigration reform legislation, and \nI hope that Congress will revisit this important issue. Keeping 12 \nmillion undocumented workers in the shadows is neither good for our \neconomy or our security.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 2368 provides for the first time adequate funding \nfor agencies and programs within DHS. It would be irresponsible and \nreckless for the President to veto this bill, and I hope he reconsiders \nhis position.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will support final passage of the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill today because its funding is \nvital to our first responders and all of those responsible for \nprotecting us.\n  Although all Americans are united in our commitment to secure our \nhomeland, the administration's budget has too often not reflected that \ncommitment. In particular, we have not kept faith with our first \nresponders by giving them the tools they need, and we have not done \nenough to secure our borders. I am glad that this bill will make much \nneeded improvements on these and other issues.\n  The bill appropriates $37.6 billion for homeland security programs \nfor fiscal year 2008, which is an increase of $2.2 billion over the \nPresident's budget. Perhaps most significantly, the legislation \nprovides vital funding to our first responders to protect our country \nfrom a terrorist attack and ensure that we are able to respond \nadequately should such an attack occur. Specifically, it provides $525 \nmillion for the State Homeland Security Grant Program, $820 million for \nthe Urban Area Security Initiative, $700 million for the assistance to \nfirefighters grants and $300 million for emergency management \nperformance grants.\n  To secure our borders, a total of $10.2 billion is provided for \nCustoms and Border Protection. I am pleased that, in addition to the \nfunding in the underlying bill, the Senate also adopted an amendment to \nadd an additional $3 billion for border security which will enable the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to hire, train and deploy 23,000 \nadditional full-time boarder patrol agents and provide other essential \nsecurity measures at our borders. The legislation also provides $4.432 \nbillion for immigration and customs enforcement, including $146 million \nfor 4,000 new detention beds.\n  Finally, I want to note that the bill increases funding for the \nTransportation Security Administration by $164.6 million above last \nyear's level, which is $764 million more than requested by the \nPresident. It provides $529.4 million for the procurement and \ninstallation of explosive detection systems at airports.\n  The funding levels in this bill reflect our commitment to protecting \nthe American people, and I am hopeful they will be maintained in \nconference and that we can quickly get this legislation to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill now on the floor. As a member of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Homeland \nSecurity, I am proud of the bill we crafted. This bill will provide our \ncountry with more of the resources it needs to protect our communities \nand secure our residents.\n  Homeland security is particularly important to my home State. New \nJersey lost 700 people on 9/11 families torn apart and lives ended \nwithout ever seeing loved ones again.\n  And New Jersey is ripe with targets for terrorists, from our ports to \nour chemical plants. In fact, the FBI has stated that the most \ndangerous 2 miles in America for terrorism lie within the stretch of \nland from Port Newark to Newark Liberty International Airport.\n  The level of funding for the Department of Homeland Security directly \naffects the safety of residents in my State.\n  That is why I'm glad that this legislation would invest $37.6 billion \ninto making our homeland safer and more secure.\n  This figure is $2.2 billion more than what President Bush asked for. \nAnd because of that, the President is threatening to veto the bill. \nThis is astonishing and it is wrong--$2.2 billion is less money than we \nspend in 1 week in Iraq.\n  The Senate must stand up, pass this legislation, and begin to turn a \ncorner to provide more money to effectively defend our homeland.\n  In addition to more money for border security, this bill provides \ncritical funding for first responders, including $560 million for \nfirefighter equipment grants, $525 million for the State Homeland \nSecurity Grant Program--which is $275 million above the President's \nrequest--and $375 million for law enforcement and terrorism prevention \ngrants.\n  This bill also doubles port and rail security grants in the Bush \nproposal to $400 million.\n  The Port of New Jersey and New York is largest port on the east \ncoast--and the second-busiest container port in the country. Our ports \nin south Jersey are part of the Delaware River port system, which is \nthe busiest crude oil tanker port in the country. Through these ports, \nmany goods and materials transit to store shelves, gas pumps and \nfactory assembly lines in the towns and cities in the interior of our \ncountry. In short, our ports are essential to our economy.\n  And in 2006, Amtrak had record ridership of 25 million. Ridership is \nalready up in 2007 by 5 percent. On an average weekday, nearly a \nmillion New Jerseyans rely on our transit systems to get to work, \nincluding trains, buses, and light rail lines.\n  This funding for port and rail security is vital for our State.\n  In 2006, the President--with great fanfare--signed a port security \nwhich authorized $400 million for port security grants this year. But \nthen he failed to fund it.\n  The Senate is prepared to follow through on the promise of this vital \nfunding.\n  I am also proud that we are working to protect our homeland--and our \neconomy--from terrorists who set their sights on hazardous cargoes at \nsea.\n  Senators Inouye, Stevens and I introduced legislation earlier this \nyear to better protect maritime vessels carrying hazardous chemicals \nand petrochemicals. I am pleased that the committee has agreed with my \nrequest to include funding for maritime hazardous cargo protection--\nincluding liquefied natural gas--in this Homeland Security bill.\n  I am further pleased that the committee acknowledged in the Report \nfor this bill the need to expand the laboratory space at the \nTransportation Security Lab, TSL, in Pomona, NJ, in order to \naccommodate the Department's explosives detection equipment \ncertification program. This program certifies all explosives detection \nequipment used by the Transportation Security Administration, and \nprovides certifications to equipment vendors. It is clear that this \nfacility must be expanded to safely accommodate this important program.\n  Finally, I am glad the Senate is once again going on record to \nsupport my provision to protect the rights of states to pass chemical \nsecurity laws that are stronger than Federal regulations.\n  DHS recently put rules into effect for the Federal regulation of \nchemical plant security. But in doing so, the agency wants to preempt \nstates from enacting stronger chemical security laws. This is the wrong \napproach.\n  The language in the Homeland Security funding bill before us wisely \npreserves the right of states to adopt chemical security measures \nstronger than Federal regulations. This language is supported by the \nchairs of the 9/11 Commission, the National Governors Association, and \nthe National Conference of State Legislatures.\n  Simply put: preempting State laws would make the people of my State \nand other States less safe.\n  The language in this bill will allow States to go beyond the Federal \nregulations as long as there is no actual conflict with the federal \nregulations. This\n\n[[Page S10115]]\n\nmeans that unless it is impossible to comply with both State law and \nFederal law, the State law is not preempted.\n  Between the increases in funding for first responders, port, rail and \nmaritime security, and the protection of States rights to pass chemical \nsecurity laws that are stronger than Federal regulations, this is the \nright bill at the right time.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and I urge the \nPresident to sign it into law.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today marks an important milestone for \nthis Congress. It seems that after spending the first half of the year \nstaging political show-votes and investigations, our friends on the \nother side have woken up to the fact they only had two things to show \nfor it: an angrier base and a long to-do list. In the fog of battle \nthey forgot that getting things done in the Senate takes cooperation.\n  We have cooperated on this bill. And it is a lot better for it. I am \nextremely pleased the majority ultimately accepted Senator Graham's \nborder security amendment. We got the message last month: border \nsecurity first. And now, thanks to this effort, we will be delivering a \n$3 billion downpayment on a stronger border. I also appreciate Senator \nCornyn's insistence that interior enforcement be a part of that \nfunding. To us it's pretty simple: there is no homeland security \nwithout border security. We will continue to push this idea on the \nfloor of the Senate in the coming weeks and months. Today is just the \nbeginning.\n  A lesson we can learn from the last 6 months is that there is a cost \nto everything. And the cost of putting off legislating in favor of \naround-the-clock politics is that there isn't much to show for it in \nthe end.\n  It has been my view all along that we should have been working on \nappropriations bills all summer. Here we are almost in August and we \nhave only passed one. So we are looking at a potential train wreck in \nSeptember. But it is possible that if we work together, like we did \nthis time, we can still make good progress. And I hope we do.\n  A brief word about cloture. Look: anybody who has been in the Senate \nfor more than a week will tell you--if they are being honest--that 40 \nor so cloture votes in 6 months isn't a sign of minority obstruction; \nit is a sign of a majority that doesn't like the rules. The cloture \nclub shouldn't be the first option. It should be the last. Hopefully \ntoday's vote is also a sign that we are moving away from cloture as a \nfirst resort.\n\n  I hope the majority will follow through on a pledge that the senior \nSenator from Illinois made on the first day of the session. He said the \nAmerican people put Democrats in the majority ``to find solutions, not \nto play to a draw with nothing to show for it.'' Very well said.\n  My Republican colleagues hope we can operate this way. I think it \nwill be the best way to operate in the fall if we actually intend to \nlegislate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there are no further amendments, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the substitute, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 2383), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback), the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. \nColeman), the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott), and the Senator from \nArizona (Mr. McCain).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. \nColeman) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I know we are all tired and we have agreed \nto cut this short. But this 9/11 Commission bill is very important and \na part of it that we have talked about tonight and actually for the \nlast year is port security. All of us agreed once again tonight that we \nshould not allow convicted, serious felons to have access to secure \nareas of our ports. Unfortunately this amendment tonight was on an \nappropriations bill, and it restricted the use of funds for 1 year. We \nhave passed another time as part of the Safe Ports Act--94 to 2--to do \nthis same thing: to take the Department of Homeland Security \nregulations they passed after careful study and codify it into law. But \nthe 9/11 conference bill has come back to us and, once again, gutted \nthat provision.\n  The reason it has been gutted is this: Once we pass this conference \nreport the way it is, and it allows the Secretary to waive, to change, \nor to leave certain felonies that are listed, then it opens the whole \nregulatory process to lawsuit and challenge on a continuous basis.\n  We have voted in the open tonight to stop that from happening, to \nstop convicted felons from working in secure areas of our ports. My \nmotion tonight is very simple. It is to recommit this bill to committee \nto restore the amendment in the exact words that we have passed on the \nfloor and to avoid the watering down and the gutting of a very \nimportant port security measure.\n  The Senate has voted 93 to 1 tonight. The House voted last week on \nthe same measure 354 to 66.\n  What the 9/11 Commission bill does is allow the Secretary to \neliminate or change listed felonies, allowing TWIC cards, these secure \narea cards, to possibly be given to those who have been convicted of \nsmuggling, arson, kidnapping, rape, extortion, bribery, money \nlaundering, hostage taking, unlawful use of a firearm, drug dealing, \nimmigration violations, assault with intent to kill, robbery, \nfraudulent entry to a seaport or racketeering.\n  These are serious crimes. Although there is often talk of giving \npeople a second chance, that second chance should not come at the \nexpense of the security of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I send this motion to the desk, which they have, and \nask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] moves to \n     recommit H.R. 1, an act to provide for the implementation \n     of the recommendations of the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, to the \n     conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on \n     such bill, with an instruction that the conferees on the \n     part of the Senate insist on the matter contained in \n     section 1455 of the Senate engrossed amendment, which \n     prohibits the issuance of transportation security cards to \n     convicted felons.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to recommit this bill. \nIt is something that can be done quickly without delaying the final \npassage of this conference report, but it restores a very important \nprovision we all voted on. I hope we can all support this motion to \nrecommit.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, with respect to my friend from South \nCarolina, I rise to urge my colleagues to defeat this motion to \nrecommit.\n  Like all legislation that makes it out of both Chambers and onto the \nPresident's desk, this bill contains compromise. Compromises are at the \nheart of the legislative process, reconciling differences between the \nHouse and the Senate. In fact, this process is at the very heart of \nthis remarkable system our Founding Fathers designed for us. So it was \nwith this legislation.\n  In some cases, the House yielded to the Senate; in others, the Senate \nyielded to the House. That is why we have a conference report that, on \nbalance, will greatly strengthen our homeland security.\n  I would say to Senator DeMint that I supported his language in the \noriginal Senate bill. It was slightly modified in conference. That \nhappens. But we ended up with language that had the support of both \nDemocratic and Republican conferees in both the House and the Senate.\n  In my opinion, the difference is not great. We simply give the \nSecretary of Homeland Security the authority, with his judgment as the \nprotector of our homeland security, to decide when and if certain of \nthese enumerated convictions ought not any longer to be a prohibition \nto working in our ports.\n  I respect Senator DeMint's position, but what he has asked us to do \nis to recommit the bill and delay all of the improvements in security \nthat come with the underlying bill. So my colleagues will have to \nanswer the question about whether it is worth it, whether it is worth \ndelaying provisions that will ensure better security against attacks on \nairplanes, better security with regard to maritime and air cargo, \nbetter security against terrorists entering this country via, for \ninstance, the visa waiver program, better technology and support for \nour first responders, and a provision to provide immunity from \nliability for citizens who see what they take reasonably and in good \nfaith to be action that appears to them to be associated with a \nterrorist attack. We protect them from liability from those they are \ncomplaining against.\n  If we do not pass this legislation tonight and enable the House to \npass it next week, we are going to be delaying its movement to the \nPresident and its enactment into law.\n  So I respectfully oppose the motion and ask my colleagues to vote \nagainst recommittal.\n  I thank the Chair and yield back my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, thank you.\n  We have accomplished a lot today. We have had a few blowups but not \nfor long. That is the way it is. For those of us who have been here a \nwhile, this reminded us all of how we used to legislate. This is fun \nfor us legislators. It is great.\n  I am so happy we did not file cloture on this bill. We were able to \nwork through it. I would say that we have earned tomorrow off. I am \nanxious the people who have the important trip to Greenland will be \nable to do that. We will not be in session tomorrow. The next vote will \nbe on the children's health bill sometime Monday. We will do it Monday. \nThe first vote will be at about 5:15 or 5:30 on Monday night. I think \nthat should be about it. We will have this vote. We will finish this \nvote and one more, and then we will have some speeches, and that will \nbe it for the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The supporters of the motion have 2 minutes 12 \nseconds. The opponents of the motion have 1 minute 1 second.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S10117]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I describe some of the most \nimportant provisions in this legislation, I want to thank the 9/11 \nfamilies who have played a critical role throughout this process. They \nfirst pushed for the establishment of the 9/11 Commission and then \ncontinued their fight, now through three major pieces of legislation, \nto see that its recommendations became law.\n  I want to thank the majority leader of the Senate for his leadership \nin helping to get this legislation through the Congress, and through a \nlong but ultimately very productive conference.\n  I want to thank Senator Collins, Chairman Thompson, Senator Collins, \nCongressman King, and all of my colleagues on the conference \ncommittee--and their staffs--on both sides of the aisle, from all of \nthe relevant committees, and in both the House and the Senate for their \nwillingness to work\n\n[[Page S10118]]\n\nthrough some difficult but critical issues to make our country safer.\n  All of us have not been able to agree on everything in this \nlegislation, but most of us have agreed on most of it and that is why \nwe are able to get this comprehensive legislation to the Congress, and \nhopefully, very soon, to the President's desk.\n  While this Nation was born in conflict, it was founded and grew in \ncompromise--the melding of different threads of policy and personality \ninto a national fabric that covers and protects us all.\n  This legislation was also born of conflict--the attacks by Islamist \nextremist terrorists against us on 9/11, and our response to these \nterrorists grows stronger as we come together in legislation like this.\n  This comprehensive, bipartisan legislation will make our Nation \nstronger, our cities and towns more secure and our families safer. Let \nme cite a few of its most important points:\n  Security enhancement in the legislation:\n  First, this legislation will help close one of the most obvious, and \ndangerous vulnerabilities in our Nation's defenses--that is the \nmillions of cargo containers that flow into our country every year \nwithout being scanned and which could be the vehicle for bringing \ndangerous nuclear material into our country.\n  It requires that within 5 years, 100 percent of maritime cargo be \nscanned before it is loaded on ships in foreign ports bound for the \nUnited States. But it wisely gives the Secretary of Homeland Security \nthe authority to extend this deadline in 2-year increments if certain \nconditions important to our economy are not met. This has been a \ncontentious issue--but I believe this legislation strikes the right \nbalance between aggressively pushing for better security while ensuring \nthat we maintain a sensible approach.\n  This legislation also enhances security in nonaviation sectors that \nhave received far too little protection in our own country, even while \nterrorists have demonstrated a willingness to attack them abroad--most \nnotably in London and in Madrid. It requires that rail and transit \nsystems work with DHS to develop comprehensive risk assessments and \nsecurity plans, and authorizes more than $4 billion over 4 years for \nrail, transit, and bus security grants.\n  Keeping in mind that the 9/11 hijackers and Richard Reed, the shoe \nbomber, boarded commercial aircraft and traveled here legally, this \nlegislation will make it harder for terrorists to enter our country, by \nadding much needed security enhancements to the Visa Waiver Program. \nThese include a new electronic travel authorization system so that \ntravelers from visa waiver countries can be checked against terrorist \nwatch lists and improved reporting of lost and stolen passports.\n  This legislation also increases resources and staffing for the Human \nSmuggling and Trafficking Center and requires DHS to create a terrorist \ntravel program to develop strategies and ensure coordination among \nrelevant agencies involved with combating terrorist travel.\n  This legislation will also better secure our aviation system overall. \nIt authorizes important funding increases for critical aviation \nsecurity programs, like checkpoint screening, baggage screening and \ncargo screening on passenger aircraft. And it requires screening of all \ncargo carried onto passenger airlines within three years--again, \nclosing another glaring vulnerability in our defenses that terrorists \ncould exploit.\n  One of the critical failures of 9/11 was, of course, the failure to \nshare vital information--and improving information sharing was a key \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission.\n  While we have previously taken important steps to improve the unity \nof effort across intelligence agencies by creating the Director of \nNational Intelligence and the National Counter Terrorism Center, this \nlegislation moves the ball even further by strengthening the \nInformation Sharing Environment, ISE, which was also established in the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. It does so by \nextending the term of the ISE program manager and authorizing him or \nher to issue government-wide standards for information sharing, as \nappropriate, and rewarding government employees for sharing \ninformation.\n  And it will improve the sharing of information between the Federal \nGovernment and its State and local counterparts by codifying the new \nInteragency Threat Assessment Coordination Group, creating standards \nfor State and local fusion centers, and ensuring that they receive \nFederal support and personnel. These measures will help ensure that \nintelligence to fight terrorism and keep Americans safe is shared more \neffectively among all levels of government.\n  In addition to strengthening Federal, State and local governments, as \npart of the compromise that brought this bill to the floor, this \nlegislation will also provide legal protections to individuals who \nreport suspicious activities. People acting in good faith to avert what \nthey believe may be terrorist activity should not be punished for their \nvigilance.\n  Every citizen must observe his or her surroundings and be alert to \nsuspicious activity without the fear of being sued for their life \nsavings. That is why this bill grants immunity from lawsuits to those \nwho in good faith report behaviour that they reasonably suspect is \nrelated to possible terrorist activity. We want to encourage--not \ndiscourage--citizens, like the video store employee in New Jersey, who \nstepped forward and alerted authorities to evidence which helped \nunravel a planned attack on Fort Dix.\n  This legislation will also improve the very controversial process for \ndistributing homeland security grants, and just as importantly, it \nauthorizes $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2008, increasing to $3.6 billion \nby 2012--$13.78 billion over the next 5 years--so that we can reverse \nthe downward trend in funding for these programs that help State and \nlocal first preventers and responders do their jobs.\n  It authorizes for the first time the State Homeland Security Grant \nProgram and Urban Area Security Initiative, UASI, to provide funds to \nStates and high-risk urban areas to prevent, prepare, respond and \nrecover from acts of terrorism. And it does so in a way that, while \nproviding the vast majority of resources on the basis of risk, ensures \nthat we build up the capabilities of all the states, knowing that \nterrorist plots can develop in any part of the country.\n  This legislation wisely authorizes emergency management performance \ngrants and provides additional resources for this program--to assist \nStates in preparing for all-hazards to ensure that every State has the \nbasic capability to prepare for and respond to both man-made and \nnatural disasters.\n  Following the communications disasters of both 9/11 and Hurricane \nKatrina, this legislation also creates a dedicated emergency \ncommunications interoperability grant program to improve emergency \ncommunications systems at the local, State, and Federal levels. This is \nclearly one of the highest priorities for our Nation's first \nresponders--because it is necessary to save their lives so that they \ncan save the lives of others--and by dedicating a program to \ninteroperable communications we will enhance our Nation's ability to \nachieve it.\n  The 9/11 Commission rightly noted that while we must protect our \nhomeland, we must do so in a way that also protects the freedom and \ncivil liberties it was founded upon.\n  This legislation does so by strengthening the Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board by establishing it as an independent agency \nwithin the executive branch, ensuring partisan balance among members, \nrequiring improved public disclosure, allowing the board to request \nthat the Attorney General issue subpoenas to private parties and \nincreasing its budget over the next 4 years by up to $10 million in \n2011.\n  It also requires that agencies with intelligence and security roles \ndesignate their own internal privacy and civil liberties officers, and \nexpands the authority of the DHS privacy officer.\n  Also, since 85 percent of our Nation's critical infrastructure is \nunder the control of the private sector, this legislation establishes a \nvoluntary certification program so that those private sector entities \nthat want to can receive certification that they have met consensus \npreparedness standards. This provision responds to another concern of \nthe 9/11 Commission--which was also\n\n[[Page S10119]]\n\nreinforced during Katrina--that those companies that take preparedness \nseriously--that have plans and exercise them that provide life saving \nprotection for their employees--will recover more quickly from a \ncatastrophe and help get their local economy moving again.\n  This legislation responds directly to another 9/11 Commission \nrecommendation--to improve Congress's ability to oversee the \nintelligence community--by requiring disclosure of the total amount \nspent by the intelligence community.\n  After the first 2 fiscal years the President may waive this \nrequirement, but only after explaining to Congress why the disclosure \nwould harm national security.\n  Like the 9/11 Commission, this bill also recognizes that we must do \nmore to promote democracy abroad by requiring the Secretary of State \nexpand strategies for democracy promotion in nondemocratic and \ndemocratic countries.\n  One of the great threats of our time is that nuclear material may be \nsmuggled out of former Soviet states and fall into the hands of \nterrorists. This bill clears legislative obstacles that had constrained \nthe cooperative threat reduction, CTR, program by repealing or \nmodifying various conditions on CTR actions in former Soviet states and \nrepealing a legislative prohibition on Department of Energy \nnonproliferation program assistance outside the former Soviet Union.\n  I want to thank my colleagues from both parties, from both houses, \nand their staffs who worked so hard and so late into so many nights to \nbring this to the floor. There is a lot in this legislation to make our \ncountry safer, and this result was only possible because of this hard \nwork and dedication.\n  Mr. President, we began as a nation born in conflict as we fought for \nour freedom. Now we are a nation borne with confidence as we fight for \nour ideals against an adversary who promotes hate over hope and fear \nover a future that recognizes our shared humanity.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this conference report and the \nPresident to act swiftly to sign it to show the world that the spirit \nof this nation founded in freedom heeds the words of Abraham Lincoln \nthat this ``government of the people, by the people, for the people, \nshall not perish from the Earth.''\n  Lincoln was right. Let us protect our Nation. Let us thwart our \nenemies.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank my colleagues for the very strong vote \nin favor of accepting the conference report. It means a lot to those of \nus who worked on it. I obviously also think it was the right thing to \ndo. This is comprehensive, bipartisan legislation that will make \nAmerica stronger, our cities and towns more secure, and our families \nsafer.\n  I want to take a moment to thank some of the people without whom this \nsuccessful result could not have occurred. I want to begin by thanking \nthe 9/11 families--the families of those who were lost on 9/11, the \nvictims of this brutal Islamist terrorist attack. They took their loss \nand grief and came to Congress to do everything it could to make sure \nthat our Government acted in a way so as to protect every other \nAmerican family from having to suffer the loss they suffered. They \nlobbied for the 9/11 Commission. It was created. When the commission \nreported out and the legislation it recommended was brought before the \nCongress in 2004, the 9/11 families hung in there. Without their \nsupport, it would not have been adopted and then signed by the \nPresident.\n  Now we return for the second phase of the 9/11 Commission report to \nadopt, as we just have, those previously unimplemented sections, \ninadequately implemented sections or, frankly, our own ideas about how \nto better protect the American people from the ongoing threat from al-\nQaida and other Islamist extremist organizations and, at the same time, \nfrom natural disasters, some catastrophic like Hurricane Katrina. The \n9/11 families deserve our gratitude.\n  I also thank Senator Reid because he made this legislation a priority \nitem for this session of Congress. I thank Senator Collins, my ranking \nmember who, as always, was thoughtful, constructive, wonderful to work \nwith, and set a tone where all the members of our committee worked very \nclosely together to produce this legislation.\n  On the House side, in conference, we met with the chairman of the \nHomeland Security Committee, Congressman Bennie Thompson of \nMississippi, and his ranking member Congressman Peter King of New \nYork--good public servants. We had some differences, but we reasoned \ntogether and resolved a lot of them.\n  I would like to pay tribute to my staff, who have worked long nights \nand many weekends to produce excellent legislation.\n  I particularly want to thank my Homeland Security Committee Staff \nDirector, Mike Alexander, for his superb leadership. I also want to \nthank the committee's Chief Counsel, Kevin Landy, for helping to \nshepherd the legislation through the process. Thanks also to Eric \nAnderson, Christian Beckner, Caroline Bolton, Janet Burrell, Scott \nCampbell, Troy Cribb, Aaron Firoved, Elyse Greenwald, Beth Grossman, \nSeamus Hughes, Holly Idelson, Kristine Lam, Jim McGee, Sheila Menz, \nLarry Novey, Deborah Parkinson, Leslie Phillips, Alistair Reader, \nPatricia Rojas, Mary Beth Schultz, Adam Sedgewick, Todd Stein, Jason \nYanussi, and Wes Young--all on my committee staff. And thanks to Purva \nRawal and Vance Serchuk on my personal office staff.\n  I must also thank Senator Collins' staff director, Brandon Milhorn, \nas well as Andy Weis, Rob Strayer, and the Senator's entire staff for \nworking with us to move this very important legislation.\n  And of course, thank you to our colleagues and thanks to the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  There were an enormous number of committees involved in this \nlegislation, in some ways even more than in the first 9/11 legislation. \nSo it took a lot of cooperation, which is the essence of getting \nanything done and, obviously, bipartisan cooperation to bring us to \nthis point.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Collins, Chairman Thompson, Congressman King, \nand all our colleagues on the conference committee and their staff on \nboth sides of the aisle from all the relevant committees in both the \nHouse and Senate for their willingness to work through some difficult, \nbut critical, issues to make our country safe.\n  I have a particular debt of gratitude to my own Homeland Security \nstaff: staff director Michael Alexander; chief counsel Kevin Landy; and \nSenator Collins' staff, beginning with staff director Brandon Milhorn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, after the terrible attacks of September \n11, 2001, Congress moved to strengthen America. Congress created the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and Senator Lieberman and I led a \nbipartisan effort to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission--reforming our intelligence community, creating a Director \nof National Intelligence, and establishing the National \nCounterterrorism Center. We have also passed legislation to strengthen \nsecurity at America's seaports and chemical facilities and to reform \nFEMA.\n  These were great advances in protecting our country. But as the \nrecently released National Intelligence Estimate noted, the United \nStates faces a ``persistent and evolving terrorist threat.'' Foremost \namong those threats is al-Qaida, which continues to plot attacks \nagainst us. We also face a growing threat of homegrown terrorism--\nviolent radicals inspired by al-Qaida's perversion of the Islamic \nfaith, but with no operational connection to foreign terrorist \nnetworks.\n  These real and evolving threats mean that we cannot stop improving \nour existing security arrangements, or ignore needs and opportunities \nto adopt new measures. Congress has, in fact, already enacted most of \nthe 9/11 Commission recommendations, but our security must continually \nimprove to meet the advances of our enemies.\n  The conference report that we consider today builds on our prior \nwork, offering important enhancements to our homeland security.\n  Notably, the conference report will protect concerned citizens from \ncivil liability when they make good-faith reports of suspicious \nactivity that could threaten our transportation system. This provision, \nbased on legislation\n\n[[Page S10120]]\n\nthat I coauthored with Senators Lieberman and Kyl, also wisely protects \nsecurity officials who take reasonable steps to respond to reports of \nsuspicious activity.\n  Vigilant citizens should not have to worry about being dragged into \ncourt, hiring defense attorneys, and incurring big legal bills, because \nthey did their civic duty by reporting a possible threat. The bill's \nprotective language reinforces the important message that New York \ntransit passengers see every day: ``If you see something, say \nsomething.'' And with TSA recently reporting possible ``dry run'' \nefforts to pass simulated bomb components through airport security, it \nis more urgent than ever that we remove any deterrents to citizens \nmaking their concerns known to authorities.\n\n  Another important aspect of the bill is its creation of a sensible \nformula for homeland security grant programs. We know two critical \nthings about the prevention of, and response to, terrorist attacks: \none, the attacks can be planned and executed anywhere and two, State \nand local agencies are likely to be the first and most urgently needed \nresponders.\n  The compromise reached on minimum levels of grant funding will help \nensure a strong baseline of capabilities across the Nation, helping to \nprevent the next terrorist attack before it occurs. Terror plots can \nemerge from any location. Planning, training, and logistics for these \nattacks often occur far from the location of the terrorists' final \ntarget and, in some cases, are preceded by other local criminal \nactivities. And, as the most recent National Intelligence Estimate on \nthis threat assessed:\n\n       The ability to detect broader and more diverse terrorist \n     plotting in this environment will challenge current US \n     defensive efforts and the tools we use to detect and disrupt \n     plots. It will also require greater understanding of how \n     suspect activities at the local level relate to strategic \n     threat information and how best to identify indicators of \n     terrorist activity in the midst of legitimate interactions.\n\n  Much of the work to prevent homegrown terror plots--like the thwarted \nattempt to attack Fort Dix, NJ will occur at the State and local level. \nThis legislation ensures adequate funding for prevention efforts in all \nour States.\n  Effective response, of course, requires that emergency workers and \nofficials be able to talk with one another. The Senate Homeland \nSecurity Committee's investigation into the Hurricane Katrina \ncatastrophe revealed many instances of tragic failures to deliver \ntimely assistance to victims simply because communications systems were \ndamaged or not interoperable. State and local governments recognize the \nproblem. That is why DHS receives more requests for funding to upgrade \nand purchase emergency communications equipment and systems under the \nState Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Area Security \nInitiative than for any other purpose.\n\n  We should, therefore, take special notice of this bill's provision \nfor a dedicated grant program at the Department of Homeland Security to \nenhance emergency communications interoperability. With an \nauthorization of $2 billion over 5 years, this critical program will \nfund development of a robust, national emergency communications network \nto assist emergency personnel whether they are responding to a \nterrorist attack, a tornado, a flood, an earthquake, or an ice storm.\n  The conference report also contains important provisions that will \nstrengthen the intelligence functions at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and will improve the sharing of information related to \nhomeland security threats among Federal, State, local, and tribal \nofficials.\n  Senator Lieberman and I helped establish the Information Sharing \nEnvironment in the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. This program is an \nessential element in promoting homeland security information sharing \nacross the Federal Government and with our State and local partners. \nThe conference report makes important improvements to the Information \nSharing Environment--extending the tenure of the program manager, \nenhancing his authority to further develop and coordinate information-\nsharing efforts governmentwide, and providing additional guidance \nconcerning the operation of the ISE.\n  The conference report will improve the operations of the intelligence \ncomponents of the Department of Homeland Security. Through the creation \nof an Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis charged with \nstrategic oversight of the intelligence components of the Department, \nthe bill will improve the coordination of the Department's intelligence \nactivities.\n  Whether homeland security information or national intelligence is \ncollected by Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, or the Coast \nGuard, this information must be efficiently and effectively identified, \nprocessed, analyzed, and disseminated. The conference report charges \nthe Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis with responsibilities \nfor improving the sharing of information, training Department employees \nto recognize the intelligence value of the information they receive \nevery day, and providing important budget guidance to the intelligence \ncomponents of the Department.\n\n  The legislation will also improve the Department's ability to provide \nuseful information to State and local officials and provide feedback on \nthe value of the information they share with the Department.\n  It is important to recognize the tremendous effort and good work that \nhas already gone into establishing fusion centers across the country. \nState governments, in particular, are devoting considerable resources \nto establishing fusion centers. I believe this demonstrates the value \ngovernment entities and the private sector place on establishing \nmechanisms to integrate information and intelligence to protect against \nall kinds of threats.\n  The legislation establishes a DHS State, Local, and Regional Fusion \nCenter Initiative whereby DHS will make available federal intelligence \nofficers and analysts to assist the work of fusion centers. It also \ndirects the Secretary of DHS to establish guidelines for fusion centers \nthat seek Federal funding.\n  These guidelines are not meant to step on State toes, but to ensure \nthat a fusion center has a clear mission statement and goals, \nincorporates performance measures, adheres to a privacy and civil \nliberties policy, ensures that all personnel receive training on \nprivacy and civil liberties, has in place appropriate security \nmeasures, and provides usable intelligence products to its \nstakeholders.\n  Most fusion centers are established and operated by States. However, \nif federal funding is going to support these centers, we should ensure \nthat they are operated in a responsible manner and in a way that \nensures efficient information exchange with the Federal Government and \nwith other fusion centers.\n  The bill also encourages deeper cooperation with State and local \nofficials, by authorizing exchange programs that will send Federal \nintelligence analysts to state and local fusion centers, and by \nbringing the expertise of state and local officials to DHS and the \nNational Counterterrorism Center.\n\n  Transportation security is another area that will be strengthened \nunder the terms of this bill. Last year's SAFE Port Act made \nsignificant improvements to maritime security. This conference report \nbolsters the security of other transportation modes, including \naviation, railroads, and mass transit. For example, the bill requires \nelectronic screening of information on l00 percent of air cargo loaded \non passenger planes through a known-shipper program. It also authorizes \nmore than $1 billion annual funding for rail and mass transit grants.\n  The bill also enhances security in the Visa Waiver Program. It \nrestricts expansion of the program until DHS can effectively track \nentries and exits from our country. And it encourages foreign \ngovernments' cooperation with U.S. counterterrorism efforts and \ninformation-sharing initiatives, including timely reporting of lost and \nstolen passports.\n  I finally note two other important sections of the conference report.\n  First, the legislation recognizes that security enhancements should \nnot come at the expense of our rights to privacy or our civil \nliberties. The legislation enhances the authority of the Privacy and \nCivil Liberties Oversight\n\n[[Page S10121]]\n\nBoard and mandates important privacy and civil liberties training for \nofficials working at fusion centers.\n  Second, the conference report will establish an international science \nand technology R program with our allies in the global war on terror, \nproviding money for joint homeland security ventures and facilitating \ntechnology transfers.\n  All of the provisions I have mentioned are worthy additions within \nthe letter or spirit of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. I \ncontinue, however, to have considerable concerns about other portions \nof the conference report.\n  Above all, I am disappointed that the House amendment mandating \nscanning of l00 percent of maritime containers was adopted by the \nconference committee, overturning the risk-based, layered security \nsystem enacted just last year as part of the SAFE Port Act. Based on \ncurrent technology, this proposal is not practical because of the huge \nvolume--11 million containers per year--coming into our seaports. It \nwill divert resources from the focus on high-risk cargo and will likely \ncause considerable backlogs at our ports, disrupting trade and posing \nproblems for businesses relying on just-in-time inventories.\n  My reservations on that point prevented me from signing the \nconference report.\n  While the proposed report makes important improvements to our \nnational preparedness, I fear that its language on private-sector \npreparedness could short-circuit the progress that DHS and the private \nsector have already made in the recent release of all 17 sector-\nspecific plans under the National Infrastructure Protection Program. I \nalso believe that, at this time, Congress has insufficient data to \nwarrant mandating a new private-sector preparedness certification \nprogram.\n  Now that the conference report has reached the floor of the Senate, \nhowever, I must weigh my concerns with this legislation against the \nbenefits that it undoubtedly offers. Because I believe the net benefits \nto our homeland security are substantial, I intend to support final \npassage of the conference report.\n\n  I close by offering my congratulations and appreciation to Senator \nLieberman for his efforts to advance this legislation.\n  I also thank my staff who worked so hard on this legislation: Brandon \nMilhorn, Andy Weis, Rob Strayer, Amy Hall, Jane Alonso, Asha Mathew, \nKate Alford, Melvin Albritton, John Grant, Amanda Wood, Mark LeDuc, \nSteve Midas, Leah Nash, Patrick Hughes, Jen Tarr, Clark Irwin, Emily \nMeeks, Douglas Campbell, and Neil Cutter.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Lieberman on his outstanding \nleadership on this bill. This was truly a bipartisan effort in a \nCongress that has seen precious few bipartisan bills taken to \ncompletion. I join him in thanking our staffs on both sides of the \naisle. They worked extremely hard. This was a very difficult bill \nbecause it involved many different issues, complex issues, and also \njurisdictions that overlapped various committees, and that always is \ndifficult in the Senate to resolve.\n  I do want to touch again on three points. First, this bill builds \nupon legislation that Senator Lieberman and I authored in 2004, the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act. This bill implemented \nthe vast majority of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. It \ncreated, for example, the Director of National Intelligence. It \nestablished the National Counterterrorism Center. It set forth \nstandards for information sharing. That legislation has made a real \ndifference. In fact, last summer when the plot which was hatched in \nGreat Britain against our airliners was thwarted, Secretary Chertoff \ntold me he believed the reforms we put into place through the \nIntelligence Reform Act of 2004 helped connect the dots, and \ninformation was shared with our allies and helped lead to the detection \nand the thwarting of that plot. So that made a difference.\n  Nevertheless, there were some areas where we hadn't finished the job, \nand this bill will help take us further down the road.\n  I want to highlight a second point, and this is the provision that is \nin this bill that I think is absolutely critical and will help to \nincrease the safety of our country.\n  A recently released National Intelligence Estimate noted that the \nUnited States continues to face a persistent and evolving terrorist \nthreat, and foremost among these threats is, of course, al-Qaida which \ncontinues to plot attacks against us.\n  We also face a growing threat of homegrown terrorism, violent \nradicals inspired by al-Qaida but not necessarily linked directly to \nal-Qaida. These real and evolving threats mean we cannot stop improving \nour existing security arrangements or ignore needs and opportunities to \nadopt new measures.\n  Most notably, this conference report will protect concerned citizens \nfrom civil liability when they in good faith report suspicious activity \nto the authorities. This provision, which is based on legislation that \nI coauthored with Senators Lieberman and Kyl, also wisely protects \nsecurity officials who take reasonable steps to respond to reports of \nsuspicious activity.\n  Vigilant citizens should not have to worry that if in good faith they \nreport suspicious activity that may indicate a terrorist threat, the \nresult is going to be they are dragged into court, have to hire defense \nattorneys, incur big legal bills, just because they did what we would \nwant them to do. The New York subway has signs saying: ``See something, \nsay something.'' And with TSA recently reporting possible dry run \nefforts to pass simulated bomb components through airport security, it \nis more urgent than ever that we remove any deterrence to citizens \nmaking their concerns known to authorities. I think these are very \nimportant provisions in this bill.\n  Finally, let me comment on one provision in this bill that is of \ngreat disappointment to me. I am very disappointed that the final \nversion of this bill mandates scanning of 100 percent of maritime \ncontainers. That overturns the risk-based, layered security system \nenacted just last year as part of the SAFE Port Act. Based on current \ntechnology, this proposal is simply not practical because of the huge \nvolume, some 11 million containers per year, coming into our seaports. \nIt will divert resources from the focus on high-risk cargo, and it will \nlikely cause considerable backlogs at our ports, disrupting trade, and \nposing problems for businesses that rely on just-in-time inventories.\n  My reservations about these provisions prevented me from signing the \nconference report. But on balance, this is a very good bill. It \ncontains a lot of provisions that I think will improve our homeland \nsecurity and, in the end, I am pleased to vote for it, and I am \ndelighted with the strong vote for its passage tonight.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator Lieberman \nand Senator Collins for their hard work on this bill. I think we \nshouldn't be so quick to pat ourselves on the back as far as the 9/11 \nCommission. The No. 1 thing the 9/11 Commission said is, the money that \nis spent on protecting this country ought to be based on risk. Fifty \npercent of the money in this bill is not based on risk. It is based on \npolitical calculations, on each one of us getting so much money for our \nState. That is absolutely wrong.\n  There are a lot of good provisions in this bill, I don't disagree \nwith that point. But when we take $14 billion over the next 5 years for \ngrants and say $7 billion of it isn't going to go based on the highest \nrisk in this country, it is going to solve the political problems that \nMembers of both the House and Senate have in terms of bringing home the \nbacon rather than putting that money where it should be put. What if \nsomething happens between now and the next 4 years and we could have \nspent the money in the high-risk areas, but we chose not to because we \nignored it and we spent the money elsewhere taking care of our own \npolitical needs rather than the needs of our country?\n  The second point that ought to be made, and Senator Collins made this \npoint, is, it is absolutely impossible for us, over the next 3 years, \nto screen 100 percent of the cargo. Yet that is what we have mandated. \nIn fact, we are going to take a very effective high-risk program right \nnow, and we are going to stop it and we are going to go to 100 percent \nscreening. In the meantime, we are going to screen 50 percent of it, \nand we are not going to look at the high-\n\n[[Page S10122]]\n\nrisk cargo. What we are doing with this bill on cargo is making our \ncountry less safe. It doesn't fit with any common sense, but yet that \nis what we have done because a majority of us want to answer the \nemotional call for 100 percent screening when, in fact, the scientists \nand people trained to protect us tell us that is not the way to go. We \nreversed, and we walked away from what we were told by the experts to \ndo.\n  What do we know about grants? What we know is that of the $10 billion \nwe have already given in grants, 30 percent of it was wasted, and we \ndon't know about the other 70 percent because there are only eight \npeople in the whole Department of Homeland Security who look at the $10 \nbillion we have spent. And we are going to spend $14 billion.\n  We did get in some post-grant review, but there is no rigorous \nassessment and transparency of how the money is going to be spent. So \nit is going to go out there, and we are never going to know if it did \nthe right thing.\n  On our track record for the $10 billion we have already spent, 30 \npercent of it we know failed, and 30 percent we know didn't go for \nlegitimate homeland security items. And we don't have and didn't put \nthe resources in this bill, if we are going to spend $14 billion over \nthe next 5 years on grants, to make sure that money goes to do what it \nis supposed to do. So we are creating problems and taking money and not \nspending it in the way that is most appropriate, and that is what the \nHomeland Security said.\n  The other point the 9/11 Commission said is we ought to reorganize \nhow we oversight intelligence. We didn't do any of that recommendation. \nWe didn't do any of it. They also commented that we have to have the \noversight and priorities, that you don't fight turf battles but what \nyou do is fight the terrorists. This bill is loaded with turf battles \nwhere money is spent, ordered, and managed by one department, but the \nchecks are cut somewhere else; not because that is the way to do it, \nbut because we are protecting some politicians' turf in terms of \ncontrolling the money. I think that does not reflect well.\n\n  There is another interesting item we have created. We created a \nweapons of mass destruction czar and commission in this bill. That may \nbe a good idea. I am not sure I disagree with that. But we also said to \nthat czar--this is going to be a White House position--anything you \ntell the President, you cannot tell him in confidence. We gutted \nexecutive privilege to have an adviser to the President on weapons of \nmass destruction to have the confidence that what he says to the \nPresident in private, in confidence for the best part of this country, \nwill become available to all of us.\n  First of all, no President is ever going to fill this position \nbecause they are not about to have an adviser behind them advising them \nwho cannot give a clear, concrete recommendation without it being \nsecond-guessed by somebody on the outside knowing what they are saying. \nIt goes against all common sense.\n  Finally, what we have done is we have taken our black box \nintelligence numbers, and we are going to tell the world what they are, \nwhich is crazy. We are going to tell the world how much money we spend \non covert activities, and we are going to share that with them. We \nshouldn't be sharing that information. That information should not be \nout there, and yet we have decided to do it to our own disadvantage.\n  I know there has been great work put in on this bill both by Chairman \nLieberman and Ranking Member Collins, and I appreciate it.\n  One final point that I will mention. We had in our bill some \noversight in the BBG, the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Here is what \nwe know about Farsi Voice of America TV and Arabic TV. What we know is \nmost of the time they are not presenting America's viewpoint. They are \npresenting our enemy's viewpoint, and we know this because my office \nhas been translating and having translated their broadcasts. We put \ninto the bill to have those translations become public as a part of \nBBG, and that got rejected.\n  So we are going to continue to have a foreign policy where we are \npaying money to have radio programs go into Iran that are counter to \nwhat our own policies are, and yet we are not going to have \naccountability in this bill, to hold BBG accountable. It is not there. \nIt has been taken away.\n  Transparency is a great thing for this country, and when we spend \nmoney to create an American position in a foreign land, to not have \ntranscripts and for them to not want us to have transcripts of what is \ngoing on, the first thing one has to ask is, Why not? Why shouldn't \nAmerican taxpayers know where they are spending their money and know \nwhat the message is that they are sending? Unless the message is \nsomething different than what it should be. And that is the case with \nRadio Farsi and Radio Farda.\n\n  There are several other things I will not spend any more time on but \nthat I think the American people ought to ask themselves. Last year, \n$434 billion on credit cards was charged to our grandkids. We have $14 \nbillion worth of grants in this bill over the next 5 years; $7 billion \nthat we don't know if it is going to be spent well. We certainly don't \nknow if it is truly going to be spent on homeland security and at a \npriority of what is best and what is based on the highest risk.\n  So I am disappointed that we didn't get a lot of things in the bill \nthat we should, and I know this is an effort at compromise, but it \nseems to me that certain things that are common sense, such as spending \nmoney to make sure our message is right, and knowing that it is right; \nmaking sure we are spending the money where the highest risk is, rather \nthan where the greatest political need is, ought to have been \nprinciples that should have gotten into this bill.\n  I voted against this bill not because I don't think we should be \nprotecting the homeland, not because I don't think we should be \nfollowing these recommendations but because we have ignored the No. 1 \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission, which is the money ought to go \nwhere the risk is. We ignored it. We ignored it. We played the \npolitical game that makes us all happy, but we didn't fix the problem. \nIf we have another event where we should have put the money, then how \nwill we answer that? How will we answer that?\n  They didn't say some of the money should go to the highest risk. They \nsaid all the money should go to the highest risk. What we have are \nthree grant programs, one of which is very good at risk and two of \nwhich are not. So we ought to ask ourselves: Have we done the best we \ncould have done?\n  The effort by Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins was \nextraordinary. We had great debate in our committee on a lot of these \nissues. By the way, they supported me in these things. We didn't get \nthem out of conference. The question we are going to be judged on is \nhow effective we did this. My hope was and my feeling is we could have \ndone better.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oklahoma. The \ntruth is the Senate is a better place because he is here, he is \npersistent, he is demanding, he spends a lot of time actually reading \nbills, and he brings his opinions to the table and to the floor. \nAlthough we may be in disagreement on some of the particulars, he cares \nenough about all this to not only work through the details but to stay \nhere after midnight, after a busy week, to make these points. So I \nthank him for all that.\n  I thank him for the contributions he made along the way to the bill \nas a member of our committee. I am going to put some statements in the \nrecord to respond to some of the points in more detail that Senator \nCoburn made, but I do wish to say that Senator Collins and I worked \nvery hard, both in the committee and then particularly in the \nconference committee, to take the State homeland security grants and \nmake sure that they were allocated, a much greater percentage of them \nwas allocated based on risk.\n  We heard the concerns. So the conference report allocates the \noverwhelming share of State funding based on the risk the State faces \nfrom terrorism. All States initially will be guaranteed a minimum of \n0.375 percent. The number was up to .75 percent earlier on. This will \nbe reduced to .35 percent over the course of the 5 years.\n  The reason for having any minimum is twofold: One is that, \nunfortunately, the enemy we face--Islamist extremist terrorism--has a \nhigher probability of\n\n[[Page S10123]]\n\nattacking, at least by our experience in this country, very visible \ntargets, such as the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. But the truth \nis the whole country is, unfortunately, vulnerable to their attacks. As \nwe have seen in other countries, they attack trains, they are prepared \nto blow up themselves with bombs in the middle of shopping areas, in \ncrowds, et cetera. So there is some reason to have a minimum amount for \nevery State in the country.\n  Secondly, homeland security generally--and we particularly get into \nthis in one of the other grant programs that I will talk about in a \nminute--deals not only with protecting the States from terrorism but \nfrom all hazards, including natural disasters. The Department of \nHomeland Security is an all-hazard agency now, including within it, \nmost particularly, FEMA, the Coast Guard, and other agencies that are \ninvolved when you think more in terms of protection from natural \ndisasters. So I think we have made some progress there, and that is the \nreason why we have done what we have done.\n  There is a separate program, which perhaps is the one Senator Coburn \nwas referring to, the urban area security initiative. That is allocated \nentirely based on risk. We also create, for the first time, two \nprograms that are intended to be all-hazard programs and to support law \nenforcement and emergency response around the country. The first is an \nEmergency Management Grant Program and the second, which we talked \nabout earlier, is the interoperability of communications.\n  So I think, on balance, when it comes to terrorism, we have allocated \nmuch more now than before based on risk. Yet we also, I think quite \nappropriately, provide something for areas all around the country to \ndeal with all the other hazards, natural disasters, that can and have \nstruck every section of the country.\n  There is also a substantial increase in funding that is authorized by \nthis bill. Of course, ultimately, it has to be appropriated, but this \nis a new challenge, this terrible challenge of terrorism, against an \nunconventional brutal enemy, which, as someone other than myself has \nsaid, hates us more than they love their own lives. They hate us more \nthan they love their own lives, so that they are prepared to kill \nthemselves to express their hatred of us. Of course, these are not \nconventional armies fighting our conventional Army on a field of battle \nor at sea or in the air.\n\n  These are enemies who strike from the shadows and intend to strike at \nunprotected civilians--at innocents. So this requires a substantial \ncommitment by our country to raise our defenses. I think it is part of \nthe reason, along with the reform of our intelligence apparatus, that \nwe have not, thank God, suffered another terrorist attack since 9/11. \nPart of it, of course, is good fortune, or, if you are so inclined, by \nthe grace of God. But I do believe what we have invested is an \nimportant part of it.\n  I myself have said more than once that I thought after 9/11, entering \nthis new era of both homeland security needs and the need to involve \nour military in seeking out for the purpose of capturing or killing \nthese terrorists, then being engaged in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, \nthat we would have done better if we had considered a special tax and \none in which we asked everybody to pay to meet the additional expenses \nbrought on by this war that Islamist terrorists started against us, so \nwe would not be facing the increasing long-term debt that Senator \nCoburn is quite right that our children are going to have to pay.\n  What I am saying is the money we have authorized to be spent here is \nimportant. We have the best defense--the best military in the world. \nPart of the reason we do is because we are spending money on it, an \nenormous amount of money. We will continue to have the best homeland \nsecurity and homeland defense if we do the same.\n  One of the great contributions Senator Coburn makes is to be very \npersistent at making sure we don't waste taxpayer money, and he has \nmade a contribution to this bill. There are many provisions in the bill \nthat improve the oversight of the spending of homeland security funds, \nand in my statement I make clear our gratitude to Senator Coburn and \nhis staff for all that they did to strengthen the auditing provisions \nof this bill.\n  I will say, finally, on the question of congressional oversight of \nintelligence and the declassification of the top line of the national \nintelligence budget, this is a direct recommendation of the 9/11 \nCommission. It doesn't make it sacrosanct, but it does give it some \nforce. They argued that the specifics of the intelligence \nappropriations should remain classified, as they do in this proposal, \nbut that the top line ought to be publicized to combat the secrecy and \ncomplexity the Commission had commented on earlier. That is what we \nintend to do.\n  But we are mindful of the concerns that Senator Coburn and others \nhave had. We have spent some time discussing this with members of the \nadministration, and this is compromise language. The bill contains this \nprovision, which is that the President would be required to disclose \nthe total appropriated amount for the national intelligence budget for \nthis year and the coming year, after which the President may waive this \nrequirement by sending to Congress a notification explaining the \nreasons for this waiver.\n  Listen, I think most people, including most people in the media, know \nwhat the top line budget for intelligence is. But we are now bringing \nit out and giving the President the opportunity to stop the disclosure \nif he determines it is in the national security interest in future \nyears, for various reasons, to do that.\n  The conference report addresses the oftentimes contentious issue of \nhomeland security grants. It may not make everyone happy, but it \nrepresents a good and fair compromise and will do much to improve the \nprocess by which these grants are distributed and used.\n  The conference report allocates a greater share--indeed the \noverwhelming share--of state funding based on the risk a state faces \nfrom terrorism, yet still ensures that each state will get money to \nmeet its basic needs in preparing for acts of terrorism. All States \nwill initially be guaranteed a minimum of 0.375 percent of funds; this \nwill be reduced to 0.35 percent over the course of 5 years.\n  Urban Area Security Initiative, UASI, grants will be allocated \nentirely based on risk of terrorism. There will be a two-step process \nfor selecting UASI cities. In the first stage, DHS will do a risk \nassessment of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the country, and \neach of these areas will be permitted to submit information to the \nDepartment concerning the risks faced by that area--thus opening up a \ndialogue with cities and bringing light to a process that has largely \ntaken place behind the scenes. After doing this initial assessment, the \nFEMA Administrator will then have the discretion--as he does now--to \nselect those high-risk urban areas eligible to apply for UASI grants.\n  The conference report also reverses the recent disturbing downward \ntrend in funding for these essential grant programs. It would authorize \n$1.8 billion for the State Homeland Security Grant Program, SHSGP, and \nUASI program in fiscal year 2008--our principal antiterrorism grants to \nfirst responders--and increase this over the next 5 years to $2.25 \nbillion. Also, as a complement to this, the conference report would \nensure that states have increased funds available for key all-hazards \ngrant programs, including the emergency management performance grants \nand dedicated grants for communications interoperability. These \nprograms help ensure that all States have basic preparedness \ncapabilities for all disasters, whether natural or man-made.\n  The conference report would also for the first time specifically \nauthorize State and urban area grants, and provide legislative \nguidelines for the programs, including permissible uses.\n  Finally, the conference report would provide a whole series of \noversight measures to ensure that funds were being spent effectively \nand appropriately to achieve preparedness, and not wasted.\n  The 9/11 Commission report said:\n\n       To combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the \n     overall amounts of money being appropriated for national \n     intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer \n     be kept secret. Congress should pass a separate \n     appropriations act for intelligence, defending the broad \n     allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been \n     assigned among the varieties of intelligence work.\n\n\n[[Page S10124]]\n\n\n  The Commission went on to say that:\n\n       The specifics of the intelligence appropriation would \n     remain classified, as they are today. Opponents of \n     declassification argue that America's enemies could learn \n     about intelligence capabilities by tracking the top-line \n     appropriations figure. Yet the top-line figure by itself \n     provides little insight into U.S. intelligence sources and \n     methods.\n\n  A provision was passed to declassify the top-line of the National \nIntelligence Budget was passed by the Senate as part of the \nIntelligence Reform Act in 2004 but removed in conference.\n  In December 2005, the 9/11 Public Discourse Project, an independent \norganization led by the 9/11 Commission members, issued a grade of \n``F'' on the implementation of this recommendation, writing that \n``Congress cannot do robust intelligence oversight when funding for \nintelligence programs is buried within the defense budget. \nDeclassifying the overall intelligence budget would allow for a \nseparate annual intelligence appropriations bill, so that the Congress \ncan judge better how intelligence funds are being spent.''\n  The final bill contains a compromise that we have worked closely with \nthe White House to craft, one which finally addresses this important 9/\n11 Commission recommendation to disclose the top line of the National \nIntelligence Budget.\n  The compromise agreement will require the President to disclose the \ntotal appropriated for the National Intelligence Budget for 2 years--\n2007 and 2008--after which the President may waive this requirement by \nsending to Congress a notification explaining the reasons for this \nwaiver.\n  The inclusion of this provision means that this important \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission will now finally be implemented.\n  In this bill, we authorize significant additional funds for homeland \nsecurity grants for State and local governments: for State Homeland \nSecurity Grants, for Urban Area Security Initiative, UASI, grants, for \nEmergency Management Performance Grants, EMPG, for interoperable \nemergency communications, for rail and transit security, in order to \nensure that our first responders across the Nation are prepared for \ndisasters, natural and man-made.\n  In authorizing these additional funds, we are cognizant that we need \nto spend these funds wisely, in a way that will make our first \nresponders most prepared and our nation most secure. For this reason, \nthe conference report includes extensive oversight and accountability \nprovisions designed to ensure that all grant funds are used as \neffectively as possible and for their intended purposes.\n  At least every 2 years, DHS is required to conduct a programmatic and \nfinancial review of each State and urban area receiving grants \nadministered by the Department to examine whether grant funds are being \nused properly.\n  The DHS inspector general is tasked with following up these agency \nreviews by conducting full, in-depth audits of a sample of States and \nurban areas each year, and then report to Congress on his findings, and \nto post the results of the audits on the Internet.\n  For the Public Safety Interoperable Communications grants that go \nthrough the Commerce Department and are administered jointly by the \nCommerce Department and DHS, there are separate provisions requiring \nthat the Commerce Department inspector general conduct audits of those \ngrants.\n  The conference report also builds on provisions in the Post--Katrina \nEmergency Management Reform Act that we passed last fall by requiring \nthat DHS develop and use performance metrics to assess the progress of \nStates and urban areas in becoming prepared, and that States and urban \nareas test their performance against these metrics through exercises.\n  All states are required to report quarterly on their expenditures and \nannually on their level of preparedness.\n  Finally, The FEMA Administrator is also required to provide to \nCongress annually an evaluation of the efficacy of the Department's \nhomeland security grants have contributed to State and local \ngovernments in meeting their target levels of preparedness and have led \nto the overall reduction of risk.\n  From the beginning, we have been aware of Senator Coburn's strongly \nheld view that there be adequate oversight and auditing of homeland \nsecurity grants, and his support for the provisions to this effect in \nthe Senate bill--provisions that were not part of the House bill. \nSenator Collins' and I, and our staffs, have fought for the Senate \nauditing provisions in conference, in the face of a number of \nobjections and concerns raised by House staff from various committees. \nAnd we have been successful in retaining in the conference report what \nwe believe are very strong provisions to ensure accountability for \nhomeland security grant funds.\n  Working with Senator Coburn, we were able to retain what I believe \nare very significant provisions to ensure the appropriate and effective \nuse of homeland security dollars.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today will \nfinally pass the Improving America's Security Act of 2007. Over 3 years \nago, the 9/11 Commission gave us its recommendations, and we are \nfinally taking a big step toward implementing them. Let me mention a \nfew highlights.\n  This comprehensive legislation goes a long way toward helping our \nfirst responders. First, it establishes a $400 million annual grant \nprogram dedicated to funding interoperable communications equipment. We \nknow that lives were lost on September 11, 2001, because first \nresponders could not communicate. The same situation continues to play \nout across our country every day. For years, I have been urging the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to establish a dedicated funding source \nfor interoperable communications equipment. I am pleased that this \nlegislation creates a grant program dedicated to improving operability \nand interoperability at local, regional, State, and Federal levels. \nSecond, to improve collaboration and help identify solutions to \ncommunications problems on our international borders, the legislation \nalso includes language that I authored that establishes International \nBorder Community Interoperable Communications Demonstration Projects on \nthe northern and southern borders. These demonstration projects will \naddress the interoperable communications needs of police officers, \nfirefighters, emergency medical technicians, National Guard, and other \nemergency response providers at our borders and will improve the \nability of U.S. personnel to work well, for example, with their \nCanadian counterparts.\n  Another key accomplishment is that the legislation provides a more \nequitable distribution of homeland security grant funding. For the past \n5 years, the largest homeland security grant programs distributed funds \nusing a formula that arbitrarily set aside a large portion of the funds \nto be divided equally among the States, regardless of size, need, or \nrisk. This legislation allocates more of the funding based on risk. \nSpecifically, the legislation would reduce the funds guaranteed to each \nState from 0.75 percent to 0.375 percent of grant funds in fiscal year \n2008; the minimum would then decline over a period of 5 years to 0.35 \npercent in fiscal year 2012 and thereafter. All other funds would be \ndistributed to States based on the risk of acts of terrorism and the \nanticipated effectiveness of the proposed use of the grants.\n  Also included in the bill is language I authored that will require \nthe Department of Homeland Security, before publishing the final rule, \nto conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the Western Hemisphere Travel \nInitiative, WHTI, including the cost to the State Department and \nresources required to meet the increased volume of passports requests. \nThe WHTI seeks to require individuals from the United States, Canada, \nand Mexico to present a passport or other document proving citizenship \nbefore entering the United States. While we need to make our borders as \nsecure as they can be, we also need to make sure that we are achieving \nthat goal in a way that will not cause economic harm to our States. A \ncost-benefit analysis will help ensure we identify and weigh the \nexpenses and benefits of the WHTI.\n  The legislation also takes important steps to shore up rail, transit, \nbus, air and cargo security in the United States. It establishes a \ngrant program for freight and passenger rail security upgrades and \nrequires railroads shipping high-hazard materials to create threat \nmitigation plans. It establishes\n\n[[Page S10125]]\n\na grant fund for system-wide Amtrak security improvements and much \nneeded infrastructure upgrades. It authorizes studies to find ways to \nimprove passenger and baggage security screening on passenger rail \nservice between the U.S. and Canada which should identify what is \nneeded to prescreen rail passengers on the northern border. I hope \nthese studies will also advance a long standing effort I have \nundertaken to implement a preclearance system at other land crossings \nso that, for example, we can inspect vehicles for hazardous materials \nbefore they cross bridges and tunnels between U.S. and Canada.\n  In addition to improving rail security, the bill establishes grant \nprograms for improving intercity bus and bus terminal security and \npublic transportation system security. It takes steps to improve the \nsafety of transporting radioactive and hazardous materials on our \nrailroads and highways. I am also pleased that this legislation \nrequires the screening of all cargo carried on passenger airplanes \nwithin 3 years. It also requires all containers to be scanned for \nradiation at foreign ports before entering U.S. ports. The legislation \nalso establishes an appeal process at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity for passengers that believe they have been wrongly included in \n``no-fly'' or ``selectee'' watch lists.\n  While the conference report takes important steps toward implementing \nmany 9/11 Commission recommendations, I am disappointed that it fails \nto address one critical recommendation and excludes several provisions \nthat were in the Senate-passed bill.\n  The 9/11 Commission report stated: ``Of all our recommendations, \nstrengthening congressional oversight may be among the most difficult \nand important.'' I am troubled that the conference report does not \ncontain critical provisions--included in the Senate-passed bill--that \nwere intended to strengthen congressional oversight and promote \nindependent and objective intelligence analysis.\n  There is a long, painful history of congressional efforts to obtain \ninformation from the intelligence community that have been slow-walked \nor simply not answered. The bill that passed the Senate required the \nintelligence community to provide Congress timely access to existing \nintelligence information unless the President asserted a constitutional \nprivilege. Unfortunately, the conference report excludes that \nprovision.\n  The Senate-passed bill also provided that no executive branch \nofficial could require the intelligence community to get permission to \ntestify or to submit testimony, legislative recommendations, or \ncomments to the Congress. That provision was also stripped from the \nconference report. We should insist that the intelligence community be \nable to provide Congress its assessment of intelligence matters \nuninfluenced by the policy goals of whatever administration is in \npower.\n  It is important for whistleblowers to know that they can come \ndirectly to Congress if they have evidence that someone has made a \nfalse statement to Congress. And Congress has a right to that \ninformation--even if it is classified. The Senate-passed bill made it \nclear that intelligence community employees and contractors can report \nclassified information directly to appropriate Members of Congress and \ncleared staff if the employee reasonably believed that the information \nprovides direct and specific evidence of a false or inaccurate \nstatement to Congress. That provision was also removed in conference.\n  While I am disappointed that the conference report does not contain \nthese provisions, on balance it is a good bill and I am pleased that we \nare passing it today--both for the families and friends of those we \nlost on September 11, 2001, and for the security of our Nation.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation \nreported by the conference, the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/\n11 Commission Act of 2007. I was proud to serve on this very important \nconference, and while I may not agree with every part of the act, I \nbelieve that on balance it is a very important piece of legislation \nthat will serve to make our Nation more secure and help protect \nAmericans of all walks of life. Over 5 years after the tragic events of \n9/11 and almost 2 years since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we continue \nto hear from Governors, county executives, mayors, first responders, \nhealth professionals, and emergency preparedness officials that our \ncountry as a whole remains unprepared for another manmade or natural \ndisaster. We have heard the argument, which I support, that Congress \nneeds to do more to support regional and local efforts to protect \nAmericans. Overall, I believe this conference report takes a critical \nstep forward in making America more secure.\n  I am going to focus on the titles of this legislation dealing with \ntransportation security, with which I was deeply involved throughout \nthis process as chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over public transportation.\n  Title XIV of this bill creates a new grant program to improve the \nsecurity of public transportation and its 14 million daily passengers. \nSafe and secure transit systems are essential to the well-being of our \ncitizens and the health of our economy. The Banking Committee examined \nthe state of transit security in our very first hearing of the 110th \nCongress, which was my first hearing as chairman. At that hearing, the \ncommittee heard from some very compelling witnesses, including the \ndirectors of the London and Madrid transit systems. It is not all that \ncommon that we invite witnesses who are not U.S. citizens to come and \nparticipate in congressional hearings. But given the tragedies in \nMadrid and London, we thought it would be worthwhile to have those who \nmanage the transit operations in those two cities come and share with \nus information about their experiences. I think their testimony was \nvery helpful in demonstrating the importance of this issue and \ngalvanizing the attention of the Congress to address this issue in the \nlegislation before us.\n  We learned in those hearings that transit attacks have unfortunately \nbeen a major component of terrorist activities over the last several \ndecades. It is no secret that worldwide, terrorists have favored public \ntransit as a target. In the decade leading up to 2000, 42 percent of \nterrorist attacks worldwide targeted rail systems or buses, according \nto a study done by the Brookings Institution. In 2005 they attacked, as \nI mentioned, London's rail and bus system, killing 52 riders and \ninjuring almost 700 more in what has been called London's bloodiest \npeacetime attack. In 2004, they attacked Madrid's metro system, killing \n192 people and leaving 1,500 people injured.\n  Transit is frequently targeted because it is tremendously important \nto any nation's economy. Securing our transit systems and our \ntransportation networks generally is a difficult challenge under any \ncircumstances. We must do all that we can to meet that challenge. \nBeyond the obvious implications of physically protecting our citizens, \nsafe transit systems can help to maintain public confidence, \nencouraging transit use, reducing pollution, and preventing our cities \nfrom being mired in gridlock.\n  The first piece of legislation that the Banking Committee marked up \nafter I became chairman addressed with transit security. That \nlegislation, reported out of the committee as S. 763, was included in \nthe Senate version of the 9/11 bill. I am extremely pleased that it is \nincluded in the conference report which the Senate is considering. \nSimilar to the bill that was reported by the Banking Committee, the \nconference report provides $3.5 billion in grants directly to transit \nagencies for security equipment, evacuation drills, and worker \ntraining--on which several witnesses, particularly from Madrid and \nLondon, testified would be the most important investment we could make. \nIndeed, the conference report requires worker training for all transit \nsystems that receive security grants. The importance of worker training \ncan scarcely be overstated. Transit workers are the first line of \ndefense against an attack and the first to respond in the event of an \nattack. Mr. O'Toole, the director of London's transit system, said it \nwell: ``You have to invest in your staff and rely on them. You have to \ninvest in technology, but don't rely on it.''\n  The conference report also authorizes funds for the research and \ndevelopment of security technologies and authorizes\n\n[[Page S10126]]\n\nfunding for the Information Sharing Analysis Center, ISAC, a valuable \ntool that provides transit agencies timely information on active \nthreats against their systems. At the Banking Committee hearing we \nheard testimony from the American Public Transportation Association in \nstrong support of the ISAC, and I am very pleased that the conference \nreport authorizes this important center.\n  The conference report follows the Banking Committee's bill in \nallocating grants directly to transit systems on the basis of risk. The \nlegislation makes clear that the Department of Homeland Security is \nresponsible for making these critical decisions and allocating the \ngrants among the Nation's 6,000 public transit agencies. The report \ndoes leave open the important decision of which agency, the Department \nof Homeland Security or the Department of Transportation, should \nactually distribute these grants and audit recipients' compliance with \nimportant provisions of transit law, including labor protections. The \nlegislation requires the Secretaries of these 2 Departments to make \nthis decision on the basis of which Department can distribute grants in \nthe most effective and efficient manner. It is my opinion that at this \nmoment, and at least for the next few years, the Department of \nTransportation is the agency that can best meet these criteria. DOT \nalready has an efficient and effective grant distribution system in \nplace that directly reaches our Nation's transit systems. The Federal \nTransit Administration is well aware of the various provisions of \ntransit law that the recipients of security grants will be required to \ncomply with and will therefore be able to monitor for compliance \neffectively. These transit security grants must go out to agencies \nquickly, as we face an urgent threat. It is my hope that the \nSecretaries will make a decision based on sound policy to best protect \nthe American public and not with an eye toward jurisdiction or turf.\n\n  Over the years we have invested heavily in aviation security. In \nfact, we have invested about $7.50 per aviation passenger per trip. \nAbout 1.8 million people travel using the aviation system daily in this \ncountry. Fourteen million people use mass transit systems every \nworkday. We have invested about $380 million in the security of mass \ntransit systems. That is about one penny per passenger per trip.\n  I am not suggesting, nor do we require, that there be an equilibrium \nbetween the security investment in aviation and mass transit systems. I \nam simply suggesting that the Federal government can and should do more \nto secure our transit systems. To that end, the conference report \nprovides an authorization of $3.5 billion for transit security. We \nbelieve with this additional authorization, and we hope an appropriate \nappropriation from the responsible committees, that we will be able to \nprovide some additional security for this critically important \ncomponent of our economy.\n  Again, I am grateful to the members of the conference committee for \ntheir support of this effort. I also want to thank my colleague and \nranking member on the Banking Committee, Senator Shelby, who has been a \ntrue champion for transit security for many years. This National \nTransit Systems Security Act of 2007 would never have reached this \nstage without Senator Shelby's work. This was truly a bipartisan \nproduct, and I want to thank Senator Shelby and our colleagues on the \nBanking Committee, including the former chairmen of the Housing and \nTransportation Subcommittee, Senators Reed and Allard, who have also \nmade very valuable contributions to this bill over the many years that \nwe have been working to improve transit security.\n  I also want to make a few comments about other items that are \nincluded in this conference report. First, as chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, I recognize the preparedness requirements that the Federal \nfinancial regulators have imposed on institutions under their \njurisdiction and which those institutions have observed. I am pleased \nto have worked with my colleagues Senators Lieberman and Collins on \ntitle IX to clarify that the private sector preparedness certification \nis voluntary and should not be construed as a requirement to replace \nany preparedness, emergency response, or business continuity standards, \nrequirements, or best practices established under any other provision \nof Federal law, or by any sector-specific agency.\n  The Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs also exercises \njurisdiction over the preparedness of American industry to supply our \nGovernment in times of defense and homeland security emergencies. Key \nto this effort is ensuring that our Nation's critical infrastructure \noperates uninterrupted and unhindered by natural or manmade disasters. \nTitle X of this bill will enable the Department of Homeland Security to \nassess our vulnerabilities and hopefully work with other agencies to \nbuild up defenses for our critical infrastructure. In one specific \nprovision, we built off of the Banking Committee's work 4 years ago \nwhen we reauthorized the Defense Production Act, DPA. In 2003, we \nemphasized the importance of the DPA's authorities in protecting our \ncritical infrastructure. Today, under the conference agreement, we will \nrequire the Homeland Security Department, in coordination with the \nDepartments of Commerce, Transportation, Defense, and Energy, to \nexplain how it is implementing these 2003 DPA requirements. With the \nDPA's authorities expiring in September 2008, this report may prove \nhelpful for our Committee's eventual markup of the reauthorization and \nmodernization of the DPA.\n  Finally, I want to express my disappointment that the conference \nreport includes an immunity provision that was added to the report \ndespite not being contained in either the Senate bill or the House bill \nthat was sent to conference. I note that this provision was not \nsupported by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has \njurisdiction over this matter, and I believe it should have been dealt \nwith in a very different manner. While I share the belief that our \ncitizens are the first line of defense against terrorism and that they \nneed to be encouraged to report legitimate suspicious behavior, we need \nto be very careful whenever we grant blanket immunity and even more \ncareful when we pass legislation granting this immunity retroactively.\n  To conclude, Mr. President, I am pleased to recommend this conference \nreport to my colleagues, as I believe that it will serve us well in our \nefforts to make Americans more secure.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am very happy to rise today in support \nof a conference report that implements the remaining 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations.\n  Finally, three years after the Commission released its bi-partisan \nreport, we are sending President Bush legislation that implements the \nlast of those recommendations--recommendations that will improve \nMaryland's as well as our nation's security. This bill increases \ncitizens' safety when they travel by air, road, or rail; improves first \nresponders' communications capabilities; facilitates intelligence \nsharing at all levels of law enforcement; and protects citizens' \nprivacy and liberty.\n  This conference report is the first legislation to formally authorize \nthe State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Area Security \nInitiative, UASI, which provide funds to states and high-risk urban \nareas--like the D.C. Metropolitan area--to prevent, prepare for, \nrespond to and recover from acts of terrorism. This legislation \nauthorizes more money than previous years, but most importantly--and I \nwant to stress this most importantly, this legislation ensures the vast \nmajority of that funding is distributed based on risk.\n  In the past, too great a percentage of our first responder grants \nwere distributed without regard to risk and vulnerability. As the 9-11 \nCommission final report stated:\n\n       [f]ederal homeland security assistance should not remain a \n     program for general revenue sharing.\n\n  By increasing the percentage of grant money distributed based on \nrisk, this legislation moves us toward the full implementation of the \nCommission's prescription.\n  This legislation also requires the Department of Homeland Security, \nDHS, to consider certain factors when allocating funds based on risk \nincluding history of threats, risk associated with critical \ninfrastructure, coastline, and the need to respond to neighboring \nareas; considerations critical to adequate risk assessment for many of\n\n[[Page S10127]]\n\nMaryland's communities. All of us were both outraged and deeply \nconcerned when DHS ranked the Washington D.C. and New York City \nmetropolitan areas in a low-risk category for terrorist attack or \ncatastrophe, a decision that would have cost those regions millions in \nanti-terror funds and had devastating impacts on their ability to \nrespond to attack had the rankings been allowed to stand. By setting \ncriteria for risk assessment, this bill guards against future gross \nmiscalculations.\n  The legislation includes several important provisions improving \ntransportation security, but I am particularly glad to see the bill \nrequires DHS to develop its capacity to screen all--100 percent--of \nmaritime cargo in foreign ports before it is loaded on ships bound for \nthe United States within 5 years. Further, the conference substitute \nrequires that DHS be able to screen all cargo carried on passenger \nairplanes within the next three years. And, the legislation authorizes \nsubstantial funds--more than $4 billion over four years--for rail, \ntransit, and bus security grants.\n  Not only does the legislation provide funding for improving \ncommunications systems, it also provides guidance. Maryland's first \nresponders and administrators have explained to me that a truly \ninteroperable communications system and a functioning incident command \nsystem require more than equipment. Practically, cooperation between \nand among local, state, national, and even international governments \nrequires governance structures, protocols, agreements, and training. By \nproviding money for staff, exercises, simulations, training, and any \nother activities necessary to achieve, maintain, or enhance emergency \ncommunications, this legislation addresses critical governance \nconcerns.\n  But to keep us safe, different government agencies need more than the \nability to communicate. They need to actually be communicating critical \ninformation and intelligence to the officials and officers who need it. \nThe conference substitute encourages the free transfer of intelligence \nacross agencies by authorizing government-wide standards for \ninformation sharing, and creating standards for state, local, and \nregional intelligence fusion centers and ensures they receive federal \nsupport and personnel.\n  The 9-11 attacks and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita demonstrated how \ninadequate information sharing and inadequate communications systems \ncan compound disasters. Let us hope that with these changes we will \nnever again have to witness firefighters rushing into buildings when \nthey should have been running out or distraught citizens trapped by \nflood waters while national officials remain unaware of the disaster.\n  But this legislation does more than protect our physical safety; it \ncontains provisions to safeguard our most cherished liberties. Recent \nrevelations regarding FBI abuse of its PATRIOT Act authority to gather \nphone, bank, and credit information on thousands of citizens underscore \nthe importance of this legislation's enhanced privacy and civil \nliberties protections. The bill strengthens the Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board independence and expands its oversight \nauthority. The bill requires agencies with access to citizens' private \ninformation to designate at least one senior official to serve as a \nsource of advice and oversight on privacy and civil liberties matters. \nFinally, under this legislation, federal agencies must report annually \non their development and use of data mining technologies so this body \ncan ensure proper usage of any technologies that raise privacy or civil \nliberties concerns.\n  This Conference Substitute also encourages this country to look \nbeyond its own borders to promote others' safety and liberty through \ndiplomacy. The legislation requires the Secretary of State expand \nstrategies for democracy promotion in non-democratic and democratic \ntransition countries, and to expand the effectiveness of the State \nDepartment's annual human rights reports. It further supports democracy \npromotion through international institutions, such as the UN Democracy \nFund, the Community of Democracies, and the International Center for \nDemocratic Transition, specifically through encouraging the \nestablishment of an office of multilateral democracy promotion. To \nallow ``maximum effort'' on non-proliferation by the U.S. Government, \nas the 9-11 Commission called for, the bill establishes a Presidential \nCoordinator for the Prevention of WMD Proliferation and Terrorism.\n  We know now how closely our own safety is linked to other nations' \ninternal security. These efforts are critical to creating a more stable \nMiddle East and a safer world.\n  The 9-11 families, several of whom are my constituents, asked us to \npass this legislation, and I am proud that we have fulfilled this \nobligation to them and to the country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased we are considering the \nconference report to H.R. 1, the Improving America's Security Act of \n2007. This legislation is particularly timely given the daily reports \nthat the terrorist threat against our Nation is increasing. We must be \nproactive in defending the homeland and take particular care to protect \nthe transportation systems which have so often been targeted.\n  The conference report we are voting on today contains significant \nprovisions to strengthen the security of the Nation's transportation \nsystem, including our surface, aviation and maritime networks. We also \ntake action to improve the interoperability of public safety \ncommunications.\n  For surface transportation security, we have worked with the relevant \nHouse conferees to reach consensus on provisions that would authorize \nnew security assessments, grant programs, and security measures for the \nnation's major surface modes, including passenger and freight \nrailroads, trucks, intercity buses, and pipelines. This bill will \nfinally authorize adequate funding and a much needed statutory \nframework for the Transportation Security Administration's, TSA, \nsurface transportation and rail security efforts.\n  The conference report also takes critical steps to address the \nremaining recommendations of the 9/11 Commission on aviation security. \nThe commission's report expressed continuing concern over the state of \nair cargo security, the screening of passengers and baggage, access \ncontrols at airports, and the security of general aviation.\n  Under this bill, all cargo going on passenger aircraft must be \nscreened within 3 years. Requirements will be put in place to plan and \nfund improvements for the detection of explosives in checked baggage \nand at passenger screening checkpoints. The TSA will also be required \nto ensure a system is in place to coordinate passenger redress matters \nand develop a strategic plan to test and implement an advanced \npassenger prescreening system.\n  With respect to giving our Nation's first responders the necessary \nresources to communicate effectively during times of crisis, the bill \nwill further bolster our previous efforts to improve interoperable, \npublic safety communications by eliminating statutory ambiguities for \neligibility and by directing specific funds in support of State \nStrategic Technology Reserves that can be tapped in times of crisis by \nState and local personnel, as proposed in S. 4.\n  This conference report is an important step toward securing our \nNation. The Commerce Committee worked for years to craft many of these \nprovisions, and they reflect the expertise and dedication of our \nmembers. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, we have completed action on the conference \nreport on H.R. 1, the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission Act of 2007, and I wish to commend Senators Joseph Lieberman \nand Susan Collins for leading this effort in the Senate. I appreciate \ntheir hard work and dedication in forging a compromise on this \nimportant piece of legislation. As a conferee I was pleased to take \npart in reconciling the differences between the Senate and House \nversions of this bill. The work that has gone into this legislation has \nbeen matched by the tremendous commitment of all of those involved to \nensure that our country remains secure in the face of natural and man-\nmade threats. Now that the Senate votes on passage of the conference \nreport, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a few issues \nthat are particularly important to me.\n  The provision to create a Chief Management Officer, CMO, is a \nnecessary\n\n[[Page S10128]]\n\nstep in addressing the serious management and integration challenges at \nthe Department of Homeland Security. I am disappointed that the \nconference report language does not encompass the entire provision \npassed by the Senate designating the CMO as the principal advisor to \nthe Secretary on management issues. The CMO must have the authority of \na Deputy Secretary to address department-wide management functions. My \ngood friend Senator Voinovich, with whom I have worked closely on the \nOversight of Government Management Subcommittee, as well as Comptroller \nGeneral Walker, and I have long advocated for a CMO at the Deputy \nSecretary level.\n  I am pleased to see that strong privacy provisions included in the \nHouse and Senate bills were retained in this report. The Privacy \nOfficer With Enhanced Rights Act, or the POWER Act, a provision \nchampioned by Congressman Bennie Thompson and I, will strengthen the \ninvestigative authority of the chief privacy officer at the Department \nof Homeland Security. I am also pleased that the report increases the \nindependence of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, so \nthat there will be no undue influence exerted on them. Both of these \nprovisions go a long way in ensuring that increased security efforts \nwill not be at the cost of Americans' right to privacy.\n  The conference report also includes an important provision to \nincrease reporting requirements for agencies using data mining. I was \npleased to work with my good friends Senators Russell Feingold and John \nSununu, on this language. Federal agencies use data mining technology \nto review and analyze millions of public and private records for many \nreasons, including the detection of criminal and terrorist activities. \nThis raises privacy concerns since an agency may analyze various \ndatabases containing personal information without any specific \nsuspicion of wrongdoing.\n  In 2003, I asked the Government Accountability Office, GAO, to look \ninto this issue, and in 2004, GAO reported that 122 Government data \nmining activities involved the use of personal information, 46 of which \ninvolved sharing personal information between agencies. GAO also found \n36 data mining programs which used personal information from the \nprivate sector. However, these numbers did not include programs that \nare used for intelligence purposes. In 2005, GAO issued a follow-up \nreport which found that agencies are not following all privacy and \nsecurity policies. Given the increasing use of data mining and the \nthreats such activities pose to Americans' privacy rights, I believe \nCongress must have a full accounting of agencies' data mining programs. \nThat is why I am pleased the conference report retains the Senate \nlanguage.\n  Finally, I want to express my disappointment that we were not able to \naddress protections for airline screeners in this legislation. It is \nessential that transportation security officers are given adequate \nemployee protections, especially the right to collectively bargain like \ntheir colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security. I hope we will \nbe able to address this issue in the future.\n  While more still needs to be done, the conference report before us \nnow provides much needed reform.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I believe that securing our Nation's public \ntransportation systems is one of the most pressing homeland security \nissues facing our Nation. Over 180 public transportation systems \nthroughout the world have been primary targets of terrorist attacks. In \n2001, as chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Development \nSubcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development, I \nheld the first hearing on transit security in the wake of September 11. \nThe hearing took place early in the 107th Congress so I am saddened \nthat it has taken us this long to enact legislation to protect our \ntransit systems. I am pleased, however, that tonight we are prepared to \npass the conference report to implement the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations, including the transit security measures that I \nauthored.\n  While our Nation acted quickly after 9/11 to secure airports and \nairplanes against terrorists, major vulnerabilities remain in surface \ntransportation. Transit agencies around the country have identified in \nexcess of $6 billion in transit security needs.\n  Transit is vital to providing mobility for millions of Americans and \noffers tremendous economic benefits to our Nation. In the United \nStates, people use public transportation over 33 million times each \nweek day compared to 2 million passengers who fly daily. Paradoxically, \nit is the very openness of the system that makes it vulnerable to \nterrorism. When one considers this and the fact that roughly $7 per \npassenger is invested in aviation security, but less than 1 cent is \ninvested in the security of each transit passenger, the need for an \nauthorized transit security program is clear. We need to be more \nvigilant to protect public transit from terrorists.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs, I was proud to author with Senators Dodd and Shelby \ncomprehensive legislation to protect our public transportation systems \nand the Americans that they serve. Title XIV of The Improving America's \nSecurity Act of 2007 authorizes $3.5 billion in grants to transit \nagencies for capital and operational costs. It also establishes an \nessential security training program for public transportation employees \nwho are at the front lines of preventing terrorist acts. The act allows \nthe Secretaries of Transportation and Homeland Security to determine \nwhich federal Department will distribute the grant funding. I urge the \nSecretaries and the administration to place responsibility for the \ngrant program with the Department of Transportation and make this \ndecision promptly. It is my opinion that this will result in the \neffective and efficient administration of the program for local transit \nagencies.\n  Taking action to protect our public transportation systems is long \noverdue. I am pleased to support the Improving America's Security Act.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman and ranking member \nof the 9/11 bill conference committee for their efforts to bring the \nconference report before the Senate. This was no small task and they, \nalong with other conferees and staff, are to be commended.\n  Despite these efforts, however, the final conference report includes \nobjectionable maritime cargo scanning language that could be \ndevastating to both the international and domestic flow of commerce.\n  The decision to mandate scanning for 100 percent of cargo containers \nis a risky proposition because it does not follow a risk-based \napproach:\n  The title of the final conference report clearly states that its \npurpose is to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. But \nthe commission did not advocate for the scanning--or even screening--of \n100 percent of the containers arriving at our shores.\n  The 9/11 Commission recommended instead that we mitigate our \nvulnerabilities to terrorism in a logical manner by applying our \nresources based on risk, and specifically cautioned us not to employ a \nblanket approach.\n  Our Nation's ports, including the Port of Anchorage, are vital to our \neconomies--both regional and national. Ensuring their security must be \na top priority. But a mandate to scan every cargo container entering \nthe U.S. could shut down many of these ports, and the resulting delays \nfor both imports and exports would be excessive and costly for \nconsumers.\n  Moreover, it is likely that foreign nations will disregard any \ncaveats we may provide, and according to a European union diplomat,\n  The E.U. would consider imposing reciprocal requirements and filing a \ncomplaint against the United States in the World Trade Organization.\n  This fact renders the approach taken by this bill with respect to \nscanning cargo unworkable internationally.\n  Here at home, these cargo scanning provisions may be equally, if not \nmore, devastating to rural economies. Communities in the lower 48 are \nserved by multiple transportation modes distributing basic supplies \nlike food and other consumer goods. In Alaska, however, over 90 percent \nof our supplies flow through the Port of Anchorage. Any disruption at \nthis port would be a disaster for Alaskans, not to mention to the Port \nof Tacoma, which serves as a\n\n[[Page S10129]]\n\nconduit for cargo transiting to and from Alaska.\n  Some contend that we are not doing enough for port security. I \ndisagree. Not even one year ago, we passed the Safe Port Act. While \nmany of us made these same arguments concerning 100 percent scanning \nduring the debate of that bill, we ultimately settled on directing DHS \nto conduct a pilot program to determine whether 100 percent scanning of \ncargo containers is even feasible. The pilot began earlier this year \nand we are only now beginning to get a clearer picture of the \ncomplexities that scanning entails.\n  Mandating 100 percent scanning of cargo containers without the \nbenefit of the results of the pilot tests is premature and \ncounterproductive.\n  Homeland security should not be used as a rhetorical tool. Let us \nfirst learn from the lessons promised by the Safe Port Act's pilot \ntests before committing ourselves to an irrational, costly, and \npotentially ineffective approach to securing our Nation.\n  I thank the following staff of the Senate Commerce Committee for \ntheir hard work on this bill:\n\n       Pamela Friedman, Mark Delich, Jarrod Thompson, Chris \n     Bertram, Mike Blank, Kim Nahigian, Paul Nagle, Christine \n     Kurth, Dan Neumann, Betsy McDonnell, and David Wonnenberg.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend Senators Lieberman and Collins \nfor their leadership and the members of the Conference Committee for \ntheir work on this important legislation.\n  More than five years after 9/11--despite tens of billions of dollars \nspent--America's ports, rails, airports, borders, nuclear powerplants \nand chemical plants are still not as safe as they could be.\n  It has been almost 3 years since the 9/11 Commission issued its final \nrecommendations.\n  This legislation is a major step toward fully implementing the \nrecommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. It changes course \nafter years of inadequate action on critical homeland security needs.\n  The bill will make America more secure because it: provides funding \nfor first responders; makes it harder for potential terrorists to enter \nthe United States; helps secure our rail, air, and mass transit \nsystems; and improves intelligence and information sharing at all \nlevels of law enforcement.\n  I am especially proud to highlight a few provisions in the bill that \nI have championed for some time.\n  The legislation specifies that States can use Federal grants to \ndesign, conduct, and evaluate mass evacuation plans and exercises.\n\n\n                            Mass Evacuation\n\n  As we learned from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, there is no \nsubstitute for being prepared.\n  Last fall, Rockford, IL, was flooded after heavy storms. Public \nsafety workers were able to vacate an entire neighborhood quickly and \nsafely because they were prepared.\n  They had an evacuation plan. They knew where they would take people. \nThey had a mobile command center set up there within hours.\n  Most cities and States have evacuation plans. But you need to have \ntraining drills and exercises to identify where the plan breaks down. \nEvacuation exercises allow you to work out solutions before lives are \nat risk in a real emergency. We may only have one chance to get it \nright.\n\n\n                            Civil Liberties\n\n  The 9/11 Commission recognized that one of the biggest challenges we \nface in fighting the war on terrorism is protecting civil liberties. \nThe Commission said:\n\n       While protecting our homeland, Americans should be mindful \n     of threats to vital personal and civil liberties. This \n     balancing is no easy task, but we must constantly strive to \n     keep it right.\n\n  To help keep this balance right, the Commission wisely recommended \nthe creation of a board to ensure that the Government does not violate \nprivacy or civil liberties. Three years ago, when Congress passed the \nfirst 9/11 bill, it included a provision I worked on to create a \nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. The bill that the Senate \npassed would have created a strong and independent board with subpoena \npower, a full-time Chairman, and a broad statutory mandate, among other \nthings.\n  Unfortunately, House Republicans were able to water down the bill to \nreduce the independence and authority of the Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Board. As a result, the board has not been an effective check \non this administration, which has shown reckless disregard for the \nconstitutional rights of innocent Americans.\n  The conference report we consider tonight will fix those \ndeficiencies.\n  Throughout American history, in times of war, we have sacrificed \nliberty in the name of security. As the 9/11 Commission said, ``The \nchoice between security and liberty is a false choice.'' We can be both \nsafe and free. I hope the new and improved Privacy and Civil Liberties \nOversight Board will help make that a reality.\n\n\n                               Risk-Based\n\n  Two years ago Congress earned an F from the 9/11 Commission for \ncreating a Homeland Security Grant Program that is not sufficiently \nfocused on risk.\n  This bill puts more emphasis on risk as a factor in distributing \nhomeland security grants. Right now, homeland security grants are based \non a variety of factors--but risk is one of many.\n\n\n                          Information Sharing\n\n  The 9/11 Commission strongly recommended that we change the culture \nin Government, so that agencies talk to each other and share \ninformation so everyone can do their jobs.\n  In 2001, the FBI had information about the hijackers that was never \nshared with local officials.\n  The conference report responds to that challenge. This bill: makes \nthe Office of Information Sharing permanent, establishes an interagency \ncoordination group on threat assessment, and makes it easier to share \ninformation between State and local government and across Federal \nagencies.\n  I am pleased that conferees made the program manager for the \nInformation Sharing Environment (ISE) permanent and authorizes funds \nand staff to carry out the ISE mission.\n  The bill also calls for progress reports to Congress on the \nInformation Sharing Environment.\n\n\n                         ``John Doe'' Provision\n\n  I will support the conference report, but I want to make clear that \nit contains one provision that has not been properly written or \ncarefully considered. The so-called John Doe provision would give \nblanket immunity to citizens and Government officials who engage in \nracial profiling, as long a court finds they were acting in good faith.\n  The proponents of this legislation claim that it is necessary because \ncitizens will not report suspicious behavior if they are afraid they \nwill be sued for racial profiling.\n  With all due respect, this is a solution in search of a problem. \nThere is no evidence that people are reluctant to file complaints about \nsuspicious behavior and there is no epidemic of nuisance lawsuits \nagainst people who do so.\n  In fact, all the evidence points in the opposite direction--vigilant \nAmericans are playing a crucial role in homeland security.\n  The reality is that this provision is targeted at one pending \nlawsuit. There is no indication that the courts are incapable of \nhandling this or any other racial profiling lawsuit. There are immunity \nrules that the courts have developed over many years and there is no \nevidence that those rules are not working to protect innocent people \nfrom nuisance lawsuits.\n  I cannot judge the merits of this particular lawsuit, but I do know \nthis: Congress should not be in the business of passing legislation to \naffect the outcome of individual cases that are pending in court. We \nshould not substitute our judgment for that of a jury of American \ncitizens, doing their civic duty, who will hear and weigh all of the \nrelevant evidence.\n  Remember the last time Congress did this? It was the Terri Schiavo \ncase. That should be a warning to Congress not to go down this road \nagain.\n  Its proponents claim that the John Doe provision is necessary so that \npeople would not be deterred from reporting suspicious behavior. But \nthis legislation will have another chilling effect: It will deter \nvictims of racial profiling from seeking justice in the courts.\n  This legislation would require a plaintiff to pay attorneys fees to a \ndefendant if the defendant who allegedly engaged in racial profiling \nacted in\n\n[[Page S10130]]\n\ngood faith. Let's be clear: even if a defendant acted in bad faith, \nmany victims of racial profiling will not file a lawsuit because they \ncannot take the risk that they will be forced to pay attorney's fees if \nthey lose.\n  Despite what its proponents claim, the John Doe provision applies to \nmore than just terrorism cases. In fact, it applies to any activity \nrelated to a threat to a passenger vehicle or its passengers. As a \nresult, this provision will probably be invoked by every defendant in \nevery future racial profiling case.\n  I am especially disappointed that this legislation was inserted into \nthe 9/11 conference report without any consideration of the concerns I \nhave outlined. This provision was not in the 9/11 bill that the Senate \npassed. In the Senate, it has received no hearings, no debate, and no \nvotes.\n  The John Doe bill falls under the jurisdiction of the Judiciary \nCommittee, of which I am a member. Senator Leahy, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, asked that it not to be included in the 9/11 \nconference report so that we could hold hearings on it, but \nunfortunately his request was not granted.\n  This reminds me of another controversial bill that was inserted into \na conference report without any debate in the Senate. It's called the \nREAL ID Act, and it is now opposed by States across our country.\n  I will be tracking closely how this legislation is implemented. I \nsuspect that, as with REAL ID, the John Doe law will be met with rising \nopposition across this country as more and more Americans learn about \nit.\n\n\n                                 Close\n\n  The 9/11 Commission gave Congress a critically important job.\n  The Commission charged Congress with making structural changes to \nclose the gaps in America's homeland security defenses. This \nlegislation responds to that challenge, and I support final passage of \nthe conference report.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back all \nremaining time, and Senator Coburn, in the spirit of not only the good \nspirit I identify with him but in the spirit of the hour, I gather, is \nprepared to yield back his remaining time as well.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield back the time on this side as \nwell.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, again, I thank Senator Collins and \nSenator Coburn. It is a measure of their devotion that they are both \nstill here at this hour.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10130-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate LTC Jean \nMcGinnis upon retiring from military service. For more than 25 years, \nour Nation has been fortunate to have such an intelligent, accomplished \nand decorated American in our armed services.\n  Lieutenant McGinnis exemplifies selfless devotion to one's country. \nBorn in Deadwood, SD, Lieutenant McGinnis began her service early. The \nNew Mexico Military Institute commissioned her as a 2nd lieutenant \nbefore she even completed her bachelor's degree at Texas A She \njoined the Army Reserve as an active Guard Reserve Officer, and \ncontinued her education at Fort Eustis, VA, where she successfully \npassed the aviation maintenance officer course to become an Army test \npilot in the UH-1 Huey helicopter.\n  In 1991, Captain McGinnis was stationed in Pennsylvania at the Willow \nGrove Naval Air Station as the aviation operations officer for the 2/\n288th Aviation Regiment. Five years later, she was assigned to the \nOffice of the Chief, Army Reserve, Program Analysis and Evaluation \nDivision and then as a budget analyst for the Army. In 1999, Major \nMcGinnis moved to Arlington, VA, in order to serve as a congressional \nliaison after training at the Command and General Staff College.\n  Throughout her service, Lieutenant McGinnis has gained wide \nrecognition from her commanding officers. She has earned the \nMeritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army \nAchievement Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Senior Army \nAviator Badge, and the Air Assault Badge and the Army Staff Badge. \nThese accomplishments speak volumes for her dedicated service to the \ncountry.\n  It is with great pride that I commend Lieutenant Jean McGinnis on \nthis wonderful accomplishment. You have served our Nation with \ndistinction, and I wish you the best on your well-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10130-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LIEUTENANT COLONEL JEAN M. McGINNIS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I honor, and pay tribute to LTC Jean \nM. McGinnis, who will retire from the U.S. Army on August 31, 2007, \nafter 25 years of distinguished service. Lieutenant Colonel McGinnis is \nan outstanding American soldier who served in a succession of command \nand staff positions worldwide of increasing responsibility.\n  In her last assignment in the U.S. Army as the Deputy Chief of the \nArmy, Senate Liaison Division, Lieutenant Colonel McGinnis demonstrated \nthe managerial and leadership skills that have characterized her \ncareer. She demonstrated Army values daily, supported her subordinates \nand chief tirelessly, and traveled extensively escorting Senators, \ntheir staffs, and Senate committee professional staff members on \ninspections and factfinding trips in the United States and overseas.\n  Lieutenant Colonel McGinnis previously served as a Congressional \nBudget Liaison Officer in the Office of the Chief of Army Reserve and \nas an Operations Research Analyst in Programs, Analysis, and Evaluation \nin the Pentagon. From 1982 to 1994, she served as an Aviation Officer, \nin the positions of Platoon Leader, Detachment Commander, Company and \nBattalion Flight Operations Officer.\n  During her aviation career Lieutenant Colonel McGinnis had many \nassignments ranging from humanitarian assistance missions in Guatemala \nand Honduras to piloting the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nthe Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in Egypt as part of Operation \nBright Star.\n  In 1997, Lieutenant Colonel McGinnis was assigned to the Office of \nthe Chief of Army Reserve in Washington, DC, as an Operations Research \nSystems Analyst. During this assignment she reconciled Army Reserve \nresource requirements with Army program needs. She later served as a \nBudget Analyst in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for \nPersonnel, Resource Division. While in this challenging assignment, she \nserved again as an Operations Research Budget Analyst of Reserve \npersonnel and was directly involved with complex Army training and \nReserve personnel policy issues.\n  She was then selected to represent the Army on Capitol Hill and \nserved 4 years working for the Army Senate Liaison Division and the \nOffice of the Chief of Army Reserve. Lieutenant Colonel McGinnis' \nexpertise and knowledge of the Active Army and Reserve policies and \nprocedures has been of great value to Senators and their staffs. \nLieutenant Colonel McGinnis' leadership, resourcefulness, and \nprofessionalism made lasting contributions to Army readiness and \nmission accomplishments. Her service to our Nation has been \nexceptional, and Lieutenant Colonel McGinnis is more than deserving of \nthis recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10130-4", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10130-S10131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DIGNIFIED TREATMENT OF WOUNDED WARRIORS ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to comment on the \npassage of the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act. The \nPresident's blue ribbon Wounded Warrior Commission met with the \nPresident to provide\n\n[[Page S10131]]\n\nhim with recommendations as to how the Veterans' Administration, along \nwith the Department of Defense, can best provide service to our \ndramatically injured veterans in a seamless fashion.\n  Our action, with passage of this legislation, is a step in the same \ndirection. It fulfills the pledge we made a few months ago when the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, along with the Armed Services Committee, \nheld joint hearings to receive testimony on needed changes to \ntransition programs and health care benefits.\n  At that time, many of us stated our intention to make a good-faith \neffort to work on issues under our respective committees' jurisdictions \nand then to merge our work back together again at the earliest possible \ntime.\n  This bill not only contains the legislation that went through the \nArmed Services Committee earlier in the form of S. 1606, but it also \nincludes title II of the bill, legislation sponsored by Senator Danny \nAkaka and me to address issues surrounding the treatment provided to \nthose veterans with traumatic brain injuries.\n  Of course, I am proud of the comprehensive nature of the legislation \nSenator Akaka and I have put forward in this legislation and pleased to \nsee its passage.\n  Under the provisions in this bill, injured veterans will benefit from \nnew investments in research into mild, moderate, and serious traumatic \nbrain injury. They and their families will be assured that care is \nprovided in age-appropriate settings. We will explore whether assisted \nliving services are the most appropriate and least restrictive settings \nto provide care for those with traumatic brain injury.\n  Most important to me is that our servicemembers, veterans, and their \nfamilies will have peace of mind knowing the Secretary can provide \ntraumatic brain injury care in a private, non-VA facility anytime the \nSecretary determines that doing so would be optimal to the recovery and \nthe rehabilitation of that patient. In other words, with passage of \nthis legislation, we are assuring that whenever it is in the best \ninterest of the patient's recovery, then VA can purchase private care \nto treat traumatic brain injury.\n  These are a few of the very important provisions in title II of the \nlegislation. Of course, there are many other notable pieces of the bill \nin title I, which, as I previously stated, was produced by my \ncolleagues in the Armed Services Committee. I compliment them again for \ntheir work on this important bill.\n  We said we would do this as expeditiously as possible. The earliest \ntime possible was, of course, the National Defense Authorization Act, \nwhich was on the floor a few weeks ago. There, we added the substance \nof the bill as an amendment to that act.\n  Unfortunately, the NDAA was pulled from the floor--a little \npremature, in my judgment, but it was. But I do wish to compliment both \nleaders for agreeing in a bipartisan way to bring this important part \nof that bill before us quickly so our troops and our injured veterans \nand their families can receive the care and benefits they deserve as \nquickly as it can be delivered.\n  I said on the floor a few weeks ago, during consideration of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, the legislation was very important \nbecause it demonstrated that Congress can break down the walls of \njurisdiction and territory and do the right thing at the right time for \nour troops.\n  I and other Senators have been very critical of the bureaucratic \nroadblocks DOD and VA can put up against one another, when we all want \nto make sure they are working together in a seamless fashion. We now \nsee those walls breaking apart. So I believe we are going to demand \nthat these two agencies break down further those barriers of territory \nand jurisdiction. When we demonstrate we can do it, we then must ask \nthem to do it. In this legislation, you saw two committees come \ntogether to make it possible. I am proud we have done so. It is the \nkind of work we ought to do.\n  I also think it is fitting we passed this bill yesterday because the \nPresident's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors \nis set to issue its final report. That happened. We have now had an \nopportunity to review it. I thank all of the Members of that Commission \nfor their service and for all of the work they did in a short \ntimeframe. Former Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala were \ngreat leaders on this issue for us and for our veterans and for our \ntroops.\n\n  The passage of this bill is only the beginning of changes that we \nwill make and must make for the health care and the benefit services \noffered to our veterans and offered through VA and DOD. I look forward \nto hearings on the panel's recommendations soon and to finalize the \nreading of the report. I now have it in hand. I am hopeful that with \nthe passage of this legislation, which will soon be on its way to the \nPresident for signature, we in the Congress can focus on the \nrecommendations of the Dole-Shalala panel.\n  With that, I again thank the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Akaka, for his work and support in the production of \ntitle II of this bill. I also want to thank and compliment Senator \nMcCain and Senator Levin and Senator Warner for their work on title I, \nthe Wounded Warrior legislation. I truly appreciate the coming together \nof these diverse but connected jurisdictions to show we can break down \nour walls and to once again demonstrate and encourage both the \nDepartment of Defense and VA to work in a progressive, seamless fashion \nfor the benefit of our fighting men and women and for the benefit of \nthose same men and women when they become veterans and the \nresponsibility for them shifts to a different jurisdiction. It is \nimportant legislation and work of which we can be proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10131-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10131-S10132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LIVESTOCK INDEMNITY PROGRAM PAYMENTS\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight an important \npiece of legislation that was passed by the Senate last night. This \nlegislation would fix a potentially devastating mistake in the \nagriculture disaster assistance legislation Congress passed last May.\n  Over the past few years, drought conditions and other natural \ndisasters have financially strained tens of thousands of agriculture \nproducers across the country. Last May, Congress responded to the needs \nof America's producers by enacting more than $3 billion in emergency \ndisaster assistance for farmers and ranchers who experienced losses in \n2005, 2006, and early 2007.\n  This assistance includes payments for livestock losses under the \nLivestock Indemnity Program and compensation for grazing losses under \nthe Livestock Compensation Program.\n  Last month, it was brought to my attention that as many as 90% of \nlivestock producers will be ineligible for assistance due to an \nunintended technicality in the emergency supplemental bill. The USDA's \nOffice of General Counsel is interpreting Section 9012 of the emergency \nsupplemental bill in a very narrow manner. This section requires \nparticipation in the Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program--\nNAP--or Federal crop insurance pilot program during the year livestock \ndisaster assistance is requested.\n  If disaster benefits are limited to only those livestock producers \nwith NAP or crop insurance coverage, the vast majority of livestock \nproducers in drought-stricken regions will be ineligible for disaster \nassistance.\n  While crop insurance is typically required for crop disaster \nassistance, similar requirements are highly unusual for livestock \ndisaster assistance. In fact, NAP coverage has never been a \nprerequisite for livestock disaster assistance in previous emergency \nspending bills.\n  Only a small percentage of livestock producers have traditionally \nparticipated in the NAP program, because indemnity payments range from \n$1 to $2 per acre. Since NAP payments are so low, few grazing producers \nhave participated. It is simply bad policy to exclude producers from \ndisaster assistance who chose not to participate in an ineffective \nprogram.\n\n  Congress clearly intended disaster assistance to be available to \nthose producers most impacted by years of devastating weather \nconditions. My legislation would strike Section 9012 of the 2007 \nemergency supplemental spending bill, and would ensure that livestock \nproducers impacted by natural disasters receive assistance they deserve \nin a timely manner.\n\n[[Page S10132]]\n\n  The USDA is currently preparing policy, procedure and software to \nimplement disaster programs authorized under this legislation. USDA has \npromised to conduct signup and deliver financial assistance to our \nagriculture producers this fall. By the time these disaster dollars \nreach individual producers, many will have waited for over two years \nsince first experiencing weather-related losses. Without this \nlegislative fix, unacceptable disaster program implementation delays \nwill occur.\n  I thank the cosponsors of this legislation who have made another \nstrong stand for America's farm and ranch families. I also thank my \ncolleagues in the Senate for recognizing the urgency of this situation \nand passing this bill by unanimous consent last night.\n  Cosponsors of the bill are: Senators Nelson of Nebraska, Baucus, \nTester, Johnson, Conrad, Harkin, Landrieu, Barrasso, Enzi, Hagel, \nDorgan, and Inhofe.\n  I urge the House of Representatives to quickly pass my bill to ensure \nthat livestock producers are able to qualify for the disaster \nassistance that was signed into law earlier this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10132-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10132-S10133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF LESLIE SOUTHWICK\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I made remarks yesterday on the Senate \nfloor about the nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick to the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues then came to the floor and made \ntheir own remarks about Judge Southwick. I would like to respond to \nsome of their points and set the record straight.\n  First, I take issue with the way they described the procedural \nhistory of a case involving a White employee in Mississippi who was \nfired for calling an African-American colleague the ``N'' word. In this \nsharply divided 5- to 4- case, Judge Southwick joined the majority, and \nhe voted to reinstate the White employee with full backpay and no \npunishment whatsoever.\n  Senator Cornyn came to the Senate floor and said that the Southwick \nmajority ``was ultimately upheld by the Mississippi Supreme Court in \ncompliance with appropriate legal standards.''\n  That statement does not accurately describe what actually happened.\n  Yes, the Mississippi Supreme Court said that termination was too \nDraconian a punishment, but it also said that the decision to reinstate \nthe White employee with full backpay and with no punishment \nwhatsoever--the decision that Judge Southwick signed onto--was \nerroneous.\n  Let me read the last three words of the Mississippi Supreme Court's \nopinion in this case so the record is clear. The three words are: \n``reversed and remanded.''\n  The Mississippi Supreme Court concluded: ``[W]e remand this matter \nback to the Employee Appeals Board for the imposition of a lesser \npenalty, or to make detailed findings on the record why no penalty \nshould be imposed.''\n  This conclusion is the same one reached by Judge Diaz, who dissented \nfrom Judge Southwick and the five-person majority at the appeals court \nlevel. Judge Diaz wrote: ``I write separately to object to the EAB's \nfailure to impose sanctions upon Bonnie Richmond for using a racial \nslur in describing another DHS employee. . . . This is not to say that \nthe EAB should have followed the DHS's recommendations to terminate \nRichmond, but there is a strong presumption that some penalty should \nhave been imposed.''\n  That conclusion, which the Mississippi Supreme Court embraced, \nundermines Senator Cornyn's assertion that the Southwick majority ``was \nultimately upheld by the Mississippi Supreme Court.''\n  The bottom line is that Judge Southwick voted to reinstate the White \nemployee with complete impunity--with no punishment whatsoever. The \nMississippi Supreme Court said: No, punishment should be considered.\n  Let me address another aspect of this case that was mentioned by a \nRepublican colleague. In trying to minimize the significance of the \ncase and defend Judge Southwick's position, this Senator stated that \nthe White employee's use of the ``N'' word was ``a one-time comment.''\n  I would dispute that characterization. It is true that the Southwick \nmajority referred to ``this one use of a racial epithet.'' However, \naccording to a letter from the State agency reprinted in the State \nsupreme court opinion, there were at least two instances in which the \nWhite employee used the ``N'' word: once in front of the victim and \nonce at a meeting where the victim was not present.\n  In addition, as set forth in the State supreme court opinion, the \nWhite employee testified that she didn't think her Black colleague \nwould be offended by use of the ``N'' word because: ``You know, I \nthought that we had used that terminology previously and Varrie [the \nblack employee] didn't seem to have a problem with it, nor anyone \nelse.''\n  So it seems that the use of the ``N'' word was not an isolated \ncomment in this workplace.\n  Senator Cornyn tried to defend Judge Southwick's vote in this case, \nand he said the following: ``A judge has no choice but to vote. He \nvoted for the result, for the outcome of the case, but I think it's \nunfair to attribute the writing of the opinion to Judge Southwick.''\n  I disagree. As I noted yesterday, Judge Southwick had other options \nin this case. He could have written a concurrence. He could have \nwritten a dissent. He could have joined one of two different dissents \nthat were written by other members of his court in this case. He did \nnone of these things.\n  The ``N'' word case is not the only case in which Judge Southwick has \ndemonstrated racial insensitivity. A coalition of four leading civil \nrights groups--the NAACP, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, \nthe National Urban League, and the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition--wrote a \nletter to the Senate Judiciary Committee and stated:\n\n       We are also troubled by Judge Southwick's record in cases \n     involving race discrimination in jury selection. . . . \n     Generally, Southwick has upheld the rejection of claims by \n     defendants that the prosecution was motivated by race \n     discrimination in striking African Americans from juries. \n     However, Southwick appears to have less difficulty finding \n     race discrimination when the prosecution makes `reverse \n     Batson' claims that defendants have struck white jurors for \n     racial reasons.\n\n  The letter discusses several examples of this trend in Judge \nSouthwick's track record.\n  Let me also say a little more about the case in which Judge Southwick \nvoted to take away an 8-year-old girl from her lesbian mother.\n  What is troubling about this case is not only the result that Judge \nSouthwick reached but also the fact that he was the only judge in the \nmajority to sign onto a troubling concurring opinion that said sexual \norientation is a choice and that losing a child in a custody battle is \na consequence of that choice.\n  Judge Southwick is opposed by the Human Rights Campaign--a prominent \ngay rights organization--which has said the following about this \nnominee:\n\n       No parent should face the loss of a child simply because of \n     who they are. If he believes that losing a child is an \n     acceptable `consequence' of being gay, Judge Southwick cannot \n     be given the responsibility to protect the basic rights of \n     gay and lesbian Americans.\n\n  As I said yesterday, this nomination isn't just about the ``N'' word \ncase and the gay custody case. Judge Southwick has a long track record \nof favoring employers and corporations over employees and consumers. \nThere are two studies that bear this out: One was conducted by the \nBusiness and Industrial Political Education Committee, as reported by \nthe Biloxi, Mississippi Sun Herald on March 24, 2004. The other study \nwas undertaken by an organization called the Alliance for Justice and \nis available on their website.\n  I would make one final point. One of my Republican colleagues \ncriticized me for opposing Judge Southwick for a seat on the Fifth \nCircuit while having voted for him last year to be a Federal district \ncourt judge.\n  It is true that Judge Southwick was voted out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee last year by voice vote as part of a package of 10 judicial \nnominees. But we did not know about the ``N'' word case at that time. \nIt is an unpublished decision and was not brought to our attention \nuntil this year.\n  In any event, the reality is that our circuit courts are more crucial \nto the protection of our rights and liberties than our district courts. \nBecause the U.S. Supreme Court takes so few cases,\n\n[[Page S10133]]\n\nthe circuit courts of appeal are the final word in 99 percent of \nFederal cases that are appealed. That is why most of the judicial \nnomination battles of the past few years have involved circuit court \nnominees, not district court nominees.\n  I know the Senators from Mississippi, and others, feel strongly that \nJudge Southwick should be confirmed. I respect their beliefs, and I \nhave listened to their arguments. But I hope they will recognize the \ncontroversy surrounding this nomination and encourage the White House \nto put forward a different nominee--someone who can gain bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10133-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10133-S10134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to submit to the Senate the second \nset of budget scorekeeping reports for the 2008 budget resolution. The \nreports, which cover fiscal years 2007 and 2008, were prepared by the \nCongressional Budget Office pursuant to section 308(b) and in aid of \nsection 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended.\n  The reports show the effects of congressional action through July 24, \n2007, and includes legislation that was enacted and or cleared for the \nPresident's signature since I filed my first report last month. The new \nlegislation includes: Public Law 110-42, an act to extend the \nauthorities of the Andean Trade Preference Act until February 29, 2008; \nPublic Law 110-48, a bill to provide for the extension of transitional \nmedical assistance, TMA, and the abstinence education program through \nthe end of fiscal year 2007, and for other purposes; and H.J. Res. 44; \npending Presidential action, a joint resolution approving the renewal \nof import restrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy \nAct of 2003, and for other purposes. The estimates of budget authority, \noutlays, and revenues used in the reports are consistent with the \ntechnical and economic assumptions of S. Con Res. 21, the 2008 budget \nresolution.\n  For 2007, the estimates show that current level spending equals the \nbudget resolution for both budget authority and outlays while current \nlevel revenues exceed the budget resolution by $4.2 billion. For 2008, \nthe estimates show that current level spending is below the budget \nresolution by $928.1 billion for budget authority and $586.7 billion \nfor outlays while current level revenues exceed the budget resolution \nlevel by $34.6 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters and accompanying tables from \nCBO be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows.\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2007.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend Treasury Secretary \nPaulson and his staff at the Treasury Department for convening the \nTreasury Conference on Business Taxation and Global Taxation. The \npurpose of this conference is to examine ways our current business tax \nsystem affects economic growth, job creation, and competitiveness. This \nis a very important issue that requires our immediate attention.\n  Today American companies compete in a global market. In the 1960s, \ntrade in goods to and from the United States represented just over 6 \npercent of GDP. Today, it represents over 20 percent of GDP, a \nthreefold increase. The U.S. role in the global economy also is quite \ndifferent. Forty years ago, the United States was dominant, accounting \nfor over half of all multinational investment in the world. Yet, today \nthe United States economy represents 20 percent of global GDP.\n  However, our Tax Code has not kept up with the globalization of the \nU.S. economy. The rules are outdated and penalize U.S. economic \ninterests by hindering American businesses' ability to effectively \ncompete in our global economy.\n  The most significant demonstration of our Tax Code's inadequacies is \nthe corporate tax rate. As Treasury stated in its conference materials, \nsince 1980, the United States has gone from a high corporate tax-rate \ncountry to a low-rate country and back again to a high-rate country \ntoday. According to research done by the Tax Foundation, the United \nStates has the second highest corporate tax rate in the OECD. The only \ncountry with a higher corporate tax rate is Japan. The U.S. corporate \ntax rate is higher than the rate in all European Union countries.\n  Furthermore, the United States is one of only two OECD countries that \nhas not reduced rates since 1994--and one of only six OECD countries \nthat have not reduced rates since 2000. According to KPMG, the average \ncorporate tax rate in the European Union has fallen from 38 percent in \n1996 to 24 percent in 2007. The United States has an average corporate \ntax rate of about 39 percent, including State level corporate taxes. \nThe U.S. rate has not dropped recently. In fact, the last time Congress \nacted on the corporate tax rate, we actually raised it.\n  According to a recent Treasury study, a country with a tax rate 1 \npercentage point lower than another country's attracts 3 percent more \ncapital. Therefore, this international trend of lower corporate tax \nrates is not surprising, and it is critical that the United States \nfollow suit.\n  A high corporate tax rate is not good for American businesses--or our \neconomy. A high rate deters corporate investment in the United States. \nIt also incentivizes companies to shift their profits to lower tax \njurisdictions. To attract businesses and profits to America, we need to \nlower our corporate tax rate.\n  This fall I plan to introduce legislation that will lower our \ncorporate tax rate. I look forward to working with the administration \nand Congress in enacting this important reform. And I once again \napplaud the Treasury Department for examining our broken corporate tax \ncode.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10135-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Sergeant John R.

Sergeant Massey was a member of the Arkansas \nNational Guard's C Battery, 2nd Battalion, 142nd Fires Brigade based in \nOzark, AR.\n  Sergeant Massey was remembered by friends and family as a good father \nwho enjoyed playing with his kids, spending time with his family, and \nriding his Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Major General William D. Wofford \nalso shared stories about Sergeant Massey's dedication to serve. \nAccording to the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, Wofford had been told by \nSergeant Massey's father that he had always wanted to be in the \nmilitary and that ``this is the way John would have wanted to go out--\nas a soldier.'' A fellow soldier noted, ``All you needed to tell him \nwas when and where, and it would be done.'' In fact, Wofford recalled \nonce asking Massey if he would like to give up his spot manning a .50 \ncaliber machine gun in the turrets of his armored patrol vehicle. \nAccording to Wofford, Sergeant Massey said, ``You can order me out of \nthe turret . . . That's the only way I'm leaving.'' When it was all \nsaid and done, Major General Wofford said that ``Sergeant. Massey \nstayed in the turret until the very end.''\n  Sergeant Massey was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple \nHeart, as well as the Arkansas Distinguished Service Medal. He is \nsurvived by his wife Amanda ``Mandy'' Massey; two daugthers, Monica and \nEmily; son Joseph; mother Deborah Massey; and father Ray Massey; as \nwell as other relatives and friends.\n\n\n                       specialist robert d. varga\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise to recognize SPC Robert D. Varga of Monroe \nCity, MO, who died on July 15, 2007, from noncombat related injuries in \nBaghdad. Rob and his wife, Ellie Madder Stone, called Little Rock, AR, \nhome and were married last year on September 5, 2006.\n  According to Specialist Varga's mother, Cecilia Varga, he was in the \nArmy to serve his country and further his education. He came from a \nmilitary family: his father served in Vietnam, grandfather served in \nWorld War II, and two brothers-in-law served in Iraq. Specialist Varga \njoined the Army in 2003 and was originally deployed as a cook with the \nHeadquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 759th Military Police \nBattalion. After his first deployment, he switched duties and trained \nwith the military police. He was then assigned to the 984th Military \nPolice Company in October 2005.\n  He received many military honors, including the Combat Action Badge, \nArmy Commendation Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, \nGlobal War on Terror Service Medal, Army Service Medal, Army Service \nRibbon, and National Defense Service Medal.\n  Family members remembered him for his outgoing personality and his \nlove of cooking and drawing. He is survived by his wife Ellie; his \nfather and mother, Frank and Cecilia Varga; sisters Pamela Poelker, \nCarey Noland, and Amanda Reimann; paternal grandmother, Marge Varga; \nmaternal grandparents, Glen and Charlotte Little, as well as numerous \nnephews and nieces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10135-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10135-S10136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE CYPRIOT PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, 1 year ago this month, the United Nations \nUnder Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Ibrahim Gambari, \npresided over a joint meeting between the President of the Republic of \nCyprus, Tassos Papadopoulos, and the head of the Turkish Cypriot \ncommunity, Mehmet Ali Talat. Their discussions reaffirmed a commitment \nby both sides to forge a lasting peace on Cyprus and push forward with \ntalks to that end.\n  In the months since that meeting, the Cypriot peace process has \nstagnated. The talks that both sides agreed to never took place, and \npetty disputes over bureaucratic issues have stymied progress on \nsubstantive negotiations. Simply put, the people of Cyprus deserve \nbetter.\n  A generation of Cypriots has now grown to adulthood estranged from \ntheir peaceful shared history and their promising shared destiny. I \nbelieve we must correct this wrong before others on the island endure a \nsimilar fate. Unless the peace process begins to move at a much faster \npace, that may not happen.\n  In the last few days, there have been some signs of progress but also \ntroubling indications that the paralysis of the past year might \ncontinue. President Papadopoulos invited Mr. Talat to discuss the peace \nprocess, a significant step in the right direction. However, Mr. \nTalat--after first accepting the invitation--later claimed that it was \nnot the right time for a meeting. I sincerely hope he will change his \nview and that the resulting discussions will yield real results. \nNeither side can afford to engage in another round of foot-dragging. I \ndo not want to look back in a year on another anniversary of missed \nopportunities.\n  Since 2003, there have been millions of peaceful crossings at the \nGreen Line that segregates the island's two communities. Cypriots of \nall ethnicities\n\n[[Page S10136]]\n\nhave clearly demonstrated their ability to coexist. It is time for \npolitical leaders to bring their policies in line with the actions of \ntheir people. As part of that process, Turkey should begin the \nwithdrawal of troops from Cyprus. The presence of these forces is \nneither justified nor necessary and complicates efforts to return the \nisland to a state of lasting peace.\n  Mr. President, as I have said before, the reunification of Cyprus \nwill have significance far beyond the Mediterranean. The island could \nserve as an example of how different ethnic groups can overcome past \nwrongs, bridge differences, and live together as neighbors. I am \nconfident that future generations of Cypriots can serve as such a model \nand, in doing so, enjoy the peace that they rightly deserve. I hope \nthat their political leaders will move quickly to afford them that \nopportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10136-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL DAY OF THE AMERICAN COWBOY\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to remember my dear friend and \ncolleague, Senator Craig Thomas. Craig was a champion for Wyoming, the \nWest, and its values. Every year, for the last several years, Craig \nchampioned a resolution honoring the American cowboy. A true cowboy in \nhis own right, Craig sought to honor those who serve as stewards of the \nland, embody the courageous and daring spirit of the West, and uphold \nthe values of freedom and responsibility that we all cherish.\n  I was proud to support my friend in this endeavor over the years to \nhonor these great individuals, and today, I am pleased the President \nhas also stated his support for the National Day of the American \nCowboy.

Mr. President, I am here today to speak about S. 1082, \nthe Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act, and H.R. 2900, the \nFood and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007.\n  The Senate passed S. 1082 in May and the House passed H.R. 2900 \nearlier this month. As the House and Senate go into conference and work \nto resolve differences between these two bills, I urge my colleagues to \nkeep in mind the public's interest.\n  Both bills contain provisions that attempt to address some of the \nproblems that have been plaguing the FDA over the past 3 years. Some of \nthese issues are better addressed by the Senate bill and others by the \nHouse bill.\n  I am going to spend the next few minutes to comment on what the bills \ndon't do and point out some of the provisions that I believe are \nimportant to improving drug safety at the FDA that will benefit all \nAmericans.\n  Two months ago, I offered amendment No. 1039 to S. 1082, because I \nbelieved--and still believe--that S. 1082 does not address a \nfundamental problem at the Food and Drug Administration--the lack of \nequality between the preapproval and postapproval offices of the \nagency, the Office of New Drugs and the Office of Surveillance and \nEpidemiology, respectively. The Office of New Drugs approves drugs for \nthe market, while the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology monitors \nand assesses the safety of the drugs once they are on the market.\n  My amendment was intended to curb delays in FDA actions when it comes \nto safety.\n  The Institute of Medicine recognized the imbalance between the Office \nof New Drugs and the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology and \nrecommended joint authority between these two offices for postapproval \nregulatory actions related to safety. My amendment did just that.\n  While I believe an independent postmarketing safety center is still \nthe best solution to the problem, joint postmarketing decisionmaking \nbetween the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology and the Office of \nNew Drugs at least would allow the office with the postmarketing safety \nexpertise to have a say in what drug safety actions the FDA would take.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment lost by one vote. But the fact that it \nlost by such a narrow margin demonstrates that many of my Senate \ncolleagues also recognize the seriousness of this problem and believe \naction by Congress is necessary.\n  I have seen time and time again in my investigations that serious \nsafety problems that emerge after a drug is on the market do not \nnecessarily get prompt attention from the Office of New Drugs, the \noffice that approves drugs to go on the market in the first place. We \nsaw this with Vioxx and more recently with the diabetes drug Avandia.\n  FDA has disregarded and downplayed important concerns and warnings \nfrom its own best scientists. We saw evidence of that in the way FDA \ntreated Dr. Andrew Mosholder's findings on antidepressants and Dr. \nDavid Graham's findings on Vioxx. The FDA even attempted to undermine \nthe publication of Dr. Graham's findings in the journal Lancet.\n  My current review of FDA's handling of Avandia has unearthed concerns \nsimilar to those we have seen in the past--a situation where FDA \nignored its own postmarketing safety experts and once again left the \npublic in the dark regarding potential, serious health risks.\n  Not only did the FDA disregard the concerns and recommendations from \nthe office responsible for postmarketing surveillance, but I have found \nthat it also attempted to suppress scientific dissent.\n  As I have said many times before, FDA employees dedicated to \npostmarketing drug safety should be able to express their opinions in \nwriting and independently without fear of retaliation, reprimand, or \nreprisal. But in the past 2 months, I have had to write to the FDA \nregarding the suppression of dissent from not one but two FDA officials \ninvolved in the review of Avandia.\n  Last month, I expressed concerns about FDA's treatment of the former \nDeputy Director of the Division of Drug Risk Evaluation. I urged the \nCommissioner to take appropriate corrective actions. That deputy \ndirector had been verbally reprimanded because she signed off on a \nrecommendation that a black box warning be placed on Avandia for \ncongestive heart failure.\n  This week, I wrote to the Commissioner about a senior medical officer \nin the Office of New Drugs who was removed from the review of potential \ncardiovascular safety problems associated with Avandia. This medical \nofficer also believed that there was enough evidence to support a black \nbox warning on Avandia regarding congestive heart failure. But I guess \nthat FDA management just did not want to hear about drug safety \nproblems--again.\n  Of the two bills up for discussion, neither the Senate nor the House \nversion will give postmarketing surveillance the equal footing it \ndeserves with drug approval. But I appreciate the attempt by my \ncolleagues in the House to provide some transparency in FDA's \npostmarketing drug safety system. Transparency is the key to \naccountability. In particular, I welcome the provision in H.R. 2900 \nthat would require FDA to report to Congress on drug safety \nrecommendations received in consultation with, as well as the reports \nfrom, the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology. If FDA does not act \non a recommendation from the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology or \nit takes a different action, the agency would be required to provide \nits justification to Congress.\n  In its report released last fall, the Institute of Medicine called \nfor specific safety-related performance goals in the Prescription Drug \nUser Fee Act, PDUFA, of 2007 to restore balance between speeding access \nto drugs and ensuring their safety.\n  I have heard from FDA employees that because of the PDUFA deadlines, \nthe staff in the Office of New Drugs is under tremendous time pressure \nto approve new drugs quickly, so safety concerns often needed to be \n``fit in'' wherever they could. This reinforces a point I have \nfrequently made in the past--the Office of New Drugs doesn't give \npostmarketing drug safety the attention or priority it deserves.\n  The House bill attempts to address this, in part, by requiring that \npostmarketing safety performance measures be developed that are ``as \nmeasurable and rigorous as the ones already developed for premarket \nreview.''\n  S. 1082 requires that the Secretary assess and implement the risk \nevaluation and management strategies in\n\n[[Page S10137]]\n\nconsultation with the Office of New Drugs and the Office of \nSurveillance and Epidemiology. It also calls for a report to Congress \non the assessment of that coordination.\n  The requirement that these two offices be consulted doesn't \nnecessarily change the status quo. The Office of Surveillance and \nEpidemiology is still just a consultant to the Office of New Drugs, and \nthe Office of New Drugs decides--and will continue to decide--what, if \nany, action will be taken to address a safety issue. But I hope that \nrequiring that the office responsible for postmarketing surveillance be \nat the table would encourage FDA to better define the role of this \noffice on drug safety matters and give this office a greater voice, \nalbeit a limited one.\n  Last fall, the Government Accountability Office reported that the \nOffice of New Drugs typically sets the agenda and chooses the \npresenters at FDA's scientific advisory meetings. The GAO recommended \nthat the role of the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology be \nclarified. After all, this office is the expert on postmarketing safety \nmatters.\n  This week, Senator Baucus and I sent a letter to the FDA to express \nconcerns regarding an upcoming advisory committee meeting on Avandia. \nAs usual, the Office of New Drugs is setting the agenda here. We \npointed out to the FDA that it doesn't make sense that it is the drug \napproval office and not the postmarketing safety office that controls \nthe advisory committee meeting convened for the purpose of discussing \npostmarketing safety matters.\n  In addition to the provisions I have mentioned so far, both the \nSenate and House bills would give FDA the much needed authorities to \nrequire labeling changes and postapproval studies; however, the House \nbill includes additional provisions outside of the risk evaluation and \nmanagement strategy process that is established under both bills.\n  The House bill specifically enables the Secretary to initiate action \non drug labeling and postapproval studies. For example, outside of the \nrisk evaluation and management strategy process, the Secretary may \nrequire a manufacturer to conduct postapproval research to assess or \nidentify potential health risks.\n  Another provision that would improve transparency at the FDA is a \nprovision in the Senate bill that requires FDA to post on its Web site, \nthe ``action package'' for the approval of a new drug within 30 days of \napproval. That action package would contain any document generated by \nthe FDA related to the review of the drug application, including a \nsummary review of all conclusions and, among other things, any \ndisagreements and how they were resolved.\n  Further, in light of the many allegations that FDA safety reviewers \nare sometimes coerced into changing their scientific findings, I \nbelieve it is critical that the following provision in S. 1082 survives \nthe legislative conference process--the provision that states that a \nscientific review of a drug application must not be changed by FDA \nmanagers or the reviewer once it is final.\n  S. 1082 also requires FDA to seek outside expert opinions on drug \nsafety questions at least two times a year from its Drug Safety and \nRisk Management Advisory Committee and other advisory committees.\n  Another important provision in S. 1082 is a requirement that FDA \nestablish and make publicly available clear, written policies on the \nreview and clearance of scientific publications by FDA employees.\n  Some of the stronger provisions regarding the expansion of the \nclinical trial registry come from the House bill. While both bills \naddress clinical trial registration, the House bill adopts a much \nbroader definition of applicable clinical trials. ``Thus, information \nabout many more trials would be made publicly available through the \nInternet under the House bill.''\n  Clinical trial registries serve an important function--they foster \ntransparency and accountability in health-related research and \ndevelopment by ensuring that the scientific and medical communities and \nthe general public have access to basic information about clinical \ntrials. Mandatory posting of clinical trial information would help \nprevent companies from withholding clinically important information \nabout their products.\n  I have heard from some scientists that they can't disclose the \nfindings of their studies because the data belongs to the manufacturer. \nIt is up to the manufacturer to decide if and when the results would be \npublished, and those results don't always see the light of day.\n  But scientists need access to all of the evidence to conduct a full \nand independent review of a product's safety. However, we know that \nrelevant data are not always made available for further review by \nindependent scientists. While the House bill does not require \nmanufacturers to share its data with other scientists, it does require \nthe sponsor of a study to report whether or not agreements were made \nrestricting individuals from discussing or publishing trial results.\n  In addition, for FDA's new authorities to be effective, there has to \nbe strong civil monetary penalties. In May, I also offered amendment \nNo. 998 to S. 1082. That amendment passed.\n  Amendment No. 998 provides for the application of stronger civil \nmonetary penalties for violations of approved risk evaluation and \nmitigation strategies.\n  While significant monetary penalties may be imposed under the House \nbill for continuous violations, the minimum penalty for a violation \nunder the Senate bill would be higher because of my amendment. We need \nto make sure that we're giving FDA, the watchdog, some bite to go with \nthe bark. If monetary penalties are nothing more than the cost of doing \nbusiness, you won't change behavior. More importantly, you can't deter \nintentional bad behavior.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Senators Kennedy and Enzi and \nCongressmen Dingell and Barton for their tremendous efforts on these \nbills. We have an opportunity to reform, improve, and reestablish the \nFDA as the gold standard for drug safety. If Congress is going to make \nmeaningful changes to the FDA to increase transparency and \naccountability, it is critical that the provisions I have discussed \ntoday make it into the bill that comes out of conference. To do less \nwould deny the American people safer drugs when they reach into their \nmedicine cabinets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10137-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10137-S10139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I believe that Members of the Senate and \nHouse of Representatives will be pleased that two of our distinguished \nformer colleagues were this month honored by President of the Republic \nof Cyprus, Tassos Papadopoulos.\n  In ceremonies on July 3 at the Presidential Palace in Nicosia, the \ncapital of Cyprus, President Papadopoulos bestowed on Senator Sarbanes \nand Congressman Brademas the Grand Cross of the Order of Makarios III.\n  John Brademas, who served for 22 years as Representative in Congress \nfrom the District centered in South Bend, IN, was author or coauthor of \nmuch of the legislation enacted during those years in support of \nschools, colleges, and universities; libraries and museums; the arts \nand the humanities. In his last 4 years, he was Majority Whip of the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Paul Sarbanes served in the House of Representatives for 6 years and \nthe Senate for 30 years. As chair of the Senate Committee on Banking \nand Urban Affairs, he was principal author of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of \n2002, to ensure integrity in corporate governance.\n  Both John Brademas and Paul Sarbanes were Rhodes scholars and so \nstudied at Oxford University, from which both earned degrees. John \nBrademas also graduated from Harvard University and Paul Sarbanes from \nPrinceton University and the Harvard Law School.\n  John Brademas was the first native-born American of Greek descent \nelected to Congress, House or Senate; Paul Sarbanes was the first \nGreek-American elected to the Senate. I note that his son, John \nSarbanes, was last November in Maryland elected to Paul's former seat \nin the House of Representatives.\n  While in Nicosia, both former Senator Sarbanes and former Congressman \nBrademas also visited the HSPH-Cyprus International Initiative for the\n\n[[Page S10138]]\n\nEnvironment and Public Health, a program associated with the Harvard \nSchool of Public Health.\n  At this point in the Record, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks \nof President Papadopoulos of the Republic of Cyprus at the Presidential \nPalace, Nicosia, Cyprus, on July 3, 2007, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Remarks of President Tassos Papadopoulos of the Republic of Cyprus\n\n       Senator Sarbanes; Congressman Brademas; Your Eminence, \n     Archbishop Chrysostomos; Your Eminence, Archbishop Demetrios; \n     Ambassador Schlicher; distinguished friends and guests,\n       It gives me great pleasure to welcome you tonight at the \n     Presidential Palace in order to pay tribute to two long-\n     standing and unwavering supporters of the people of the whole \n     of Cyprus, Senator Paul Sarbanes and Congressman John \n     Brademas.\n       I have had the privilege of knowing both these \n     distinguished gentlemen for many years and I consider them to \n     be among the most ardent, tireless and unflinching supporters \n     for the just cause of Cyprus in the United States.\n       Senator Sarbanes and Congressman Brademas ably represented \n     the people in their respective constituencies for decades, as \n     well as successfully advancing the aspirations and objectives \n     of the Hellenic American Community. I can think of no other \n     two people who have done more for the nurturing of closer \n     bonds between the people of Cyprus and the United States of \n     America. I have always held the view and have declared on \n     several public occasions that the first loyalty of Americans \n     of Greek origin is to their host country, the United States \n     of America. When, however, the best interests of the United \n     States and the rules of international law and practice are \n     not incompatible with the special interests of Greece and of \n     Cyprus, we hope and expect that they will lean towards and \n     publicly remember their ethnic roots. Both gentlemen have \n     admirably honoured these principles.\n       For all these reasons, the Government of the Republic of \n     Cyprus has decided to pay tribute to their life-long \n     commitment to the Rule of Law, ``justice for Cyprus'', for \n     the condemnation of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, for the \n     end of the occupation of Cyprus soil by Turkish troops, for \n     the end of the massive violations of human rights in Cyprus \n     by Turkey and for promoting a just, functional and lasting \n     solution to the Cyprus issue.\n\n\n                             JOHN BRADEMAS\n\n       John Brademas was born in Mishawaka, Indiana, of Greek \n     parentage. He was elected to the United States Congress in \n     1958 as a Representative of Indiana's Third District, thus \n     becoming the first U.S.-born Greek-American to be elected to \n     the United States Congress and paving the way for, among \n     others, Paul Sarbanes, Paul Tsongas and Mike Bilirakis.\n       He represented his district for twenty-two years (1959-\n     1981), the last four as Majority Whip for the Democratic \n     Party. Upon leaving Congress, Dr. Brademas served as \n     President of New York University from 1981 to 1992 and has \n     since been President Emeritus. He has been integral in \n     establishing a close-knit relationship between Cyprus and New \n     York University, examples of which are the current \n     excavations in Yeronisos under Professor Joan Connelly and \n     the Cyprus Global Professorship on History and Theory of \n     Justice, which I will have the honour of inaugurating in \n     September.\n\n\n                             PAUL SARBANES\n\n       Paul Sarbanes was born in Salisbury, Maryland, of Greek \n     parents. After serving in the Maryland House of Delegates for \n     four years, he was elected to the United States Congress in \n     1970 and served in the House of Representatives for six \n     years.\n       In 1976 he was elected to the United States Senate for the \n     State of Maryland and was re-elected four more times, serving \n     for a total of thirty years, before retiring this January. As \n     Chair of the Senate Banking and Urban Affairs Committee in \n     2001-02, he was the main architect of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley \n     Act, which effectuated one of the most significant changes to \n     United States Securities laws in over 70 years.\n       As impressive as their domestic record, it is the steadfast \n     support for the just cause of Cyprus of Senator Sarbanes and \n     Congressman Brademas which brings us here today.\n       Immediately after the Turkish invasion of 1974, John \n     Brademas and Paul Sarbanes, with the help of the late \n     Congressman Benjamin Rosenthal of New York and Senator Thomas \n     Eagleton of Missouri, who recently passed away, led the \n     successful effort of enforcing an arms embargo against \n     Turkey. As Dr. Brademas put it himself, Paul Sarbanes and he \n     were not the Greek lobby, but the ``rule of law lobby''.\n       This last notion forms the cornerstone of their support \n     towards Cyprus. Both men have for many years advocated for a \n     just solution to the Cyprus problem, not only because it is a \n     Hellenic issue, but because it is essentially a rule of law \n     and human rights issue, under United States law. Only a \n     solution based on the relevant Security Council Resolutions \n     and in accordance with the principles of international law, \n     as well as the Acquis Communautaire of the European Union, \n     can secure a permanent, viable and stable solution, which \n     will benefit all Cypriots. Such a solution, which is not \n     tailor-made for the satisfaction of outside parties, will \n     enhance the stability of the Eastern Mediterranean and is \n     conducive to the interests of the United States.\n\n\n                            THE RULE OF LAW\n\n       John Brademas and Paul Sarbanes consistently advanced the \n     cause of Cyprus throughout their political careers. In so \n     doing, they have been the embodiment of values cherished by \n     America, such as the rule of law, respect for human rights \n     and democratic governance, which are, alas, all too often \n     swept aside for reasons of political expedience.\n       Tonight's honourees, have been exceptional leaders of the \n     Greek-American Community. I would be remiss if I did not \n     dedicate a few words towards the Hellenic diaspora in the \n     United States. The President of the Cyprus Federation of \n     America, Mr. Peter Papanicolaou, is amongst us today, so I \n     take this opportunity to convey through him the sincere \n     appreciation of the Cypriot people for the Community's \n     tireless support and to urge you, dear Peter, to continue \n     with your efforts until Cyprus is free and freely reunified, \n     in its territory, society, institutions and economy.\n       I would also like to welcome again to Cyprus the spiritual \n     leader of the community, His Eminence, Archbishop Demetrios, \n     and to thank him for his efforts to stop the pillage and \n     destruction of Cyprus' religious and cultural heritage in the \n     occupied area.\n       Before I conclude my remarks, I wish to once again express \n     the heartfelt gratitude and appreciation of the Government \n     and people of Cyprus to Paul Sarbanes and John Brademas for \n     their unwavering commitment, all these years, and to wish \n     them the best of luck for all their future endeavors.\n       Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, at this point in the Record, I ask \n     unanimous consent that the remarks of former Congressman \n     Brademas on this occasion be printed in the Record. Senator \n     Sarbanes responded extemporaneously on this occasion.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Remarks of Dr. John Brademas President Emeritus, New York University \n     and Former Member, Indiana, 1959-1981, United States House of \n                            Representatives\n\n       President Papadopoulos; Your Eminence, Archbishop \n     Chrysostomos; Your Eminence, Archbishop Demetrios; Ambassador \n     Schlicher; distinguished guests and friends all, I want to \n     express to you, Mr. President, my deepest appreciation for \n     the high honor that you do my colleague and valued friend, \n     Senator Paul Sarbanes, and me with the award of the Grand \n     Cross of the Order of Makarios III.\n       I want to recognize as well Dr. Phillip Mitsis, Alexander \n     S. Onassis Professor of Hellenic Culture and Civilization and \n     Professor of Classics at New York University, and his wife, \n     Sophia Kalantzakos, a Member of the Parliament of Greece.\n       Let me here also thank the distinguished Ambassador of the \n     United States to the Republic of Cyprus, His Excellency, \n     Ronald L. Schlicher, for having this week so graciously \n     received Senator and Mrs. Sarbanes, my wife and me.\n       It was nearly one year ago, on September 8, 2006, that I \n     had the privilege of welcoming to New York University the \n     distinguished President of the Republic of Cyprus, His \n     Excellency, Tassos Papadopoulos, and now I am pleased to be \n     in the country he so faithfully serves as leader.\n       I hope, Mr. President, and ladies and gentlemen, you will \n     allow me a few words to say why this honor is so meaningful \n     to me.\n       As most of you know, I am the first native-born American of \n     Greek origin elected to the Congress of the United States--my \n     late father was born in Kalamata.\n       I was for 22 years a Member of the House of \n     Representatives, from the State of Indiana.\n       In Congress, I was a member of the committee with \n     responsibility for education legislation and so helped write \n     all the laws enacted during those two decades and two years \n     to support schools, colleges and universities; libraries and \n     museums; the arts and the humanities. And in my last four \n     years, I served as the Majority Whip of the House of \n     Representatives, part of the Leadership of the Democratic \n     Party.\n       In 1981 I became president of New York University or, as we \n     call it, NYU, the largest private university in my country. I \n     am now president emeritus.\n\n\n                         SENATOR PAUL SARBANES\n\n       I am so pleased that my distinguished friend, United States \n     Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, is here with his lovely \n     wife, Christine, and am, of course, delighted that my \n     brilliant and beautiful physician wife, Mary Ellen, has \n     joined me for this ceremony.\n       And I want to thank my dear cousin, Anna Bredima-\n     Savopoulou, Counsel for the Union of Greek Shipowners, for \n     having flown here from Athens to be on hand for this \n     ceremony. I am very proud of Anna's accomplishments.\n       Paul Sarbanes, as you know, for many years a leading member \n     of the United States Senate and, indeed, the first Greek-\n     American elected to the Senate, and a valued ally in the \n     struggle for justice for Cyprus, is someone I have often \n     described as ``a modern Pericles''.\n       I am delighted that Paul's son, John Sarbanes, was last \n     November elected to represent Paul's former constituency in \n     the\n\n[[Page S10139]]\n\n     House of Representatives even as I'm pleased to say that only \n     a few weeks ago, Michael Sarbanes, another son of Paul and \n     Christine, has announced his candidacy for the presidency of \n     the City Council of Baltimore. Obviously, politics runs in \n     the Sarbanes family!\n       I'm glad, too, to welcome some other friends from my days \n     in Washington, including the distinguished former Ambassador \n     of Cyprus to the United States, Andreas Jacovides, and his \n     wife, Pamela, as well as two great champions of the Hellenic \n     cause in my country and, indeed, the world, Andrew Athens and \n     Andrew Manatos.\n       I'm pleased also that two vigorous voices of the Cypriot \n     community in the United States are here today, Phillip \n     Christopher and Panicos Papanicolaou.\n       I'm glad as well to greet a colleague from New York \n     University, an outstanding scholar, Professor Joan Breton \n     Connelly, leader of the excavation of Yeronisos Island and of \n     an international team there. Professor Connelly has just \n     published a magnificent book, Portrait of a Priestess: Women \n     and Ritual in Ancient Greece, which has won splendid reviews \n     in the New York Times and New York Review of Books.\n       And I must salute that eminent archaeologist, Professor \n     Vassos Karageorghis, director of the Anastasios G. Leventis \n     Foundation.\n\n\n                           LINKS WITH CYPRUS\n\n       I have still other links with Cyprus.\n       I serve on the international advisory counsel of The Pharos \n     Trust, that splendid chamber of cultural activity in Cyprus, \n     led by Garo Keheyan. And as a graduate of Harvard University, \n     I'm pleased also to serve on the Executive Council of the \n     Cyprus International Initiative for the Environment and \n     Public Health--Harvard School of Public Health. And as I'm \n     recalling connections, I'm glad again to see a respected \n     Cypriot businessman, George Paraskevaides, and his wife, \n     Thelma.\n       Tonight I recall that it was nearly ten years ago in June \n     of 1998, that I had the privilege of visiting the University \n     of Cyprus and being received by its distinguished Rector, \n     Professor Dr. Miltiades Chacholiades, and of addressing \n     members of the Cyprus Chamber of Commerce & Industry and \n     Cyprus American Business Association.\n       Of course, particularly meaningful, all the more so in \n     light of the decoration Paul Sarbanes and I are today \n     receiving, is the trip Paul and I made in August 1977 when we \n     came here for the funeral of the great leader of the Cypriot \n     people, His Eminence, Archbishop Makarios.\n       The connection, however, with Cyprus of which some of you \n     may be most aware is the one of which I shall say a few words \n     now.\n       In 1967, when a group of Greek colonels overthrew young \n     King Constantine of Greece, I, the only Greek-American in \n     Congress, sharply attacked the coup. I refused to visit \n     Greece or go to the Greek Embassy in Washington and I \n     publicly opposed U.S. military aid to Greece, arguing that as \n     Greece was a member of NATO, which championed freedom, \n     democracy and the rule of law, none of which values the Greek \n     military junta supported, the United States should not be \n     sending them arms.\n\n\n                       TURKISH INVASION OF CYPRUS\n\n       In July 1974, the junta attempted to overthrow Archbishop \n     Makarios, President of Cyprus, an action that brought the \n     downfall of the colonels but also triggered two invasions of \n     Cyprus by Turkish armed forces, forces equipped with weapons \n     supplied by the United States, a legal ``No-No''.\n       So I led a group of several Members of the House of \n     Representatives, including then Representative Sarbanes, to \n     call on the Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, and we told \n     him that as American law mandated an immediate halt to \n     further shipment of arms to any country using American \n     weapons for other than defensive purposes, he should enforce \n     the law and impose an embargo on further U.S. arms to Turkey.\n       As this was the same week that Richard Nixon resigned the \n     presidency, I reminded Secretary Kissinger that the reason \n     Mr. Nixon was on his way in exile to California was that he \n     had not respected the laws of the land or the Constitution of \n     the United States.\n       ``You should do so,'' I told Kissinger.\n       He and the new President, Gerald R. Ford, refused to \n     enforce the law, and, therefore, we in Congress did.\n       I remind you that the United States has a separation-of-\n     powers constitutional system, not a parliamentary system! So \n     in 1974, Congress voted an embargo on sending further \n     American weapons to Turkey. As I have from time to time heard \n     criticisms, in respect of the role of ``the Greek lobby'' in \n     Congress, I observe that when we voted the embargo on further \n     U.S. arms to Turkey, there were only five of us of Greek \n     origin in Congress, all in the House of Representatives: John \n     Brademas, Paul Sarbanes, Peter Kyros, Gus Yatron--all \n     Democrats, all of whom supported the embargo--and one \n     Republican, Skip Bafalis, who voted against it. There were at \n     that time no Americans of Greek descent in the Senate.\n       Accordingly, this so-called ``Greek lobby'' was effective \n     because of the validity of our arguments and, if I may say \n     so, of our work to generate support for our position not only \n     among Greek-Americans across the country but among other \n     Americans who shared our views.\n\n\n                       ``THE RULE OF LAW LOBBY''\n\n       We were ``The Rule of Law Lobby''!\n       I shall not here take time to review with you my subsequent \n     experience when President Jimmy Carter, to my distress, as I \n     generally supported his Administration, called on Congress to \n     support lifting the embargo on Turkey despite the fact that \n     there had been no action to resolve the Cyprus question.\n       Here I must pay tribute to my friend of many years, Costa \n     Carras, founder in London of ``Friends of Cyprus'' who has \n     continued to call attention to the issue that concerns us \n     all--justice for Cyprus. In my view, finding a just \n     resolution for Cyprus is an indispensable requirement as the \n     European Union considers the application for membership of \n     Turkey even as I believe there are other commitments Turkey \n     must make if it wishes to join the EU.\n       First, of course, is that Turkey comply with the so-called \n     Copenhagen criteria, which include respect for minorities, \n     respect for human rights, respect for decent treatment of \n     peoples.\n       Certainly it is not rational that a European Union member-\n     state militarily occupy another EU member-state, and Cyprus \n     is now a member of the European Union.\n       As today there are over 40,000 Turkish armed forces in \n     Cyprus, their continued presence, if Turkey were in the \n     European Union, would be an offense to common sense.\n       I add that there are an estimated 160,000 Turkish settlers \n     in northern Cyprus while there are only 100,000 Turkish \n     Cypriots!\n       A second point: It is also unreasonable for one member of \n     the European Union to refuse to give diplomatic recognition \n     to the existence of another member, and as we all know, \n     Turkey has refused to recognize the Republic of Cyprus.\n       So these then are two of the conditions--removal of Turkish \n     troops and diplomatic recognition of Cyprus--that it seems to \n     me must be met by the Government of Turkey as it seeks to \n     join the European Union and take advantage of the benefits of \n     such membership.\n       If a just settlement on Cyprus is one issue related to \n     Turkey's desire to join the European Union, there is another \n     of which I shall say a word.\n\n\n                   ATTACKS ON ECUMENICAL PATRIARCHATE\n\n       Three years ago, His Eminence, Archbishop Demetrios, \n     Primate of the Greek Orthodox Church in America, testified on \n     Capitol Hill before the United States Helsinki Commission. \n     His Eminence and religious leaders of other traditions voiced \n     their concern about the systematic efforts on the part of \n     Turkey to undermine the Orthodox Church and the Ecumenical \n     Patriarchate.\n       I cite, by way of example, the expropriation by Turkish \n     authorities of properties of Christian Orthodox communities, \n     the refusal by the Turkish Government to accord recognition \n     as a legal entity to the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the \n     shutdown of the Halki School of Theology and other attacks on \n     religious minorities--Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, \n     Roman Catholics, Jews.\n       For an impressive analysis of Turkish persecution of \n     religious minorities, I refer you to the report issued only \n     in May of this year by the United States Commission on \n     International Religious Freedom.\n       And I could add the powerful statement on religious freedom \n     made by Congressman Tom Lantos of California, chairman of the \n     Committee on Foreign Affairs of the United States House of \n     Representatives, also last May. Chairman Lantos sent a letter \n     to Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan urging him to take several \n     steps to liberalize Turkey's policies toward the Ecumenical \n     Patriarchate, once and for all.\n       Forty-two of Chairman Lantos' Committee colleagues, \n     Democrats and Republicans, signed the letter urging the \n     Turkish Government to stop trying to bully the Ecumenical \n     Patriarchate into extinction.\n       You here better than I can speak of the desecration of \n     Greek Orthodox churches in Turkish-occupied Cyprus.\n       Let me conclude. As one who in the year 2001, in an address \n     at the Bosphorous University in Turkey, said that I wanted to \n     see a democratic Turkey, Turkey part of Europe and Turkey in \n     the European Union, provided that country comply with the \n     Copenhagen criteria, including respect for human rights, I \n     must tell you that in 1974, when Paul Sarbanes, our \n     colleagues and I in Congress voted an embargo on further \n     American arms to Turkey, we made clear that for us this \n     decision was a matter of respecting the rule of law--a point \n     I have made earlier.\n       Paul Sarbanes and I, to repeat, were leaders of ``The Rule \n     of Law Lobby''!\n       Paul Sarbanes and I and many of our former colleagues in \n     Congress--and I regret that I cannot include the present \n     President of the United States in this regard--will continue \n     to call on respect for the laws of our own country even as we \n     will continue to urge justice for the brave people of Cyprus.\n       President Papadopoulos, thank you again for the great honor \n     that you do Senator Sarbanes and me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10139-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10139-S10140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LANDMINES IN COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the people of Colombia have endured decades \nof civil conflict characterized by widespread killings and \ndisappearances of civilians perpetrated by rebel groups and \nparamilitary death squads, sometimes with the active participation of \ngovernment security forces. In recent\n\n[[Page S10140]]\n\nyears, both rebels and paramilitaries have financed their illegal \nactivities through the sale of cocaine, which has also corrupted \ngovernment institutions.\n  Each year since the inception of Plan Colombia, the United States has \nprovided Colombia with more than half a billion dollars in mostly \nmilitary and counter-drug assistance, totaling more than $5 billion.\n  The primary goal of Plan Colombia, at least as sold to the Congress, \nwas to decrease by half the amount of coca produced, resulting in \ncommensurate reductions in the income derived from cocaine to the \nrebels and paramilitaries and the amount of cocaine entering the United \nStates.\n  While there is no reliable evidence that Plan Colombia has affected \neither the price or availability of cocaine in the United States, the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy reports that profits from \nillegal drugs to the FARC rebels declined by about one-third between \n2003 and 2005. This is welcome news. But whether this trend has \ncontinued since then or has ebbed and flowed like most other statistics \nrelating to drug cultivation and trafficking in Colombia, is unknown. \nUnfortunately, it is also not yet apparent that this reported reduction \nin profits has affected the FARC's ability to operate.\n  While the majority of killings of civilians during the 7 years of \nPlan Colombia are attributed to paramilitaries, sometimes with the \nactive or tacit support of government forces, the FARC has engaged in \nmany atrocities, including attacks against civilian targets and \nkidnapping. But perhaps the most insidious of their crimes is the \nwidespread use of landmines.\n  According to a report released yesterday by Human Rights Watch, \ncasualties from landmines used by the FARC, as well as by another rebel \ngroup known as the ELN, have risen steadily in recent years. As is so \noften the case with landmines which are triggered indiscriminately by \nthe victim, most of the casualties in Colombia have been civilians.\n  While the number of casualties did not exceed 148 a year in the \n1990s, Human Rights Watch reports that last year the number was 1,107. \nThis increase contrasts sharply with the worldwide decline in the use \nof these insidious weapons. In fact, Colombia is among the more than \n150 nations that have signed or ratified the international treaty \nbanning antipersonnel mines.\n  According to press reports, the FARC defends its use of mines by \nclaiming that they are used only against government security forces, \nnot civilians. That, however, is a specious claim, since mines are \ninherently indiscriminate. They will kill or maim whoever comes into \ncontact with them, often months or years after they are laid. I have \nseen photographs of the horrific injuries suffered by both government \nsoldiers and innocent civilians from rebel mines.\n  While the FARC, like others who continue to use landmines, would \nundoubtedly claim that their military utility justifies their continued \nuse, I reject that argument. The harm to civilians and the \ncontamination of the countryside caused by mines cannot be justified.\n  While there are programs to assist Colombia's mine victims with \nrehabilitation and vocational training, they are far from adequate. I \nhave supported efforts to increase U.S. assistance. We are looking at \nways to use the Leahy War Victims Fund to assist Colombian civilians \nwho have been injured by mines, and we are supporting United for \nColombia's efforts to obtain surgery in the U.S. for Colombian soldiers \nwho have suffered grievous mine injuries.\n  I have been a consistent critic of human rights violations in \nColombia where impunity remains a persistent problem. There have been \nthousands of killings of civilians, including of human rights \ndefenders, union members, journalists, and others who have been \ntargeted by one armed group or another. Hardly any of these crimes have \nresulted in convictions and punishment. But none of that excuses the \ncontinued use of landmines by the FARC and ELN. As I have said many \ntimes before, the use of landmines should be a war crime. It is \nbarbaric; it is inhumane; it is indefensible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10140-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION AGAINST IMPUNITY IN GUATEMALA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, I spoke in this Chamber about \nthe current debate underway in Guatemala concerning the International \nCommission Against Impunity in Guatemala, CICIG. In my brief remarks I \nrecalled the 30 years of civil war that caused widespread atrocities \nagainst civilians, particularly Guatemala's Mayan population. A \nsubstantial majority of those killings and disappearances were \nperpetrated by Guatemalan security forces.\n  Since the signing of the Peace Accords in 1996, most Guatemalans have \ntried to put the past behind them and rebuild their country. The United \nStates and other donors have supported that effort.\n  But key aspects of the Peace Accords remain unfulfilled, and there \nhas been no justice for the families of the war's many victims. \nMeanwhile, gang violence, drug trafficking, brutal killings of women, \nand attacks against human rights defenders and others who speak out \nagainst corruption and impunity have increased exponentially and \nthreaten the very foundations of Guatemala's fragile democracy.\n  In recent years, the Guatemalan Government has worked with officials \nof the United Nations to draft the CICIG agreement, the latest version \nof which has been upheld by Guatemala's constitutional court.\n  The CICIG is necessary to expose the truth about clandestine groups \nand to bring accountability for the violence. Far from weakening \nnational sovereignty, CICIG will support Guatemala by helping to \nstrengthen the capacity of the country's dysfunctional judicial system.\n  On July 18, a majority of members of the International Relations \nCommittee of the Guatemalan Congress, for reasons that only they can \nexplain, voted against the CICIG agreement. Since then, several have \nchanged their votes and I understand that on August 1 the full Congress \nwill approve or reject the CICIG agreement or refer it to another \ncommittee.\n  The question of whether to approve CICIG is, of course, a decision \nsolely for Guatemala's Congress to make. But the importance of this \nhistoric decision cannot be overstated for U.S.-Guatemalan relations \nand for Guatemala's future.\n  Guatemala, like many impoverished countries emerging from years of \ncivil conflict, faces immense social, economic and political \nchallenges. Without the support of countries like the United States in \nbuilding its economy, promoting foreign investment and trade, and \nstrengthening the institutions of democracy, Guatemala will lag behind \nits neighbors.\n  Today, that support hangs in the balance.\n  The Bush administration has voiced strong support for CICIG. The U.S. \nCongress has linked a resumption of U.S. assistance for the Guatemalan \nArmed Forces, in part, on approval of CICIG. In addition, I would be \nreluctant to support assistance for Guatemala to take part in any \nregional security initiative with the United States, unless CICIG is \napproved and supported. There is little point in trying to work with a \ngovernment that fails to demonstrate a strong commitment to ending \nimpunity and to combating gang violence and corruption, which have \ninfiltrated the very institutions that would participate in such a \nstrategy.\n  CICIG is nothing less than a choice between the past and the future. \nRejecting this historic initiative an outcome most Americans would find \ninexplicable would signal that the Guatemalan Congress is more \ninterested in protecting the forces of evil, and in covering up the \ntruth, than in ending the lawlessness that is taking Guatemala \nbackwards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10140-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10140-S10141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS IN COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at a time when we are focused on the chaos \nin Iraq and the flood of Iraqis who have fled their homes and are \nliving either as displaced persons in Iraq or as refugees in Jordan, \nSyria and elsewhere, I want to call attention to a humanitarian crisis \nin our own hemisphere.\n  In Colombia, a country of roughly 44 million people, over 3 million \nhave\n\n[[Page S10141]]\n\nbeen internally displaced as a result of political and drug-related \nviolence and the aerial spraying of chemical herbicides to eradicate \ncoca. They are the second largest displaced population in the world \nafter Darfur, Sudan. An average of 18,000 Colombians are uprooted every \nmonth, with more than 1 million forced to flee in the past 5 years \nalone, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n  To put that in perspective, if the same ratio were applied to the \nUnited States, a country of roughly 300 million people, there would be \nover 20 million internally displaced Americans. That is a staggering \nnumber when you consider the burden they would place on public services \nand the environment. Colombia by comparison is a relatively poor \ncountry, and many of these people, the majority of whom are women and \nchildren, lack access to basic health care, sanitation, education, \nadequate shelter, or employment.\n  It is my understanding that Colombia has suitable laws for addressing \nthe needs of the internally displaced, but the laws are too often \nignored or poorly implemented. Insecurity and inadequate public \nservices in isolated areas, where many of the displaced are located, \nhinder return to their homes and contribute to further displacement.\n  Recently, the House of Representatives passed a resolution calling on \nthe Colombian Government and the international community to prioritize \nthe needs of displaced persons, and recommending that the United States \nincrease funding for emergency and long-term assistance.\n  The Senate version of the fiscal year 2008 State-Foreign Operations \nbill provides $40 million for assistance for displaced persons in \nColombia. This is a $5 million increase above the President's budget \nrequest, which was woefully inadequate.

After \n36 years in law enforcement, Dave will hang up his uniform early next \nmonth and enter a well-earned retirement.\n  Dave comes from a family dedicated to police service--he is the \nfourth generation in his family to serve as a police officer. In fact, \nhis great-grandfather and namesake, Chief David Demag, was the first \nchief of police of the Village of Essex in the early 1900s. It seems to \nme that it is only fitting that Dave will finish his law enforcement \ncareer in Essex, where his roots grow deep.\n  I am proud to be able to call Dave not only an accomplished Vermonter \nbut also a good friend. We have known each other for years, having both \nstarted our careers in law enforcement in the city of Burlington. Dave \nbegan in 1971 as a patrol officer for the Burlington Police Department, \nand was promoted through the ranks as corporal, detective, sergeant, \nlieutenant and, finally, commander. In 1996, he was appointed chief of \npolice in St. Albans, a post he held until May 2001, when he was named \nto Chief of Police in Essex.\n  When he began his law enforcement career in the early 1970s, Dave \nworked undercover on drug cases. One of the cases we worked together \non--he as an undercover agent and me as the State's attorney for \nChittenden County--set up a successful sting to catch Paul Lawrence, a \ncorrupt cop who framed dozens of narcotics suspects. The Lawrence case \nremains the first item Dave cites as the most memorable moments of his \nprofessional life.\n  Known for his ability to earn and command respect from his employees \nand the public he serves, Chief Demag has led the Essex Police \nDepartment with a steady hand and a calm presence. He is credited with \nrevitalizing the Essex Police Department and changing the way it trains \nand promotes officers. As chief, he has emphasized continuing education \nfor members of the force and required promotions to be based on ability \nrather than length of service.\n  Dave's leadership was especially apparent last August when a gunman \nwent on a shooting spree at three sites across Essex, including an \nelementary school, leaving two dead and three wounded, including the \ngunman himself. Taking swift and deliberate action, Dave and his \nofficers ushered dozens of teachers and several children away from the \nchaos at Essex Elementary School and to safety as tactical-response \nofficers wearing body armor and carrying automatic weapons moved in and \nsurrounded the building.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I have been privileged to work with Chief Demag \nand have his vocal support on an array of initiatives--from bulletproof \nvests to first responder funding--that have helped make the lives and \nwork of Vermont's and our Nation's police officers a bit easier. But \nwhat stands out most in my mind is his unwavering support for the \nHometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act, which became law in 2003 and \nexpanded the Public Safety Officer Benefits, PSOB, Program by allowing \nsurvivors of public safety officers who suffer fatal heart attacks or \nstrokes while acting in the line of duty to qualify for the Federal \nsurvivor benefits. Dave understood how important it was for that bill \nto become law because his father, special Deputy Sheriff Bernard Demag \nof the Chittenden County Sheriff's Office, suffered a fatal heart \nattack within 2 hours of his chase and apprehension of an escaped \njuvenile whom he had been transporting. The Demag family spent nearly \ntwo decades fighting in court for workers' compensation death benefits \nto no avail. What Dave and his family went through left no doubt in my \nmind that we should be treating the surviving families of officers who \ndie in the line of duty with more decency and respect. Although Dave \nknew that his family would not receive survivor benefits under the PSOB \nlaw, he did not want other survivors of public safety officers to \nendure what his family suffered. It was a great day when I told Dave \nthat the Hometown Heroes Act had finally been signed into law.\n  In 2001, Chief Demag was appointed on my recommendation to serve on \nthe 11-member U.S. Medal of Valor Review Board, which selects and \nrecommends to the President public safety officers to receive the \nPublic Safety Officer Medal of Valor. The Medal of Valor is the highest \nnational award for valor by a public safety officer and is designed to \nrecognize the extraordinary heroism of our police, firefighters and \ncorrectional officers. As a board member, Dave has worked faithfully to \naward the medal to his public safety officers who demonstrate \nextraordinary valor above and beyond the call of duty.\n  I wish Dave and his wife Donna nothing but the best as they head into \nthe next phase of their life together. I will say, however, that \nwhoever Essex appoints as its next police chief will have the biggest \nof shoes to fill, as Dave Demag is the best kind of leader a community \ncan hope for and he will be missed. Thank you, Dave, and \ncongratulations for your service and commitment to the people of Essex \nand all Vermonters.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10141-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10141-S10142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            IRAN DIVESTMENT\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate an important article that appeared in today's Baltimore Sun. \nIt describes the progress States are making in passing laws that divest \ntheir pension funds of companies that invest heavily in Iran's oil and \ngas industry. As highlighted in the article, Florida enacted a \nsignificant law along these lines, and other States, including my State \nof Illinois, are on the verge of doing so.\n  The need for these laws is clear. Iran uses the revenue it generates \nfrom its energy sector to finance its pursuit of nuclear weapons and \nsupport for terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. Along with a \nsustained diplomatic effort and toughened multilateral sanctions on \nIran, divestment is a\n\n[[Page S10142]]\n\nuseful tool that State and local governments can use to increase \neconomic pressure to persuade Iran to end its dangerous policies.\n  But, as the article points out, past Supreme Court decisions have \ncalled into question whether States have the constitutional authority \nto pass such laws. For that reason, Congress needs to pass the Iran \nSanctions Enabling Act, S. 1430, which I introduced in May. This bill \nwould clarify that States have the authority to pass divestment \nlegislation with respect to Iran, and it would provide information from \nthe Federal Government to make it easier for them to do so. I am proud \nthat 14 of my colleagues have cosponsored this bill so far, but Iran's \nseemingly unbridled drive for nuclear weapons makes this a matter of \nconsiderable urgency. I urge the rest of my colleagues to join us in \nworking to pass this legislation without delay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article in today's Baltimore Sun be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From baltimoresun.com, July 26, 2007]\n\n                      Let States Divest From Iran\n\n                (By Jonathan Schanzer and Howard Slugh)\n\n       Last month, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist signed a bill \n     ordering his state to divest its pension fund from businesses \n     that work with Iran's energy sector. The legislation, led by \n     Adam Hasner, Republican majority leader of Florida's House of \n     Representatives, passed unanimously in both chambers of the \n     Legislature.\n       Unfortunately, the state legislation is unconstitutional. \n     Only new federal legislation can legally allow states to \n     divest from Iran.\n       In 1996, Massachusetts restricted state businesses from \n     working with companies that dealt with Myanmar, formerly \n     called Burma. Massachusetts sought to press Myanmar's \n     military junta to take steps toward democracy and provide \n     better treatment for dissidents. In 2000, the Supreme Court \n     unanimously struck down the Massachusetts law in Crosby v. \n     National Foreign Trade Council.\n       The problem was that the state legislation conflicted with \n     a federal statute that enabled the president to impose \n     sanctions on Myanmar. The court argued that the president \n     ``has less to offer and less economic and diplomatic leverage \n     as a consequence'' of the Massachusetts law. According to the \n     Constitution's supremacy clause, federal sanctions must trump \n     state law.\n       Florida's sanctions against Iran could face a similar fate. \n     Under federal law, only Congress and the president can \n     implement federal tools--such as the Iran Freedom Support \n     Act--to deter Iran from nuclear proliferation and terrorism. \n     As in the Myanmar case, the Florida divestment plan conflicts \n     with federal sanctions.\n       Florida has attempted to distinguish its statute from \n     Massachusetts' by adding wording claiming that the law aims \n     to lower fiduciary risk, not create an alternate foreign \n     policy. But just because a state claims its law doesn't \n     conflict with federal law doesn't make it so. The Florida law \n     could be struck down if challenged--unless Congress does the \n     right thing.\n       The House and Senate are considering the Iran Sanctions \n     Enabling Act to authorize states to pass divestment laws \n     aimed at Iran's energy sector. The bill would cure any \n     constitutional conflict. It would integrate the state \n     sanctions as an element of congressional sanctions, rather \n     than leaving them outside the congressional framework.\n       Broad bipartisan support of this bill is a sign that \n     Congress sees sanctions--on both the state and federal levels \n     as an important tool to weaken Iran. It also shows that \n     Congress understands that divestment is a tool that Americans \n     broadly support. Indeed, the growing ``terror-free \n     investing'' movement is gaining traction nationwide. It \n     echoes grass-roots efforts to divest from South Africa in the \n     1980s, which eventually brought the apartheid regime to its \n     knees.\n       Despite the bill's wide popularity, some in Washington \n     oppose it. William Reinsch, former commerce undersecretary in \n     the Clinton administration and current president of the \n     National Foreign Trade Council, claims that ``a unified U.S. \n     foreign policy--not multiple state sanctions or divestment \n     laws--is best suited to address'' the Iran challenge. Those \n     who join Mr. Reinsch in opposing the bill claim that \n     divestment would create economic tensions with our allies, \n     making it more difficult to act multilaterally.\n       Opponents of the bill fail to understand that the lack of \n     enforcement of federal sanctions in the past is exactly why \n     the American people have taken matters into their own hands. \n     They have lobbied their state legislatures because they want \n     to punish Iran. They do not care whether their states offend \n     our allies who continue to do business with Iran.\n       A handful of states are considering their own divestment \n     bills, including Maryland, where Del. Ron George, an Anne \n     Arundel County Republican, has proposed legislation that \n     would bar the state pension fund from investing in companies \n     tied to Iran. Other states are weighing different divestment \n     options. In Ohio, state Rep. Josh Mandel reports that he and \n     his colleagues led an effort for ``state pension funds to \n     divest the retirement dollars of policemen, firefighters and \n     teachers from an Iranian regime that is calling for the \n     destruction of America and Israel.''\n       The House and Senate have deliberated over the Iran \n     Sanctions Enabling Act since May. It is imperative that \n     Congress pass the bill quickly, to ensure that these state \n     efforts are constitutional.\n       This is an effective way to push Iran to cease developing \n     nuclear weapons and to encumber its efforts to support \n     terrorism.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10142-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10142-S10143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COMMON ARTICLE 3\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, like much of the Senate, I was taken \naback to hear what the Attorney General had to say--and what he refused \nto say--before the Judiciary Committee this week. It is the latest in \nan effort to obfuscate and avoid accountability on issues of vital \nimportance to this country's well being.\n  I fear the same was true on Friday, when the President signed an \nExecutive order on Geneva Conventions Common Article 3 as Applied to a \nProgram of Detention and Interrogation.\n  A year and a half ago, the Congress overwhelmingly adopted the McCain \namendment to ensure that no prisoner in our Nation's custody is ever \nsubjected to torture or cruel treatment. Since then, all agencies of \nour Government have been abiding by the humane and professional \nstandards in the U.S. Army's Field Manual on interrogation, and \ngetting, by the administration's own account, excellent intelligence in \nthe war on terror.\n  I am deeply concerned that President Bush may now be trying to reopen \nthe door to cruelty that Congress shut. While the Executive order \nappears to rule out unlawful treatment, the administration has said \nthat the order allows the CIA to resume at least some elements of its \n``enhanced interrogation'' program, and to use methods beyond those \nthat our military employs. The administration still refuses to rule out \ntorture techniques such as water boarding.\n  As our own military leadership repeatedly warns, if we say we can \nlawfully use an interrogation technique on enemy prisoners, what is \nthere to prevent our enemies from employing the same interrogation \ntechnique on captured American military personnel? On Sunday, Director \nof National Intelligence Admiral McConnell acknowledged that the CIA \ncan now use techniques to which he would not want to see American \ncitizens subjected.\n  A policy that permits cruel and inhumane treatment at the hands of \nany U.S. Government personnel--whether referred to as ``enhanced \ninterrogation'' techniques or any other name--is simply \ncounterproductive to an effective war against terrorists. As General \nPetraeus put it in his recent directive to those under his command in \nIraq:\n\n       Some may argue that we would be more effective if we \n     sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain \n     information from the enemy. They would be wrong. Beyond the \n     basic fact that such actions are illegal, history shows that \n     they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary.\n\n  These words are no less applicable to practices of the CIA.\n  Beyond the fact that they are neither useful nor necessary, torture \nand cruel and inhumane treatment of those in U.S. custody diminish the \nmoral authority our country needs to wage an effective war against \nterrorists, and are simply used by al-Qaida as a recruitment tool to \nenlist more enemies faster than we can take them off the battlefield.\n  Every agency of our Government should be held to the same \ninterrogation standards that our military lives and swears by. No one \nshould be subject to treatment that would outrage us if inflicted on an \nAmerican. Whenever America has been threatened in the past, there has \nbeen a divide in our country between those who believe that our \nliberties and laws make us weaker, and those who believe they make us \nstronger. I believe that our commitment to the rule of law is our \ngreatest strength. We will win this war as we have won every great \nconflict in our history--by staying true to who we are and to the \nvalues that distinguish us from our enemies.\n\n[[Page S10143]]\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10143-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IMPROVING EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE AND RESPONSE ACT\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today I wish to discuss the \nImproving Emergency Medical Care and Response Act of 2007, which I \nintroduced yesterday. I am joined in this effort by Representative \nHenry Waxman, who introduced a companion bill in the House.\n  This bill focuses on improving communication systems used in \nemergency care response and provides financial support for research in \nemergency medicine. Disasters that strike our Nation, be it manmade or \nnatural, can have catastrophic effects on the health and well-being of \nour citizens. The ability to provide adequate, timely health care \nfollowing these ``sudden-impact'' events--or any emergency situation, \nfor that matter--relies heavily on an effective and comprehensive \nemergency communication system. However, recent studies show that \nvarious emergency medical services throughout the country are \nstruggling to efficiently handle just the day-to-day operations. \nTherefore, the concern is even greater when disaster does strike and \nthe struggle becomes grossly amplified, ultimately exposing the gaps in \nour emergency care and response infrastructure. There was no clearer \nexample of this than the flawed response to the devastating effects of \nHurricane Katrina in 2005.\n  Patients waiting in the emergency department, ED, for extended \nperiods of time or, potentially worse, patients leaving the ED before \nmedical evaluation because of these long wait-times are both strong \nindicators that improved strategies and systems are needed to reduce \nthe burden on our emergency medical services across the country. \nExtended offloading times and diversion of ambulances are also \ncontributing factors to a slow emergency response, which can have a \nfatal impact on prehospital care. Unfortunately, we do not have to look \nfar to see what tragedies will come from not addressing these issues. \nIn fact, just months ago, tragedy struck Edith Isabel Rodriguez, a Los \nAngeles woman who made national headlines after she was ignored by \nhospital personnel, dismissed by 9-1-1 dispatchers, and denied \nimmediate care despite vomiting blood and writhing in pain for 45 \nminutes until she died. How does this happen in a country that boasts \none of the highest standards of living of any nation in the world? Ms. \nRodriguez's death is unacceptable and is a harrowing reminder of the \nultimate penalty our citizens are paying for a fractured emergency care \nsystem.\n  For these reasons, my bill establishes demonstration programs \ndesigned to coordinate emergency medical services, expand communication \nand patient-tracking systems, and implement a regionalized data \nmanagement system. The types of information garnered from such \ndemonstration programs will contain vital information such as the \nimpact of emergency care systems on patient outcomes, program \nefficiency, financial impact, and identification of remaining barriers \nto developing regionalized, accountable emergency care systems. Of \nequal importance is the bill's support for research in the field of \nemergency medicine and emergency medical care systems. Specifically, \nfunds are requested to support research in the basic science of \nemergency medicine, model of service delivery, and incorporation of \nbasic scientific research into day-to-day practice.\n  Improving and identifying the best practices of emergency medical \ncare is necessary to ensure high-quality, efficient, and reliable care \nfor all who need it. I ask my fellow colleagues to support this \nlegislation so that we can better prepare for emergencies and future \ndisasters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10143-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10143-S10144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BOSTON CELTICS ``HEROES AMONG US'' AWARDS 2007\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, today we celebrate the enactment of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, one of the great civil rights laws in \nthe Nation's history. Seventeen years ago, Congress acted on the \nfundamental principle that people should be measured by what they can \ndo, not what they can't do. The Americans with Disabilities Act began a \nnew era of opportunity for millions of disabled citizens who had been \ndenied full and fair participation in society.\n  For generations, people with disabilities were treated with pity and \nas persons who deserved charity, not opportunity. Out of ignorance, the \nNation accepted discrimination for decades and yielded to fear and \nprejudice. The passage of the ADA finally ended these condescending and \nsuffocating attitudes and widened the doors of opportunity for all \npeople with disabilities.\n  The anniversary of this landmark legislation is a time to reflect on \nhow far we have come in improving the ``real life'' possibilities for \nthe Nation's 56 million people with disabilities. In fact, the seeds of \naction were planted long before 1990.\n  In 1932, the United States elected a disabled person to the highest \noffice in the land, and he became one of the greatest Presidents in our \nhistory. But even Franklin Roosevelt felt compelled by the prejudice of \nhis times to hide his disability as much as possible. The World War II \ngeneration began to change all that.\n  The 1940s and the 1950s introduced the Nation to a new class of \nAmericans with disabilities--wounded and disabled veterans returning \nfrom war and finding a society grateful for their courage and sacrifice \nbut relegating them to the sideline of the American dream. Even before \nthe war ended, however, rehabilitation medicine had been born. \nDisability advocacy organizations began to grow. Disability benefits \nwere added to Social Security. Each decade since then has brought \nsignificant new progress and more change.\n  In the 1960s, Congress responded with new architectural standards, so \nwe could have a society everyone could be a part of. No one would have \nto wait outside a new building because they were disabled.\n  The 1970s convinced us that greater opportunities for fuller \nparticipation in society were possible for the disabled. Congress \nresponded with a range of steps to improve the lives of people with \nmental disabilities as well. We supported the right of children with \ndisabilities to attend public schools. We guaranteed the right of \npeople with disabilities to vote in elections, and we insisted on \ngreater access to cultural and recreational programs in their \ncommunities.\n  The 1980s brought a new realization, however, that in helping people \nwith disabilities, we can't rely only on Government programs. We began \nto involve the private sector as well. We guaranteed fair housing \nopportunities for people with disabilities, required fair access to air \ntravel, and made advances in technology available for people hard of \nhearing or deaf.\n  The crowning achievement of these decades of progress was passage of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and its promise of a new \nand better life for every disabled citizen in which their disabilities \nwould no longer put an end to their dreams.\n  As one eloquent citizen with a disability said, ``I do not wish to be \na kept citizen, humbled and dulled by having the state look after me. I \nwant to take the calculated risk, to dream and to build, to fail and to \nsucceed. I want to enjoy the benefits of my creations and face the \nworld boldly, and say, this is what I have done.''\n  Our families, our neighbors, and our friends with disabilities have \ntaught us in ways no books can teach. The inclusion of people with \ndisabilities enriches all our lives. Every day, my son Teddy, who lost \nhis leg at the age of 12, continues to teach me every day the greatest \nlesson of all--that disabled does not mean unable.\n  As the saying goes, when people are excluded from the social fabric \nof a community, it creates a hole--and when there is a hole, the entire \nfabric is weaker. It lacks the strength that diversity brings. The \nfabric of our Nation is stronger today than it was 17 years ago because \npeople with disabilities are no longer left out and left behind, and \nbecause of that, America is a greater and better and fairer Nation.\n  Today, in this country, we see the many signs of the progress that \nmean so much in our ongoing efforts to include persons with \ndisabilities in every aspect of life--the ramps beside the steps, the \nsidewalks with curb-cuts to accommodate wheelchairs, the lifts for \nhelping disabled people to take a bus to work or the store or a movie.\n  Disabled students are no longer barred from schools and denied \neducation. They are learning and achieving at levels once thought \nimpossible. They are graduating from high schools, enrolling in \nuniversities, joining the workforce, achieving their goals, enriching \ntheir communities and their country. They have greater access than ever \nto the rehabilitation and training needed to be successfully employed \nand become productive, contributing members of their communities.\n  With the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act in 1999, \nwe finally linked civil rights much more closely to health care. It \nisn't civil and it isn't right to send a disabled person to work \nwithout the health care they need and deserve.\n  These milestones show that we are continuing the way to fulfilling \nthe\n\n[[Page S10145]]\n\npromise of a new, better, and more inclusive life for citizens with \ndisabilities--but we still have a way to go. Today, as we rightly look \nback with pride, we also need to look ahead with hope and dedication.\n  We still face many challenges, especially in areas such as health \ncare and in home-based and community-based services and support. Many \npersons with disabilities still do not have the services and support \nthey need to make choices about how best to live their lives. Many are \nunwillingly confined to institutions or unable to have a financial plan \nfor their future.\n  A strong Medicare prescription drug benefit is essential for all \npeople with disabilities. Today, about one in six Medicare \nbeneficiaries--over 6 million people--is a person with disabilities \nunder aged 65. Over the next 10 years that number is expected to \nincrease to 8 million. These persons are much less likely to be able to \nobtain or afford private insurance coverage. Many of them are forced to \nchoose between buying groceries, paying their mortgage, or paying for \ntheir medication.\n\n  Families raising children with significant disabilities deserve \nhealth care for their children. No family should be forced to go \nbankrupt, live in poverty, or give up custody of their disabled child \nin order to get needed health care for disabled child. They deserve the \nright to buy-in to Medicaid so that their family can stay together and \nstay employed. Congress did its job, and now every State should do its \npart under the Family Opportunity Act, adopted in 2005.\n  People with disabilities and older Americans need community-based \nassistance as well, so they can live at home with their families and in \ntheir communities. We need to pass the CLASS Act to ensure this support \nis available, without forcing families into poverty. It is a challenge \nfor the Nation, and we need to work together to meet it.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act was an extraordinary milestone in \nthe pursuit of the American dream. Many disability and civil rights \nleaders in communities throughout the country worked long and hard and \nwell to achieve it.\n  To each disabled American, I say thank you. It is all of you who are \nthe true heroes of this achievement and who will lead us in the fight \nto keep the ADA strong in the years ahead.\n  Sadly, the Supreme Court has not been on our side. In the past 17 \nyears, it has restricted the intended scope of the ADA. Suppose you are \na person with epilepsy in a job you love and you get excellent \npersonnel reviews. You are taking medicine that controls the seizures \nand you have no symptoms. But your employer finds out you have epilepsy \nand fires you. Should you be able to sue your employer for \ndiscrimination? Suppose you are a person with Down's syndrome, doing a \nfantastic job at the local Wal-Mart, but the manager really doesn't \nwant someone with Down's syndrome greeting the public. Should you be \nable to sue for discrimination or are you no longer even covered under \nthe ADA? Congress intended full protection from discrimination--but the \ncourts are ruling differently. It is time now to restore the intent of \nthe ADA.\n  The Supreme Court continues to carve out exception after exception in \nthe ADA. But discrimination is discrimination, and no attempt to blur \nthat line or write exceptions into the law should be tolerated. \nCongress wouldn't do it, and it is wrong for the Supreme Court to do \nit.\n  The ADA was a spectacular example of bipartisan cooperation and \nsuccess. Passed by overwhelming majorities in both the House and the \nSenate, Republicans and Democrats alike took rightful pride in the \ngoals of the law and its many accomplishments.\n  I know that the first President Bush, Senator Bob Dole, Senator \nHarkin, and many other Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle \nconsider their work on the ADA to be among their finest accomplishments \nin public service. It is widely regarded today as one of the giant \nsteps in our ongoing two-centuries-old civil rights revolution.\n  The need for that kind of bipartisan cooperation is especially \ncritical today as Congress embarks on restoring the ADA to its original \nintent, so that the rights of those with disabilities are protected, \nnot violated.\n  Today, more than ever, disability need no longer mean the end of the \nAmerican dream. Our goal is to banish stereotypes and discrimination, \nso that every disabled person can realize the dream of working and \nliving independently and becoming a productive and contributing member \nof our community.\n  That goal should be the birthright of every American and the ADA \nopened the door for every disabled American to achieve it.\n  A story from the debate on the ADA eloquently made the point. A \npostmaster in a town was told to make his post office accessible. The \nbuilding had 20 steep steps leading up to a revolving door at the only \nentrance. The postmaster questioned the need to make such costly \nrepairs. He said, ``I've been here for thirty-five years, and in all \nthat time, I've yet to see a single customer come in here in a \nwheelchair.'' As the Americans with Disabilities Act has proved so \nwell, if you build the ramp, they will come, and they will find their \nfield of dreams.\n  So let's ramp up our own efforts across the country. We need to keep \nbuilding those ramps, no matter how many steps stand in the way. We \nwill not stop today or tomorrow or next month or next year. We will not \never stop until America works for all Americans.\n  I ask all of us in Congress join today in committing to keep the ADA \nstrong. It is an act of conscience, an act of community, and above all, \nan act of continued hope for a better future for our country as a \nwhole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10145-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10145-S10146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        COMMENDING SEAN SWARNER\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I wish to commend an \nextraordinary man from Colorado who just became the only two-time \ncancer survivor to reach the peaks of the world's highest tallest \nmountains on every continent.\n  At the age of 13, Sean Swarner was diagnosed with stage IV Hodgkin's \ndisease and was told he only had a few months to live. Sean battled \nback, but only 2 years later he was forced to face the possibility of \ndeath again. He was diagnosed with Askin's sarcoma, had a golf-ball \nsized tumor removed from his lung, and given only 10 days to live. Sean \nunderwent intense chemotherapy and radiation, often slipping into comas \nfrom the abrasive treatments. The intensity of the radiation damaged \none of his lungs to the point where it was no longer fully functional. \nSean endured more in those few years than most of us experience in a \nlifetime, but he survived and eventually thrived.\n  The cancers had been unrelated and doctors told Sean how lucky he was \nto survive, and that the odds of him surviving both cancers are similar \nto winning the lottery four times in a row with the same numbers. I \ndon't believe luck had anything to do with Sean's survival. It was his \nabsolute strength and fortitude that allowed him to fight the cancers. \nSean beat the cancers and is now the only two-time cancer survivor to \nreach the summits of the highest mountains on all seven continents.\n  Sean began his trek in 2002 when he conquered Mount Everest. Since \nthen, he has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Elbrus, Mount Aconcagua, \nMount Vinson Massif, Mount Kosciusko, and on June 16, 2007 he climbed \nAlaska's Mount Denali, the seventh and final mountain in his quest to \nreach the highest summits on each continent. Conquering all seven peaks \nis an incredible accomplishment for anyone, but for someone in Sean's \ncondition it is nothing short of amazing. The determination, \nperseverance, and courage that Sean demonstrated stands as an example \nto all of us that anything is possible if you really want it to happen.\n  As amazing as these accomplishments are, Sean's story does not end \nwith his successful mountain climbs and victory over two cancers. Sean \nis only 32 years old and has a lifetime ahead of him. He plans to climb \nthe Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia and the North and South Poles. Once \nhe reaches the Poles, Sean will become one of less than a dozen people \nto complete the ``Adventure Grand Slam'' and the first cancer survivor \nto do so. When he isn't climbing mountains, Sean uses his experience \nwith cancer and stories\n\n[[Page S10146]]\n\nfrom his expeditions to spread hope and inspiration. He makes regular \nvisits to cancer wards and provides strength and courage for those who \ncontinue to suffer from and battle cancer. Sean has also begun a \nmotivation speaking tour by visiting wounded troops and veterans all \nover the country and is currently making arrangements to speak in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  Sean's story is truly inspirational, not only to those struggling to \nbeat cancer, but to anyone who seeks to accomplish something that \nothers say is impossible. I would like to commend Sean for his success \nand thank him for serving as such a positive role model to anyone who \nhas faced long odds. Sean has proven the power of \ndetermination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10146-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING DR.

As Administrator for the last 3 years, he has ably \ncarried out the agency's mission of protecting american agriculture.\n  As a strong leader of APHIS' domestic safeguarding efforts, Dr. \nDeHaven has been the public face of USDA's effective, science-based \nresponse to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, in the United \nStates. He has brought strong leadership skills to increasing U.S. \npreparedness to deal with avian influenza viruses in our poultry \nindustry and ensuring that APHIS maintains robust emergency response \nand antismuggling programs designed to prevent the establishment of \nexotic pests and diseases of agriculture in our country.\n  Dr. DeHaven serves as one of USDA's principal liaisons to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. He has worked closely with his \ncolleagues there on a number of fronts, including agricultural \ncommodity inspections at our Nation's ports of entry and the joint work \nof USDA and DHS officials at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center off \nLong Island, NY. The work of the researchers and diagnosticians at the \nCenter ensures our nation is prepared in the event of a detection of a \nhighly contagious foreign animal disease, such as foot-and-mouth \ndisease or classical swine fever.\n  The agency's role has been shaped on the international front under \nDr. DeHaven's direction. He has spearheaded efforts to stop the spread \nin poultry of the Asian strain of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian \ninfluenza. He has also advocated for improving international animal \ndisease response infrastructure, traveling extensively to create a \ncoalition of like-minded developed countries to work with the United \nNation's Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO, and the World \nOrganization for Animal Health. Dr. DeHaven helped push for \nimplementation of a Crisis Management Center at the FAO's headquarters \nin Rome, with the goal of coordinating global H5N1 response efforts. I \nbelieve that the U.S. poultry industry is better protected as a result \nof his efforts.\n  Dr. DeHaven's integrity, dedication, and professionalism have \nrepresented the United States proudly in all of these endeavors. He has \nconsistently championed U.S. agriculture in all of his international \nrelationships and activities.\n  We congratulate him on his retirement from the Federal Government, \nand thank him for his 28 years of service with APHIS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10146-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING DANIEL BALDINGER\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \na valued friend, Daniel Baldinger, who passed away on July 4, 2007. \nThroughout his life he displayed a special kindness and a deep \ncommitment to his friends and family. His spontaneous humor and wit \nmade for a personality to which people were quickly attracted. He was \nmultilingual, able to communicate in French, Italian, and Spanish among \nother languages as well. I enjoyed his company and looked forward to \nour times together. Dan, though creative and artistic, was also a \nskilled executive and presided over a family business started in 1955, \nwhich he quickly expanded into a booming business. The company, Louis \nBaldinger & Sons, became one of the leading companies in the lighting \nindustry. Under Dan's leadership, Louis Baldinger & Sons' products were \nobtained by some of the countries most prestigious architects and \ndesigners.\n  While Dan achieved substantial success in his business ventures; he \nwould be most proud of the breadth of friendships and loving \nrelationships he shared with his family. He was a devoted and loving \nhusband to his wife Marjorie of 48 years and together they enjoyed a \nwonderful family life. Dan was a proud father of his son Howard and \ndaughter Toby, about whom he constantly bragged.\n  Dan was a caring man with deep intellectual curiosity and myriad \ninterests. He was a person of various talents and abilities including \ncooking, which he did with flourish and gusto. At any given moment, one \ncould find him discussing--in one of the many languages he spoke--\nbaseball, his plans for the Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS, \nof which he was the national chairman, or his completion of the New \nYork Marathon in 4 hours and 28 minutes.\n  While Dan is no longer with us, his memory will carry on. He lived \nlife to the fullest and was a compassionate man who acted with \nintegrity and decency. Dan touched so many lives and all of those that \nhad the pleasure of knowing him will miss him greatly, including my \nwife Bonnie and me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10146-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10146-S10147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING DAVID A.

Waks, who championed integrity in public \n     service for almost 40 years, first as a councilman, then as \n     mayor in Wayne, and later as a state Superior Court judge in \n     Paterson, died at his home here Wednesday.\n       The cause of death was lung cancer, diagnosed in mid-\n     November, his wife, Joan, said.\n       Waks, 66, who once described himself to a reporter as an \n     ``ornery cuss'' but told voters they could count on him to be \n     fair-minded, even-handed and flexible, was known for his \n     honesty, compassion, intelligence and hard work.\n       ``He was one of Passaic County's real jewels,'' said Rep. \n     Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-Paterson), a close friend for whom Waks' \n     son, Joseph, previously worked as spokesman.\n       Born and raised in Paterson, Waks moved to Wayne and got \n     his start in politics in 1971 as an advocate for local \n     tenants after his landlord hiked his apartment's rent by 20 \n     percent.\n       He was elected to the council with heavy support from 5th \n     Ward renters, and continued to support enforcement of \n     tenants' rights. Often the only Democrat on a Republican \n     governing body, Waks was elected mayor in 1994 and again in \n     1997, resigning to become judge in 2000.\n       In December 1971, Wayne's township council voted to give \n     one of its last liquor licenses to the friend of a \n     councilman. Soon after he was sworn in, in January 1972, Waks \n     drafted a resolution to rescind the issuance of the license. \n     To avoid public allegations of cronyism, the councilman's \n     friend returned the license before the resolution could go \n     before the council, and the license was later issued to a \n     Vietnam veteran who opened a now-defunct liquor store on \n     Route 23.\n       ``It was a nice way to get started,'' said Waks. \n     ``Everybody knew the first time it was political patronage. \n     It was the first thing I ever did, and still one of the \n     proudest.''\n       Waks' tenure coincided with an era in which former Wayne \n     officials, including its\n\n[[Page S10147]]\n\n     former mayor, business administrator, and township attorney, \n     pleaded guilty to taking part in various bribery schemes \n     involving developers. Later, Waks and his wife, an attorney \n     who served on the Wayne council after her husband's \n     departure, sued the wrongdoers for damages in an innovative \n     racketeering lawsuit that brought the township more than \n     $300,000.\n       Running for mayor, Waks refused to take campaign \n     contributions from those doing business with the township.\n       ``He drove me nuts in this office,'' Beverly Tierney, \n     administrative assistant in the Wayne mayor's office, said of \n     her friend and former boss. ``He never let anyone do \n     anything. He would not accept a gift. A restaurant sent over \n     a tray of cookies, and he had me send them back.''\n       He was sworn in as a Civil Division judge in state Superior \n     Court in Paterson seven years ago today, according to \n     Assignment Judge Robert Passero.\n       Waks wasn't above getting personally involved in his job, \n     according to Passero. He recalled a case before Waks in which \n     a single mother with children faced eviction for failure to \n     pay rent. ``He gave her the money to pay the rent,'' Passero \n     said. ``While liking inwardly what he did, I actually had to \n     admonish him for that as not being appropriate.''\n       For as hard as he worked and as compassionate as he was, \n     Passero said Waks never let the grandiosity of being a judge \n     go to his head. ``He was the type of guy who never wore \n     socks. I think he still wore the same ties as he had in high \n     school,'' he said, with a laugh. ``He was very unassuming. \n     Very casual.''\n       Passero added, ``He studied hard, he worked hard. In my \n     opinion, he was an ideal judge.''\n       Waks graduated School 20 and Eastside High School in \n     Paterson, and received a bachelor's degree from Rutgers \n     University. In 1966, he earned a law degree from Georgetown \n     University, where he met his wife. He joined his father, \n     Isadore Waks, in his Paterson law practice the following \n     year. On occasion Waks filled in for his father as attorney \n     for Paterson's Board of Adjustment, and gave the money he \n     earned for that work to his mother, Joan Waks said. Later, \n     Waks continued as a solo practitioner.\n       State Sen. John Girgenti, D-Hawthorne, who appointed Waks \n     to state Superior Court, said Waks was ``a perfect candidate \n     for the bench, because he got along well with everyone.''\n       Waks received a lifetime appointment to the bench before \n     the state Senate Judiciary Committee in May, Joan Waks said. \n     Family members brought a wheelchair because he was weak at \n     that point, but Waks stood for a brief speech about how \n     ``important it was to serve the people,'' said his wife.\n       ``He really was so proud to be recognized for the work he \n     did,'' she said. ``He loved being a judge.''\n       Waks quit smoking about 15 years ago, his wife said. She \n     said he expressed his fear about dying and said he was ``not \n     ready to go.'' ``I don't think he believed it 'til the end,'' \n     she said. ``He died like he lived, stubbornly.''\n       In addition to his wife, Waks is survived by a brother, Jay \n     Waks, of Larchmont, N.Y.; his children, Joseph Waks and his \n     wife Nancy Slowe of Bayonne; daughters Jennifer Kennelly and \n     her husband Thomas, of Pompton Plains; and Melanie Graceffo \n     and her husband Gerald, of Cranford, six grandchildren: Cole, \n     McKenzie, and Aidan Kennelly, and Gordon, Gabriel, and Isabel \n     Graceffo, and what his wife termed ``his two granddogs.''\n       Joan Waks said she would hold a ``family-only'' service \n     Monday. Waks, who was proud to be Jewish but nonpracticing, \n     will be cremated, she said. A memorial service will likely be \n     held Aug. 4 at DePaul High School in Wayne, where Waks sold \n     coffee at Friday bingo games long past the time their \n     children attended the school. Wayne Mayor Scott Rumana \n     ordered flags to fly at half staff for 30 days to honor \n     Waks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10147-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING FAUSTA SAWAL\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I recognize Mrs. Fausta \nSawal for her outstanding service in senior citizen communities in our \nhome State of Washington. Mrs. Sawal was selected among 16,000 \nvolunteers to receive the Senior Companion 2007 Spirit of Service \nAward.\n  The Spirit of Service awards are given to individuals who have \ndemonstrated both leadership and a commitment to service within their \ncommunities. Mrs. Sawal has been a true role model in the community, \nhelping senior citizens and disabled adults for more than 16 years. \nDuring her service with the Volunteers of America Senior Companion \nProgram in Seattle/King County, she made a profound difference in the \nquality of life for dozens of people. Mrs. Sawal was there to call 911 \nwhen one of her clients suffered from a heart attack. She also provided \nassistance when another client fell from a bus and needed to be taken \nto the hospital. Time and again, Mrs. Sawal demonstrated her caring \nnature and her ability to effectively assist individuals in a time of \nneed.\n  Mrs. Sawal has not limited her work to helping individuals. She has \nbeen a leader within many community organizations. Currently, she is \nthe president of the Senior Companion Program Advisory Council, a \nmember of the Filipino Community Center, and a volunteer at both the \nAsian Counseling and Referral Services and the International Drop-In \nCenter. Mrs. Sawal has been active in each of these organizations, \ntaking on many responsibilities including organizing special events, \nassisting case managers and clients, assisting with in-service \ntrainings, procuring sponsors, and recruiting volunteers.\n  In addition to her role in the community, this amazing woman has \nraised eight children. Mrs. Sawal has more than 20 grandchildren and 4 \ngreat-grandchildren. In 2004, she was chosen as the Mother of the Year \nin Seattle's Asian community.\n  I would like to thank Mrs. Sawal for the positive impact she has had \non so many lives in Washington State. Both her past activities and her \ncurrent pursuits are helping to create healthier and happier \ncommunities. I am sure Mrs. Sawal will continue to make significant \ncontributions to her family and in the elderly and disabled communities \nin Washington. Mrs. Sawal is a remarkable woman, and I am pleased she \nis being honored for her years of dedication to helping others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10147-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              200TH ANNIVERSARY OF NELSON COUNTY, VIRGINIA\n\n Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a county in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia that is celebrating its bicentennial \nanniversary. Throughout this year, Nelson County residents will gather \nto celebrate their county's history and founding.\n  Nelson County is nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge \nMountains, midway between Charlottesville and Lynchburg. It was settled \nby colonists of English and German descent, as well as by the Scotch-\nIrish, whom I proudly recognize as my ancestors. The county was \nofficially founded in 1807 and named in honor of Thomas Nelson, Jr., \nthird Governor of Virginia. Nelson County is now home to about 14,500 \npeople.\n  For those who call Nelson County home, it is a comfortable place to \nwork and live. Nelson County is also a community in the truest sense of \nthe word. This was most clearly demonstrated when neighbors came \ntogether and offered comfort and helping hands after Hurricane Camille \ncaused widespread destruction in the county in 1969. Today community \nmembers can look to each other and remember with pride how they came \ntogether under hard circumstances to make Nelson County prosper once \nagain.\n  Nelson County's economy is based on agriculture and natural resource-\nbased industries such as timber and quarrying. The scenic surroundings \nhave also attracted recreational development in recent years, making \nthe county an outdoor enthusiast's haven. Outdoor recreation \nopportunities include hiking along the magnificent Appalachian Trail or \nto the top of Crabtree Falls, the highest cascading waterfall east of \nthe Mississippi River, as well as canoeing and fishing on the James or \nTye Rivers and skiing at Wintergreen Resort.\n  Many Americans may not be familiar with Nelson County by name, but \nmillions have had a glimpse of what life was like in this rural \ncommunity due to the writings of Nelson County native, Earl Hamner, Jr. \nDuring the Great Depression, Hamner began writing of his experience \ngrowing up in Nelson County. These writings eventually provided the \nsubstance for ``The Waltons'' television series.\n  The Nelson County Museum of History, which is currently being \ndeveloped, will soon offer visitors opportunities to learn the rich \nheritage and rural culture of Nelson County through events, exhibits, \nand educational programs.\n  The rural community of Nelson County has much to remember and much to \nbe proud of.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Nelson \nCounty and its residents on their first 200 years and in wishing them \nwell in the future.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10148-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10148]]\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10148-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session, the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10148-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 10:08 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2429.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 1881. A bill to amend the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \nto restore the intent and protections of that Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am joining, today, with the senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, in introducing the ADA \nRestoration Act of 2007.\n  Today, July 26, marks the 17th anniversary of the signing of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, one of the landmark civil rights laws \nof the 20th century, and a long-overdue emancipation proclamation for \nthe 50 million Americans with disabilities.\n  As chief sponsor of the ADA in the Senate, I take pride in the \nprogress we have made as a Nation since 1990. We have removed most \nphysical barriers to movement and access for the 50 million Americans \nwith disabilities. We have required employers to provide reasonable \naccommodations so that people with disabilities can have equal \nopportunity in the workplace. We have advanced the 4 goals of the ADA, \nequality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and \neconomic self-sufficiency.\n  So today is a day, first and foremost, to celebrate all that has been \naccomplished over the last 17 years.\n  But despite that progress, there is a problem. In recent years, the \ncourts have ignored Congress's clear intent as to who should be \nprotected under the ADA. And the courts have narrowed the definition of \nwho qualifies as an ``individual with a disability.'' As a consequence, \nmillions of people we intended to be protected under the ADA, including \npeople with epilepsy, diabetes, and cancer, are not protected any more. \nIn a ruling just this spring, the 11th Circuit court even concluded \nthat a person with mental retardation was not ``disabled'' under the \nADA.\n  Looking back through the legislative history, it is abundantly clear \nthat Congress intended that the protections in the ADA apply to all \npersons without regard to mitigating circumstances, such as taking \nmedication or using an assistive device.\n  In the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee report Congress \nsaid:\n\n       Whether a person has a disability should be assessed \n     without regard to the availability of mitigating measures, \n     such as reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids.\n\n  The House Education and Labor Committee report says the same thing, \nand goes on to say:\n\n       For example, a person who is hard of hearing is \n     substantially limited in the major life activity of hearing, \n     even though the loss may be corrected through the use of a \n     hearing aid. Likewise, persons with impairments, such as \n     epilepsy or diabetes, which substantially limit a major life \n     activity are covered under . . . the definition of \n     disability, even if the effects of the impairment are \n     controlled by medication.\n\n  Nonetheless, in a series of cases, the Supreme Court ignored \nCongressional intent. Together, these Supreme Court cases have created \nan absurd and unintended Catch 22. People with serious health \nconditions like epilepsy or diabetes who are fortunate to find \ntreatments that make them more capable and independent, and more able \nto work, may find that they are no longer protected by the ADA. If \nthese individuals are no longer covered under the ADA, then their \nrequests for a reasonable accommodation at work can be denied, or they \ncan be fired. On the other hand, if they stop taking their medication, \nthey will be considered a person with a disability under the ADA, but \nthey will be unable to do their job.\n  This is not just absurd, it is wrong. It flies in the face of clear, \nunambiguous Congressional intent. When we passed the law, there was \ncommon agreement on both sides of the aisle, and on the part of the \nWhite House, that the law was designed to protect any individual who is \ntreated less favorably because of a current, past, or perceived \ndisability.\n\n[[Page S10152]]\n\n  This situation cries out for a modest, reasonable legislative fix, \nand that is exactly what we are doing, today, by introducing the ADA \nRestoration Act of 2007.\n  Our bill amends the definition of ``disability'' so that people who \nCongress originally intended to be protected from discrimination are \ncovered under the ADA.\n  Mr. Presdient, 17 years ago, the Americans with Disabilities Act \npassed with overwhelming bipartisan support. Likewise, today, we are \nbuilding a strong bicameral, bipartisan majority to support ADA \nRestoration. A companion bill is being introduced, today, in the House.\n  As with the original passage of the ADA in 1990, it is going to take \ntime to hold hearings and build strong majorities. But I look forward \nto working to restore Congress' original intent, and, once again, to \nensure that Americans with disabilities are protected from \ndiscrimination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was orderd to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1881\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Americans with Disabilities \n     Act Restoration Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990, Congress intended that the Act ``establish a clear and \n     comprehensive prohibition of discrimination on the basis of \n     disability'', and provide broad coverage and vigorous and \n     effective remedies without unnecessary and obstructive \n     defenses;\n       (2) decisions and opinions of the Supreme Court have unduly \n     narrowed the broad scope of protection afforded by the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, eliminating \n     protection for a broad range of individuals whom Congress \n     intended to protect;\n       (3) in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990, Congress recognized that physical and mental \n     impairments are natural parts of the human experience that in \n     no way diminish a person's right to fully participate in all \n     aspects of society, but Congress also recognized that people \n     with physical or mental impairments having the talent, \n     skills, abilities, and desire to participate in society are \n     frequently precluded from doing so because of prejudice, \n     antiquated attitudes, or the failure to remove societal and \n     institutional barriers;\n       (4)(A) Congress modeled the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     of 1990 definition of disability on that of section 504 of \n     the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (referred to in this section \n     as ``section 504''), which had, prior to the date of \n     enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, \n     been construed broadly to encompass both actual and perceived \n     limitations, and limitations imposed by society; and\n       (B) the broad conception of the definition contained in \n     section 504 had been underscored by the Supreme Court's \n     statement in its decision in School Board of Nassau County v. \n     Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987), that the definition \n     ``acknowledged that society's myths and fears about \n     disability and disease are as handicapping as are the \n     physical limitations that flow from actual impairment'';\n       (5) in adopting, in the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990, the concept of disability expressed in section 504, \n     Congress understood that adverse action based on a person's \n     physical or mental impairment is often unrelated to the \n     limitations caused by the impairment itself;\n       (6) instead of following congressional expectations that \n     the term ``disability'' would be interpreted broadly in the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Supreme Court \n     has ruled, in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. \n     Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), that the elements of the \n     definition ``need to be interpreted strictly to create a \n     demanding standard for qualifying as disabled'' and, \n     consistent with that view, has narrowed the application of \n     the definition in various ways; and\n       (7) contrary to explicit congressional intent expressed in \n     the committee reports for the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     of 1990, the Supreme Court has eliminated from the Act's \n     coverage individuals who have mitigated the effects of their \n     impairments through the use of such measures as medication \n     and assistive devices.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to effect the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990's \n     objectives of providing ``a clear and comprehensive national \n     mandate for the elimination of discrimination'' and ``clear, \n     strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing \n     discrimination'' by restoring the broad scope of protection \n     available under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n       (2) to respond to certain decisions of the Supreme Court, \n     including Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., (527 U.S. 471 \n     (1999), Murphy v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 527 U.S. 516 \n     (1999), Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, 527 U.S. 555 \n     (1999), and Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. \n     Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), that have narrowed the class \n     of people who can invoke the protection from discrimination \n     that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 provides; \n     and\n       (3) to reinstate the original congressional intent \n     regarding the definition of disability in the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990 by clarifying that the protection of \n     that Act is available for all individuals who are--\n       (A) subjected to adverse treatment based on an actual or \n     perceived impairment, or a record of impairment; or\n       (B) adversely affected--\n       (i) by prejudiced attitudes, such as myths, fears, \n     ignorance, or stereotypes concerning disability or particular \n     disabilities; or\n       (ii) by the failure to remove societal and institutional \n     barriers, including communication, transportation, and \n     architectural barriers, or the failure to provide reasonable \n     modifications to policies, practices, and procedures, \n     reasonable accommodations, and auxiliary aids and services.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS IN AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990.\n\n       Section 2(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n     (42 U.S.C. 12101(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:\n       ``(1)(A) physical and mental disabilities are natural parts \n     of the human experience that in no way diminish a person's \n     right to fully participate in all aspects of society; and\n       ``(B)(i) people with physical or mental disabilities having \n     the talent, skills, abilities, and desire to participate in \n     society are frequently precluded from doing so because of \n     discrimination; and\n       ``(ii) other people who have a record of a disability or \n     are regarded as having a disability have also been subjected \n     to discrimination;''; and\n       (2) by striking paragraph (7) and inserting the following:\n       ``(7)(A) individuals with disabilities have been subjected \n     to a history of purposeful unequal treatment, have had \n     restrictions and limitations imposed upon them because of \n     their disabilities, and have been relegated to positions of \n     political powerlessness in society; and\n       ``(B) classifications and selection criteria that exclude \n     individuals with disabilities should be strongly disfavored, \n     subjected to skeptical and meticulous examination, and \n     permitted only for highly compelling reasons, and never on \n     the basis of prejudice, myths, irrational fears, ignorance, \n     or stereotypes about disability;''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \nvarious programs for the recruitment and retention of public health \nworkers and to eliminate critical public health workforce shortages in \nFederal, State, local, and tribal public health agencies; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the last few years, our Nation's public \nhealth has been threatened repeatedly. We have faced natural disasters \nlike the horrific damage done by Hurricane Katrina. We have endured \nhuman-led catastrophes like the tragic September 11 attacks. Only a \ncouple of months ago, a man infected with a potentially lethal strain \nof extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis was able to travel from his \nhome in Atlanta to France, Greece, the Czech Republic, and Canada, \nbefore ending up at a center in Denver for treatment.\n  These emergencies have made it clear that our public health system \nmust be prepared for the unexpected.\n  Our ability to prevent, respond to, and recover from incidents like \nthese depends upon an adequately staffed and well trained public health \nworkforce. But if we look at our public health workforce today, what we \nsee is alarming: an aging staff nearing retirement with no clear \npipeline of trained employees to fill the void.\n  The average age of lab technicians, epidemiologists, environmental \nhealth experts, microbiologists, IT specialists, administrators, and \nother public health workers is 47. That is 7 years older than the \naverage age of the Nation's workforce. Retirement rates are as high as \n20 percent in some State public health agencies. Nearly half of the \nFederal employees in positions critical to our biodefense will be \neligible to retire by 2012. The average age of a public health nurse is \nnear 50 years.\n  These statistics are sobering. As the responsibilities of our public \nhealth workforce are growing, their ranks continue to shrink. These are \nshortages that impact not just for the security of our health, but our \nnational security.\n  We can't afford to overlook this problem any longer. For the third \nconsecutive Congress, Senator Hagel and I are introducing the Public \nHealth Preparedness Workforce Development Act of 2007. This is a bill \nthat will increase the pipeline of qualified public health workers at \nall levels--Federal, State, local, and tribal. It offers scholarships \nand loan repayment as recruitment and retention incentives for students \nwho enter and stay in the field of public health. It also provides \nopportunities for mid-career public health professionals to go back for \nadditional training in public health preparedness or biodefense.\n  The time to prepare for a public health emergency, whether that be a \nnatural disaster or one of our own making, is not tomorrow, nor next \nmonth, nor a year from now, but today. Looking forward we must \nstrengthen our public health workforce. I urge my colleagues to join me \nand the Senator from Nebraska in taking up and passing the Public \nHealth Preparedness Workforce Development Act. We must all make a \ncommitment to securing the safety of our nation, and that security \nbegins with our public health.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1883. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for standardized marketing requirements under the Medicare \nAdvantage program and the Medicare prescription drug program and to \nprovide for State certification prior to waiver of licensure \nrequirements under the Medicare prescription drug program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Accountability \nand Transparency in Medicare Marketing Act, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Dorgan and Wyden. This legislation aims to regulate the \nmarketing standards and sales tactics of Medicare Advantage and \nMedicare prescription drug plans, now the fastest growing segment of \nMedicare and a prime target for fraud, misrepresentation, and deceptive \nsales practices.\n  As chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, I recently held a \nhearing entitled, ``Medicare Advantage Marketing and Sales: Who Has the \nAdvantage?'' Our hearing uncovered that a large majority of State \ninsurance departments have received, and continue to receive, an \nunprecedented number of complaints about inappropriate or confusing \nmarketing practices that have led Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in \nMedicare Advantage plans without adequately understanding the \nconsequences of their decisions.\n  My legislation will facilitate the creation of uniform marketing \nstandards that will be adopted and enforced by individual states. Based \non current law, CMS has exclusive authority to investigate and \ndiscipline the marketing and selling of Medicare advantage products, \nwhile States have only been permitted to examine and enforce violations \nagainst individual insurance agents. This unusual arrangement, which \nsome might call a pre-emption of authority, has left a sizable \nenforcement gap that has exacerbated the problems found by the \ncommittee.\n  This legislation will close that gap, giving States the ability to \nstandardize marketing and sales regulations, as well as regulate both \nagents and companies in the marketing and sales of\n\n[[Page S10154]]\n\nMedicare Advantage and prescription drug plans. Ultimately, State \ninsurance commissioners will have the ability to work in conjunction \nwith CMS in order to provide the most comprehensive protection possible \nfor Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Senior citizens deserve to have access to the health care plan that \nbest serves their needs without having to worry about being purposely \nmislead and deceived. I believe we must repair this disconnect in \noversight and ensure the protection of American seniors, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join in my effort to do so.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1883\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \nof 2002 to reauthorize and improve agricultural energy programs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry,\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \nhelp deliver clean energy technologies from the research pipelines of \nour labs into the hands of our farmers and ranchers, so that we can \ntake better advantage of our farms and fields for clean energy \nproduction. This bill, called the Harvesting Energy Act, will bolster \nthe energy title of this year's farm bill, building on the good ideas \nthat Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Chambliss, and the rest of us on \nthe Agriculture Committee have been working on for several months.\n  I am proud that the Harvesting Energy Act reflects the broad-based, \nbipartisan input of the 25 by '25 coalition which, earlier this year, \nprovided us with their policy recommendations for how we can produce 25 \npercent of our energy from renewable resources by 2025. The 25 by '25 \nvision has been endorsed by 22 current and former Governors and several \nState legislatures across the country, along with over 500 \norganizations and companies, including the Big Three automobile \nmanufacturers, agricultural producers, and environmental groups. We \nestablished 25 by '25 as a national goal earlier this year when we \npassed the Energy bill in the Senate. We must now implement the \npolicies that are necessary to achieve that goal.\n  I have spoken many times about the urgency of moving this Nation \ntoward energy independence by making better use of the resources we \nhave here at home. Responsible development of our oil and gas \nresources, improved efficiency and conservation, and more aggressive \ninvestment in renewable energy technologies--these are the three \npillars upon which we must build an economy that is less dependent on \nforeign oil.\n  I do not need to remind my colleagues of the dangers that oil \ndependence poses to the United States and to global security. It is oil \nthat empowers states such as lran, Venezuela, and Syria. It is oil that \ncontributes to violence in Iraq, Nigeria, and the Sudan. It is oil that \nplaces Russia and China in a dangerous competition for oil in Central \nAsia and Africa.\n  This Congress has made remarkable progress since January in \nconfronting the daunting task of reducing our dependence on foreign \noil. It is an effort that has spanned several committees.\n  The Energy bill that we passed in early June represented the diligent \nwork of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Commerce \nCommittee, and the Finance Committee. I was proud of the work we did on \nthat bill, from creating meaningful oil savings targets to making \nsmarter investments in renewables, improving vehicle standards, and \nestablishing a national goal of producing 25 percent of our energy from \nour farms and fields by 2025.\n  I am also proud of the energy work we are doing on the farm bill in \nthe Agriculture Committee. Thanks to Chairman Harkin's leadership, the \n2007 farm bill will build on the 2002 farm bill's first-ever energy \ntitle.\n  This is an important step that recognizes the central role that our \nfarmers and ranchers must play in a new, clean energy economy. We have \nthe most productive lands and most efficient farmers in the world, \nallowing America to be the breadbasket for the global community. With \nthese resources, talent, and ingenuity, there is no doubt that we can \ngrow our way to energy independence.\n  As I travel through Colorado, the possibilities of a clean energy \nrevolution, driven by farmers and ranchers, are clear.\n  In Weld County, Logan County, and Yuma County, we are seeing biofuel \nplants spring to life, creating new markets and new opportunities for \nour rural communities. In 2004, there were no ethanol plants in \nColorado. Today, three plants produce more than 90 million gallons per \nyear, and a fourth plant will come on line later this year, adding \nanother 50 million gallons per year.\n  But it is not just biofuels. In the San Luis Valley, where my family \nhas lived for five generations, Xcel Energy just broke ground on the \nlargest solar plant in North America.\n  We have added 60 megawatts of wind capacity in Colorado in the last 2 \nyears, and by the end of 2007, we will add another 775 megawatts, more \nthan tripling the State's production of wind power to more than 1,000 \nmegawatts. This is good for households along the Front Range that get \nclean, affordable power, and it is good for the ranchers in Prowers \nCounty, who own the land on which the turbines sit.\n  These biofuel plants, wind turbines, and solar farms are revitalizing \nrural communities that have been withering on the vine. They are \nbringing life back to main streets that were boarded up and excitement \nback to farmers and ranchers who are eager to be a part of our clean \nenergy revolution.\n  The bill I am introducing today will help stimulate this revolution \nby getting more renewable energy technologies out of the development \npipeline and into the fields, where they belong.\n  It is based on the recommendations contained in the 25 by 25 Action \nPlan and builds on those ideas with important new initiatives to \nsupplement the energy title of the farm bill. Our goal is to ensure \nthat the renewable energy work being done at the Department of Energy \nand in colleges and universities throughout the country, in which we \ninvested earlier this year through the Energy bill, is accompanied by a \nstrong commitment at USDA to bring the resulting technologies and \nmethods out to farmers and ranchers.\n  USDA has a long history of identifying promising new production \nmethods and technologies, refining them, and making them available to \nagricultural producers. The Akron Research Station in Washington \nCounty, CO, is a great example. For 100 years it has connected our \nfarmers in eastern Colorado with the latest practical agricultural \nresearch available.\n  USDA can and should be making the same efforts to disperse the latest \nand best developments from the renewable energy revolution to farmers \nand ranchers.\n  I want to briefly describe four ways in which my bill will bolster \nUSDA's capabilities in this area and help make the 25x'25 vision a \nreality.\n  First, the Harvesting Energy Act of expands and extends Section 9006 \nof the farm bill, which offers competitive grants and loan guarantees \nto help farmers, ranchers, and rural small businesses invest in proven \nclean energy technologies. My bill adds $280 million to section 9006, \nfollowing the recommendations of the 25x'25 Agriculture Energy \nAlliance. This will ramp up the loan guarantees for cellulosic ethanol \nfacilities, encourage community wind and other electric power projects, \nand expand the number of eligible applicants for these loans and \ngrants. This is a responsible way to help more farmers become net \nenergy producers of on-farm renewable energy.\n  Second, my bill accelerates research, development, demonstration, and \ndeployment of renewable resources such as biomass, wind, solar, and \nrenewable natural gas. I am proposing that we devote an additional $200 \nmillion per year to these efforts, with the specific goals of bringing \nbiomass energy feedstocks such as native grasses and short-rotation \ntrees into production; perfecting our biorefinery and conversion \ntechnologies; refining biofuels from these biomass feedstocks; and \nmaking use of the biobased coproducts to add value to the process.\n  Third, if we are to continue to expand biofuels production, we need \nto ensure that the supply is stable so that we don't encounter major \nshortages in droughts or in periods of adverse weather. Storing \nfeedstocks like corn, oilseed crops, and biomass for cellulosic ethanol \nwill better protect consumers from huge price fluctuations or \nshortages. My bill would create a voluntary biofuel feedstock reserve \nthat would encourage farmers to store these feedstocks on-farm and make \nthem available for biofuel production when a price spike or a shortage \noccurs.\n\n[[Page S10156]]\n\n  Fourth, the Harvesting Energy Act invests in research and development \nin new production technologies that promise to yield high energy \nreturns and carbon storage. One of the key investments that this bill \nmakes is in biochar. Biochar is a type of charcoal produced from \nbiomass that is valuable as a soil amendment. The USDA and DOE are \nfinding that they can produce biochar as a carbon-capturing byproduct \nof cellulosic ethanol production. This is good for farmers, who put the \nbiochar back into the soil as a fertilizer, good for the environment \nbecause it reduces carbon emissions, and good for consumers because it \ncould drive down cellulosic ethanol production costs. My bill would \nprovide $50 million in competitive funding for research and development \ngrants to scale-up and commercialize biochar production systems. Like \nso much else we are doing in the energy title of the farm bill, this \nwould move ideas from the research pipeline out into the field, where \nthey need to be.\n  This bill includes a wide range of other provisions that build on the \ngood work that the Agriculture Committee is doing on the farm bill. \nLike the provisions I have described, they aim to expand the menu of \nrenewable energy options we have available as we work to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  I again thank Chairman Harkin and Senator Chambliss for their \nleadership on the Agriculture Committee and for their commitment to \ncreating a robust energy title in this year's farm bill. I firmly \nbelieve that with the right investments and a commitment from this \nCongress, our farmers and ranchers can help lead us down the path to \nenergy independence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Smith (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1887. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act in \norder to ensure access to critical medications under the Medicare Part \nD prescription drug program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. Smith. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Access to \nCritical Medications Act ACMA, a bill that will vastly improve the \ncoverage millions of vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries receive through \nthe Medicare prescription drug program, known as Part D. The new drug \nbenefit has been a tremendous success, providing access to affordable \nprescription drug therapies to millions of beneficiaries, some for the \nvery first time. But many of our most vulnerable seniors, especially \nthose suffering from serious health conditions like mental illness, \nHIV/AIDS or cancer, often have difficulty obtaining the vital drug \ntherapies they need to remain functional, or in some cases, to survive. \nTo remedy these problems, the bill I am introducing today will give the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, the regulatory tools \nit needs to ensure that all prescription drug plans, PDP, provide \nunfettered access to medically essential drug therapies.\n  My connection to this issue began long before Medicare's new \nprescription drug benefit went into effect. As chairman of the Aging \nCommittee, I held a hearing in the spring of 2005 to explore how well \nCMS was preparing to transition dual-eligible beneficiaries, those who \nqualify for both Medicare and Medicaid, into Medicare Part D. At that \nhearing, advocates expressed a number of concerns with the \nimplementation of the new drug benefit, and chief among them was \nguaranteeing that vulnerable beneficiaries had access to important drug \ntherapies that either stabilized or improved their health condition. I \nmade a personal request to then CMS Administrator Dr. Mark McClellan to \nwork with prescription drug plans to ensure that their formularies \nprovide access to all available drugs in certain pharmaceutical \nclasses, including those that contain innovative treatments for mental \nillness, epilepsy, cancer and HIV/AIDS. The result of that conversation \nwas the creation of the ``all or substantially all'' policy for six \nprotected drug classes. CMS initially included this new policy as part \nof the sub-regulatory formulary guidance it issued to plans in 2005 and \nagain in 2006.\n  While I was pleased with CMS providing this additional protection for \nthe vital drug therapies in the six protected classes, its actual \nimpact on beneficiaries gaining access to the medications they need has \nbeen uneven at best. For one, the policy was issued as sub-regulatory \nguidance, which limits CMS' ability to enforce it. While it is true \nthat the annual contracts CMS develops with prescription drug plans \ngenerally include a requirement that they abide by the ``all or \nsubstantially all'' guidance, the agency's record of enforcing the \npolicy has been quite poor. Instead of plans covering all drugs in the \nsix protected classes, as CMS claims plan contracts require, \nbeneficiaries, often the most frail and vulnerable, have had extensive \naccess problems because their PDPs do not include their medication on \nits formulary. In fact, data from a study being conducted by the \nAmerican Psychiatric Institute for Research and Education, APIRE, \nreleased earlier this year, showed that roughly 68 percent of surveyed \nbeneficiaries, many of them dual eligibles, experienced some sort of \nproblem accessing the prescription drug they needed because their PDP's \nformulary did not cover it. This would suggest that CMS' current \napproach to enforcing the ``all or substantially all'' policy is \nwoefully lacking.\n  I should note that beneficiaries often are able to access a drug that \nshould be covered on their plan's formulary by filing a coverage \nappeal. However, that process is usually long and difficult to \ncomplete, and results in the problem only being solved for one \nbeneficiary. I appreciate the responsiveness of drug plans to specific \nbeneficiaries' difficulties with accessing the drugs they need, but if \nthey are not addressing the concerns raised through the appeals process \non a broader scale, problems will only continue to occur. I believe we \nneed a system-wide approach to ensuring that beneficiaries have access \nto the life-saving and life-improving medications they need and I \nbelieve that solution lies within the legislation I am filing today.\n  The Access to Critical Medications Act ACMA would codify, for a 5-\nyear period, the current policies in CMS existing ``all or \nsubstantially all'' sub-regulatory guidance. I am hopeful that \nproviding this statutory authority will signal to plans that it is no \nlonger an option to cover all available drugs in the six protected \nclasses. It is a legal requirement that must be adhered to in order to \nparticipate in Medicare Part D. Accordingly, I would expect that this \nchange will empower CMS to take a more proactive role in ensuring that \nprescription drug plan sponsors are not placing arbitrary barriers to \naccessing these critical medications covered by the ``all or \nsubstantially all'' policy.\n  During the 5 year period that the ``all or substantially all'' policy \nwill be effective, the ACMA directs CMS to establish a process through \nregulation, that would allow for this important policy to be updated \nand enforced in future years. None of us hold the knowledge of the \npharmaceutical and medical developments of tomorrow. In a decade, there \ncould be major breakthroughs in treating any number of debilitating \nillnesses, which may require the creation of or modification of \npharmaceutical classes covered by this important policy. CMS needs to \nhave the authority to update the classes and categories it covers and \nthe process the ACMA creates will provide them the tools to do that.\n  In order to use those tools, the ACMA defines specific, clinically-\nbased criteria that the Secretary must follow when evaluating whether a \ndrug class should be added or removed from coverage under the policy. \nThis will ensure that there is consistency in the manner by which the \npolicy is evaluated in future years, so that the Secretary is not \narbitrarily determining which medications are important enough so that \nall plans must provide access to them. The ACMA also makes modest \nchanges to the appeals process, to ensure that plans and CMS resolve \nbeneficiary complaints in a timely manner, and that access to \nmedications is guaranteed while the appeals process runs its course.\n  The existing ``all or substantially all'' policy was a step in the \nright direction at the time it was created. However, as we approach the \nthird year of Medicare's prescription drug benefit, beneficiaries' \nactual experience in the program provides overwhelming support that we \nneed a more robust approach to helping vulnerable beneficiaries get the \nmedications they need.\n\n[[Page S10157]]\n\nAs importantly, CMS must have a regulatory process in place that will \nenable it to modify the classes covered by the policy in response to \nchanges in medical and pharmaceutical science. I believe the ACMA \nclearly addresses both those needs, and I hope my colleagues will \nagree. It is a well thought out policy that strikes a careful balance \nbetween flexibility and enforceability. Advocacy groups such as the \nAmerican Psychiatric Association, the National Alliance for Mental \nIllness, Mental Health America, the AIDS Institute, the HIV Medicine \nAssociation and the Epilepsy Foundation all contributed to the \ndevelopment of ACMA and all now support the finished product.

Gordon Smith,\n     404 Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: We are writing on behalf of the Access \n     to Critical Medications Coalition to offer our strong support \n     for your Medicare Access to Critical Medications Act. The \n     Coalition represents a diverse group of national and \n     community-based patient, provider and advocacy organizations \n     dedicated to ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries with HIV/\n     AIDS, mental illnesses, epilepsy, cancer, organ failure, and \n     autoimmune diseases have reliable access through Medicare \n     Part D to the prescriptions that they need to stay healthy.\n       The Medicare Access to Critical Medications Act will \n     strengthen protections for these medically vulnerable \n     populations by codifying the requirement that Medicare Part D \n     plans cover ``all or substantially all'' drugs in the six \n     classes of drugs that are critical to treating HIV/AIDS, \n     mental illnesses, cancer, epilepsy, autoimmune diseases such \n     as Crohn's, and transplant patients. As you may know, \n     coverage of nearly all of the drugs in these categories is \n     standard practice among state Medicaid programs and private \n     insurers because it is more cost effective and better for \n     people with these conditions when clinicians have the \n     flexibility to prescribe the drug or drugs most appropriate \n     to manage the condition according to factors unique to them.\n       Passage of this bill is important because the current \n     protections for these drug classes offered in Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) guidance are not guaranteed \n     beyond this year and are being ignored by drug plans with no \n     risk of sanctions. Surveys of HIV and mental health medical \n     providers indicate that Medicare beneficiaries with these \n     conditions have been hospitalized or experienced dangerous \n     treatment interruptions due to challenges with Medicare Part \n     D coverage, including burdensome prior authorization \n     processes. Many of the beneficiaries reporting problems are \n     very low-income and live on Supplemental Security Income \n     (SSI) checks or modest disability payments. Paying out of \n     pocket for drugs denied by Medicare Part D drug plans is not \n     an option for most.\n       On behalf of Medicare beneficiaries with these life-\n     threatening illnesses, thank you for your leadership in \n     working to ensure access to critical medications through \n     Medicare Part D by requiring drug plans to cover ``all or \n     substantially all'' of the drugs available to treat these \n     serious, but treatable conditions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             American Psychiatric Association,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 24, 2007.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, 404 Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: I am writing on behalf of the American \n     Psychiatric Association (AP A), the medical specialty \n     representing more than 38,000 psychiatric physicians \n     nationwide, to express our strong support for your Medicare \n     Access to Critical Medications Act of 2007.\n       This bill will provide crucial protections in the Medicare \n     Part D program for six classes of life-saving medications. \n     Part D drug plans will be required to place substantially all \n     anticancer, HIV/AIDS, and immunosuppressant medications on \n     their formularies, as well as drugs that are important to \n     people with severe mental illnesses--antipsychotics, \n     antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. In addition, when a \n     drug plan and a patient's physician disagree about whether a \n     critical medication is needed, your legislation will require \n     that the medication be covered until the appeals process can \n     be completed.\n       Unfortunately, data from the first year of the Part D \n     program point to the need for additional protections for \n     patients with serious diseases. In 2006, an American \n     Psychiatric Institute for Research and Education (APIRE) \n     study tracked 1,193 dually-eligible Medicare/Medicaid \n     psychiatric patients and found that 53.4 percent experienced \n     at least one problem with medication access or continuity. \n     Among these patients, 19.8 percent had a subsequent emergency \n     room visit reported, and 11 percent had a hospitalization.\n\n[[Page S10159]]\n\n     Furthermore, the study found that the most common medication \n     classes with coverage problems included atypical \n     antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants (West, \n     Wilk, Muszynski et al, American Journal of Psychiatry, 164:5 \n     May 2007).\n       Clearly, Part D patients will receive better care, and the \n     Medicare program as a whole will save money, if access to \n     important medications can be improved. Your legislation will \n     create new statutory protections that will address a number \n     of the most serious barriers.\n       We greatly appreciate your leadership--and the hard work of \n     your staff Matthew Canedy and Catherine Finley--in addressing \n     this serious problem.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Carolyn B. Robinowitz, M.D.,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Stevens, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 1892. A bill to reauthorize the Coast Guard for fiscal year 2008, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coast \nGuard Authorization Act for the fiscal year 2008 along with Senators \nSnowe, Inouye, Stevens, Lautenberg, and Lott. This comprehensive \nlegislation will provide the Coast Guard with needed resources to carry \nout missions critical to our Nation's security, environmental \nprotection, and fisheries enforcement.\n  The U.S. Coast Guard plays a critical role in keeping our oceans, \ncoasts, and waterways safe, secure, and free from environmental harm. \nAfter September 11 and Hurricane Katrina, the Coast Guard has been a \nsource of strength. As marine traffic grows, the number of security \nthreats in our ports increases. Climate change is raising the stakes of \nanother Katrina happening.\n  The Coast Guard faces many challenges, and those serving in the Coast \nGuard routinely serve with discipline and courage. From saving lives \nduring natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, to \nprotecting our shores in a post-9/11 world, the Coast Guard has served \nAmerica well, and continues to serve us every day.\n  Each year, maritime smugglers transport thousands of aliens to the \nU.S. with virtual impunity because the existing law does not \nsufficiently punish or deter such conduct. During fiscal years 2004 and \n2005, over 840 mariners made $13.9 million smuggling people into the \nU.S. illegally. Less than 3 percent of those who were interdicted were \nreferred for prosecution.\n  This bill gives the Coast Guard the authority it needs to prosecute \nmariners who intentionally smuggle aliens on board their vessels with a \nreckless disregard of our laws. It also provides protection for \nlegitimate mariners who encounter stowaways or those who may need \nmedical attention.\n  Our Nation relies heavily on polar icebreakers to conduct missions in \nthe Arctic and Antarctic. They conduct vital research on the oceans and \nclimate, resupply U.S. outposts in Antarctica, and provide one of our \nNation's only platforms for carrying out security and rescue missions \nin some of the world's most rapidly changing environments.\n  Currently, the United States' icebreaking capabilities lie with the \nCoast Guard's three vessels: the HEALY; the Polar Sea; and the Polar \nStar. But the fleet is aging rapidly and requires extensive \nmaintenance. In fact, the Polar Star is currently not even operational \nbecause the Coast Guard lacks the resources required to maintain this \nvessel.\n  With increased climate change, the role of icebreakers is changing. \nWith an ice-free Arctic summer expected by 2050, more and more \ninternational expeditions will be headed to the region to examine newly \nrevealed oil and gas reserves and other natural resources.\n  Canada, Russia and other countries will begin to compete with America \nover jurisdiction and, without a strong polar icebreaker fleet, our \nNation will suffer a severe disadvantage.\n  A recent 2007 report by the National Academy of Sciences found that \nthe U.S. needs to maintain polar icebreaking capacity and construct at \nleast two new polar icebreakers. This bill follows those \nrecommendations.\n  This bill includes many provisions of the Oil Pollution Prevention \nand Response Act of 2007, which I introduced on June 14, 2007. These \nprovisions are vital for the environmental protection of our Nation's \noceans and coasts. For example, this bill would require improved \ncoordination with federally-recognized tribes on oil spill prevention, \npreparedness, and response. It would also address oil spills resulting \nfrom the transfer of oil to or from vessels, spills resulting from \nhuman error, and small oil spills that are an all-too-common occurrence \nin many of our waterways.\n  For my home State of Washington, it provides a mechanism for year-\nround funding of the Neah Bay response tug, a key element of the oil \nspill prevention safety net for Washington State's Olympic Coast. It \nwould also increase oil spill preparedness in the Strait of Juan de \nFuca by changing the definition of ``High Volume Port Line'' so as to \ndeliver better incident response throughout Puget Sound.\n  The Coast Guard is responsible for ensuring our country's security, \nmarine safety and protecting our environment and fisheries. Every day \nthe Coast Guard carries out these missions and does so with limited \nresources. It is our job to ensure the Coast Guard has the tools it \nrequires to continue getting the job done. This bill will go a long way \ntowards that goal. I urge my colleagues to consider this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1892\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as Ranking Member on the Coast Guard's \noversight subcommittee, I am pleased today to co-sponsor the Coast \nGuard Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008.\n  The Coast Guard serves as the guardian of our maritime homeland \nsecurity and provides many critical services for our nation. Last year \nalone, the Coast Guard responded to over 28,000 calls for assistance, \nand saved nearly 5,300 lives. These brave men and women risk their \nlives to defend our borders from drugs, illegal immigrants, acts of \nterror, and other national security threats. In 2004, the Coast Guard \nseized 287,000 pounds of cocaine, including over 20 tons in a single \ninterdiction action, the largest drug bust ever recorded. They also \nstopped nearly 8,000 illegal migrants from reacting our shores. In \naddition they conducted 6,100 boardings to protect our vital fisheries \nstocks and they responded to 4,400 pollution incidents.\n  In today's post-9/11 world, the men and women of the Coast Guard have \nbeen working harder than ever securing the nation's coastline, \nwaterways, and ports. This rapid escalation of the Coast Guard's \nhomeland security mission catalogue continues today. While our new \nreality requires the Coast Guard to maintain a robust homeland security \nposture, these new priorities must not diminish the Coast Guard's focus \non its traditional missions such as marine safety, search and rescue, \naids to navigation, fisheries law enforcement, and marine environmental \nprotection.\n  The bill we introduce today would authorize funding at $8.3 billion \nfor fiscal year 2008. This authorization will continue to allow the \nCoast Guard to perform non-homeland security missions such as search \nand rescue, fisheries enforcement, and marine environmental protection, \nas well as fund the necessary missions related to ports, waterways, and \ncoastal security. It also includes funding to allow the service to \ncontinue replacing its rapidly aging assets so it can increase \nefficiency of its actions and reap the benefits of advances of modern \ntechnology and engineering.\n  The Coast Guard's rapid operational escalation has taken a \nsignificant toll on the ships, boats, and aircraft that the Coast Guard \nuses on a daily basis, putting additional strain on vessels that \nalready collectively comprise the world's third oldest navel fleet. The \nCoast Guard is now 5 years into the acquisition phase of a program \ndesigned to recapitalize its aging infrastructure the Integrated \nDeepwater Program. In recent months, we have heard a litany of bad news \nregarding Deepwater, from the decommissioning of eight 123-foot patrol \nboats following a failed effort to extend them, to reports that \nDeepwater's flagship, the National Security Cutter, will not meet the \nspecifications required by the Coast Guard. The service has taken \nnumerous steps to rectify contractual shortcomings that have led to \nmany of these problems, but much work remains to be done before the \nCoast Guard can regain the confidence of its overseers and the American \npublic. This bill authorizes nearly $1 billion for Coast Guard \nacquisitions programs, a large sum to be sure. But Senator Cantwell and \nI, and the rest of the Coast Guard's oversight subcommittee will \nclosely monitor developments with the program to ensure that the \nmistakes of Deepwater's past are not carried over into its future.\n  This bill also includes a provision to increase the Coast Guard's \nability to prosecute those engaged in illegal alien smuggling in the \nmaritime environment. Under current law and practice, individuals have \nto be seriously injured or die in a maritime migrant smuggling event \nbefore the smugglers are faced with meaningful legal penalties. This \nallows organized groups of experienced smugglers to operate with near \nimpunity, facilitating the entry of\n\n[[Page S10173]]\n\nthousands of illegal immigrants annually. The Maritime Alien Smuggling \nLaw Enforcement Act, contained within this bill would close this \nserious loophole at the frontline of our homeland security efforts.\n  The bill also contains provisions vital to navigation security, \nincluding a requirement that the Coast Guard continue to operate the \nLORAN-C navigation system. Though advances in Global Positioning System \ntechnology have allowed our mariners to receive accurate, timely \npositioning data, many seafarers, particularly in the northern \nlatitudes where GPS signals are less strong, still rely on LORAN \nsignals as a back-up to their more modern systems, or in some cases, as \na primary navigation aid.\n  The service men and women of the Coast Guard do yeoman's work in \nsupport of our homeland security and to ensure the safety of the \nmaritime domain, and this bill also contains provisions to help them in \nnumerous ways. Provisions ensure the Government is providing adequate \naccess to medical care for those stationed on remote islands; grants \nCoast Guard servicemen and women access to the armed forces retirement \nhomes; and authorizes funding for additional facilities to improve \ntheir quality of life.\n  In sum, this bill contains provisions too numerous to mention \nindividually that support the Coast Guard's missions and enhance its \nability to safeguard our homeland, our environment, and our maritime \noperations. I thank Senator Cantwell and the rest of my fellow co-\nsponsors for all their hard work on this bill, and I ask my colleagues \nin this body to join me in expressing support for the valiant men and \nwomen of the Coast Guard and this bill that will facilitate execution \nof their appointed missions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 1893. An original bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security \nAct to reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and \nfor other purposes; from the Committee on Finance; placed on the \ncalendar.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the following \nmaterial regarding today's introduction of S. 1893, the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, be included in \nthe Record, July 26, 2007 letter from the Congressional Budget Office; \nand Technical Summary of the Children's Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act of 2007.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2007.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) have prepared the \n     attached cost estimate for the Children's Health Insurance \n     Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, based on the legislative \n     language (ERN07632) that was provided by the Committee on \n     Finance on July 26, 2007.\n       CBO estimates that enacting this legislation would increase \n     federal direct spending by $35.2 billion over the 2008-2012 \n     period and by $71.0 billion over the 2008-2017 period. CBO \n     and JCT estimate that net revenues would increase under the \n     bill by $36.1 billion over the next five years and $72.8 \n     billion over the 10-year period. A portion of that increase \n     would be in off-budget revenues: $0.8 billion for the 2008-\n     2012 period and $1.1 billion over the 2008-2017 period. On \n     balance, the spending and revenue changes would reduce \n     federal on-budget deficits by $0.1 billion through 2012 and \n     $0.8 billion for the 2008-2017 period. The two attached \n     tables provide estimates of year-by-year changes and a \n     summary of the estimated change in enrollment of children \n     under the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) \n     and Medicaid.\n       Projected spending would exceed estimated on-budget revenue \n     increases beginning in fiscal year 2015. Pursuant to section \n     203 of S. Con. Res. 21, the Concurrent Resolution on the \n     Budget for Fiscal Year 2008, CBO estimates that the changes \n     in direct spending and revenues would cause an increase in \n     the on-budget deficit greater than $5 billion in at least one \n     of the 10-year periods between 2018 and 2057.\n       CBO has reviewed the non-tax provisions of the bill--titles \n     I through VI, excluding section 411, and title VII--for \n     mandates and determined that they contain no \n     intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded \n     Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The bill would affect the way \n     states administer SCHIP and Medicaid, but because of the \n     flexibility in those programs, the new requirements would not \n     be intergovernmental mandates as UMRA defines that term. In \n     general, state, local, and tribal governments would benefit \n     from the continuation of existing SCHIP grants, the creation \n     of new grant programs, and broader flexibility and options in \n     some programs.\n       According to JCT, the tax provisions of the bill contain no \n     intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA. JCT has \n     determined that the tax provisions of the bill contain a \n     private-sector mandate, as defined in UMRA, by increasing the \n     excise tax rate on cigarettes and other tobacco products. The \n     costs of that mandate would be similar to the estimated \n     budget effects of the provision (as shown in the attached \n     table), and thus would significantly exceed the threshold \n     established in UMRA for private-sector mandates in each year \n     (the threshold is $131 million in 2007, and is adjusted \n     annually for inflation).\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Eric \n     Rollins and Jeanne De Sa.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter R. Orszag,\n                                                         Director.\n\n          CBO'S ESTIMATE OF THE EFFECTS ON DIRECT SPENDING AND REVENUES OF THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007\n                       [Based on the legislative language ERN07632, provided by the Senate Committee on Finance on July 26, 2007]\n  Figures are outlays, by fiscal year, in billions of dollars.

Allotments for the 50 States and the District of Columbia\n\n     Current Law\n       The annual SCHIP appropriation available to states, \n     including the District of Columbia, is the amount of the \n     total appropriation remaining after amounts set aside for the \n     territories and, for FY1998 to FY2002, the special diabetes \n     grants. Each state's share, or percentage, of the available \n     appropriation is determined by a formula using the state's \n     ``number of children,'' as adjusted for geographic variation \n     in health costs and subject to certain floors and a ceiling.\n       Beginning with the FY2001 SCHIP allotment, the ``number of \n     children'' is equal to (1) 50 percent of the number of \n     children in the state who are low income (with ``low income'' \n     defined as having family income below 200% of the federal \n     poverty threshold), plus (2) 50 percent of the number of \n     uninsured low-income children in the state. The source of \n     data is the average of the number of such children, as \n     reported and defined in the three most recent Annual Social \n     and Economic (ASEC) Supplements (formerly known as the March \n     supplements) to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey \n     (CPS) before the beginning of the calendar year in which the \n     applicable fiscal year begins. For example, in determining \n     the FY2007 allotments, the three most recent supplements \n     available before January 1, 2006, were used. Thus, states' \n     FY2007 allotments were based on the ``number of children'' \n     using data that covered calendar years 2002, 2003 and 2004.\n       The adjustment for geographic variations in health costs is \n     85% of each state's variation from the national average in \n     its average wages in the health services industry. The source \n     of data is the average wages from mandatory reports filed \n     quarterly by every employer on their unemployment insurance \n     contributions and provided to the Department of Labor's \n     Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). A three-year average of \n     these data is also required in the statute.\n       Each state's ``number of children,'' as adjusted for \n     geographic variation in health costs, is calculated as a \n     percentage of the national total. This is the state's \n     preliminary proportion of the available SCHIP appropriation, \n     against which the floors and ceiling are compared.\n       Since the beginning of SCHIP, no state's share of the \n     available appropriation could result in an allotment of less \n     than $2 million. No state has ever been affected by this \n     floor. Beginning with the FY2000 allotment, two additional \n     floors also applied: (1) no state's share could be less than \n     90% of last year's share, and (2) no state's share could be \n     less than 70% of its FY1999 share. (Each state's FY1999 share \n     was identical to its FY1998 share, per P.L. 105-277.)\n       A ceiling has also applied beginning with the FY2000 \n     allotment: No state's share can exceed 145% of its FY1999 \n     share.\n       Once the floors and ceiling are applied to affected states \n     to produce their adjusted proportion, the other states' \n     shares are adjusted proportionally to use exactly 100% of the \n     available appropriation. Each state's adjusted proportion \n     multiplied by the appropriation available to states for a \n     fiscal year results in each state's federal SCHIP allotment \n     for that fiscal year.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The annual CHIP funds available to states, including the \n     District of Columbia--that is, the available national \n     allotment--is the amount of the total appropriation remaining \n     after amounts allotted to the territories.\n       For FY2008, a state's allotment is calculated as 110% of \n     the greatest of the following four amounts: (1) the state's \n     FY2007 federal CHIP spending multiplied by the annual \n     adjustment; (2) the state's FY2007 federal CHIP allotment \n     multiplied by the annual adjustment; (3) for states that were \n     determined in FY2007 to have exhausted their own federal CHIP \n     allotments (and therefore designated a shortfall state for \n     FY2007), the state's FY2007 projected spending as of November \n     2006 (or as of May 2006, for a state whose May 2006 \n     projection was $95 million to $96 million higher than its \n     November 2006 projection) multiplied by the annual \n     adjustment; and (4) the state's FY2008 federal CHIP projected \n     spending as of August 2007 and certified by the state to the \n     Secretary not later than September 30, 2007.\n       The annual adjustment for health care cost growth and child \n     population growth is the product of (1) 1 plus the percentage \n     increase (if any) in the projected per capita spending in the \n     National Health Expenditures for the fiscal year over the \n     prior fiscal year, and (2) 1.01 plus the percentage increase \n     in the child population (under age 19) in each state as of \n     July 1 of the fiscal year over the prior fiscal year's, \n     based on the most timely and accurate published estimates \n     from the Census Bureau.\n       For FY2009 to FY2012, a state's allotment is calculated as \n     110% of its projected spending for that year, as submitted to \n     CMS no later than August 31 of the preceding fiscal year.\n\n[[Page S10175]]\n\n       For FY2008, if the state allotments as calculated exceed \n     the available national allotment, the allotments are reduced \n     proportionally. For FY2009 to FY2012, if the state allotments \n     as calculated exceed the available national allotment, then \n     the available national allotment is distributed to each state \n     according to its percentage calculated as the sum of the \n     following four factors:\n       Each state's projected federal CHIP expenditures for that \n     fiscal year (as certified by the state to the Secretary no \n     later than the August 31 of the preceding fiscal year), \n     calculated as a percentage of the national total, multiplied \n     by 75%;\n       Each state's number of low-income children (based on the \n     most timely and accurate published estimates from the Census \n     Bureau), calculated as a percentage of the national total, \n     multiplied by 12\\1/2\\%;\n       Each state's projected federal CHIP expenditures for the \n     preceding fiscal year (as certified by the state to the \n     Secretary in November of the fiscal year), calculated as a \n     percentage of the national total, multiplied by 7\\1/2\\%; and\n       Each state's actual federal CHIP expenditures for the \n     second preceding fiscal year, as determined by the Secretary, \n     calculated as a percentage of the national total, multiplied \n     by 5%.\n       If a state's projected CHIP expenditures for FY2009 to \n     FY2012 are at least 10% more than the last year's allotment \n     (excluding any reduction in states' allotments due to \n     insufficient available national allotment) then, unless the \n     state received approval in the prior year of a state plan \n     amendment or waiver to expand CHIP coverage or the state \n     received a payment from the CHIP Contingency Fund, the state \n     must submit to the Secretary by August 31 before the fiscal \n     year information relating to the factors that contributed to \n     the need for the increase in the state's allotment, as well \n     as any other information that the Secretary may require for \n     the state to demonstrate the need for the increase in the \n     state's allotment. The Secretary shall notify the state in \n     writing within 60 days after receipt of the information that \n     (1) the projected expenditures are approved or disapproved \n     (and if disapproved, the reasons for disapproval); or (2) \n     specified additional information is needed. If the Secretary \n     disapproved the projected expenditures or determined \n     additional information is needed, the Secretary shall provide \n     the state with a reasonable opportunity to submit additional \n     information to demonstrate the need for the increase in the \n     State's allotment for the fiscal year. If a determination has \n     not determined by September 30 whether the state has \n     demonstrated the need for the increase in its allotment, the \n     Secretary shall provide the state with a provisional \n     allotment for the fiscal year equal to 110% of last year's \n     allotment (excluding any reduction in states' allotments due \n     to insufficient available national allotment). Once the \n     Secretary makes a determination, the Secretary may adjust the \n     state's allotment (and the allotments of other states) \n     accordingly, but not later than November 30 of the fiscal \n     year.\n       For FY2008 allotment factors based on CHIP expenditures, \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall use \n     the most recent FY2007 expenditure data available to the \n     Secretary before the start of FY2008. The Secretary may \n     adjust the FY2008 allotments based on the actual expenditure \n     data reported to CMS no later than November 30, 2007; the \n     Secretary may not make adjustments after December 31, 2007.\n       For purposes of determining a state's allotment, the \n     state's projected expenditures shall include payments \n     projected using Sec. 2105(g) (discussed in Section 110) and \n     for certain CHIP-enrolled parents and childless adults \n     (discussed in Section 105).\n\n\n             Section 103. One-Time Appropriation for FY2012\n\n     Current Law\n       No provision.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       In FY 2012, a one-time appropriation of $12,500,000,000 \n     shall be made to the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     to add to the funds already provided under section 2104(a) \n     for that year only. Such funds shall be distributed by the \n     Secretary in a manner consistent with and under the same \n     terms and conditions of section 102 of this Act.\n\n\n   Section 104. Improving funding for the territories under CHIP and \n                                Medicaid\n\n     Current Law\n       The territories were to receive 0.25 percent of the total \n     appropriations provided in Sec. 2104(a). Later legislation \n     added specific appropriations for the territories in FY1999 \n     to FY2007:\n       $32,000,000 in FY 1999;\n       $34,200,000 in FY 2000;\n       $34,200,000 in FY 2001;\n       $25,200,000 in FY 2002;\n       $25,200,000 in FY 2003;\n       $25,200,000 in FY 2004;\n       $32,400,000 in FY 2005;\n       $32,400,000 in FY 2006; and\n       $40,000,000 in FY 2007.\n       For FY 1999, the $32 million represented approximately 0.75 \n     percent of the total appropriations in Sec. 2104(a). For \n     FY2000 to FY2007, the additional appropriation equaled 0.8 \n     percent of the total appropriations in Sec. 2104(a). Combined \n     with the 0.25 percent available through the original enacting \n     legislation, the territories were allotted 1.05% of the total \n     appropriations in Sec. 2104(a) from FY2000 to FY2007.\n       The amounts set aside for the territories were distributed \n     according to the following percentages provided in statute: \n     Puerto Rico, 91.6 percent; Guam, 3.5 percent; the Virgin \n     Islands, 2.6 percent; American Samoa, 1.2 percent; and the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, 1.1 percent.\n       Medicaid (and SCHIP) programs in the territories are \n     subject to spending caps specified in statute. The federal \n     Medicaid matching rate, which determines the share if \n     Medicaid expenditures paid for by the federal government, is \n     statutorily set at 50 percent of the territories. Therefore, \n     the federal government pays 50% of the cost of Medicaid items \n     and services in the territories up to the spending caps. For \n     the 50 states and DC, certain administrative functions have a \n     higher federal match. For example, startup expenses for \n     specified computer systems are matched at 90%, and there is a \n     100% match for the implementation and operation of \n     immigration status verification systems.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       From the national CHIP appropriation, the allotments to the \n     territories are calculated as follows. For FY2008, each \n     territory's allotment is its highest annual federal CHIP \n     spending between FY1998 and FY2007, plus the annual \n     adjustment for health care cost growth and national child \n     population growth. FY2007 spending will be determined by the \n     Secretary based on the most timely and accurate published \n     estimates of the Census Bureau. For FY2009 through FY2012, \n     each territory's allotment is the prior year's allotment, \n     plus the annual adjustment for health care cost growth and \n     national child population growth.\n       For FY2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, federal \n     matching payments for specified data reporting systems (i.e., \n     the design, development, and operations of claims processing \n     systems and citizenship documentation data systems in each of \n     Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana \n     Islands, and American Samoa would be subject to the 90% \n     federal match rate for the start-up expenses associated with \n     such systems and the 75% federal match rate for the operation \n     of such systems without regard to the specified spending \n     caps.\n       The provision would require the Government Accountability \n     Office (GAO) to submit a report to the appropriate committees \n     of Congress not later than September 30, 2009, with regard to \n     the territories' eligible Medicaid and CHIP populations, \n     their historical and projected spending and the ability of \n     capped funding streams to address such needs, the extent to \n     which the federal poverty level is used for determining \n     Medicaid and CHIP eligibility in the territories, and the \n     extent to which the territories participate in data \n     collection and reporting with regard to Medicaid and CHIP \n     and specifically the extent to which they participate in \n     the Current Population Survey versus the American \n     Community Survey, which are federal surveys that estimate \n     the number of low-income children in the states. The \n     report is also to provide recommendations for improving \n     Medicaid and CHIP funding to the territories.\n\n\n               Section 105. Incentive bonuses for states\n\n     Current Law\n       No provision.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       Incentive Pool\n       A CHIP Incentive Bonuses Pool is established in the U.S. \n     Treasury. The Incentive Pool receives deposits from an \n     initial appropriation in FY2008 of $3 billion, along with \n     transfers from six different potential sources, with the \n     currently available but not immediately required funds \n     invested in interest-bearing U.S. securities that provide \n     additional income into the Incentive Pool. The six sources \n     for deposits are as follows:\n       On December 1, 2007, the amount by which states' FY2006 and \n     FY2007 allotments not expended by September 30, 2007, exceed \n     50% of the federal share of the FY2008 allotment, as \n     determined by the Secretary by not later than October 1, \n     2007;\n       On each December 1 from 2008 to 2012, any of the annual \n     CHIP appropriation not used by the states;\n       On October 1 of fiscal years 2009 to 2012, the amount by \n     which the unspent funds from the prior year's allotment \n     exceeds the applicable percentage of that allotment. The \n     applicable percentage is 20% for FY2009, and 10% for FY2010, \n     FY2011, and FY2012;\n       Any original allotment amounts not expended by the end of \n     their second year of availability;\n       On October 1, 2009, any amounts set aside for transition \n     off of CHIP coverage for childless adults that are not \n     expended by September 30, 2009; and\n       On October 1 of FY2009 through FY2012, any amounts in the \n     CHIP Contingency Fund in excess of the fund's aggregate cap, \n     as well as any Contingency Fund payments provided to a state \n     that are unspent at the end of the fiscal year following the \n     one in which the funds were provided.\n       Funds from the Incentive Pool are payable in FY2008 to \n     FY2012 to states that have increased their Medicaid and CHIP \n     enrollment among low-income children above a defined \n     baseline, with associated payments as follows (reduced \n     proportionally if necessary). (For purposes of Incentive Pool \n     policies, a ``child'' enrolled in Medicaid means an \n     individual under age 19--or age 20 or 21, if a state has so \n     elected under its Medicaid plan; and ``low-income children'' \n     means children in\n\n[[Page S10176]]\n\n     families with incomes at 200% of federal poverty or below.) \n     Beginning in FY2009, a state may receive a payment from the \n     Incentive Pool if its average monthly enrollment of low-\n     income children in CHIP and Medicaid for the coverage period \n     (which is defined as the last two quarters of the preceding \n     fiscal year and the first two quarters of the fiscal year, \n     except that for FY2009 it is based only on the first two \n     quarters of FY2009) exceeds the baseline monthly average.\n       For FY2009, the baseline monthly average is each state's \n     average monthly enrollment in the first two quarters of \n     FY2007 enrollment (as determined over a 6-month period on the \n     basis of the most recent information reported through the \n     Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) multiplied by \n     the sum of 1.02 and the percentage increase in the population \n     of low-income children in the state from FY2007 to FY2009, as \n     determined by the Secretary based on the most recent \n     published estimates from the Census Bureau before the \n     beginning of FY2009. For FY2010 onward, the baseline monthly \n     average is the prior year's baseline monthly average \n     multiplied by the sum of 1.01 and the percentage increase in \n     the population of low-income children in the state over the \n     preceding fiscal year, as determined by the Secretary based \n     on the most recent published estimates from the Census Bureau \n     before the beginning of the fiscal year.\n       A state eligible for a bonus shall receive in the last \n     quarter of the fiscal year the following amount, depending on \n     the ``excess'' of the state's enrollment above the baseline \n     monthly average: (i) If such excess with respect to the \n     number of individuals who are enrolled in the State plan \n     under title XIX does not exceed 2 percent, the product of $75 \n     and the number of such individuals included in such excess; \n     (ii) if such excess with respect to the number of individuals \n     who are enrolled in the State plan under title XIX exceeds 2 \n     percent, but does not exceed 5 percent, the product of $300 \n     and the number of such individuals included in such excess; \n     and (iii) if such excess with respect to the number of \n     individuals who are enrolled in the State plan under title \n     XIX exceeds 5 percent, the product of $625 and the number of \n     such individuals included in such excess. For FY2010 onward, \n     these dollar amounts are to be increased by the percentage \n     increase (if any) in the projected per capita spending in the \n     National Health Expenditures for the calendar year beginning \n     on January 1 of the coverage period over that of the \n     preceding coverage period.\n  Payments from the Incentive Pool shall be used for any purpose that \nthe State determines is likely to reduce the percentage of low-income \nchildren in the State without health insurance.\n       Redistribution of FY2005 Allotments\n       An appropriation of $5,000,000 is provided to the Secretary \n     for FY2008 for improving the timeliness of MSIS and to \n     provide guidance to states with respect to any new reporting \n     requirements related to such improvements. Amounts \n     appropriated are available until expended. The resulting \n     improvements are to be designed and implemented so that \n     beginning no later than October 1, 2008, Medicaid and CHIP \n     enrollment data are collected and analyzed by the Secretary \n     within six months of submission.\n       FY2005 original CHIP allotments unspent at the end of \n     FY2007 are to be redistributed on a proportional basis to \n     states that were projected at any point in FY2007 to exhaust \n     their federal CHIP allotments.\n\n\n  Section 106. Phase-out of coverage for nonpregnant childless adults \n             under CHIP, conditions for coverage of parents\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1115 of the Social Security Act gives the Secretary \n     of HHS broad authority to modify virtually all aspects of the \n     Medicaid and SCHIP programs. Under Section 1115, the \n     Secretary may waive requirements in Section 1902 (usually, \n     freedom of choice of provider, comparability, and \n     statewideness). For SCHIP, no specific sections or \n     requirements are cited as ``waive-able.'' SCHIP statute \n     simply states that Section 1115, pertaining to research and \n     demonstration projects, applies to SCHIP. States may obtain \n     waivers that allow them to provide services to individuals \n     not traditionally eligible for SCHIP, or limit benefit \n     packages for certain groups as long as the Secretary \n     determines that these programs further the goals of SCHIP.\n       Approved SCHIP Section 1115 waivers are deemed to be part \n     of a state's SCHIP state plan for purposes of federal \n     reimbursement. Costs associated with waiver programs are \n     subject to each state's enhanced-FMAP. Under SCHIP Section \n     1115 waivers, states must meet an ``allotment neutrality \n     test'' where combined federal expenditures for the state's \n     regular SCHIP program and for the state's SCHIP demonstration \n     program are capped at the state's individual SCHIP allotment. \n     This policy limits federal spending to the capped allotment \n     levels.\n       Under current law, including 1115 waiver authority, states \n     cover pregnant women, parents of Medicaid and SCHIP eligible \n     children and childless adults in their SCHIP programs.\n       The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 prohibited the approval \n     of new demonstration programs that allow federal SCHIP funds \n     to be used to provide coverage to nonpregnant childless \n     adults, but allowed for the continuation and renewal of such \n     existing Medicaid or SCHIP waiver projects affecting federal \n     SCHIP funds that were approved under the Section 1115 waiver \n     authority before February 8, 2006.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       Childless Adults\n       The provision would prohibit the approval or renewal of \n     Section 1115 demonstration waivers that allow federal CHIP \n     funds to be used to provide coverage to nonpregnant childless \n     adults (hereafter referred to as applicable existing waivers) \n     on or after the date of enactment of this Act. Beginning on \n     or after October 1, 2008, rules regarding the period to which \n     an applicable existing waiver would apply, individuals \n     eligible for coverage under such waivers, and the amount of \n     federal payment available for such coverage would be subject \n     to the following requirements: (1) no federal CHIP funds \n     would be available for coverage of nonpregnant childless \n     adults under an applicable existing waiver after September \n     30, 2008, (2) State-requested extensions of applicable \n     existing waivers that would otherwise expire before October \n     1, 2008, would be granted by the Secretary but only through \n     September 30, 2008, and (3) coverage to a nonpregnant \n     childless adult under applicable existing waivers provided \n     during FY2008 will be reimbursed at the CHIP enhanced FMAP \n     rate.\n       States with applicable existing waivers (that are otherwise \n     terminated under this provision) would be permitted to extend \n     coverage, through FY2009, to individual nonpregnant childless \n     adults who received coverage under the applicable existing \n     waiver at any time during FY2008 (regardless of whether the \n     individual lost coverage at any time during FY2008 and was \n     later provided benefit coverage under the waiver in that \n     fiscal year) subject to the following restrictions: (1) for \n     each such State, the Secretary would be required to set aside \n     an amount as part of a separate allotment equal to the \n     federal share of the State's projected FY2008 expenditures \n     (as certified by the state and submitted to the Secretary by \n     August 31, 2008) for providing coverage under the waiver to \n     such individuals in FY2008 increased by the annual adjustment \n     for per capita health care growth (described in Section 102 \n     of this bill), (2) the Secretary may adjust the set aside \n     amount based on State-reported FY2008 expenditure data \n     (reported on CMS Form 64 or CMS Form 21 not later than \n     November 30, 2008), but in no case shall the Secretary adjust \n     such amount after December 31, 2008, and (3) the Secretary \n     would pay an amount equal to the federal Medicaid matching \n     rate for expenditures related to such coverage (provided \n     during FY2009) up to the set-aside spending cap.\n       States with existing CHIP waivers to extend coverage to \n     nonpregnant childless adults (that are otherwise terminated \n     under this provision) would be permitted to submit a request \n     to CMS (not later than June 30, 2009) for a Medicaid \n     nonpregnant childless adult waiver. For such states, the \n     Secretary would be required to make a decision to deny or \n     approve such application within 90 days of the date of \n     submission. For such states, if no CMS decision to approve or \n     deny such request has been made as of September 30, 2009, the \n     provision would allow such application to be deemed approved.\n       States with applicable existing waivers that request a \n     Medicaid nonpregnant childless adult waiver under this \n     provision would be required to meet the following ``budget \n     neutrality'' requirements. For fiscal year 2010, allowable \n     waiver expenditures for such populations would not be \n     permitted to exceed the total amount payments made to the \n     State (as specified above) for FY2009, increased by the \n     percentage increase (if any) in the projected per capita \n     spending in the National Health Expenditures for fiscal year \n     2010 over fiscal year 2009). In the case of any succeeding \n     fiscal year, allowable waiver expenditures for such \n     populations would not be permitted to exceed each such \n     State's set aside amount (described above) for the preceding \n     fiscal year, increased by the percentage increase (if any) in \n     the projected per capita spending in the National Health \n     Expenditures for such fiscal year over the prior fiscal year.\n       Parents\n       The provision would also prohibit the approval of \n     additional Section 1115 demonstration waivers that allow \n     federal CHIP funds to be used to provide coverage to \n     parent(s) of a targeted low-income child(ren) (hereafter \n     referred to as applicable existing CHIP parent coverage \n     waiver) on or after the date of enactment of this Act. \n     Beginning on or after October 1, 2009, rules regarding the \n     period to which an applicable existing CHIP parent coverage \n     waiver extends coverage to eligible populations, and the \n     amount of federal payment available for coverage to such \n     populations under the waiver would be subject to the \n     following requirements: (1) State-requested extensions of \n     applicable existing CHIP-financed Section 1115 parent \n     coverage waivers that would otherwise expire before October \n     1, 2009, would be granted by the Secretary but only through \n     September 30, 2009, and (2) the CHIP enhanced FMAP rate would \n     apply for such coverage to such eligible populations during \n     FY2008 and FY2009.\n       States with existing CHIP waivers to extend coverage to \n     parent(s) of targeted low-income child(ren) would be \n     permitted to continue such assistance during each of fiscal\n\n[[Page S10177]]\n\n     years 2010, 2011, and 2012 subject to the following \n     requirements: (1) for each such State and for each such \n     fiscal year, the Secretary would be required to set aside an \n     amount as part of a separate allotment equal to the federal \n     share of 110% of the State's projected expenditures (as \n     certified by the state and submitted to the Secretary by \n     August 31 of the preceding fiscal year) for providing waiver \n     coverage to such individuals enrolled in the waiver in the \n     applicable fiscal year, and (2) the Secretary would pay the \n     State from the set aside amount (specified above) for each \n     such fiscal year an amount equal to the applicable percentage \n     for expenditures in the quarter to provide coverage as \n     specified under the waiver to parent(s) of targeted low-\n     income child(ren).\n       In fiscal year 2010 only, costs associated with such parent \n     coverage would be subject to each such state's CHIP enhanced \n     FMAP for States that meet one of the outreach or coverage \n     benchmarks (listed below) in FY2009, or each such state's \n     Medicaid FMAP rate for all other states. The provision would \n     prohibit federal matching payments for the payment of \n     services beyond the set-aside spending cap.\n       For fiscal year 2011 or 2012, costs associated with such \n     parent coverage would be subject to: (1) each such state's \n     Reduced Enhanced Matching Assistance Percentage (REMAP) \n     (i.e., a percentage which would be equal to the sum of (a) \n     each such state's FMAP percentage and (b) the number of \n     percentage points equal to one-half of the difference between \n     each such state's FMAP rate and each such state's enhanced \n     FMAP rate) if the state meets one of the coverage benchmarks \n     (listed below) for FY2010 or FY2011 (as applicable), or (2) \n     each such state's FMAP rate if the state failed to meet any \n     of the coverage benchmarks (listed below) for the applicable \n     fiscal year. The provision would prohibit federal matching \n     payments for the payment of services beyond the setaside \n     spending cap.\n       FY2010 outreach and coverage benchmarks include: (1) the \n     state implemented a significant child outreach campaign \n     including (a) the state was awarded an outreach and \n     enrollment grant (under Section 201 of this bill) for fiscal \n     year 2009, (b) the state implemented 1 or more process \n     measures for that fiscal year, or (c) the state has submitted \n     a specific plan for outreach for such fiscal year, (2) the \n     state ranks in the lowest 1/3 of the States in terms of the \n     State's percentage of low-income children without health \n     insurance based on timely and accurate published estimates of \n     the Bureau of the Census, or (3) the State qualified for a \n     payment from the Incentive Fund for the most recent coverage \n     period.\n       FY2011 and 2012 coverage benchmarks include: (1) the state \n     ranks in the lowest \\1/3\\ of the States in terms of the \n     State's percentage of low-income children without health \n     insurance based on timely and accurate published estimates of \n     the Bureau of the Census, and (2) the State qualified for a \n     payment from the Incentive Fund for the most recent coverage \n     period.\n       A rule of construction clarifies that states are not \n     prohibited from submitting applications for 1115 waivers to \n     provide medical assistance to a parent of a targeted low-\n     income child.\n       The General Accountability Office would be required to \n     conduct a study to determine if the coverage of a parent, \n     caretaker relative, or legal guardian of a targeted low-\n     income child increases the enrollment of or quality of care \n     for children, and if such parents, relatives, and legal \n     guardians are more likely to enroll their children in CHIP or \n     Medicaid. Results of the study (and report recommended \n     changes) would be reported to appropriate committees of \n     Congress 2 years after the date of enactment.\n\n\nSection 107. State option to cover low-income pregnant women under CHIP \n                     through a State plan amendment\n\n     Current Law\n       Under SCHIP, states can cover pregnant women ages 19 and \n     older in one of two ways: (1) via a special waiver of program \n     rules (through Section 1115 authority), or (2) by providing \n     coverage as permitted through regulation. In the latter case, \n     coverage includes prenatal and delivery services only.\n       In general, SCHIP allows states to cover targeted low-\n     income children with family income that is above applicable \n     Medicaid eligibility levels in a given state. States can set \n     the upper income level up to 200% FPL, or if the applicable \n     Medicaid income level was at or above 200% FPL before SCHIP, \n     the upper income limit may be raised an additional 50 \n     percentage points above that level. Other SCHIP eligibility \n     restrictions include (1) the child must be uninsured, (2) the \n     child must be otherwise ineligible for regular Medicaid, and \n     (3) the child cannot be an inmate of a public institution \n     or a patient in an institution for mental disease, or \n     eligible for coverage under a state employee health plan. \n     States may provide SCHIP coverage to children who are \n     covered under a health insurance program that has been in \n     operation since before July 1, 1997 and that is offered by \n     a state that receives no federal funds for this program. \n     States may use enrollment restrictions such as capping \n     total program enrollment, creating waiting lists, and \n     instituting a minimum period of no insurance (e.g., 6 \n     months) before being eligible.\n       Under regular Medicaid, states must provide coverage for \n     pregnant women with income up to 133% FPL, and at state \n     option, may extend such coverage to pregnant women with \n     income up to 185% FPL. States must also provide coverage to \n     first-time pregnant women with income that meets former cash \n     assistance program rules (which were generally well below \n     100% FPL). The period of coverage for these mandatory and \n     optional pregnant women is during pregnancy through the end \n     of the month in which the 60 days postpartum period ends. In \n     addition, waiver authority may be used to cover pregnant \n     women at even higher income levels and for extended periods \n     of time (e.g., 18 or 24 months postpartum).\n       Under regular Medicaid, states may temporarily enroll \n     pregnant women whose family income appears to be below \n     Medicaid income standards for up to 2 months until a final \n     formal determination of eligibility is made. Entities that \n     may qualify to make such presumptive eligibility \n     determinations for pregnant women include Medicaid providers \n     that are outpatient hospital departments, rural health \n     clinics and certain other clinics, and other entities \n     including certain primary care health centers and rural \n     health care programs funded under Sections 330 and 330A of \n     the Public Health Service Act, grantees under the Maternal \n     and Child Health Block Grant Program, entities receiving \n     funds under the Health Services for Urban Indians program, \n     and entities that participate in WIC, the Commodity \n     Supplemental Food Program, a state perinatal program (as \n     designated by the state), or in the Indian Health Service or \n     a health program or facility operated by tribes or tribal \n     organizations under the Indian Self Determination Act.\n       Mandatory Medicaid eligibility applies to children under \n     age 6 in families with income at or below 133% FPL. In \n     addition, states may cover newborns under age 1 up to 185% \n     FPL under Medicaid. Children born to Medicaid-eligible \n     pregnant women must be deemed to be eligible for Medicaid \n     from the date of birth up to age 1 so long as the child is a \n     member of the mother's household, and the mother remains \n     eligible for Medicaid (or would remain eligible if pregnant). \n     During this period of deemed eligibility for the newborn, for \n     claiming and payment purposes, the Medicaid identification \n     (ID) number of the mother must also be used for the newborn, \n     unless the state issues a separate ID number for the child \n     during this period. In general, newborns may also be enrolled \n     in SCHIP if they meet the applicable financial standards in a \n     given state, which build on top of Medicaid's rules.\n       For families with income below 150% FPL, premiums cannot \n     exceed nominal amounts specified in Medicaid regulations, and \n     service-related cost-sharing is limited to nominal Medicaid \n     amounts for the subgroup under 100% FPL and slightly higher \n     amounts in SCHIP regulations for the subgroup with income \n     between 100-150% FPL.\n       For families with income above 150% FPL, premiums and cost-\n     sharing may be imposed in any amount as long as such costs \n     for higher-income children are not less than the costs for \n     lower-income children. Total premiums and cost-sharing \n     incurred by all SCHIP children cannot exceed 5% of annual \n     family income.\n       Other cost-sharing protections also apply. Applicable \n     premium and cost-sharing amounts cannot favor children from \n     families with higher income over children in families with \n     lower income. No cost-sharing may be applied to preventive \n     services.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would allow states to provide optional \n     coverage under CHIP to pregnant women, through a state plan \n     amendment, if certain conditions are met, including (1) the \n     state has established an income eligibility level of at least \n     185% FPL for mandatory, welfare-related qualified pregnant \n     women and optional poverty-related pregnant women under \n     Medicaid, (2) the state does not apply an effective income \n     level under the state plan amendment for pregnant women that \n     is lower than the effective income level (expressed as a \n     percent of poverty and accounting for applicable income \n     disregards) for mandatory, welfare-related qualified pregnant \n     women and optional poverty-related pregnant women under \n     Medicaid on the date of enactment of this provision to be \n     eligible for Medicaid as pregnant women, (3) the state does \n     not provide coverage for pregnant women with higher family \n     income without covering such pregnant women with a lower \n     family income, (4) the state provides pregnancy-related \n     assistance (defined below) for targeted low-income pregnant \n     women in the same manner, and subject to the same \n     requirements, as the state provides child health assistance \n     for targeted low-income children under the state CHIP plan, \n     and in addition to providing child health assistance for such \n     women, (5) the state does not apply any exclusion of benefits \n     for pregnancy-related assistance based on any pre-existing \n     condition or any waiting period (including waiting periods to \n     ensure that CHIP does not substitute for private insurance \n     coverage), and (6) the state must provide the same cost-\n     sharing protections to pregnant women as applied to CHIP \n     children, and all cost-sharing incurred by targeted low-\n     income pregnant women under CHIP would be capped at 5% of \n     annual family income.\n       States that elect this new optional coverage for pregnant \n     women under CHIP and that meet all the above conditions \n     associated with this option, may also elect to provide \n     presumptive eligibility for pregnant women, as defined in the \n     Medicaid statute, to targeted low-income pregnant women under \n     CHIP.\n\n[[Page S10178]]\n\n       Pregnancy-related assistance would include all the services \n     covered as child health assistance under the state's CHIP \n     program, and includes medical assistance that would be \n     provided to a pregnant woman under Medicaid, during pregnancy \n     through the end of the month in which the 60 day postpartum \n     period ends. The upper income limit for coverage of targeted \n     low-income pregnant women under CHIP could be up to the level \n     for coverage of targeted low-income children in the state. As \n     with targeted low-income children under CHIP, the new group \n     of targeted low-income pregnant women must be determined \n     eligible, be uninsured, and must not be an inmate of a public \n     institution or a patient in an institution for mental disease \n     or eligible for coverage under a state employee health \n     benefit plan. Also as with targeted low-income children, \n     pregnant women may include those covered under a health \n     insurance program that has been in operation since before \n     July 1, 1997 and that is offered by a state that receives no \n     federal funds for this program.\n       The provision would also deem children born to the new \n     group of targeted low-income pregnant women under CHIP to be \n     eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, as applicable.\n       Such newborns would be covered from birth to age 1. During \n     this period of eligibility, the mother's identification \n     number must also be used for filing claims for the newborn, \n     unless the state issues a separate identification number for \n     that newborn.\n       The provision would also address States that provide \n     assistance through other options. The option to provide \n     assistance in accordance with the preceding subsections of \n     this section shall not limit any other option for a State to \n     provide (A) child health assistance through the application \n     of sections 457.10, 457.350(b)(2), 457.622(c)(5), and \n     457.626(a)(3) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, or \n     (B) pregnancy-related services through the application of any \n     other waiver authority (as in effect on June 1, 2007).\n       Any State that provides child health assistance under any \n     authority described in paragraph (1) may continue to provide \n     such assistance, as well as postpartum services, through the \n     end of the month in which the 60-day period (beginning on the \n     last day of the pregnancy) ends, in the same manner as \n     assistance and postpartum services would be provided if \n     provided under the State plan under title XIX, but only if \n     the mother would otherwise satisfy the eligibility \n     requirements that apply under the State child health plan \n     (other than with respect to age) during such period.\n       A rule of construction clarifies that nothing in this \n     subsection shall be construed to (A) infer the congressional \n     intent regarding the legality or illegality of the content of \n     sections of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, specified \n     in paragraph (l)(A), or (B) modify the authority to provide \n     pregnancy-related services under a waiver specified in \n     paragraph (l)(B).\n       For the new group of targeted low-income pregnant women, \n     additional conforming amendments would prohibit cost-sharing \n     for pregnancy-related services and waiting periods prior to \n     enrollment or for the purpose of preventing crowd-out of \n     private health insurance.\n\n\n                   Section 108. CHIP contingency fund\n\n     Current Law\n       No provision.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       A CHIP Contingency Fund is established in the U.S. \n     Treasury. The Contingency Fund receives deposits through a \n     separate appropriation. For FY2009, the appropriation to the \n     Fund is equal to 12.5% of the available national allotment \n     for CHIP. For FY2010 through FY2012, the appropriation is \n     such sums as are necessary for making payments to eligible \n     states for the fiscal year, as long as the annual payments do \n     not exceed 12.5% of that fiscal year's available national \n     allotment for CHIP. Balances that are not immediately \n     required for payments from the Fund are to be invested in \n     U.S. securities that provide addition income to the Fund, as \n     long as the annual payments do not cause the Fund to exceed \n     12.5% of the available national allotment for CHIP. Amounts \n     in excess of the 12.5% limit shall be deposited into the \n     Incentive Pool. For purposes of the CHIP Contingency Fund, \n     amounts set aside for block grant payments for transitional \n     coverage of childless adults shall not count as part of the \n     available national allotment.\n       Payments from the Fund are to be used only to eliminate any \n     eligible state's shortfall (that is, the amount by which a \n     state's available federal CHIP allotments are not adequate to \n     cover the state's federal CHIP expenditures, on the basis of \n     the most recent data available to the Secretary or requested \n     from the state by the Secretary).\n       The Secretary shall separately compute the shortfalls \n     attributable to children and pregnant women, to childless \n     adults, and to parents of low-income children. No payment \n     from the Contingency Fund shall be made for nonpregnant \n     childless adults. Any payments for shortfalls attributable to \n     parents shall be made from the Fund at the relevant matching \n     rate. Contingency funds are not transferable among \n     allotments.\n       Eligible states, which cannot be a territory, for a month \n     in FY2009 to FY2012 are those that meet any of the following \n     criteria:\n       The state's available federal CHIP allotments are at least \n     95% but less than 100% of its projected federal CHIP \n     expenditures for the fiscal year (i.e., less than 5% \n     shortfall in federal funds), without regard to any payments \n     provided from the Incentive Fund; or\n       The state's available federal CHIP allotments are less than \n     95% of its projected federal CHIP expenditures for the fiscal \n     year (i.e., more than 5% shortfall in federal funds) and that \n     such shortfall is attributable to one or more of the \n     following: (1) One or more parishes or counties has been \n     declared a major disaster and the President has determined \n     individual and public assistance has been warranted from the \n     federal government pursuant to the Stafford Act, or a public \n     health emergency was declared by the Secretary pursuant to \n     the Public Health Service Act; (2) the state unemployment \n     rate is at least 5.5% during any 13 consecutive week period \n     during the fiscal year and such rate is at least 120% of the \n     state unemployment rate for the same period as averaged over \n     the last three fiscal years; (3) the state experienced a \n     recent event that resulted in an increase in the percentage \n     of low-income children in the state without health insurance \n     (as determined on the basis of the most timely and accurate \n     published estimates from the Census Bureau) that was outside \n     the control of the state and warrants granting the state \n     access to the Fund, as determined by the Secretary.\n       The Secretary shall make monthly payments from the Fund to \n     all states determined eligible for a month. If the sum of the \n     payments from the Fund exceeds the amount available, the \n     Secretary shall reduce each payment proportionally.\n       If a state was determined to be eligible in a given fiscal \n     year, that does not make the state eligible in the following \n     fiscal year. In the case of an event that occurred after July \n     1 of the fiscal year that resulted in the declaration of a \n     Stafford Act or public health emergency that increased the \n     number of uninsured low-income children as described above, \n     any related Contingency Fund payment shall remain available \n     until the end of the following fiscal year.\n       The Secretary shall provide annual reports to Congress on \n     the Contingency Fund, the payments from it, and the events \n     that caused states to apply for payment.\n\n\n Section 109. 2-year availability of allotments; expenditures counted \n                       against oldest allotments\n\n     Current Law\n       SCHIP allotments (currently through FY2007) are available \n     for three years. Allotments unspent after three years are \n     available for reallocation. For example, the FY2004 allotment \n     was available through the end of FY2006; any remaining \n     balances at the end of FY2006 were redistributed to other \n     states.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       CHIP allotments through FY2006 are available for three \n     years. CHIP allotments made for FY2007 through FY2012 are \n     available for two years.\n       Payments to states from the Incentive Pool are available \n     until expended by the state. Payments for a month from the \n     Contingency Fund are available through the end of the fiscal \n     year, except in the case of an event that occurred after July \n     1 of the fiscal year that resulted in the declaration of a \n     Stafford Act or public health emergency that increased the \n     number of uninsured low-income children.\n       States' federal CHIP expenditures on or after October 1, \n     2007, shall be counted first against the Contingency Funds \n     from the earliest available month in the earliest fiscal \n     year, then against the earliest available allotments.\n       A State may elect, but is not required, to count CHIP \n     expenditures against any incentive bonuses paid to the State.\n       Expenditures for coverage of nonpregnant childless adults \n     in FY2009 and of parents of targeted low-income children in \n     FY2010 through FY2012 shall be counted only against the \n     amount set aside for such coverage\n\n\n  Section 110. Limitation on matching rate for States that propose to \ncover children with effective family income that exceeds 300 percent of \n                            the poverty line\n\n     Current Law\n       The federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) is the \n     rate at which states are reimbursed for most Medicaid service \n     expenditures. It is based on a formula that provides higher \n     reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes \n     relative to the national average (and vice versa); it has a \n     statutory minimum of 50% and maximum of 83%. There are \n     statutory exceptions to the FMAP formula for the District of \n     Columbia (since FY1998) and Alaska (for FY1998-FY2007). In \n     addition, the territories have FMAPs set at 50% and are \n     subject to federal spending caps.\n       The enhanced FMAP (E-FMAP) for SCHIP equals a state's \n     Medicaid FMAP increased by the number of percentage points \n     that is equal to 30% multiplied by the number of percentage \n     points by which the FMAP is less than 100%. For example, in \n     states with an FMAP of 60%, the E-FMAP equals the FMAP \n     increased by 12 percentage points (60% + [30% multiplied by \n     40 percentage points] = 72%). The E-FMAP has a statutory \n     minimum of 65% and maximum of 85%.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       For child health assistance or health benefits coverage \n     furnished in any fiscal year inning with FY2008 to a targeted \n     low-income child whose effective family income would exceed \n     300% of the federal poverty line but for the application of a \n     general exclusion of\n\n[[Page S10179]]\n\n     a block of income that is not determined by type of expense \n     or type of income, states would be reimbursed using the FMAP \n     instead of the E-FMAP for services provided to that child. An \n     exception would be provided for states that, on the date of \n     enactment of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) \n     Reauthorization Act of 2007 has an approved State plan \n     amendment or waiver or has enacted a State law to submit a \n     State plan amendment to provide child health assistance or \n     health benefits under their state child health plan or its \n     waiver of such plan to children above 300% of the poverty \n     line.\n\n\n   Section 111. Option for qualifying States to receive the enhanced \n  portion of the CHIP matching rate for Medicaid coverage of certain \n                          children current Law\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 2105(g) of the Social Security Act permits \n     qualifying states to apply federal SCHIP funds toward the \n     coverage of certain children already enrolled in regular \n     Medicaid (that is, not SCHIP-funded expansions of Medicaid). \n     Specifically, these federal SCHIP funds are used to pay the \n     difference between SCHIP's enhanced Federal Medical \n     Assistance Percentage (FMAP) and the Medicaid FMAP that the \n     state is already receiving for these children. Funds under \n     this provision may only be claimed for expenditures occurring \n     after August 15, 2003.\n       Qualifying states are limited in the amount they can claim \n     for this purpose to the lesser of the following two amounts: \n     (1) 20% of the state's original SCHIP allotment amounts (if \n     available) from FY1998, FY1999, FY2000, FY2001, FY2004, \n     FY2005, FY2006, and FY2007 (hence the ``terms ``20% \n     allowance'' and ``20% spending''); and (2) the state's \n     available balances of those allotments. If there is no \n     balance, states may not claim Section 2105(g) spending.\n       The statutory definitions for qualifying states capture \n     most of those that had expanded their upper-income \n     eligibility levels for children in their Medicaid programs to \n     185% of the federal poverty level or higher prior to the \n     enactment of SCHIP. Based on statutory definitions, 11 states \n     were determined to be qualifying states: Connecticut, Hawaii, \n     Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Rhode Island, \n     Tennessee, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.\n       SCHIP spending under Sec. 2105(g) can be used by qualifying \n     states only for Medicaid enrollees (excluding those covered \n     by an SCHIP-funded expansion of Medicaid) who are under age \n     19 and whose family income exceeds 150% of poverty, to pay \n     the difference between the SCHIP enhanced FMAP and the \n     regular Medicaid FMAP.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       Qualifying states under Sec. 2105(g) may also use available \n     balances from their CHIP allotments from FY2008 to FY2012 to \n     pay the difference between the regular Medicaid FMAP and the \n     CHIP enhanced FMAP for Medicaid enrollees under age 19 (or \n     age 20 or 21, if the state has so elected in its Medicaid \n     plan) whose family income exceeds 133% of poverty.\n\n                  Title II--A Outreach and Enrollment\n\n\n            Section 201. Grants for outreach and enrollment\n\n     Current Law\n       The federal and state governments share in the costs of \n     both Medicaid and SCHIP, based on formulas defining the \n     federal contribution in federal law. States are responsible \n     for the non-federal share, using state tax revenues, for \n     example, but can also use local government funds to comprise \n     a portion of the non-federal share. Generally, the non-\n     federal share of costs under Medicaid and SCHIP cannot be \n     comprised of other federal funds.\n       Under Medicaid, there are no caps on administrative \n     expenses that may be claimed for federal matching dollars. \n     Title XXI specifies that federal SCHIP funds can be used for \n     SCHIP health insurance coverage, called child health \n     assistance, which meets certain requirements. Apart from \n     these benefit payments; SCHIP payments for four other \n     specific health care activities can be made, including: (1) \n     other child health assistance for targeted low-income \n     children; (2) health services initiatives to improve the \n     health of SCHIP children and other low-income children; (3) \n     outreach activities; and (4) other reasonable administrative \n     costs. For a given fiscal year, payments for other specific \n     health care activities cannot exceed 10% of the total amount \n     of expenditures for SCHIP benefits and other specific health \n     care activities combined.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would establish a new grant program under \n     CHIP to finance outreach and enrollment efforts that increase \n     participation of eligible children in both Medicaid and CHIP. \n     For the purpose of awarding grants, the provision would \n     appropriate $100 million for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. \n     These amounts would be in addition to amounts appropriated \n     for CHIP allotments to states (as per Section 2104 of the \n     CHIP statute) and would not be subject to restrictions on \n     expenditures for outreach activities under current law.\n       For each fiscal year, the provision would require that ten \n     percent of the funds appropriated for this new grant would be \n     set aside to finance a national enrollment campaign \n     (described below), and an additional 10 percent would be set-\n     side to be used by the Secretary to award grants to Indian \n     Health Service providers and Urban Indian Organizations that \n     receive funds under title V of the Indian Health Care \n     Improvement Act for outreach to, and enrollment of, children \n     who are Indians.\n       The provision would require the Secretary to develop and \n     implement a national enrollment campaign to improve the \n     enrollment of under-served child populations in Medicaid and \n     CHIP. Such a campaign may include: (1) the establishment of \n     partnerships with the Secretary of Education and the \n     Secretary of Agriculture to develop national campaigns to \n     link the eligibility and enrollment systems for the programs \n     each Secretary administers that often serve the same \n     children, (2) the integration of information about Medicaid \n     and CHIP in public health awareness campaigns administered by \n     the Secretary, (3) increased financial and technical support \n     for enrollment hotlines maintained by the Secretary to ensure \n     that all states participate in such hotlines, (4) the \n     establishment of joint public awareness outreach initiatives \n     with the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Labor \n     regarding the importance of health insurance to building \n     strong communities and the economy, (5) the development of \n     special outreach materials for Native Americans or for \n     individuals with limited English proficiency, and (6) such \n     other outreach initiatives as the Secretary determines would \n     increase public awareness of Medicaid and CHIP.\n       In awarding grants, the Secretary would be required to give \n     priority to entities that propose to target geographic areas \n     with high rates of eligible but not enrolled children who \n     reside in rural areas, or racial and ethnic minorities and \n     health disparity populations, including proposals that \n     address cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment, and \n     which submit the most demonstrable evidence that (1) the \n     entity includes members with access to, and credibility with, \n     ethnic or low-income populations in the targeted communities, \n     and (2) the entity has the ability to address barriers to \n     enrollment (e.g., lack of awareness of eligibility, stigma \n     concerns, punitive fears associated with receipt of benefits) \n     as well as other cultural barriers to applying for and \n     receiving coverage under CHIP or Medicaid.\n       To receive grant funds, eligible entities would be required \n     to submit an application to the Secretary in such form and \n     manner, and containing such information as the Secretary \n     chooses. As noted above, such applications must include \n     evidence that the entity (a) includes members with access to, \n     and credibility with, ethnic or low-income populations in the \n     targeted communities, and (b) has the ability to address \n     barriers to enrollment (e.g., lack of awareness of \n     eligibility, stigma concerns, punitive fears associated with \n     receipt of benefits) as well as other cultural barriers to \n     applying for and receiving CHIP or Medicaid benefits. The \n     applicable must also include specific quality or outcome \n     performance measures to evaluate the effectiveness of \n     activities funded by the grant. In addition, the applicable \n     must contain an assurance that the entity will (1) conduct an \n     assessment of the effectiveness of such activities against \n     the performance measures, (2) cooperate with the collection \n     and reporting of enrollment data and other information in \n     order for the Secretary to conduct such assessment, and (3) \n     in the case of an entity that is not a state, provide the \n     state with enrollment data and other information necessary \n     for the state to make projections of eligible children and \n     pregnant women. The Secretary would be required to make \n     publicly available the enrollment data and information \n     collected and reported by grantees, and would also be \n     required to submit an annual report to Congress on the funded \n     outreach and enrollment activities conducted under the new \n     grant.\n       Seven types of entities would be eligible to receive \n     grants, including (1) a state with an approved CHIP plan, (2) \n     a local government, (3) an Indian tribe or tribal consortium, \n     a tribal organization, an urban Indian organization receiving \n     funds under title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement \n     Act, or an Indian Health Service provider, (4) a federal \n     health safety net organization, (5) a national, local, or \n     community-based public or nonprofit organization, including \n     organizations that use community health workers or community-\n     based doula programs, (6) a faith-based organization or \n     consortia, to the extent that a grant awarded to such an \n     entity is consistent with requirements of section 1955 of the \n     Public Health Service Act relating to a grant award to non-\n     governmental entities, or (7) an elementary or secondary \n     school.\n       Federal health safety net organizations include a number of \n     different types of entities, including for example: (1) \n     federally qualified health centers, (2) hospitals that \n     receive disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments, (3) \n     entities described in Section 340B(a)(4) of the Public Health \n     Service Act (e.g., certain family planning projects, certain \n     grantees providing early intervention services for HIV \n     disease, certain comprehensive hemophilia diagnostic \n     treatment centers, and certain Native Hawaiian health \n     centers), and (4) any other entity or consortium that \n     serves children under a federally-funded program, \n     including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for \n     Women, Infants and Children (WIC), Head Start programs, \n     school lunch programs, and elementary or secondary \n     schools.\n       The provision defines ``community health worker'' as an \n     individual who promotes health or nutrition within the \n     community in which the individual resides by (1) serving as a \n     liaison between communities and health\n\n[[Page S10180]]\n\n     care agencies, (2) providing guidance and social assistance \n     to residents, (3) enhancing residents' ability to effectively \n     communicate with health care providers, (4) providing \n     culturally and linguistically appropriate health or nutrition \n     education, (5) advocating for individual and community health \n     or nutrition needs, and (6) providing referral and follow-up \n     services.\n       In the case of a State that is awarded an Outreach and \n     Enrollment grant, the State would be required to meet a \n     maintenance of effort requirement with regard to the state \n     share of funds spent on outreach and enrollment activities \n     under the CHIP state plan. For such states, the funds spent \n     on outreach and enrollment under the state plan for a fiscal \n     year would not permitted to be less than the State share of \n     funds spent in the fiscal year preceding the first fiscal \n     year for which the grant is awarded.\n       The provision would add translation and interpretation \n     services to the specific health care activities that can be \n     reimbursed under CHIP. Translation or interpretation services \n     in connection with the enrollment and use of services under \n     CHIP by individuals for whom English is not their primary \n     language (as found by the Secretary for the proper and \n     efficient administration of the state plan) would be matched \n     at either 75% or the sum of the enhanced FMAP for the state \n     plus five percentage points, whichever is higher.\n       In addition, the 10% limit on payments for other specific \n     health care activities in current CHIP statute would not \n     apply to expenditures for outreach and enrollment activities \n     funded under this section.\n\n\n       Section 202. Increased outreach and enrollment of Indians\n\n       (a) Agreements with States for Medicaid and CHIP Outreach \n     on or Near Reservations to Increase the Enrollment of Indians \n     in Those Programs\n     Current Law\n       No provision in the Social Security Act.\n       Section 404(a) of the IHCIA requires the Secretary to make \n     grants or enter into contracts with Tribal Organizations for \n     establishing and administering programs on or near federal \n     Indian reservations and trust areas and in or near Alaska \n     Native villages. The purpose of the programs is to assist \n     individual Indians to enroll in Medicare, apply for Medicaid \n     and pay monthly premiums for coverage due to financial need \n     of such individuals. Section 404(b) of the IHCIA directs the \n     Secretary, through the IHS, to set conditions for any grant \n     or contract. The conditions include, but are not limited to: \n     (1) determining the Indian population that is, or could be, \n     served by Medicare and Medicaid; (2) assisting individual \n     Indians to become familiar with and use benefits; (3) \n     providing transportation to Indians to the appropriate \n     offices to enroll or apply for medical assistance; and (4) \n     developing and implementing both an income schedule to \n     determine premium payment levels for coverage of needy \n     individuals and methods to improve Indian participation in \n     Medicare and Medicaid. Section 404( c) of the IHCIA \n     authorizes the Secretary, acting through the IHS, to enter \n     into agreements with tribes, Tribal Organizations, and Urban \n     Indian Organizations to receive and process applications for \n     medical assistance under Medicaid and benefits under Medicare \n     at facilities administered by the IHS, or by a tribe, Tribal \n     Organization or Urban Indian Organization under the Indian \n     Self-Determination Act.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would amend Section 1139 of the Social \n     Security Act (replacing the current Section 1139 provision \n     dealing with an expired National Commission on Children).\n       The provision would encourage states to take steps to \n     provide for enrollment of Indians residing on or near a \n     reservation in Medicaid and CHIP. The steps could include \n     outreach efforts such as: outstationing of eligibility \n     workers; entering into agreements with the IHS, Indian Tribes \n     (ITs), Tribal Organizations (TOs), and Urban Indian \n     Organizations (UIOs) to provide outreach; education regarding \n     eligibility, benefits, and enrollment; and translation \n     services. The provision would not affect the arrangements \n     between states and Indian Tribes, Tribal Organizations, and \n     Urban Indian Organizations to conduct administrative \n     activities under Medicaid and CHIP.\n       The provision would require the Secretary, acting through \n     CMS, to take such steps as necessary to facilitate \n     cooperation with and agreements between states, and the IHS, \n     ITs, TOs, or UIOs relating to the provision of benefits to \n     Indians under Medicaid and CHIP.\n       The provision would specify that the following terms have \n     the meanings given to these terms in Section 4 of the Indian \n     Health Care Improvement Act: Indian, Indian Tribe, Indian \n     Health Program, Tribal Organization, and Urban Indian \n     Organization.\n       (b) Nonapplication of 10 Percent Limit On Outreach and \n     Certain Other Expenditures\n     Current Law\n       Title XXI of the Social Security Act provides states with \n     annual federal SCHIP allotments based on a formula set in \n     law. State SCHIP payments are matched by the federal \n     government at an enhanced rate that builds on the base rate \n     applicable to Medicaid. The SCHIP statute also specifies that \n     federal SCHIP funds can be used for SCHIP health insurance \n     coverage, called child health assistance that meets certain \n     requirements. States may also provide benefits to SCHIP \n     children, called targeted low-income children, through \n     enrollment in Medicaid. Apart from these benefit payments, \n     SCHIP payments for four other specific health care activities \n     can be made, including: (1) other child health assistance for \n     targeted low-income children; (2) health services initiatives \n     to improve the health of targeted low-income children and \n     other low-income children; (3) outreach activities; and (4) \n     other reasonable administrative costs. For a given fiscal \n     year, SCHIP statute specifies that payments for these four \n     other specific health care activities cannot exceed 10% of \n     the total amount of expenditures for benefits (excluding \n     payments for services rendered during periods of presumptive \n     eligibility under Medicaid) and other specific health care \n     activities combined.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would exclude from the 10% cap on CHIP \n     payments for the four other specific health care activities \n     described above: (1) expenditures for outreach activities to \n     families of Indian children likely to be eligible for CHIP or \n     Medicaid, or under related waivers, and (2) related informing \n     and enrollment assistance activities for Indian children \n     under such programs, expansions, or waivers, including such \n     activities conducted under grants, contracts, or agreements \n     entered into under Section 1139 of this Act.\n\n\n Section 203. Option for states to rely on findings by an Express Lane \nagency to determine components of a child's eligibility for Medicaid or \n                                  CHIP\n\n     Current Law\n       Medicaid law and regulations contain requirements regarding \n     determinations of eligibility and applications for \n     assistance. Generally, the Medicaid agency must determine the \n     eligibility of each applicant no more than 90 days from the \n     date of application for disability-based applications and 45 \n     days for all other applications. The agency must assure that \n     eligibility for care and services under the plan is \n     determined in a manner consistent with the best interests of \n     the recipients.\n       In limited circumstances outside agencies are permitted to \n     determine eligibility for Medicaid. For example, when a joint \n     TANF-Medicaid application is used the state TANF agency may \n     make the Medicaid eligibility determination, or the Secretary \n     may enter into an agreement with a given state to allow the \n     Social Security Administration (SSA) to determine Medicaid \n     eligibility of aged, blind, or disabled individuals in that \n     state.\n       Applicants must attest to the accuracy of the information \n     submitted on their Medicaid applications, and sign \n     application forms under penalty of perjury. Each state must \n     have an income and eligibility verification system under \n     which (1) applicants for Medicaid and several other \n     specified government programs must furnish their Social \n     Security numbers to the state as a condition for \n     eligibility, and (2) wage information from various \n     specified government agencies is used to verify \n     eligibility and to determine the amount of available \n     benefits. Subsequent to initial application, states must \n     request information from other federal and state agencies, \n     to verify applicants' income, resources, citizenship \n     status, and validity of Social Security number (e.g., \n     income from the Social Security Administration (SSA), \n     unearned income from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), \n     unemployment information from the appropriate state \n     agency, qualified aliens must present documentation of \n     their immigration status, which states must then verify \n     with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the \n     state must verify the SSN with the Social Security \n     Administration). States must also establish a Medicaid \n     eligibility quality control (MEQC) program designed to \n     reduce erroneous expenditures by monitoring eligibility \n     determinations. State Medicaid overpayments made on behalf \n     of individuals due to an error in determining eligibility \n     may not exceed 3% of the State's total Medicaid \n     expenditures in a given fiscal year. Erroneous excess \n     payments that exceed the 3% error rate will not be matched \n     with Federal Medicaid funds.\n       With regard to criteria for State Personnel Administration \n     and Offices, current law requires each state plan to \n     establish and maintain methods of personnel administration in \n     accordance with the Administration of the Standards for a \n     Merit System of Personnel Administration, 5 CFR Part 900, \n     Subpart F. States must assure compliance with the standards \n     by local jurisdictions; assure that the U.S. Civil Service \n     Commission has reviewed and determined the adequacy of state \n     laws, regulations, and policies; obtain statements of \n     acceptance of the standards by local agencies; submit \n     materials to show compliance with these standards when \n     requested by HHS; and have in effect an affirmative action \n     plan, which includes specific action steps and timetables, to \n     assure equal employment opportunity.\n       SCHIP defines a targeted low-income child as one who is \n     under the age of 19 years with no health insurance, and who \n     would not have been eligible for Medicaid under the rules in \n     effect in the state on March 31, 1997. Federal law requires \n     that eligibility for Medicaid and SCHIP be coordinated when \n     states implement separate SCHIP programs. In these \n     circumstances, applications for SCHIP coverage must first be \n     screened for Medicaid eligibility.\n       Under Medicaid presumptive eligibility rules, states are \n     allowed to temporarily enroll children whose family income \n     appears to be below Medicaid income standards for up\n\n[[Page S10181]]\n\n     to 2 months until a final formal determination of eligibility \n     is made. Entities qualified to make presumptive eligibility \n     determinations for children include Medicaid providers, \n     agencies that determine eligibility for Head Start, \n     subsidized child care, or the Special Supplemental Food \n     Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). BIPA 2000 \n     added several entities to the list of those qualified to make \n     Medicaid presumptive eligibility determinations. These \n     include agencies that determine eligibility for Medicaid or \n     the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP); \n     certain elementary and secondary schools; state or tribal \n     child support enforcement agencies; certain organizations \n     providing food and shelter to the homeless; entities involved \n     in enrollment under Medicaid, TANF, SCHIP, or that determine \n     eligibility for federally funded housing assistance; or any \n     other entity deemed by a state, as approved by the Secretary \n     of HHS. These Medicaid presumptive eligibility rules for \n     children also apply to SCHIP.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would create a three year demonstration \n     program that would allow up to 10 states to use Express Lane \n     at Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment and renewal. The \n     demonstration would provide $44 million for systems upgrades \n     and implementation (not coverage costs) and $5 million for an \n     independent evaluation of the demonstration at the end of \n     three years and a report on the demonstration's effectiveness \n     to Congress. The report would be due one year after \n     completion of the demonstration.\n       The Demonstration would allow states the option to rely on \n     a finding made by an Express Lane Agency within the preceding \n     12 months to determine whether a child under age 19 (or at \n     state option age 20, or 21) has met one or more of the \n     eligibility requirements (e.g., income, assets or resources, \n     citizenship, or other criteria) necessary to determine an \n     individual's initial eligibility, eligibility \n     redetermination, or renewal of eligibility for medical \n     assistance under Medicaid (including the waiver of \n     requirements of this title).\n       If a finding from an Express Lane agency results in a child \n     not being found eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, the State \n     would be required to determine Medicaid or CHIP eligibility \n     using its regular procedures. The provision does not relieve \n     states of their obligation to determine eligibility for \n     medical assistance under Medicaid, or prohibit state options \n     intended to increase enrollment of eligible children under \n     Medicaid or CHIP. In addition, the provision requires states \n     to inform the families (especially those whose children are \n     enrolled in CHIP) that they may qualify for lower premium \n     payments or more comprehensive health coverage under Medicaid \n     if the family's income were directly evaluated for an \n     eligibility determination by the State Medicaid agency, and \n     at the family's option they can seek a regular Medicaid \n     eligibility determination.\n       The provision would allow States to rely on an Express Lane \n     Agency finding that a child is a qualified alien as long as \n     the Agency complies with guidance and regulatory procedures \n     issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security for eligibility \n     determinations of qualified aliens, and verifications of \n     immigration status (that meet the requirements of Section 301 \n     of this bill).\n       States that opt to use an Express Lane Agency to determine \n     eligibility for Medicaid or CHIP may meet the CHIP screen and \n     enroll requirements by using any of the following \n     requirements: (1) establishing a threshold percentage of the \n     Federal poverty level that is 30 percentage points (or such \n     other higher number of percentage points) as the state \n     determines reflects the income methodologies of the program \n     administered by the Express Lane Agency and the Medicaid \n     State plan, (2) providing that the child satisfies all income \n     requirements for Medicaid eligibility, or (3) providing that \n     such child has a family income that exceeds the Medicaid \n     income eligibility threshold that serves as the lower income \n     eligibility threshold for CHIP.\n       The provision would allow states to provide for presumptive \n     eligibility under CHIP for a child who, based on an \n     eligibility determination of an income finding from an \n     Express Lane agency, would qualify for child health \n     assistance under CHIP. During the period of presumptive \n     eligibility, the State may determine the child's eligibility \n     for CHIP based on telephone contact with family members, \n     access to data available in electronic or paper format, or \n     other means that minimize to the maximum extent feasible the \n     burden on the family.\n       A State may initiate a Medicaid eligibility determination \n     (and determine program eligibility) without a program \n     application based on data obtained from sources other than \n     the child (or the child's family), but such child can only be \n     automatically enrolled in Medicaid (or CHIP) if the family \n     affirmatively consented to being enrolled through affirmation \n     and signature on an Express Lane agency application. The \n     provision requires the State to have procedures in place to \n     inform the individual of the services that will be covered, \n     appropriate methods for using such services, premium or other \n     cost sharing charges (if any) that apply, medical support \n     obligations created by the enrollment (if applicable), and \n     the actions the individual must take to maintain enrollment \n     and renew coverage. For children who consent to enrollment in \n     the State plan, the provision would allow the State to waive \n     signature requirements on behalf of such child.\n       States that participate in the Express Lane Eligibility \n     Demonstration would not be required to direct a child (or a \n     child's family) to submit information or documentation \n     previously submitted by the child or family to an Express \n     Lane agency that the State relies on for its Medicaid \n     eligibility determination. A participating state may rely on \n     information from an Express Lane agency when evaluating a \n     child's eligibility for Medicaid or SCHIP without a separate, \n     independent confirmation of the information at the time of \n     enrollment.\n       An Express Lane agency must be a public agency determined \n     by the State agency to be capable of making the \n     determinations described in the provisions of this section \n     and is identified in the state plan under this title or Title \n     XXI. Express Lane Agencies would include: (1) a public agency \n     that determines eligibility for assistance under a State \n     program funded under part A of title IV, a program funded \n     under Part D of title IV, a State child health plan under \n     title XXI, the Food Stamp Act of 1977, the Head Start Act, \n     the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, the Child \n     Nutrition Act of 1966, or the Child Care and Development \n     Block Grant, the Steward B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, \n     the United States Housing Act of 1937, the Native American \n     Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, (2) a \n     state specified governmental agency that has fiscal liability \n     or legal responsibility for the accuracy of the eligibility \n     determination findings, and (3) a public agency that is \n     subject to an interagency agreement limiting the disclosure \n     and use of such information for eligibility determination \n     purposes.\n       Programs run through Title XX (SSBG) are not eligible \n     Express Lane agencies. Private for-profit organizations are \n     not eligible Express Lane agencies. Current law applies \n     regarding the ability of Medicaid to contract with non-profit \n     and for-profit agencies to administer the Medicaid \n     application process with clarifying language that nothing in \n     this demonstration exempts states from the merit-based system \n     for Medicaid employees. A rule of construction would also \n     clarify that states may not use the Express Lane option as a \n     means of avoiding current merit-based employment requirements \n     for Medicaid determinations.\n       In addition, the provision would require such agencies to \n     notify the child's family (1) of the information that will be \n     disclosed under this provision, (2) that the information will \n     be used solely for the purposes of determining eligibility \n     under Medicaid and CHIP, (3) that the family may elect not to \n     have the information disclosed for such purposes. The Express \n     Lane agency must also enter into or be subject to an \n     interagency agreement to limit the disclosure and use of such \n     information.\n       As part of the demonstration, signatures under penalty of \n     perjury would not be required on a Medicaid application form \n     attesting to any element of the application for which \n     eligibility is based on information received from a source \n     other than an applicant. The provision would provide that any \n     signature requirement for a Medicaid application may be \n     satisfied through an electronic signature.\n       States participating in the Demonstration will have to code \n     which children are enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP by way of \n     Express Lane for the duration of the demonstration. States \n     must take a statistically valid sample, approved by CMS, of \n     the children enrolled via Express Lane annually for full \n     Medicaid eligibility review to determine eligibility error \n     rate. States submit the error rate to CMS and if the error \n     rate exceeds 3% either of the first two years, the state must \n     show CMS what corrective actions are in place to improve upon \n     their error rate and will be required to reimburse erroneous \n     excess payments that exceed the allowable error rate of 3%. \n     However, CMS does not have the authority to apply the error \n     rate derived from the Express Lane sample to the entire \n     Express Lane or Medicaid child population, or to take other \n     punitive action against a state based on the error rate. \n     States that participate in the Express Lane demonstration \n     will continue to be subject to existing requirements under \n     Medicaid requiring states to reimburse erroneous excess \n     payments that exceed the allowable error rate of 3% \n     consistent with 1903(u).\n\n\n    Section 204. Authorization of certain information disclosure to \n                simplify health coverage determinations\n\n     Current Law\n       Each state must have an income and eligibility verification \n     system under which (1) applicants for Medicaid and several \n     other specified government programs must furnish their Social \n     Security numbers to the state as a condition for eligibility, \n     and (2) wage information from various specified government \n     agencies is used to verify eligibility and to determine the \n     amount of available benefits. Subsequent to initial \n     application, states must request information from other \n     federal and state agencies, to verify applicants' income, \n     resources, citizenship status, and validity of Social \n     Security number (e.g., income from the Social Security \n     Administration (SSA), unearned income from the Internal \n     Revenue Service (IRS), unemployment information from the \n     appropriate state agency, qualified aliens must present \n     documentation of their immigration status, which states must \n     then verify with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, \n     and the state must verify the SSN with the Social\n\n[[Page S10182]]\n\n     Security Administration). States must also establish a \n     Medicaid eligibility quality control (MEQC) program designed \n     to reduce erroneous expenditures by monitoring eligibility \n     determinations.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would authorize federal or State agencies or \n     private entities with potential data sources relevant for the \n     determination of eligibility under Medicaid (e.g., \n     eligibility files, vital records about births, etc.) to share \n     such information with the Medicaid agency if: (1) the child \n     (or such child's parent, guardian, or caretaker relative) has \n     provided advanced consent to disclosure, and has not objected \n     to disclosure, (2) such data are used solely for the purpose \n     of identifying, enrolling, and verifying potential \n     eligibility for Medicaid medical assistance, and (3) an \n     interagency agreement prevents the unauthorized use, \n     disclosure, or modification of such data, and otherwise meets \n     federal standards for safeguarding privacy and data security, \n     and requires the State agency to use such data for the \n     purposes of child enrollment in Medicaid. The provision would \n     impose criminal penalties for persons who engage in \n     unauthorized activities with such data.\n       For purposes of the Express Lane Demonstration only, the \n     provision would also authorize the Medicaid and CHIP programs \n     to receive data directly relevant to eligibility \n     determinations and determining the correct amount of benefits \n     under such program from (1) the National New Hires Database, \n     (2) the National Income Data collected by the Commissioner of \n     Social Security, or (3) data about enrollment in insurance \n     that may help to facilitate outreach and enrollment under \n     Medicaid, CHIP and certain other programs.\n\n              Title III--Removal of Barriers to Enrollment\n\n\nSection 301. Verification of declaration of citizenship or nationality \n           for purposes of eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP\n\n     Current Law\n       To be eligible for the full range of benefits offered under \n     Medicaid, an individual must be a citizen or national of the \n     United States or a qualified alien. Nonqualified aliens can \n     only receive limited emergency Medicaid benefits. Noncitizens \n     who apply for full Medicaid benefits have been required since \n     1986 to present documentation that indicates a ``satisfactory \n     immigration status.''\n       Due to recent changes in federal law, citizens and \n     nationals also must present documentation that proves \n     citizenship and documents personal identity in order for \n     states to receive federal Medicaid reimbursement for services \n     provided to them. This citizenship documentation requirement \n     was included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. \n     109-171) and modified by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act \n     of 2006 (P.L. 109-432). Before the DRA, states could accept \n     self-declaration of citizenship for Medicaid, although some \n     chose to require additional supporting evidence.\n       The citizenship documentation requirement is outlined under \n     Section 1903(x) of the Social Security Act and applies to \n     Medicaid eligibility determinations and redeterminations made \n     on or after July 1, 2006. The law specifies documents that \n     are acceptable for this purpose and exempts certain groups \n     from the requirement, including people who receive Medicare \n     benefits, Social Security benefits on the basis of a \n     disability, Supplemental Security Income benefits, child \n     welfare assistance under Title IV-B of the Social Security \n     Act, or adoption or foster care assistance under Title IV-E \n     of the Social Security Act. An interim final rule on the \n     requirement was issued in July 2006, and a final rule was \n     issued in July 2007.\n       The citizenship documentation requirement does not apply to \n     SCHIP. However, some states use the same enrollment \n     procedures for all Medicaid and SCHIP applicants. As a \n     result, it is possible that some SCHIP enrollees would be \n     asked to present evidence of citizenship.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       As part of its Medicaid state plan and with respect to \n     individuals declaring to be U.S. citizens or nationals for \n     purposes of establishing Medicaid eligibility, a state would \n     be required to provide that it satisfies existing Medicaid \n     citizenship documentation rules under Section 1903(x) or new \n     rules under Section 1902(dd). The Secretary would not be \n     allowed to waive this requirement.\n       Under a new Section 1902(dd), a state could meet its \n     Medicaid state plan requirement for citizenship documentation \n     by: (1) submitting the name and Social Security number (SSN) \n     of an individual to the Commissioner of Social Security as \n     part of a plan established under specified rules and (2) in \n     the case of an individual whose name or SSN is invalid, \n     providing the individual with an opportunity to cure the \n     invalid determination with the Social Security \n     Administration, followed by 90 days to present evidence of \n     citizenship as defined in Section 1903(x) and disenrolling \n     the individual within 30 days after the end of the 90-day \n     period if evidence is not provided.\n       A state opting for name and SSN validation would be \n     required to establish a program under which it submits each \n     month to the Commissioner of Social Security for verification \n     of the name and SSN of each individual enrolled in Medicaid \n     that month who has attained the age of 1 before the date of \n     the enrollment. In establishing its program, a state could \n     enter into an agreement with the Commissioner to provide for \n     the electronic submission and verification of name and SSN \n     before an individual is enrolled in Medicaid.\n       At such times and in such form as the Secretary may \n     specify, states would be required to provide information on \n     the percentage of invalid names and SSNs submitted each \n     month. If the average monthly percentage for any fiscal year \n     is greater than 7%, the state shall develop and adopt a \n     corrective plan and pay the Secretary an amount equal to \n     total Medicaid payments for the fiscal year for individuals \n     who provided invalid information multiplied by the ratio of \n     the number of individuals with invalid information in excess \n     of the 7% limited divided by the total number of individuals \n     with invalid information. The Secretary could waive, in \n     certain limited cases, all or part of such payment if a state \n     is unable to reach the allowable error rate despite a good \n     faith effort by the state. This provision shall not apply to \n     a State for a fiscal year, if there is an agreement with the \n     Commissioner to provide for the electronic submission and \n     verification of name and SSN before an individual is enrolled \n     in Medicaid, as of the close of the fiscal year.\n       States would receive 90% reimbursement for costs \n     attributable to the design, development, or installation of \n     such mechanized verification and information retrieval \n     systems as the Secretary determines are necessary to \n     implement name and SSN validation, and 75% for the operation \n     of such systems.\n       The provision would also clarify requirements under the \n     existing Section 1903(x). It would add ``a document issued by \n     a federally-recognized Indian tribe evidencing membership or \n     enrollment in, or affiliation with, such tribe'' to the list \n     of documents that provide satisfactory documentary evidence \n     of citizenship or nationality, except for tribes located \n     within states having an international border whose membership \n     includes noncitizens, who would only be allowed to use such \n     documents until the Secretary of HHS issues regulations \n     authorizing the presentation of other evidence. It would \n     require states to provide citizens with the same reasonable \n     opportunity to present evidence that is provided under \n     Section 1137(d)(4)(A) to noncitizens who must present \n     evidence of satisfactory immigration status. Groups that are \n     exempt from the Section 1903(x) citizenship documentation \n     requirement would remain the same as under current law, \n     except for the inclusion of a permanent exemption for \n     children who are deemed eligible for Medicaid coverage by \n     virtue of being born to a mother on Medicaid. The provision \n     would clarify that deemed eligibility applies to children \n     born to noncitizen women on emergency Medicaid, and would \n     require separate identification numbers for children born to \n     these women.\n       In order to receive reimbursement for an individual who \n     has, or is, declared to be a U.S. citizen or national for \n     purposes of establishing CHIP eligibility, a state would be \n     required to meet the Medicaid state plan requirement for \n     citizenship documentation described above. The 90% and 75% \n     reimbursement for name and SSN validation would be available \n     under SCHIP, and would not count towards a state's CHIP \n     administrative expenditures cap.\n       Except for technical amendments made by the provision and \n     the application of citizenship documentation to CHIP, which \n     would be effective upon enactment, the provision would be \n     effective as if included in the Deficit Reduction Act of \n     2005. States would be allowed to provide retroactive \n     eligibility for certain individuals who had been determined \n     ineligible under previous citizenship documentation rules.\n\n\n      Section 302. Reducing administrative barriers to enrollment\n\n     Current Law\n       During the implementation of SCHIP states instituted a \n     variety of enrollment facilitation and outreach strategies to \n     bring eligible children into Medicaid and SCHIP. As a result, \n     substantial progress was made at the state level to simplify \n     the application and enrollment processes to find, enroll, and \n     maintain eligibility among those eligible for the program.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would require the State plan to describe the \n     procedures used to reduce the administrative barriers to the \n     enrollment of children and pregnant women in Medicaid and \n     CHIP, and to ensure that such procedures are revised as often \n     as the State determines is appropriate to reduce newly \n     identified barriers to enrollment. States would be deemed to \n     comply with the above-listed requirement if (1) the State's \n     application and renewal forms, and information verification \n     processes are the same under Medicaid and CHIP for \n     establishing and renewing eligibility for children and \n     pregnant women, and (2) the state does not require a face-to-\n     face interview during the application process.\n\n    Title IV--Elmination of Barriers to Providing Premium Assistance\n\n  Subtitle A--Additional State Option for Providing Premium Assistance\n\n\n Section 401. Additional State option for providing premium assistance\n\n     Current Law\n       Under Medicaid, a provision in the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990 created the health \n     insurance premium payment (HIPP) program. The original HIPP \n     provision required state Medicaid programs to pay a Medicaid \n     beneficiary's share of costs\n\n[[Page S10183]]\n\n     for group (employer-based) health coverage for any Medicaid \n     enrollee for whom employer-based coverage is available when \n     that coverage is both comprehensive and cost effective for \n     the state. An individual's enrollment in an employer plan is \n     considered cost effective if paying the premiums, \n     deductibles, coinsurance and other cost-sharing obligations \n     of the employer plan is less expensive than the state's \n     expected cost of directly providing Medicaid-covered \n     services. Under the original provision, states were also \n     required to purchase employer-based health insurance for non-\n     Medicaid eligible family members if such family coverage was \n     necessary for Medicaid-eligible individual to receive \n     coverage, and as long as it was still cost-effective. States \n     were also to provide coverage for those Medicaid covered \n     services that are not included in the private plans. In \n     August 1997, as part of the Balanced Budget Act, Congress \n     amended the mandatory nature of the HIPP provision. Today, \n     states can opt to use Medicaid funds to pay for premiums and \n     other cost-sharing for Medicaid beneficiaries when coverage \n     is available, comprehensive, and cost-effective.\n       Under SCHIP, the Secretary has the authority to approve \n     funding for the purchase of ``family coverage'' if it is cost \n     effective relative to the amount paid to cover only the \n     targeted low-income children and does not substitute for \n     coverage under group health plans that would otherwise be \n     provided to the children. While the term ``family coverage'' \n     is not specifically defined in the statute, it has been \n     interpreted to refer to either coverage for the entire family \n     under an SCHIP program or under an employer-sponsored health \n     insurance plan. In addition, states using SCHIP funds for \n     employer-based plan premiums must ensure that SCHIP minimum \n     benefits are provided and SCHIP cost-sharing ceilings are \n     met.\n       Because of these requirements, implementation of premium \n     assistance programs under Medicaid and SCHIP are not \n     widespread. States cited difficulty in identifying potential \n     enrollees, determining whether the subsidy would be cost-\n     effective, and obtaining necessary information (e.g., \n     information about the availability of employer-sponsored \n     plans, covered benefits, available contributions, and the \n     remaining costs) as some of the barriers to the \n     implementation of such programs.\n       In August 2001, the Bush Administration introduced the \n     Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability (HIFA) \n     Initiative under the Section 1115 waiver authority. Under \n     HIFA, states were to direct unspent SCHIP funds to extend \n     coverage to uninsured populations with annual income less \n     than 200% FPL and to use Medicaid and SCHIP funds to pay \n     premium costs for waiver enrollees who have access to \n     Employer Sponsored Insurance (ESI). This resulted in an \n     increased emphasis on states' use of the Section 1115 waiver \n     authority to offer premium assistance for employer-based \n     health coverage in lieu of full Medicaid and/or SCHIP \n     coverage. ESI programs approved under the Section 1115 waiver \n     authority are not subject to the same current law constraints \n     required under Medicaid's HIPP program or SCHIP's family \n     coverage variance option (i.e., the comprehensiveness and \n     cost-effectiveness tests).\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would allow states to offer a premium \n     assistance subsidy for qualified employer sponsored coverage \n     to all targeted low-income children who are eligible for \n     child health assistance and have access to such coverage. \n     Qualified employer sponsored coverage would be defined as a \n     group health plan or health insurance coverage offered \n     through an employer that (1) qualifies as credible health \n     coverage as a group health plan under the Public Health \n     Service Act, (2) for which the employer contributes at least \n     40 percent toward the cost of the premium, and (3) is non-\n     discriminatory in a manner similar to section 105(h) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code but would not allow employers to \n     exclude workers who had less than 3 years of service. \n     Qualified employer-sponsored insurance would not include (1) \n     benefits provided under a health flexible spending \n     arrangement, (2) a high deductible health plan purchased in \n     conjunction with a health savings account as defined in the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       The provision would establish a new cost effectiveness test \n     for ESI programs. A group health plan or health insurance \n     coverage offered through an employer would be considered \n     qualified employer sponsored coverage if the state \n     establishes that (1) the cost of such coverage is less than \n     the expenditures that the State would have made to enroll the \n     child or the family (as applicable) in CHIP, or (2) the State \n     establishes that the aggregate amount of State expenditures \n     for the purchase of all such coverage for targeted low-income \n     children under CHIP (including administrative expenses) does \n     not exceed the aggregate amount of expenditures that the \n     State would have made for providing coverage under the CHIP \n     state plan for all such children.\n       Premium assistance subsidies would be considered child \n     health assistance for the purpose of making federal matching \n     payments under the CHIP program, and the state would be \n     considered a secondary payor for any items or services \n     provided under ESI coverage. The provision defines premium \n     assistance subsidies as an amount equal to the difference \n     between the employee contribution for the employee only, and \n     the employee contribution for the employee and CHIP-eligible \n     child, less applicable premium cost sharing imposed under \n     title XXI (including the employee contribution toward the 5 \n     percent total annual aggregate cost-sharing limit under \n     CHIP). States would be permitted to provide a premium \n     assistance subsidy as reimbursement for out-of-pocket \n     expenses directly to an employee, or directly to the \n     employer. At the employer's option, the provision permits the \n     employer to notify the State that it elects to opt out of \n     being directly paid a premium assistance subsidy on behalf of \n     an employee. In the event of such notification, the employer \n     would be required to withhold the total amount of the \n     employee contribution required for enrollment of the employee \n     (and the child) in the ESI coverage and then the State would \n     then pay the premium subsidy directly to the employee.\n       States would be required to provide supplemental coverage \n     for each targeted low income child enrolled in the ESI plan \n     consisting of items or services that are not covered, or are \n     only partially covered, and cost-sharing protections \n     consistent with the requirements of CHIP. States would be \n     permitted to directly pay out-of-pocket expenditures for \n     cost-sharing imposed under the qualified ESI coverage and \n     collect all (or any) portion for cost-sharing imposed on the \n     family.\n       Waiting periods (to prevent crowd-out of private coverage \n     with public coverage) imposed under the CHIP state plan would \n     also apply to premium assistance coverage. Parents would be \n     permitted to disenroll their child(ren) from ESI coverage \n     and enroll them in CHIP coverage effective on the first \n     day of any month for which the child is eligible for such \n     coverage.\n       States that provide ESI coverage to parents of targeted \n     low-income children, would be permitted to offer a premium \n     assistance subsidy to eligible parents in the same manner as \n     that State offers such subsidy to eligible child(ren). The \n     amount of the premium subsidy would be increased to take into \n     account the cost of enrollment of the parent in the ESI \n     coverage, or at state option, the cost of the enrollment of \n     the child's family (if the states determines that it is cost-\n     effective).\n       Each state has the option to establish an employer/family \n     premium assistance purchasing pool for employers with less \n     than 250 employees who have at least one CHIP-eligible \n     employee (pregnant woman) or child.\n       The state, or a state designated entity, will identify and \n     offer access to not less than two privately delivered health \n     products that meet the CHIP benefits benchmark.\n       States that provide ESI coverage to parents of targeted \n     low-income children, would be permitted to offer a premium \n     assistance subsidy to eligible parents in the same manner as \n     that State offers such subsidy to eligible child(ren). The \n     amount of the premium subsidy would be increased to take into \n     account the cost of enrollment of the parent in the ESI \n     coverage, or at state option, the cost of the enrollment of \n     the child's family (if the states determines that it is cost-\n     effective).\n       This provision would not limit the state's authority to \n     offer premium assistance under the Medicaid HIPP program, a \n     section 1115 demonstration waiver, or any other authority in \n     effect prior to the enactment of this Act. States would be \n     required to inform parents about the availability of premium \n     assistance subsidies for CHIP eligible children in qualified \n     employer-sponsored insurance, how the family would elect such \n     subsides during the application process and ensure that \n     parents are fully informed of the choices for receiving child \n     health assistance under the CHIP or through the receipt of a \n     premium assistance subsidy.\n       The provision would also allow States to provide premium \n     assistance subsidies for enrollment of targeted low-income \n     children in coverage under a group health plan or health \n     insurance coverage offered through an employer if it is \n     determined that such coverage is actuarially equivalent to \n     CHIP benchmark benefits coverage, or CHIP benchmark-\n     equivalent coverage. Plans that meet the CHIP benefit \n     coverage requirements would not be required to provide \n     supplemental coverage for benefits and cost-sharing \n     protections as required under CHIP. Such provisions would be \n     applied to Medicaid-eligible children and to the parents of \n     Medicaid-eligible children in the same manner as they are \n     applied to CHIP.\n       Finally, the provision would require the General \n     Accountability Office to submit a report to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress on cost and coverage issues relating \n     to any State premium assistance programs for which federal \n     matching payments are made under Medicaid, CHIP, or the \n     Section 1115 waiver authority. Such report will be due to \n     Congress no later than January 1, 2009.\n\n\n      Section 402. Outreach, education, and enrollment assistance\n\n     Current Law\n       SCHIP states plans are required to include a description of \n     the procedures in place to provide outreach to children \n     eligible for SCHIP child health assistance, or other public \n     or private health programs to (1) inform these families of \n     the availability of SCHIP coverage, and (2) to assist them in \n     enrolling such children in SCHIP. In addition, states are \n     required to provide a description of the state's efforts to \n     ensure coordination between SCHIP and other public and \n     private health coverage.\n       There is a limit on federal spending for SCHIP \n     administrative expenses, which include activities such as \n     data collection and\n\n[[Page S10184]]\n\n     reporting, as well as outreach and education. For federal \n     matching purposes, a 10% cap applies to state administrative \n     expenses. This cap is tied to the dollar amount that a state \n     draws down from its annual allotment to cover benefits under \n     SCHIP, as opposed to 10% of a state's total annual allotment. \n     In other words, no more than 10% of the federal funds that a \n     state draws down for SCHIP benefit expenditures can be used \n     for administrative expenses.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would require states to include a description \n     of the procedures in place to provide outreach, education, \n     and enrollment assistance for families of children likely to \n     be eligible for premium assistance subsidies under CHIP or a \n     waiver approved under Section 1115. For employers likely to \n     provide qualified employer-sponsored coverage, the state is \n     required to include the specific resources the State intends \n     to apply to educate employers about the availability of \n     premium assistance subsidies under the CHIP state plan. \n     Expenditures for such outreach activities would not be \n     subject to the 10 percent limit on spending for \n     administrative costs associated with the CHIP program.\n\n   Subtitle B--Coordinating Premium Assistance With Private Coverage\n\n\nSection 411. Special enrollment period under group health plans in case \n    of termination of Medicaid or CHIP coverage or eligibility for \n          assistance in purchase of employment-based coverage\n\n     Current Law\n       Under the Internal Revenue Code, a group health plan is \n     required to provide special enrollment opportunities to \n     qualified individuals. Special enrollment refers to the \n     opportunity given to qualified individuals to enroll in a \n     health plan without having to wait until a late enrollment \n     opportunity or open season. Such individuals must have lost \n     eligibility for other group coverage, or lost employer \n     contributions towards health coverage, or added a dependent \n     due to marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. \n     In addition, the individual must meet the health plan's \n     substantive eligibility requirements, such as being a full-\n     time worker or satisfying a waiting period. Health plans must \n     give qualified individuals at least 30 days after the \n     qualifying event (e.g., loss of eligibility) to make a \n     request for special enrollment.\n       The same special enrollment opportunities apply to group \n     health plans and health insurance issuers offering group \n     health insurance under the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act.\n       The Employee Retirement Income Security Act specifies the \n     persons who may bring civil action to enforce the provisions \n     under this statute. Such persons include a plan participant \n     or beneficiary, a fiduciary, the Secretary of Labor, and a \n     State. Current law allows the Secretary to assess a maximum \n     financial penalty.against a plan administrator or employer \n     for certain violations, including failure to meet the \n     existing notice requirement.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would require (under the Internal Revenue \n     Code) a group health plan to permit an eligible but not \n     enrolled employee (or dependent(s) of such an employee) to \n     enroll for coverage under the group health plan if either of \n     the following conditions are met: (1) the employee or \n     dependent(s) is/are covered under Medicaid or CHIP, and \n     coverage of the employee or dependent(s) is terminated as a \n     result of loss of eligibility and the employee requests \n     coverage under the group health plan not later than 60 days \n     after the date of coverage termination, or (2) the employee \n     or dependent(s) becomes eligible for assistance, with respect \n     to coverage under the group health plan under Medicaid or \n     CHIP (including under any waiver or demonstration project), \n     if the employee requests coverage under the group health plan \n     no later than 60 days after the date the employee or \n     dependent is determined to be eligible for such assistance.\n       Each employer that maintains a group health plan in a State \n     that provides premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP would \n     be required to provide each employee a written notice of the \n     potential opportunities for premium assistance available in \n     the State under Medicaid and CHIP. For compliance purposes, \n     the employer may use any State-specific model notice issued \n     by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services in accordance with the model notice \n     requirements established under this section of the bill.\n       The plan administer of the group health plan would be \n     required to disclose to the State, upon request, information \n     about the benefits available under the group health plan so \n     as to permit the State to make a determination concerning \n     cost-effectiveness, and in order for the State to provide \n     supplemental benefits if required.\n       The provision includes conforming amendments. A group \n     health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group \n     health insurance (under the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act) would be required to permit an eligible but not \n     enrolled employee (or dependent(s) of such an employee) to \n     enroll for coverage under the group health plan if either of \n     the following conditions are met: (1) the employee or \n     dependent(s) is/are covered under Medicaid or CHIP, and \n     coverage of the employee or dependent(s) is terminated as a \n     result of loss of eligibility and the employee requests \n     coverage under the group health plan not later than 60 days \n     after the date of coverage termination, or (2) the employee \n     or dependent(s) becomes eligible for assistance, with respect \n     to coverage under the group health plan under Medicaid or \n     CHIP (including under any waiver or demonstration project), \n     if the employee requests coverage under the group health plan \n     not later than 60 days after the date the employee or \n     dependent is determined to be eligible for such assistance.\n       Each employer that maintains a group health plan in a State \n     that provides premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP would \n     be required to provide each employee a written notice of the \n     potential opportunities for premium assistance available in \n     the State under Medicaid and CHIP. Not later than 1 year \n     after the date of enactment, the Secretary of Labor and the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), in consultation \n     with State Medicaid Directors and State CHIP Directors, would \n     be required to develop model notices to enable employers to \n     comply with notice requirements in a timely manner. Model \n     notices would include information regarding how an employee \n     would contact the State for information regarding premium \n     assistance and how to apply for such assistance.\n       The plan administer of the group health plan would be \n     required to disclose to the State, upon request, information \n     about the benefits available under the group health plan so \n     as to permit the State to make a determination concerning \n     cost-effectiveness, and in order for the State to provide \n     supplemental benefits if required.\n       The HHS Secretary and the Labor Secretary would be required \n     to jointly establish a Medicaid, CHIP, and Employer-Sponsored \n     Coverage Coordination Working Group not later than 60 days \n     after the date of enactment. The purpose of the Working Group \n     would be to develop the model coverage coordination \n     disclosure form, and to identify the impediments to effective \n     coordination of coverage available to families. The purpose \n     of the disclosure form would be to allow the State to \n     determine the availability and cost-effectiveness of \n     coverage, and allow for coordination of coverage for \n     enrollees of such plans. The forms will include (1) \n     information that will allow for the determination of an \n     employee's eligibility for coverage under the group health \n     plan, (2) the name and contact information of the plan \n     administrator of the group health plan, (3) benefits offered \n     under the plan, (4) premiums and cost-sharing under the plan, \n     and (5) any other information relevant to coverage under the \n     plan.\n       The Working Group would consist of no more than 30 members \n     and be composed of representatives from the Department of \n     Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, State \n     directors of Medicaid and CHIP programs, employers (including \n     owners of small businesses and their trade or industry \n     representatives and certified human resource and payroll \n     professionals), plan administrations and plan sponsors of \n     group health plans, and children and other beneficiaries of \n     Medicaid and CHIP. Members would be required to serve without \n     compensation. The Department of Health and Human Services and \n     the Department of Labor would be required to jointly provide \n     appropriate administrative support to the Working Group, \n     including technical assistance. The Working Group would be \n     required to submit the model coverage coordination disclosure \n     form, along with a report containing recommendations for \n     appropriate measures to address impediments to effective \n     coordination of coverage between Medicaid, CHIP and group \n     health plans, to the Labor Secretary and the HHS Secretary no \n     later than 18 months after the date of enactment. The \n     Secretaries shall jointly submit a report regarding the \n     Working Group report recommendations to each chamber of the \n     Congress no later than 2 months after receipt of the report \n     from the Working Group. The Working Group shall terminate 30 \n     days after the issuance of its report.\n       The Labor Secretary and the HHS Secretary would be required \n     to develop the initial model notices, and the Labor Secretary \n     would provide such notices to employers no later than 1 year \n     after the date of enactment. Each employer would be required \n     to provide initial annual notices to its employees beginning \n     the first year after the date on which the model notices are \n     first issued. The model coverage coordination disclosure form \n     would also apply to requests made by States beginning the \n     first year after the date on which the model notices are \n     first issued.\n       The provision would amend current law by allowing the Labor \n     Secretary to assess a civil penalty (up to $100 a day) \n     against an employer for failure to meet the new notice \n     requirement established under this section of the bill. Each \n     violation with respect to any employee would be treated as a \n     separate violation. The Labor Secretary would also be allowed \n     to assess a civil penalty (up to $100 a day) against a plan \n     administrator for failure to comply with the new disclosure \n     requirement established under this section of the bill. Each \n     violation with respect to any participant or beneficiary \n     would be treated as a separate violation.\n\n Title V--Strengthening Quality of Care and Health Outcomes of Children\n\n\n Section 501. Child health quality improvement activities for children \n                      enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP\n\n     Current Law\n       The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and \n     the Agency for\n\n[[Page S10185]]\n\n     Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) are both actively \n     involved in funding and implementing an array of quality \n     improvement initiatives, though only AHRQ has engaged in \n     activities specific to children.\n       In November 2002, CMS started the Quality Initiative (QI), \n     a multi-faceted effort to improve health care quality. This \n     program includes the Nursing Home Quality Initiative, the \n     Home Health Quality Initiative, the National Voluntary \n     Hospital Quality Reporting Initiative, and the Physician \n     Focused Quality Initiative. The Medicare Prescription Drug, \n     Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) included \n     provisions for hospitals to report data on quality \n     indicators. In addition, the MMA included a variety of \n     provisions designed to promote quality care, such as \n     demonstrations that focus on improving the treatment of \n     chronic illnesses and on identifying effective approaches for \n     rewarding superlative performance. In 2005, quality reporting \n     was expanded for inpatient hospital services and extended to \n     home health. The development of plans for value-based \n     purchasing in hospitals and home health settings was also \n     required. In 2006, quality reporting was extended to hospital \n     outpatient services and ambulatory service centers. \n     Additionally, the 2007 Physician Quality Reporting Initiative \n     (PQRI) implemented a voluntary quality reporting system for \n     physicians and other eligible professionals with incentive \n     payments for covered professional services tied to the \n     reporting of claims data.\n       None of the CMS QI programs to date have focused on \n     children. Rather, most have focused on the general \n     population, adults with chronic conditions, or the frail \n     elderly.\n       AHRQ has made quality improvement for children a priority \n     in recent years. In part, this is because of the high costs \n     incurred by children on Medicaid/SCHIP.\n       Many AHRQ projects to implement and evaluate improved \n     health care strategies for the care of children are underway. \n     These include:\n       1. Pediatric Quality Indicators that includes a set of \n     measures that can be used with hospital inpatient discharge \n     data to detect patient safety events and potentially \n     avoidable hospitalizations.\n       2. The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and \n     Systems (CAHPS) program is a public-private initiative to \n     develop standardized surveys of patients' experiences with \n     ambulatory and facility-level care. Medicaid uses CAHPS to \n     measure quality of care for children with special health care \n     needs.\n       3. AHRQ's Child Health Care Quality Toolbox lists tips and \n     tools for evaluating health care quality for children. It is \n     available to providers and consumers at www.ahrq.gov/\nchtoolbx/index.htm.\n       Other AHRQ-supported initiatives to improve the quality and \n     safety of health care for children and adolescents, focusing \n     on health care IT, and the development of pediatric \n     electronic medical records, among other quality improvement \n     activities.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       (a) Development of Child Health Quality Measures For \n     Children Enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP.\n       The provision would add a new section to the Social \n     Security Act defining child health quality improvement \n     activities for children enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP. Not \n     later than January 1, 2009, the Secretary would be required \n     to identify and publish for general comment an initial \n     recommended core set of child health quality measures for use \n     by states with respect to Medicaid and CHIP, health insurance \n     issuers and managed care entities that enter into contracts \n     under Medicaid and CHIP, and providers under those two \n     programs.\n       With consultation with specific groups (identified below), \n     the Secretary must identify existing quality of care measures \n     for children that are in use under public and privately \n     sponsored health care coverage arrangements, or that are part \n     of reporting systems that measure both the presence and \n     duration of health insurance coverage over time. Based on \n     such measures, the Secretary published an initial core set of \n     child health quality measures that includes, but is not \n     limited to, the following: (1) duration of insurance coverage \n     over a 12-month period, (2) availability of a full range of \n     preventive services, treatments, and services for acute \n     conditions, including services to promote healthy birth and \n     prevent and treat premature birth, and treatments to correct \n     or ameliorate the effects of chronic physical and mental \n     conditions, (3) availability of care in a range of ambulatory \n     and inpatient settings, and (4) measures that, taken \n     together, can be used to estimate the overall national \n     quality of health care for children and to perform \n     comparative analyses of pediatric health care quality and \n     racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in child health \n     and health care for children.\n       Not later than 2 years after the enactment of the \n     Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of \n     2007, the Secretary, in consultation with the states, must \n     develop a standardized format for reporting information and \n     procedures and approaches that encourage states to use the \n     initial core measurement set to voluntarily report \n     information regarding quality of pediatric care under \n     Medicaid and CHIP.\n       In addition, the Secretary must disseminate information to \n     states regarding best practices with respect to measuring and \n     reporting quality of care for children, and must facilitate \n     adoption of such best practices. In developing these best \n     practices approaches, the Secretary must give particular \n     attention to state measurement techniques that ensure \n     timeliness and accuracy of provider reporting, encourage \n     provider reporting compliance and encourage successful \n     quality improvement strategies, and improve efficiency in \n     data collection using health information technology.\n       Not later than January 1, 2010, and every 3 years \n     thereafter, the Secretary must report to Congress on (1) the \n     status of the Secretary's efforts to improve quality related \n     to the duration and stability of health insurance coverage \n     for children under Medicaid and CHIP, (2) the quality of \n     children's health care under those programs, including \n     preventive health services, health care for acute conditions, \n     chronic health care, and health services to ameliorate the \n     effects of physical and mental conditions, as well as to aid \n     in growth and development of children, and (3) quality of \n     children's health care, including clinical quality, health \n     care safety, family experience with health care, health \n     care in the most integrated setting, and elimination of \n     racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in health \n     and health care. In these reports to Congress, the \n     Secretary must also describe the status of voluntary \n     reporting by states under Medicaid and CHIP utilizing the \n     initial core set of quality measures, and provide any \n     recommendations for legislative changes needed to improve \n     quality of care provided to Medicaid and CHIP children, \n     including recommendations for quality reporting by states. \n     The Secretary must also provide technical assistance to \n     states to assist them in adopting and utilizing core child \n     health quality measures for their Medicaid and CHIP \n     programs.\n       The provision defines ``core set'' to mean a group of \n     valid, reliable and evidence-based quality measures for \n     children that provide information regarding the quality of \n     health coverage and health care for children, address the \n     needs of children throughout the developmental age span, and \n     that allow purchasers, families, and health care providers to \n     understand the quality of care in relation to the preventive \n     needs of children, treatments aimed at managing and resolving \n     acute conditions, and diagnostic and treatment services to \n     correct or ameliorate physical, mental or developmental \n     conditions that could become chronic if left untreated or \n     poorly treated.\n       (b) Advancing and Improving Pediatric Quality Measures.\n       The provision would also require the Secretary to establish \n     a pediatric quality measures program not later than January \n     1, 2010. The purpose of this program would be to (1) improve \n     and strengthen the initial core child health care quality \n     measures, (2) expand on existing pediatric quality measures \n     used by both public and private purchasers and advance the \n     development of new and emerging measures, and (3) increase \n     the portfolio of evidence-based, consensus pediatric quality \n     measures available to public and private purchases of \n     children's health care services, providers and consumers.\n       At a minimum, the pediatric quality measures developed \n     under this program must be (1) evidence-based and where \n     appropriate, risk-adjusted, (2) designed to identify and \n     eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in child health and \n     the provision of health care, (3) designed to ensure that the \n     data required for such measures is collected and reported in \n     a standard format that permits comparisons at the state, plan \n     and provider level, (4) periodically adjusted, and (5) \n     responsive to child health needs, services and stability of \n     coverage.\n       In identifying gaps in existing pediatric quality measures \n     and establishing priorities for the development and use of \n     such measures, the Secretary must consult with a variety of \n     entities, including (1) states, (2) institutional and non-\n     institutional providers that specialize in the care and \n     treatment of children, particularly those with special needs, \n     (3) dental professionals, including pediatric dental \n     professionals, (4) primary care providers for children and \n     families living in medically under-served areas, or who are \n     members of population subgroups at heightened risk for poor \n     health outcomes, (5) national organizations representing \n     consumers and purchasers of children's health care, (6) \n     national organizations and individuals with expertise in \n     pediatric health quality measurement, and (7) voluntary \n     consensus standard setting organizations and other \n     organizations involved in the advancement of evidence-based \n     measures of health care.\n       In addition, the Secretary must award grants and contracts \n     for the development, testing, and validation of new, \n     emerging, and innovative evidence-based measures for \n     children's health care services across the domains of quality \n     identified above, and must also award grants and contracts \n     for the (1) development of consensus on evidence-based \n     measures for children's health care services, (2) \n     dissemination of such measures to public and private \n     purchasers of health care for children, and (3) updating of \n     such measures as necessary.\n       Beginning no later than January 1, 2012 and annually \n     thereafter, the Secretary must publish recommended changes to \n     the core measures described above that must reflect the \n     testing, validation, and consensus process for the \n     development of pediatric quality measures also described \n     above.\n       The term ``pediatric quality measure'' means a measurement \n     of clinical care that is capable of being examined through \n     the collection and analysis of relevant information, that is \n     developed in order to assess one or\n\n[[Page S10186]]\n\n     more aspects of pediatric health care quality in various \n     institutional and ambulatory health care settings, including \n     the structure of the clinical care system, the process of \n     care, the outcome of care, or patient experiences in care.\n       (c) Annual State Reports Regarding State-Specific Quality \n     of Care Measures Applied Under Medicaid or CHIP.\n       Each state with an approved state plan for Medicaid or CHIP \n     must report annually to the Secretary the following: (1) \n     state-specific child health quality measures, including \n     measures of duration and stability of insurance coverage; \n     quality with respect to preventive services and care for \n     acute and chronic conditions as well as services to \n     ameliorate the effects of physical and mental conditions, and \n     to aid in growth and development; clinical quality, health \n     care safety, family experience with health care, care \n     delivered in the most integrated setting, and elimination of \n     racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in health care; \n     and other measures in the initial core quality measurement \n     set identified above, and (2) state-specific information on \n     the quality of care provided to children under Medicaid and \n     CHIP, including information collected through external \n     quality reviews of Medicaid managed care organizations (under \n     Section 1932) and Medicaid benchmark plans (under Section \n     1937), and CHIP benchmark plans (under Section 2103). Not \n     later than September 30, 2009, and annually thereafter, the \n     Secretary must collect, analyze and make publicly available \n     the information reported by states as described above.\n       (d) Demonstration Projects for Improving the Quality of \n     Children's Health Care and the Use of Health Information \n     Technology.\n       During FY2008 through FY2012, the Secretary must award not \n     more than 10 grants to states and child health providers to \n     conduct demonstration projects to evaluate promising ideas \n     for improving the quality of children's health care furnished \n     under Medicaid and CHIP. Such projects would include efforts \n     designed to: (1) experiment with and evaluate new measures of \n     the quality of children's health care (including testing the \n     validity and suitability for reporting of such measures), (2) \n     promote the use of health information technology in care \n     delivery for children, (3) evaluate provider-based models \n     that improve the delivery of services to children, including \n     care management for children with chronic conditions and the \n     use of evidence-based approaches to improve the \n     effectiveness, safety and efficiency of health care for \n     children, or (4) demonstrate the impact of the model \n     electronic health record format for children on improving \n     pediatric health, including the effects of chronic childhood \n     health conditions, and pediatric health care quality as well \n     as reducing health care costs.\n       In awarding these grants, the Secretary must ensure that \n     (1) only one demonstration project funded by such a grant \n     shall be conducted in a state, and (2) such demonstration \n     projects must be conducted evenly between states with large \n     urban areas and states with large rural areas. Grants may be \n     conducted on a multi-state basis, as needed.\n       Of the total amount appropriated for this new grant program \n     for a fiscal year (described below), $20 million must be used \n     to carry out these activities.\n       (e) Demonstration Projects for Reducing Childhood Obesity\n      Current Law\n       Greater awareness of the obesity crisis and its long-term \n     social and economic implications has encouraged policy makers \n     to fund an array of programs aimed at promoting physical \n     activity and appropriate nutrition. While many of these have \n     been state-based efforts, the federal government has actively \n     funded obesity research as well as health promotion campaigns \n     and public health surveillance systems.\n       Title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 USC) obliges \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ``conduct . . . \n     encourage, cooperate with, and render assistance to other \n     appropriate public authorities, scientific institutions, and \n     scientists in the conduct of, and promote the coordination \n     of, research, investigations, experiments, and \n     demonstrations, and studies relating to the causes, \n     diagnosis, treatment, control, and prevention of physical and \n     mental diseases and impairments''. In carrying out these \n     responsibilities, the Secretary is authorized to make grants-\n     in-aid to universities, hospitals, laboratories, other public \n     or private institutions, and to individuals for research \n     projects.\n       The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recently noted that \n     the fundamental problem plaguing national programs seeking to \n     address the obesity crisis is that these efforts ``remain \n     fragmented and small-scale''. Moreover, obesity prevention \n     programs remain largely uncoordinated. Although many federal \n     agencies are involved in overseeing different types of \n     obesity-related programs, including the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Department of \n     Agriculture, the National Institutes of Health, and \n     Department of Health and Human Services, NAS concluded \n     that the lack of a dedicated funding stream for obesity \n     prevention and inadequate coordination between federal \n     agencies has led to inefficient uses of resources or \n     unnecessary redundancies in programmatic efforts.\n       Another problem is that many federal funding streams \n     available to support healthy lifestyles among children have \n     been very narrowly focused on small target populations or \n     they have only addressed obesity indirectly. Examples of the \n     former include efforts which have exclusively targeted low-\n     income families (usually, Medicaid recipients); by contrast, \n     health education courses aimed at American Indians with Type \n     2 diabetes exemplify the types of federally-funded efforts \n     which have indirectly served as obesity prevention programs \n     but which have reached very limited numbers of individuals in \n     the aggregate.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of \n     the Centers for Medicare a Medicaid Services, shall conduct a \n     demonstration project to develop a comprehensive and \n     systematic model for reducing childhood obesity by awarding \n     grants to eligible entities to carry out such a project. The \n     model will (1) identify behavioral risk factors for obesity \n     among children; (2) identify needed clinical preventive and \n     screening benefits among those children identified as target \n     individuals on the basis of such risk factors; (3) provide \n     ongoing support to such target individuals and their families \n     to reduce risk factors and promote the appropriate use of \n     preventive and screening benefits; and (4) be designed to \n     improve health outcomes, satisfaction, quality of life, and \n     appropriate use of items and services for which medical \n     assistance is available under CHIP and Medicaid.\n       Eligible entities include a city, county, or Indian tribe; \n     a local or tribal educational agency; an accredited \n     university, college, or community college; a federally-\n     qualified health center; a local health department; a health \n     care provider; a community-based organization; or any other \n     entity determined appropriate by the Secretary, including a \n     consortium or partnership.\n       An eligible entity awarded a grant under this provision \n     shall use the funds to (1) carry out community-based \n     activities related to reducing childhood obesity, (2) carry \n     out age-appropriate school-based activities that are designed \n     to reduce childhood obesity, (3) carry out educational, \n     counseling, promotional, and training activities through the \n     local health care delivery systems, and (4) provide, through \n     qualified health professionals, training and supervision for \n     community health workers to engage in educational efforts \n     related to obesity.\n       Not later than 3 years after the Secretary implements the \n     demonstration project under this subsection, the Secretary \n     shall submit to Congress a report that describes the project, \n     evaluates the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the \n     project, evaluates beneficiary satisfaction under the \n     project, and includes any other information the Secretary \n     deems appropriate. $25 million is authorized for this \n     purpose.\n       (f) Development of Model Electronic Health Record Format \n     for Children Enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP.\n       Not later than January 1, 2009, the Secretary must \n     establish a program to encourage the development and \n     dissemination of a model electronic health record format for \n     children enrolled under state plans for Medicaid or CHIP. \n     Such an electronic health record would be (1) subject to \n     state laws, accessible to parents, caregivers and other \n     consumers for the sole purpose of demonstrating compliance \n     with school or leisure activity requirements, (2) designed to \n     allow interoperable exchanges that conform with federal and \n     state privacy and security requirements, (3) structured in a \n     manner that permits parents and caregivers to view and \n     understand the extent to which the care their children \n     receive is clinically appropriate and of high quality, and \n     (4) capable of being incorporated into, and otherwise \n     compatible with, other standards developed for electronic \n     health records. Of the total amount appropriated for this new \n     grant program for a fiscal year, $5 million must be used to \n     carry out these activities.\n       (g) Study of Pediatric Health and Health Care Quality \n     Measures.\n       Not later than July 1, 2009, the Institute of Medicine must \n     study and report to Congress on the extent and quality of \n     efforts to measure child health status and the quality of \n     health care for children across the age span and in relation \n     to preventive care, treatments for acute conditions, and \n     treatments to ameliorate or correct physical, mental, and \n     developmental conditions in children. In conducting this \n     study, the IOM must: (1) consider all the major national \n     population-based reporting systems sponsored by the federal \n     government, including reporting requirements under federal \n     grant programs and national population surveys and estimates \n     conducted directly by the federal government, (2) identify \n     the information regarding child health and health care \n     quality that each system is designed to capture and generate, \n     the study and reporting periods covered by each system, and \n     the extent to which the information is made widely available \n     through publication, (3) identify gaps in knowledge related \n     to children's health status, health disparities among \n     subgroups of children, the effects of social conditions on \n     children's health status and use and effectiveness of health \n     care, and the relationship between child health status and \n     family income, family stability and preservation, and \n     children's school readiness and educational achievement and \n     attainment, and (4) make recommendations regarding improving \n     and strengthening the timeliness, quality, and public \n     transparency and accessibility of information about child \n     health and health care\n\n[[Page S10187]]\n\n     quality. Of the total amount appropriated for this new grant \n     program, up to $1 million must be used to carry out these \n     activities.\n       (h) Rule of Construction.\n       No evidence-based quality measure developed, published, or \n     used as a basis of measurement or reporting under this \n     section may be used to establish an irrebuttable presumption \n     regarding either the medical necessity of care or the maximum \n     permissible coverage for any individual child who is eligible \n     for and receiving assistance under Medicaid or CHIP.\n       (i) Appropriations.\n       An appropriation of $45 million for FY2008 through FY2012 \n     would be made for the purpose of carrying out the provisions \n     of this section. Such funds would remain available until \n     expended.\n       The provision would also use the federal medical assistance \n     percentage (FMAP) applicable to a given state to determine \n     the federal share of costs incurred by states for the \n     development or modification of existing claims processing and \n     retrieval systems as is necessary for the efficient \n     collection and reporting on child health measures.\n\n\n  Section 502. Improved information regarding access to overage under \n                                  CHIP\n\n     Current Law\n       Under SCHIP, states must assess the operation of the SCHIP \n     state plan in each fiscal Year, including the progress made \n     in reducing the number of uncovered low-income children. They \n     must also report to the Secretary of HHS, by January 1 \n     following the end of the fiscal year, the results of that \n     assessment.\n       Federal regulations stipulate that each annual report \n     include the following additional information: (1) progress in \n     meeting strategic objectives and performance goals identified \n     in the state SCHIP plan, (2) effectiveness of policies to \n     discourage the institution of public coverage for private \n     coverage, (3) identification of successes and barriers in \n     state plan design and implementation, and the approaches the \n     state is considering to overcome these barriers, (4) progress \n     in addressing any specific issues (such as outreach) that the \n     state plan proposed to periodically monitor and assess, (5) \n     an updated 3-year budget, including any changes in the \n     sources of non-federal share of state pan expenditures, (6) \n     identification of total state expenditures for family \n     coverage and total number of children and adults, \n     respectively, provided family coverage during the preceding \n     fiscal year, and (7) current income standards and \n     methodologies for its SCHIP Medicaid expansion program, \n     separate SCHIP program, and its regular Medicaid program, as \n     appropriate.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       (a) Inclusion of Process and Access Measures in Annual \n     State Reports.\n       The provision would require each state to include the \n     following information in its annual CHIP report to the \n     Secretary of HHS: (1) eligibility criteria, enrollment, and \n     retention data (including information on continuity of \n     coverage or duration of benefits), (2) data regarding the \n     extent to which the state uses process measures with respect \n     to determining the eligibility of children, including \n     measures such as 12-months of continuous eligibility, self-\n     declaration of income for applications or renewals, or \n     presumptive eligibility, (3) data regarding denials of \n     eligibility and redeterminations of eligibility, (4) data \n     regarding access to primary and specialty services, access to \n     networks of care, and care coordination provided under the \n     state CHIP plan, using quality of care and consumer \n     satisfaction measures included in the Consumer Assessment of \n     Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey, (5) if the \n     state provides child health assistance in the form of premium \n     assistance for the purchase of coverage under a group health \n     plan, data regarding the provision of such assistance, \n     including the extent to which employer-sponsored health \n     insurance coverage is available for children eligible for \n     CHIP, the range of the monthly amount of such assistance \n     provided on behalf or a child or family, the number of \n     children or families provided such assistance on a monthly \n     basis, the income of the children or families provided such \n     assistance, the benefits and cost-sharing protection provided \n     under the state CHIP plan to supplement the coverage \n     purchased with such premium assistance, the effective \n     strategies the state engages in to reduce any administrative \n     barriers to the provision of such assistance, and, the \n     effects, if any, of the provision of such assistance on \n     preventing the coverage under CHIP from substituting for \n     coverage provided under employer-sponsored health insurance \n     offered in the state, and (6) to the extent applicable, a \n     description of any state activities that are designed to \n     reduce the number of uncovered children in the state, \n     including through a state health insurance connector program \n     or support for innovative private health coverage \n     initiatives.\n       (b) GAG Study and Report on Access to Primary and Specialty \n     Services.\n       The provision would require GAO to conduct a study of \n     children's access to primary and specialty services under \n     Medicaid and CHIP, including (1) the extent to which \n     providers are willing to treat children eligible for such \n     programs, (2) information on such children's access to \n     networks of care, (3) geographic availability of primary and \n     specialty services under such programs, (4) the extent to \n     which care coordination is provided for children's care under \n     Medicaid and CHIP, and (5) as appropriate, information on the \n     degree of availability of services for children under such \n     programs.\n       In addition, not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, GAO must submit a report to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress on this study that \n     includes recommendations for such federal and state \n     legislative and administrative changes as GAO determines are \n     necessary to address any barriers to access to children's \n     care under Medicaid and CHIP that may exist.\n\n\nSection 503. Application of certain managed care quality safeguards to \n                                  CHIP\n\n     Current Law\n       A number of sections of the Social Security Act apply to \n     states under title XXI (SCHIP) in the same manner as they \n     apply to a state under title XIX (Medicaid). These include:\n       Section 1902(a)(4)(C) (relating to conflict of interest \n     standards).\n       Paragraphs (2), (16), and (17) of section 1903(i) (relating \n     to limitations on payment).\n       Section 1903(w) (relating to limitations on provider taxes \n     and donations).\n       Section 1920A (relating to presumptive eligibility for \n     children).\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would add the same requirements for CHIP \n     managed care entities as currently exist under Medicaid. \n     Specifically, the provision would add reference to Medicaid's \n     statutory requirements on: the process for plan enrollment, \n     termination, and change of enrollment; the type of \n     information provided to enrollees and potential enrollees on \n     providers, covered services, enrollee rights, and other forms \n     of information; beneficiary protections; quality assurance \n     standards; protections against fraud and abuse; and sanctions \n     against managed care plans for noncompliance.\n\n                        Title VI--Miscellaneous\n\n\n  Section 601. Technical correction regarding current State authority \n                             under Medicaid\n\n     Current Law\n       States may provide SCHIP through an expansion of their \n     Medicaid programs. Expenditures for such populations of \n     targeted low-income children are matched at the enhanced FMAP \n     rate and are paid out of SCHIP allotments.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       With respect to expenditures for Medicaid for fiscal years \n     2007 and 2008 only, a state may elect (1) to cover optional \n     poverty-related children and, may apply less restrictive \n     income methodologies to such individuals (via authority in \n     Section 1902(r) or through Section 1931 (b )(2)( C)), for \n     which the regular Medicaid FMAP, rather than the enhanced \n     FMAP applicable to CHIP, would be used to determine the \n     federal share of such expenditures, or (2) to receive the \n     regular Medicaid FMAP, rather than the enhanced CHIP FMAP, \n     for CHIP children under an expansion of the state's Medicaid \n     program. This provision would be repealed as of October 1, \n     2008 (i.e., the beginning of fiscal year 2009). States \n     electing these options would be ``held harmless'' for related \n     expenditures in FY2007 and FY2008, once this repeal takes \n     effect.\n\n\n         Section 602. Payment Error Rate Measurement (``PERM'')\n\n     Current Law\n       P.L. 107-300 requires the heads of Federal agencies \n     annually to review programs they oversee that are susceptible \n     to significant erroneous payments, and to estimate the amount \n     of improper payments, to report those estimates to Congress, \n     and to submit a report on actions the agency is taking to \n     reduce erroneous expenditures.\n       The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the \n     federal agency within HHS that administers the Medicaid and \n     SCHIP programs, issued an interim final rule with comment \n     period on August 28, 2006, regarding Payment Error Rate \n     Measurement (PERM) for the Medicaid and SCHIP programs. This \n     rule was effective on October 1, 2006. In addition to P.L. \n     107-300, this regulation points to Sections 1102, 1902(a)(6) \n     and 2107(b)(1) of the Social Security Act which contains the \n     Secretary's general rulemaking authority and obligation of \n     the states to provide information, as the Secretary may \n     require, to monitor program performance. Section \n     1902(a)(27)(B) also requires states to require providers to \n     furnish State Medicaid Agencies and the Secretary with \n     information regarding payments claimed by Medicaid providers \n     for furnishing Medicaid services. Payment error rates will be \n     calculated for fee-for-service (FFS) claims, managed care \n     claims and for eligibility determinations. The preamble to \n     this regulation notes that CMS will hire Federal contractors \n     to review Medicaid and SCHIP FFS and managed care claims and \n     to calculate the state-specific and national error rates for \n     both programs. States will calculate the state-specific \n     eligibility error rates. Based on those rates, the Federal \n     contractor will calculate the national eligibility error rate \n     for each program. CMS plans to sample a subset of states each \n     year rather than measure every state every year.\n       With respect to Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility reviews \n     under PERM, states selected for review in a given year must \n     conduct reviews of a statistically valid random sample of \n     beneficiary claims to determine if improper payments were \n     made based on errors in the state agency's eligibility \n     determinations. States must have a CMS-approved sampling \n     plan. In addition to reporting error\n\n[[Page S10188]]\n\n     rates, states must also submit a corrective action plan based \n     on its error rate analysis, and must return overpayments of \n     federal funds.\n       Medicaid Eligibility Quality Control (MEQC) is operated by \n     State Medicaid agencies to monitor and improve the \n     administration of its Medicaid program. The traditional MEQC \n     program is based on State reviews of Medicaid beneficiaries \n     identified through a statistically reliable statewide sample \n     of cases selected from the eligibility files. These reviews \n     are conducted to determine whether the sampled cases meet \n     applicable Title XIX eligibility requirements and to \n     determine if a State has made erroneous excess payments in \n     its program. ``Erroneous excess payments for medical \n     assistance'' reflect: a) payments made on behalf of \n     ineligible individuals and families, and b) overpayments on \n     behalf of eligible individuals and families by reason of \n     error in determining the amount of expenditures for medical \n     care required of an individual or family as a condition of \n     eligibility.\n       The SCHIP statute specifies that federal SCHIP funds can be \n     used for SCHIP health insurance coverage, called child health \n     assistance that meets certain requirements. States may also \n     provide benefits to SCHIP children, called targeted low-\n     income children, through enrollment in Medicaid. Apart from \n     these benefit payments, SCHIP payments for four other \n     specific health care activities can be made, including: (1) \n     other child health assistance for targeted low-income \n     children; (2) health services initiatives to improve the \n     health of targeted low-income children and other low-income \n     children; (3) outreach activities; and (4) other reasonable \n     administrative costs. For a given fiscal year, SCHIP statute \n     specifies that payments for these four other specific health \n     care activities cannot exceed 10% of the total amount of \n     expenditures for benefits (excluding payments for services \n     rendered during periods of presumptive eligibility under \n     Medicaid) and other specific health care activities combined.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would apply a federal matching rate of 90 \n     percent to expenditures related to administration of PERM \n     requirements applicable to CHIP.\n       The provision would also exclude from the 10% cap on CHIP \n     administrative costs all expenditures related to the \n     administration of PERM requirements applicable to CHIP in \n     accordance with P.L. 107-300, existing regulations, and any \n     related or successor guidance or regulations.\n       In addition, the Secretary must not calculate or publish \n     any national or state-specific error rate based on the \n     application of PERM requirements to CHIP until after the date \n     that is 6 months after the date on which a final rule \n     implementing such requirements (described below) is in effect \n     for all states. Any calculation of a national error rate or a \n     state specific error rate after such a final rule is in \n     effect for all states may only be inclusive of errors, as \n     defined in such final rule or in guidance issued within a \n     reasonable time frame after the effective date for such final \n     rule that includes detailed guidance for the specific \n     methodology for error determinations.\n       The final rule implementing the PERM requirements must \n     include: (1) clearly defined criteria for errors for both \n     states and providers, (2) a clearly defined process for \n     appealing error determinations by review contractors, and (3) \n     clearly defined responsibilities and deadlines for states in \n     implementing any corrective action plans.\n       After the final PERM rule is in effect for all states, a \n     state for which the PERM requirements were first in effect \n     under an interim final rule for FY2007 may elect to accept \n     any payment error rate determined in whole or in part for the \n     state on the basis of data for that fiscal year or may elect \n     to not have an payment error rate determined on the basis of \n     such data and, instead, must be treated as if FY2010 were the \n     first year for which the PERM requirements apply to the \n     state.\n       If the final PERM rule is not in effect for all states by \n     July 1, 2008, a state for which the PERM requirements were \n     first in effect under an interim final rule for FY2008 may \n     elect to accept any payment error rate determined in whole or \n     in part for the state on the basis of data for that fiscal \n     year, or may elect to not have any payment error rate \n     determined on the basis of such data and, instead, must be \n     treated as if FY2011 were the first fiscal year for which the \n     PERM requirements apply to the state.\n       In addition, the provision would require the Secretary to \n     review the Medicaid Eligibility Quality Control (MEQC) \n     requirements with the PERM requirements and coordinate \n     consistent implementation of both sets of requirements, while \n     reducing redundancies. A state may elect, for purposes of \n     determining the erroneous excess payments for medical \n     assistance ratio applicable to the state under MEQC, to \n     substitute data resulting from the application of PERM \n     requirements after the final PERM rule is in effect for all \n     states for the data used for the MEQC requirements.\n       The Secretary must also establish state-specific sample \n     sizes for application of the PERM requirements with respect \n     to CHIP for FY2009 and thereafter, on the basis of \n     information as the Secretary determines is appropriate. In \n     establishing such sample sizes, the Secretary must, to the \n     greatest extent possible (1) minimize the administrative cost \n     burden on states under Medicaid and CHIP, and (2) maintain \n     state flexibility to manage these programs.\n\n\n    Section 603. Elimination of counting Medicaid child presumptive \n             eligibility costs against Title XXI Allotment\n\n     Current Law\n       Under Medicaid presumptive eligibility rules, states are \n     allowed to temporarily enroll (for up to 2 months) children \n     whose family income appears to be below applicable Medicaid \n     income standards, until a formal determination of eligibility \n     is made. Payments on behalf of Medicaid children during \n     periods of presumptive eligibility are matched at the regular \n     Medicaid FMAP, but are paid out of state SCHIP allotments.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would strike the language in existing CHIP \n     statute that sets the federal share of costs incurred during \n     periods of presumptive eligibility for children at the \n     Medicaid FMAP rate, and also strikes the language that allows \n     payment out of CHIP allotments for Medicaid benefits received \n     by Medicaid children during periods of presumptive \n     eligibility.\n\n\n                 Section 604. Improving data collection\n\n     Current Law\n       As discussed in Section 102, the percentage of the SCHIP \n     appropriation that is allotted to individual states is based \n     primarily on state-level estimates of (1) the number of low-\n     income children and (2) the number of uninsured low-income \n     children, based on a three-year average of the Annual Social \n     and Economic (ASEC) Supplements (formerly known as the March \n     supplements) to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey \n     (CPS). Based on these CPS estimates, some states' share of \n     the available national allotment in the second year of SCHIP \n     (FY1999) was going to differ markedly from the prior year's \n     (e.g., a share of the available national allotment in FY1999 \n     that would have been approximately 40% lower or higher than \n     in FY1998). As a result, legislation was enacted to base the \n     FY1999 SCHIP allotments on the states' share of the available \n     national allotment as calculated for FY1998.\n       Separate legislation was also enacted to add two new floors \n     and a ceiling to ensure that a state's share of the available \n     national allotment did not change by more than certain \n     amounts, as compared to the state's prior-year share and the \n     state's FY1998/FY1999 share.\n       Another piece of legislation was also enacted that required \n     appropriate adjustments to the CPS (1) to produce \n     statistically reliable annual state data on the number of \n     low-income children who do not have health insurance \n     coverage, so that real changes in the uninsurance rates of \n     children can reasonably be detected; (2) to produce data that \n     categorizes such children by family income, age, and race or \n     ethnicity; and (3) where appropriate, to expand the sample \n     size used in the state sampling units, to expand the number \n     of sampling units in a state, and to include an appropriate \n     verification element. For this purpose, $10 million was \n     appropriated annually, beginning in FY2000. Because of this \n     legislation, the number of sampled households in the ASEC CPS \n     increased by about 50% (34,500 households). Even with the \n     sample expansion, the margins of error of the state-level \n     estimates of the number of low-income children, and \n     particularly the estimates of low-income children without \n     health insurance, can be relatively high, especially in \n     smaller states.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       Besides the $10 million provided annually for the CPS since \n     FY2000, an additional $10 million (for a total of $20 million \n     additionally) is appropriated. In addition to the current-law \n     requirements of the additional appropriation, for data \n     collection beginning in FY2008, in appropriate consultation \n     with the HHS Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce shall do \n     the following:\n       Make appropriate adjustments to the CPS to develop more \n     accurate state-specific estimates of the number of children \n     enrolled in CHIP or Medicaid;\n       Make appropriate adjustments to the CPS to improve the \n     survey estimates used to compile the state-specific and \n     national number of low-income children without health \n     insurance for purposes of determining annual CHIP allotments, \n     and for making payments to states from the CHIP Incentive \n     Pool, the CHIP Contingency Fund, and, to the extent \n     applicable to a State, from the block grant set aside for \n     CHIP payments on behalf of parents in FY2010 through FY2012;\n       Include health insurance survey information in the American \n     Community Survey (ACS) related to children;\n       Assess whether ACS estimates, once such survey data are \n     first available, produce more reliable estimates than the CPS \n     for CHIP allotments and payments;\n       On the basis of that assessment, recommend to the HHS \n     Secretary whether ACS estimates should be used in lieu of, or \n     in some combination with, CPS estimates for CHIP purposes; \n     and\n       Continue making the adjustments to expansion of the sample \n     size used in State sampling units, the number of sampling \n     units in a State, and using an appropriate verification \n     element.\n       If the Commerce Secretary recommends to the HHS Secretary \n     that ACS estimates should be used instead of, or in \n     combination with, CPS estimates for CHIP purposes, the HHS \n     Secretary may provide a transition period for using ACS \n     estimates, provided that\n\n[[Page S10189]]\n\n     the transition is implemented in a way that avoids adverse \n     impacts on states.\n\n\n        Section 605. Deficit Reduction Act Technical Correction\n\n       State Flexibility in Benefit Packages.\n     Current Law\n       Under the Early and Periodic, Screening, Diagnostic and \n     Treatment (EPSDT) benefit under Medicaid, most children under \n     age 21 receive comprehensive basic screening services (i.e., \n     well-child visits including age-appropriate immunizations) as \n     well as dental, vision and hearing services. In addition, \n     EPSDT guarantees access to all federally coverable services \n     necessary to treat a problem or condition among eligible \n     individuals.\n       Under Medicaid, categorically needy (CN) eligibility groups \n     include families with children, the elderly, certain \n     individuals with disabilities, and certain other pregnant \n     women and children who meet applicable financial eligibility \n     standards. Some CN eligibility groups must be covered while \n     others are optional. Medically needy (MN) groups include the \n     same types of individuals, but different, typically higher \n     financial standards apply. All MN eligibility groups are \n     optional.\n       The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA; P.L. 109-171) gave \n     states the option to provide Medicaid to state-specified \n     groups through enrollment in benchmark and benchmark-\n     equivalent coverage which is nearly identical to plans \n     available under SCHIP (described above). For any child under \n     age 19 in one of the major mandatory and optional CN \n     eligibility groups (defined in Section 1902(a)(10)(A)), wrap-\n     around benefits to the DRA benchmark and benchmark-equivalent \n     coverage includes EPSDT (described above). In traditional \n     Medicaid, EPSDT is available to individuals under age 21 in \n     CN groups, and may be offered to individuals under 21 in MN \n     groups.\n       DRA identifies a number of groups as exempt from mandatory \n     enrollment in benchmark or benchmark equivalent plans. One \n     such exempted group is children in foster care receiving \n     child welfare services under Part B of title IV of the Social \n     Security Act and children receiving foster care or adoption \n     assistance under Part E of such title.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would require that EPSDT be covered for any \n     individual under age 21 who is eligible for Medicaid through \n     the state plan under one of the major mandatory and optional \n     CN groups and is enrolled in benchmark or benchmark-\n     equivalent plans authorized under DRA. The provision would \n     also give states flexibility in providing coverage of EPSDT \n     services through the issuer of benchmark or benchmark-\n     equivalent coverage or otherwise.\n       The provision would also make a correction to the reference \n     to children in foster care receiving child welfare services.\n       Finally, not later than 30 days after the date the \n     Secretary approves a state plan amendment to provide \n     benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage under Medicaid, \n     the Secretary must publish in the Federal Register and on the \n     internet website of CMS, a list of the provisions in Title \n     XIX that the Secretary has determined do not apply in order \n     to enable the state to carry out such a state plan amendment \n     and the reason for each such determination.\n       The amendments made by this provision would become \n     effective as if included in Section 6044(a) of the DRA (i.e., \n     March 31, 2006).\n\n\n        Section 606. Elimination of confusing program references\n\n     Current Law\n       P.L. 106-113 directed the Secretary of HHS or any other \n     Federal officer or employee, with respect to references to \n     the program under Title XXI of the Social Security Act, in \n     any publication or official communication to use the term \n     ``SCHIP'' instead of ``CHIP'' and to use the term ``State \n     children's health insurance program'' instead of ``children's \n     health insurance program.''\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would repeal the section in P.L 106-113 \n     providing the program references to ``SCHIP'' and ``State \n     children's health insurance program'' for official \n     publication and communication purposes.\n\n\n            Section 607. Mental Health Parity in CHIP Plans\n\n     Current Law\n       In 1996, Congress passed the Mental Health Parity Act \n     (MHPA) that established new federal standards for mental \n     health coverage offered by group health plans, most of which \n     are employment-based. Under provisions included in the 1997 \n     Balanced Budget Act (P.L. 105-33), Medicaid managed care \n     plans and SCHIP programs must comply with the requirements of \n     MHPA.\n       Medicaid expansions under SCHIP follow Medicaid rules. \n     Thus, when such expansions provide for enrollment in Medicaid \n     managed care plans, the MHPA applies. Separate state programs \n     under SCHIP follow SCHIP rules that have broader application \n     than the Medicaid rules. In separate state SCHIP programs, to \n     the extent that a health insurance issuer offers group health \n     insurance coverage, which can include, but is not limited to \n     managed care, the MHPA applies.\n       Under MHPA, Medicaid and SCHIP plans may define what \n     constitutes mental health benefits (if any). The MHPA \n     prohibits group plans from imposing annual and lifetime \n     dollar limits on mental health coverage that are more \n     restrictive than those applicable to medical and surgical \n     coverage. Full parity is not required, that is, group plans \n     may still impose more restrictive treatment limits (e.g., \n     with respect to total number of outpatient visits or \n     inpatient days) or cost-sharing requirements on mental health \n     coverage compared to their medical and surgical services.\n       Under Medicaid managed care, state Medicaid agencies \n     contract with managed care organizations (MCOs) to provide a \n     specified set of benefits to enrolled beneficiaries. These \n     MCOs may be paid under a variety of arrangements, but are \n     frequently reimbursed on the basis of a pre-determined \n     monthly fee (called a capitation rate) for each enrolled \n     beneficiary. The contracted benefits may include all, some, \n     or none of the mandatory and optional mental health services \n     covered under the state Medicaid plan. When Medicaid managed \n     care plans do not include all covered mental health benefits, \n     these additional services are sometimes ``carved out'' to a \n     separate, specialized behavioral health managed care entity \n     (usually subject to its own prepaid capitation rates), or may \n     be provided in the fee-for-service setting, in which Medicaid \n     providers are paid directly by the state Medicaid agency for \n     each covered service delivered to a Medicaid beneficiary. All \n     prepaid Medicaid managed care contracts that cover medical/\n     surgical benefits and mental health benefits must comply with \n     the MHPA without exemptions. The MHPA does not apply to fee-\n     for-service arrangements because state Medicaid agencies do \n     not meet the definition of a group health plan.\n       With respect to covered benefits, separate SCHIP programs \n     tend to look more like private insurance models than like \n     Medicaid. That is, these programs are more likely to cover \n     traditional benefits (e.g., inpatient hospital services, \n     physician services) that would be found in employer-based \n     health insurance plans than certain service categories that \n     are largely unique to Medicaid (e.g., EPSDT, residential \n     treatment facilities, intermediate care facilities for the \n     mentally retarded or ICF/MRs, and institutions for mental \n     disease or IMDs). Most separate SCHIP programs also provide \n     services through managed care plans, although this situation \n     varies by state. Again, all or some covered mental health \n     services may be included in MCO contracts, or carved out to \n     specialized behavioral health managed care plans, or may be \n     provided on a fee-for-service basis.\n       Under CHIP, states may provide coverage under their \n     Medicaid programs (MXP), create a new separate SCHIP program \n     (SSP), or both. Under SSPs, states may elect any of three \n     benefit options: (1) a benchmark plan, (2) a benchmark-\n     equivalent plan, or (3) any other plan that the Secretary of \n     HHS deems would provide appropriate coverage for the target \n     population (called Secretary-approved benefit plans). \n     Benchmark plans include (1) the standard Blue Cross/Blue \n     Shield preferred provider option under FEHBP, (2) the \n     coverage generally available to state employees, and (3) the \n     coverage offered by the largest commercial HMO in the state.\n       Benchmark-equivalent plans must cover basic benefits (i.e., \n     inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physician \n     services, lab/x-ray, and well-child care including \n     immunizations), and must include at least 75% of the \n     actuarial value of coverage under the selected benchmark plan \n     for specific additional benefits (i.e., prescription drugs, \n     mental health services, vision care and hearing services).\n     Explanation of Provision\n       This section prohibits discriminatory limits on mental \n     health care in separate CHIP plans by directing that any \n     financial requirements or treatment limitations that apply to \n     mental health or substance abuse services must be no more \n     restrictive than the financial requirements or treatment \n     limits that apply to other medical services. It also \n     eliminates a current law provision that authorizes states to \n     reduce the mental health coverage provided to 75 percent of \n     the coverage provided in CHIP benchmark plans.\n\n\n                   Section 608. Dental Health Grants\n\n     Current Law\n       Under SCHIP, states may provide coverage under their \n     Medicaid programs (MXP), create a new separate SCHIP program \n     (SSP), or both. Under SSPs, states may elect any of three \n     benefit options: (1) a benchmark plan, (2) a benchmark-\n     equivalent plan, or (3) any other plan that the Secretary of \n     HHS deems would provide appropriate coverage for the target \n     population (called Secretary-approved benefit plans). \n     Benchmark plans include (1) the standard Blue Cross/Blue \n     Shield preferred provider option under FEHBP, (2) the \n     coverage generally available to state employees, and (3) the \n     coverage offered by the largest commercial HMO in the state.\n       Benchmark-equivalent plans must cover basic benefits (i.e., \n     inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physician \n     services, lab/x-ray, and well-child care including \n     immunizations), and must include at least 75% of the \n     actuarial value of coverage under the selected benchmark plan \n     for specific additional benefits (i.e., prescription drugs, \n     mental health services, vision care and hearing services).\n       SCHIP regulations specify that, regardless of the type of \n     SCHIP health benefits coverage, states must provide coverage \n     of well-baby and well-child care (as defined by the state), \n     age-appropriate immunizations based on recommendations of the \n     Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and \n     emergency services.\n\n[[Page S10190]]\n\n     Explanation of Provision\n       This section provides up to $200 million in federal grants \n     for states to improve the availability of dental services and \n     strengthen dental coverage for children covered under CHIP. \n     States that receive grants would be required to maintain \n     prior levels of spending for dental services provided under \n     CHIP.\n\n\n  Section 609. Application of Prospective Payment System for Services \nProvided by Federally-Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current Medicaid law, federally-qualified health \n     centers (FQHCs) and rural health clinics (RHCs) are paid \n     based on a prospective payment system. Beginning in FY200l, \n     per visit payments were based on 100% of average costs during \n     1999 and 2000 adjusted for changes in the scope of services \n     furnished. (Special rules applied to entities first \n     established after 2000). For subsequent years, the per visit \n     payment for all FQHCs and RHCs equals the amounts for the \n     preceding fiscal year increased by the percentage increase in \n     the Medicare Economic Index applicable to primary care \n     services, and adjusted for any changes in the scope of \n     services furnished during that fiscal year. In managed care \n     contracts, states are required to make supplemental payments \n     to the facility equal to the difference between the \n     contracted amount and the cost-based amounts.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       This section would establish a prospective payment system \n     in CHIP for FQHCs and RHCs similar to the payment system \n     established by the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits \n     Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) applicable \n     under Medicaid law. States that operate separate or \n     combination CHIP programs would be required to reimburse \n     FQHCs and RHCs based on the Medicaid Prospective Payment \n     System, starting in FY 09. A one-time appropriation of $5 \n     million will be made available to the Secretary of HHS to be \n     provided to affected states to enable them to transition to \n     the new payment system on the affected states. The Secretary \n     would be required to monitor the impact of the application of \n     the payment system on states and report to Congress within \n     two years of implementation on any effect on access to \n     benefits, provider payment rates, or scope of benefits \n     offered by affected states.\n\n                     Title VII--Revenue Provisions\n\n                       Title VIII--Effective Date\n\n\n                      Section 801. Effective date\n\n     Current Law\n       No provision.\n     Explanation of Provision\n       The effective date of this bill except with respect to \n     section 301 would be October 1, 2007, whether or not final \n     regulations to carry out provisions in the bill have been \n     promulgated by that date. In the case of both current state \n     CHIP and Medicaid plans, if the Secretary of HHS determines \n     that a state must pass new state legislation to implement the \n     requirements of this bill, the state's existing CHIP and/or \n     Medicaid plans, if applicable, would not be considered to be \n     out of compliance solely on the basis of its failure to meet \n     such requirements before the first day of the first calendar \n     quarter beginning after the close of the first regular \n     session of the state legislature that begins after the date \n     of enactment of this bill. In the case of a state that has a \n     2-year legislative session, each year of such session must be \n     considered to be a separate regular session of the state \n     legislature. With respect to section 301, the effective date \n     will be October 1, 2008.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Dodd (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \n        Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Lieberman)):\n  S. 1894. A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \nprovide family and medical leave to primary caregivers of \nservicemembers with combat-related injuries; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Support \nfor Injured Servicemembers Act of 2007. This bill will implement one of \nthe key recommendations of the President's Commission on Care for \nAmerica's Returning Wounded Warriors. First of all, I commend former \nSenator Bob Dole, former Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna \nShalala, and the distinguished members of the Commission for their \nthoughtfulness and thorough work on this critically important matter.\n  More than 20 years ago, I began the effort to bring job protection to \nhard-working Americans so they wouldn't have to choose between the \nfamily they love and the job they need. This effort, after more than \nseven years, three presidents, and two vetoes, eventually led to the \nenactment of the Family Medical Leave Act, FMLA, which provides 12 \nweeks of unpaid leave for eligible employees to care for a newborn or \nadopted child, their own serious illness or that of a loved one. Since \nits passage, I have worked to expand this act to cover more workers and \nto provide for wage replacement, so that more employees can afford to \ntake leave when necessary.\n  Mr. President, it is essential that we do everything possible to \nsupport our troops and to allow their loved ones to be with them as \nthey recover from a combat-related injury or illness. That is why we \nmust expand and improve leave benefits to those caring for our injured \nor ill servicemembers. The bill I introduce today provides up to 6 \nmonths of FMLA leave for primary caregivers of servicemembers who \nsuffer from a combat-related injury or illness. FMLA currently provides \nfor 3 months of unpaid leave to a spouse, parent or child acting as a \ncaregiver for a person with a serious illness. However, some of those \ninjured in service to our country rely on other family members or \nfriends to care for them as they recover. This legislation allows these \nother primary caregivers, such as siblings, cousins, friends or \nsignificant others to take leave from their employment when our \nreturning heroes need them most.\n  Our troops are giving their all on the battlefield. The very least \nour Government owes them is its total support for their family and \nmedical needs. While FMLA has provided critical support to more than 50 \nmillion American families, I will not rest until we are able to \nmodernize this statute to cover our wounded warriors. Plain and simple, \nthe loved ones of these brave men and women should be allowed to care \nfor them without the fear of losing their job.\n  I am pleased that I am joined today by Senators Ben Nelson, Kennedy, \nReed and Lieberman in introducing the Support for Injured \nServicemembers Act of 2007 and ask for the support of all my colleagues \nfor this critically important effort to care for our returning wounded \nwarriors and their loved ones.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. \n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1894\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 282\n\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease (known as ``PKD'') is 1 \n     of the most prevalent life-threatening genetic diseases in \n     the United States, is a severe, dominantly inherited disease \n     that has a devastating impact, in both human and economic \n     terms, on people of all ages, and affects equally people of \n     all races, sexes, nationalities, geographic locations, and \n     income levels;\n\n[[Page S10192]]\n\n       Whereas, based on prevalence estimates by the National \n     Institutes of Health, it is estimated that about 600,000 \n     patients in the United States have a genetic inheritance from \n     1 or both parents for polycystic kidney disease, and that \n     countless additional friends, loved ones, spouses, and \n     caregivers must shoulder the physical, emotional, and \n     financial burdens that polycystic kidney disease causes;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease, for which there is no \n     treatment or cure, is the leading genetic cause of kidney \n     failure in the United States and the 4th leading cause \n     overall;\n       Whereas the vast majority of polycystic kidney disease \n     patients reach kidney failure at an average age of 53, \n     causing a severe strain on dialysis and kidney \n     transplantation resources and on the delivery of health care \n     in the United States, as the largest segment of the \n     population of the United States, the ``baby boomers'', \n     continues to age;\n       Whereas end stage renal disease is one of the fastest \n     growing components of the Medicare budget, and polycystic \n     kidney disease contributes to that cost by an estimated \n     $2,000,000,000 annually for dialysis, kidney transplantation, \n     and related therapies;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disease \n     that causes damage to the kidney and the cardiovascular, \n     endocrine, hepatic, and gastrointestinal organ systems and \n     instills in patients a fear of an unknown future with a life-\n     threatening genetic disease and apprehension over possible \n     genetic discrimination;\n       Whereas the severity of the symptoms of polycystic kidney \n     disease and the limited public awareness of the disease cause \n     many patients to live in denial and forego regular visits to \n     their physicians or to avoid following good health management \n     which would help avoid more severe complications when kidney \n     failure occurs;\n       Whereas people who have chronic, life-threatening diseases \n     like polycystic kidney disease have a predisposition to \n     depression and its resultant consequences due to their \n     anxiety over pain, suffering, and premature death;\n       Whereas the Senate and taxpayers of the United States \n     desire to see treatments and cures for disease and would like \n     to see results from investments in research conducted by the \n     National Institutes of Health (NIH) and from such initiatives \n     as the NIH Roadmap to the Future;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a verifiable example \n     of how collaboration, technological innovation, scientific \n     momentum, and public-private partnerships can generate \n     therapeutic interventions that directly benefit polycystic \n     kidney disease sufferers, save billions of Federal dollars \n     under Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs for dialysis, \n     kidney transplants, immunosuppressant drugs, and related \n     therapies, and make available several thousand openings on \n     the kidney transplant waiting list;\n       Whereas improvements in diagnostic technology and the \n     expansion of scientific knowledge about polycystic kidney \n     disease have led to the discovery of the 3 primary genes that \n     cause polycystic kidney disease and the 3 primary protein \n     products of the genes and to the understanding of cell \n     structures and signaling pathways that cause cyst growth that \n     has produced multiple polycystic kidney disease clinical drug \n     trials;\n       Whereas there are thousands of volunteers nationwide who \n     are dedicated to expanding essential research, fostering \n     public awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney \n     disease, educating polycystic kidney disease patients and \n     their families about the disease to improve their treatment \n     and care, providing appropriate moral support, and \n     encouraging people to become organ donors; and\n       Whereas these volunteers engage in an annual national \n     awareness event held during the 3rd week of September, and \n     such a week would be an appropriate time to recognize \n     National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of September 9-16, 2007, as \n     ``National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of a national week to \n     raise public awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney \n     disease (known as ``PKD'');\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research into a cure \n     for polycystic kidney disease; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to support National Polycystic Kidney \n     Disease Awareness Week through appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities, to promote public awareness of polycystic kidney \n     disease and to foster understanding of the impact of the \n     disease on patients and their families.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Hatch to \nintroduce a resolution to increase awareness of Polycystic Kidney \nDisease, PKD, a common and life threatening genetic illness.\n  Over 600,000 people have been diagnosed with PKD nationwide including \n10,000 people in my home State of Wisconsin. There is no treatment or \ncure for PKD. Families and friends struggle to fight this disease and \nprovide unwavering support to their loved ones suffering from PKD.\n  But there is hope. The PKD Foundation has led the fight for increased \nresearch and patient education. Recent studies have led to the \ndiscovery of the genes that cause PKD as well as promising clinical \ndrug trials for treatment. More needs to be done and the Government \nwants to help.\n  In order to increase public awareness of this fatal disease, I \npropose that September 9 through 16 be designated as ``National \nPolycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week.'' This week coincides with \nthe annual walk for PKD which takes place every September. In \nWisconsin, residents gather across the State to take part in this very \nspecial walk.\n  Increasing awareness will help all those affected by this terrible \ndisease. I hope my colleagues will support this important resolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, along with \nmy colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Herb Kohl, a resolution to \ndesignate the week of September 9-16, 2007, as ``National Polycystic \nKidney Disease Awareness Week''.\n  This resolution acknowledges the dangers of Polycystic Kidney \nDisease, also called PKD, which affects over 600,000 Americans. That is \nmore than three times the population of Salt Lake City.\n  PKD is the most common, life-threatening genetic disease in the U.S. \nThere is no cure, and it is one of the four leading causes of kidney \nfailure, also called end-stage renal disease; diabetes being number \none.\n  Polycystic kidney disease is characterized by the growth of numerous \nfluid-filled cysts in the kidney, which slowly reduce the kidney \nfunction and can eventually lead to kidney failure. When PKD causes \nkidneys to fail, the patient requires dialysis or kidney \ntransplantation. About one-half of people with the major type of PKD \nprogress to kidney failure.\n  PKD is especially personal to me because so many Utahns suffer from \nthis disease. The PKD Foundation claims that approximately 5,000 \nindividuals in Utah live with PKD, and that the incidence of end-stage \nrenal disease in Utah is three times that of the national average. To \ncure PKD would result in billions of dollars in savings to the \nmilitary, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Veterans Administration for \ndialysis, transplantation and related treatments.\n  Due to the illusiveness of PKD, many people are simply unaware of the \nnature of this disease. A National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness \nWeek will help spread the word about the deadliness of PKD and vast \nnumbers of, not only Utahns, but all Americans affected by this \ndisease. With education comes the ability to know how to help people. \nLet us make it possible for everyone to know about PKD, so that more \npeople can join the effort in making PKD a disease of the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/26/senate-section/article/S10192-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10192-S10193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2477.

SENSE OF SENATE ON IMMIGRATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On June 28th, 2007, the Senate, by a vote of 46 to 53, \n     rejected a motion to invoke cloture on a bill to provide for \n     comprehensive immigration reform.\n       (2) Illegal immigration remains the top domestic issue in \n     the United States.\n       (3) The people of the United States continue to feel the \n     effects of a failed immigration system on a daily basis, and \n     they have not forgotten that Congress and the President have \n     a duty to address the issue of illegal immigration and the \n     security of the international borders of the United States.\n       (4) People from across the United States have shared with \n     members of the Senate their wide ranging and passionate \n     opinions on how best to reform the immigration system.\n       (5) There is no consensus on an approach to comprehensive \n     immigration reform that does not first secure the \n     international borders of the United States.\n       (6) There is unanimity that the Federal Government has a \n     responsibility to, and immediately should, secure the \n     international borders of the United States.\n       (7) Border security is an integral part of national \n     security.\n       (8) The greatest obstacle the Federal Government faces with \n     respect to the people of the United States is a lack of trust \n     that the Federal Government will secure the international \n     borders of the United States.\n       (9) This lack of trust is rooted in the past failures of \n     the Federal Government to uphold and enforce immigration laws \n     and the failure of the Federal Government to secure the \n     international borders of the United States.\n       (10) Failure to uphold and enforce immigration laws has \n     eroded respect for those laws and eliminated the faith of the \n     people of the United States in the ability of their elected \n     officials to responsibly administer immigration programs.\n       (11) It is necessary to regain the trust of the people of \n     the United States in the competency of the Federal Government \n     to enforce immigration laws and manage the immigration \n     system.\n       (12) Securing the borders of the United States would serve \n     as a starting point to begin to address other issues \n     surrounding immigration reform on which there is not \n     consensus.\n       (13) Congress has not fully funded some interior and border \n     security activities that it has authorized.\n       (14) The President of the United States can initiate \n     emergency spending by designating certain spending as \n     ``emergency spending'' in a request to the Congress.\n       (15) The lack of security on the international borders of \n     the United States rises to the level of an emergency.\n       (16) The Border Patrol are apprehending some, but not all, \n     individuals from countries that the Secretary of State has \n     determined have repeatedly provided support for acts of \n     international terrorism who cross or attempt to cross \n     illegally into the United States.\n       (17) The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating a \n     human smuggling ring that has been bringing Iraqis and other \n     Middle Eastern individuals across the international borders \n     of the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of Senate that--\n       (1) the Federal Government should work to regain the trust \n     of the people of the United States in its ability of the \n     Federal Government to secure the international borders of the \n     United States;\n       (2) in order to restore the credibility of the Federal \n     Government on this critical issue, the Federal Government \n     should prove its ability to enforce immigration laws by \n     taking actions such as securing the border, stopping the flow \n     of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States, and \n     creating a tamper-proof biometric identification card for \n     foreign workers; and\n       (3) the President should request emergency spending that \n     fully funds--\n       (A) existing interior and border security authorizations \n     that have not been funded by Congress; and\n       (B) the border and interior security initiatives contained \n     in the bill to provide for comprehensive immigration reform \n     and for other purposes (S. 1639) introduced in the Senate on \n     June 18, 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2496.
