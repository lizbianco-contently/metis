Mr. President, September 25, 2007, marks the 50th \nanniversary of one of the most important days in our country's history \nand certainly one of the most important days in the history of our \nState of Arkansas. On that day in 1957, Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth \nEckford, Ernest Green, Thelma Mothershed, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, \nTerrence Roberts, Jefferson\n\n[[Page S11776]]\n\nThomas, and Carlotta Walls changed the world when they entered the \ndoors to Little Rock Central High School and desegregated the Little \nRock school district.\n  Known collectively as the Little Rock Nine, these brave young men and \nwomen faced down a jeering crowd, the Arkansas National Guard, and even \ntheir own Governor to take a principled stand and march toward greater \nequality for all in our Nation and in my home State of Arkansas.\n  As the mother of growing children right now, thinking of what those \nstudents must have felt at that time to have taken such a stand, to \nstand before their peers who were jeering and yelling at them, to stand \nup to authority as they did, must have been incredible.\n  Next week in Little Rock, we will commemorate the heroic sacrifice \nthese students made to blaze a trail so that future generations could \nbenefit. In doing so, it is also appropriate to recognize those in the \ncommunity who uplifted these individuals and gave them the strength \nthey needed.\n  Arkansas Daisy and L.C. Bates, Chris Mercer, Wiley Branton, and \nfuture Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall either gave these \nchildren daily guidance or fought for them in the court system to \nensure they could have access to a quality education that was their \nright as a citizen of this country.\n  We all think about the images and certainly the impression we leave \non children today. We think about these individuals who made such an \nimpact in the support they gave these children as they took this very \nimportant step. We must also not forget the enormous role the parents \nof the Little Rock Nine played to ignore threats and intimidation that \ncame their way.\n  Again, as a parent and thinking of the preparation that goes into \nencouraging your children to take new steps and to stand up for what is \nright is tough because you know what your children will come up \nagainst. Those parents had to have had mixed emotions to send their \nchildren out there and wonder what kind of harm or what kind of \ncrushing blow would come to their self-esteem or to their confidence.\n  Yet they supported it in every way known, making sure their clothes \nlooked perfect or making sure their bodies and their souls were strong. \nWhat incredible parents they were.\n  What happened in Little Rock 50 years ago is not only a testament to \nthose students, but it is also a testament to those who supported them. \nIt is a testament to the people of Little Rock of all backgrounds who \ndecided they would confront their own conscience, and it is a testament \nto those who, upon reflecting upon the matter, decided that doing what \nis right was worth the cost.\n  I also wish to recognize other communities in Arkansas that led the \nway for integration in the Deep South, even prior to the famous \nstandoff of 1957; often these others receive little attention. Shortly \nafter the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, the communities \nof Charleston, Fayetteville, and Hoxie desegregated their schools to \ncomply with the ruling of the Supreme Court.\n  Former U.S. Senator Dale Bumpers, a Charleston native and the \nattorney for the Charleston School Board in 1954, was very involved in \nhis community's decision.\n  In a recent newspaper interview, he recounted that the members of the \nCharleston School Board made up their mind that the Supreme Court \ndecision meant what it said and Charleston could save itself a lot of \ntrouble by going ahead and integrating immediately instead of fighting \nit, fighting it out, essentially knowing it would be a lost cause.\n  Dale Bumpers continued to push for change, later as a lawyer, our \nGovernor in Arkansas, and our U.S. Senator in Arkansas. In 1988, he \nauthored the legislation that established the Little Rock Central High \nSchool National Historic Site which is administered by the National \nPark Service, the Little Rock School District and the City of Little \nRock and other entities.\n  He was also responsible for the legislation that awarded the Little \nRock Nine with the Congressional Gold Medal, our Nation's highest \ncivilian honor. Monday, I and my colleagues will be in Little Rock to \ndedicate the new visitors center and the museum at that site. The new \ncenter will feature exhibits on the Little Rock Nine and the road to \ndesegregation.\n  As a young child myself who experienced firsthand the integration of \nschools in my hometown of Helana, AR, I cannot imagine the fear and \nanxiety those students must have felt in that tumultuous environment in \n1957.\n  I feel fortunate that my community embraced the process of \nintegration and that my parents, in particular, were engaged and kept \nme in the local school district when so many of my friends were being \nmoved to private schools.\n  My husband Steve, who is a graduate of Little Rock Central High \nSchool, and I are both better people for learning in integrated schools \nand experiencing the diversity and what it provides us.\n  I appreciate the lifelong lessons I learned in my early years. It is \nbecause of the Little Rock Nine that it was possible. Their decision to \nmove this Nation forward makes me proud to be an Arkansan. It makes me \nproud to be an American.\n  In closing, I wish to specifically thank my colleagues from the \nArkansas delegation, especially the Presiding Officer, my colleague, \nSenator Mark Pryor, and Congressman Vic Snyder. I have been so proud to \nwork with both of them to secure the funding for the new visitors \ncenter.\n  In addition, I joined with Senator Pryor, who also attended Little \nRock Central High, to introduce a resolution which recognizes the 50th \nanniversary of the school desegregation. It passed the Senate earlier \nthis month. I wish to thank all my colleagues for their support in that \neffort.\n  We all know there is still much to be done, still much that can be \ndone in our country to ensure the goals of the Little Rock Nine are \nachieved and that equal rights are available for each and every \nindividual in this great Nation.\n  We have come very far in the last 50 years. As we move forward, we \nshould let the lessons of the past provide a measure of our progress \nand the inspiration to build on our achievements for all our fellow \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, the names Ernest Green, Elizabeth \nEckford, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Minnijean Brown \nTrickey, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas, Thelma Mothershed Wair, \nMelba Pattillo Beals are part of Arkansas history and part of America's \nhistory.\n  When I talked to the so-called Little Rock Nine about the fact that \nwe were able to secure funding for the visitors center, Minnijean Brown \nTrickey said it was an affirmation of a very beautiful and tragic \nstory.\n  I think she captured it. The story of Little Rock Central High School \nin 1957 is a story of courage, of hardship, of justice, faith, \ntradition, power, opportunity, and leadership. I think that is why the \nstory is so powerful, because it connects so many of those things all \nin one event or one series of events.\n  It has all of those elements, but there is also more to the story. \nThe ``more to the story'' part is what I wanted to talk about today. We \nare here to talk about the events in 1957, to talk about the very \npainful but ultimately successful integration of a large public high \nschool in a Southern city.\n  I need to thank my colleagues, Senator Lincoln from Arkansas; my \ncolleague in the House, Congressman Vic Snyder; and also a colleague \nwho is no longer with us in the Senate, Conrad Burns, because we all \nworked together to get the money for the Little Rock Central High \nVisitors Center, which will open this coming Monday.\n\n  But that is not all who worked in this effort. The National Park \nService, the city of Little Rock, the 50th Anniversary Commemoration \nCommittee, the Little Rock Nine Foundation, and countless others worked \nto have this special grand opening Monday; to have a visitors center, \nfor a place that has a\n\n[[Page S11777]]\n\nplace in our Nation's history on the civil rights struggle that has \ngone on in this country.\n  Also, I wish to say that Congressman Vic Snyder was able to get a \ncommemorative coin for Little Rock Central and the Little Rock Nine. I \ncertainly helped him do that, along with Senator Lincoln. We all worked \nhard on that, but Congressman Snyder took the lead role.\n  This Friday night at Little Rock Central High School in Quigley \nStadium, the Little Rock Central High Tigers will play the Pine Bluff \nZebras. Once again, we find Little Rock Central is ranked in the top 10 \nin the Arkansas top 10 football rankings. But that stadium played a \nrole in the Central High crisis. It is a role that is often forgotten \nbecause we focus on the Little Rock Nine, and certainly we should.\n  We focus on the turbulence in trying to integrate the school, and \ncertainly we should. But also there were many other happenings at \nLittle Rock Central that year. One of them was Little Rock Central High \nSchool just so happened to have what Sports Illustrated and other \nsports magazines and publications have called one of the alltime \ngreatest high school football teams. That week Central High won its \n23rd game in a row, against a team from Louisiana. The week before they \nbeat a team from Texas. That same week, when the 101st Airborne showed \nup to restore order and keep the peace around the campus of Little Rock \nHigh School, the 101st Airborne set up their equipment on the Tigers' \npractice field.\n  Well, that was a huge no-no in the mind of Coach Wilson Matthews. He \nwent out there and he barked orders to the 101st Airborne like they \nwere his own football team. They hopped to and they got off the \npractice field. That Friday night, when the stands were full and the \nTigers took the field, they looked up and there was the 101st Airborne \ncheering for the Central High School Tigers.\n  That story is captured in a great story in Sports Illustrated from \nthis past year's April 9 publication. It captures the humanity and the \nimpact that crisis had on people, not just that day or that year but \nfor a lifetime.\n  The Little Rock Central High School story is complicated in some \nways. It is about the best and the worst in American history. In some \nways, it is about a city that is struggling to try, in postwar America, \nto work through many racial issues. It is a story that is not always \nsuccessful. It is not always easy. But it is a story that in the end is \na great story and is one that needs to be told.\n  Let me talk for a couple more minutes about the events of that day \nand why Little Rock Central is so important to the history of this \ncountry. First, we focus on the Little Rock Nine, and understandably \nthese nine young black children had to pay a huge price; it took a lot \nof courage to do what they did. But it is more than them.\n  We had a Southern city that, by most standards, was considered to be \na moderate Southern city when it came to race. The Little Rock School \nBoard took the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision literally, and \nthey believed they needed to integrate the Little Rock School System \nwith all deliberate speed, as the Supreme Court said.\n  The quickest they could figure out to do it was in the fall of 1957. \nOf course, when that happened, they entered into this vortex of \nemotions, this vortex where you see a nation being torn apart by race \nand by many policies, not just in the South. We talk about the South, \nbut certainly there is racism all over this country, and this country \nwas in a struggle for civil rights.\n  In fact, it goes back to the founding documents of our democracy and \nour Declaration of Independence. It says all men are created equal. \nThat is what the desegregation, the integration movement was about in \nthis country: Are all men created equal or are there going to be two \nsets of everything for people in this country?\n  The Supreme Court did what it did. The local school board did what it \ndid. The Governor in our State, to his everlasting shame, did not \nsupport what the school board did and actually energized people to \noppose what the school board had done. The President had to call in the \n101st Airborne to try to stop what was going on at Little Rock Central. \nHere is a photo of the famous Little Rock Nine. They are going to be \nhonored all week in Little Rock. Again, they showed tremendous courage \nas they went through this process. Here we see a photo of Little Rock \nCentral High with the 101st Airborne escorting students into the \nbuilding. It is hard to imagine today; we have made such progress. I \nwill be the first to say we are not there yet when it comes to race, \nbut we have made so much progress.\n  Little Rock Central High School was a turning point. It didn't mean \nthe struggle was over. In a lot of ways, it meant the struggle was \nbeginning. But we have made a lot of progress. We have a lot to be \nproud of. Not everything that happened in 1957 is something Arkansas is \nproud of. But nonetheless, it was a huge turning point in making this \ncountry better.\n  I close talking about Little Rock Central High School today. Here is \na photo of it today. The school looks identical to the way it looked in \n1957. The architects of this country have called it one of the most \nbeautiful high schools in America. It is now also one of the most \nsuccessful high schools in America.\n  I pulled something off a history Web site. It says:\n\n       Central offers students an international studies magnet \n     program and an extensive curriculum including more than 30 \n     Advanced Placement . . . courses. Central consistently has \n     more National Merit Semifinalists than any other school in \n     the state (19 in 2006-07 alone), claims a large percentage of \n     the state's National Achievement Semifinalists (approximately \n     20% of Arkansas' total between 1994 and 2004) and has \n     produced 15 Presidential Scholars since the program's \n     inception in 1964.\n\n  Part of the story of Little Rock Central must include what has \nhappened since September 25, 1957. Part of the story of Little Rock \nCentral is a story about rebuilding, about integrating, about coming \nback, and about success.\n  I was very honored to have an opportunity to go to Little Rock \nCentral High School, as did the husband of the senior Senator from the \nState of Arkansas. It has produced many strong leaders in the State. \nOne of those was a dear friend of mine, Roosevelt Thompson, who passed \naway tragically when he was in college. But the story of Little Rock \nCentral is a story that touches all of us. It is a very important part \nof our State's history and our national history.\n  We are honored that all nine of the Little Rock Nine are still living \ntoday and will be in Little Rock this week to commemorate some very \ndifficult but very important events for this country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11777-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11777-S11778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DEBT LIMIT\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes talking \nabout something that will come up in the next week or 10 days. That is \nan extension and expansion of the debt limit. An attempt will be made \nto do this by unanimous consent. That is wrong. Every Member of the \nSenate ought to be on record on whether we ought to expand again the \namount of borrowing we are going to place on the backs of our children \nand grandchildren. The current statutory debt limit is $8.965 trillion. \nIt was last raised March 20, 2006. This Senator voted against that. We \nhave been on notice since that time that we needed to make the effort \nto rein in wasteful Washington spending so that we do not have to, in \nfact, borrow more money against our children's future. Only 10 years \nago it was $5.95 billion. We have increased the debt in the last 10 \nyears by 50 percent.\n  What does that mean? Individually, that means $30,000 for every man, \nwoman, and child. But the important aspect is not just what we owe now \nbut what the unfunded liabilities are for the future which are in \nexcess of $70 trillion. What does that mean if you are born today? That \nmeans if you are born today, you will be inheriting at the moment of \nyour birth liabilities of\n\n[[Page S11778]]\n\nover $400,000. How in the world can our children have an education, a \ngreat job, own a home, and give their children the things we have \nbenefited from by being born owing $400,000?\n  It is time for things to come to a stop or to markedly change. This \nlast week the Senate once again failed to make tough decisions about \npriorities. We chose to fund pork projects instead of repairing \nbridges. We said peace gardens, bike paths, and baseball stadiums are \nmore important than critical infrastructure. Yesterday a new poll was \nreleased. Rightly so, it reflected less than 11 percent of Americans \nhave confidence in this body. It is no wonder. Our priorities are \nwrong.\n\n  Congress for years has raided the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds to hide the true size of the annual budget deficit. This practice \nhas undermined the solvency of the programs and threatens both the \nretirement security of today's workers and the economic opportunities \nand future of our children and grandchildren. It is irresponsible to \nsimply raise the debt limit while at the same time creating or \nexpanding Federal programs that will result in additional borrowing \nfrom Social Security trust funds and not accepting the responsibility \nto make hard choices about what are our priorities. Congress has \nrepeatedly demonstrated that it is unwilling to prioritize spending. \nThis year multiple times the Senate has rejected amendments to cut \nspending while authorizing billions and billions of dollars in new \nspending. The Senate this year twice has rejected amendments stating \nthat Congress has a moral obligation to offset the cost of new \nGovernment spending by getting rid of the waste, fraud, abuse, and \nduplication in current Federal programs.\n  American families don't have the luxury Congress has. They can't get \na new loan or new credit cards after they have maxed out their \ncapability to borrow. Yet instead, every day in this body we do \nessentially that.\n  The moral question is, why should we be proud of stealing from our \nchildren? There isn't a greater moral question before this country \ntoday than whether we are going to steal opportunity and freedom from \nthe next generation.\n  I am putting the Senate on notice that I will not agree to a UC on \nthe debt limit extension without a debate and full vote by each Member \nof this body on that debt limit and a recommitment to do what is right \nfor the future.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VITTER.

Mr. President, I rise today to strongly oppose the Durbin \namendment to the Defense appropriations bill. That amendment would pass \nthe so-called DREAM Act into law.\n  In standing up in opposition, let me suggest this should not be \ncalled the DREAM Act. It should be called the ``Amnesty Reality Act'' \nbecause this is yet another attempt, another version of amnesty for a \nsignificant number of illegal aliens.\n  Let me say at the outset I am not standing here to criticize or to \nlambaste the individuals involved, undoubtedly, who came to this \ncountry with their parents to try to find a better life because of very \ndifficult conditions in Mexico or otherwise.\n  The point of my opposition is not directed at them. It is directed at \nwhat is very bad and destructive policy in terms of U.S. immigration \npolicy, repeating the mistakes of the past, making a very real problem \nworse and not better through a significant amnesty program.\n  Why is this an amnesty? Well, purely and simply, this so-called DREAM \nAct, which I think should be called the ``Amnesty Reality Act,'' \nembodied in this Durbin amendment to the Defense appropriations bill \nwould provide a pathway to citizenship to who knows how many folks who \nentered this country, and remain in this country, illegally. \nSpecifically, it targets folks who came into this country illegally as \nminors, presumably with their families, with their parents. It also \ngives them benefits in this country that most U.S. citizens do not \nenjoy, specifically, instate college tuition that U.S. citizens outside \nthat State do not enjoy.\n  This is very frustrating to me. Just a few months ago, we had a major \ndebate on the floor of this body about immigration policy. A large so-\ncalled comprehensive immigration bill was on the floor of the Senate. \nIt received a lot of attention and a lot of focus. That was a good \nthing because the American people got engaged; they focused on what was \ngoing on. They understood what was being proposed, and they wrote and \ne-mailed and called us in record numbers.\n  I do not think anyone can deny the message came through loudly and \nclearly. The message was: We do not support an amnesty program because \nthat will make the problem far worse and not better. The second part of \nthe message was: Let's start with real enforcement. Let's finally get \nserious with border security, workplace security, to begin to address \nthis very real illegal immigration problem in this country.\n  That message came through in such volume that it literally shut down \nthe Senate phone system on the morning of that pivotal vote which \ndefeated that so-called comprehensive immigration bill proposed by \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Durbin, the author of this DREAM Act \namendment, and others.\n  What is so frustrating to me is that very loud, very clear message \nseems to have fallen on deaf ears in terms of some Members of this \nbody. Unfortunately, this DREAM Act amendment is proof of that. Again, \nit is, clearly beyond argument, another version of amnesty. It would \nprovide a pathway to citizenship for a significant class of people, \nfolks who came into this country illegally as minors. We do not know \nhow many people that would be, and we have very little way of enforcing \neven the provisions of this amendment to keep it to the folks to whom \nit is supposed to be targeted.\n  What do I mean by that? Well, the folks are supposed to have come \ninto this country in the last 5 years. Yet at the same time the \namendment says it can apply to people up to age 30. What sort of proof \ndo these folks have to offer with regard to when they came into this \ncountry? There is no proof requirement. It could simply be an \naffirmative statement by themselves, no other required proof. So this \nis open ended, this is unenforceable, and it is a significant amnesty.\n  In addition, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, it provides \nsubstantial benefits to these folks illegally in our country, benefits \nthat the huge majority of American citizens do not enjoy. What is that? \nWell, the biggest is instate college tuition that would come to folks \nwho sign up for the DREAM Act. As soon as they sign up, they would be \ntreated as instate residents of that State. They would get instate \ntuition, and--guess what--all other U.S. citizens, the children of all \nother U.S. citizens outside that particular State who would love the \nbenefit of instate tuition would not enjoy that same benefit.\n  That does not match the commonsense test that the American people \nwant us to use. It certainly has nothing to do with the message the \nAmerican people sent to us loudly and clearly during the debate on the \nso-called comprehensive immigration bill with its massive amnesty \nprogram. Again, that message came through loudly and clearly: No \namnesty; real enforcement.\n  The American people are saying that not because they are mean-\nspirited, not because they hold anything against these individuals who \nare seeking a better life in this country, but because they know, \nbecause common sense tells them, this is going to make the problem \nworse and not better. Inadequate enforcement, with amnesty, acts as a \nmagnet to magnify the problem, to encourage more illegals to cross the \nborder into our country. If that does not ring true just because of \ncommon sense, history proves it.\n  The last time the Congress acted in this area of the law was in 1986, \nagain\n\n[[Page S11779]]\n\nwith significant immigration reform. The promise was exactly the same: \nWe are going to get serious. We are going to get real with enforcement. \nWe just need this amnesty one time--never again--to help solve the \nproblem.\n  Well, what happened? That bill passed into law. The real enforcement \nnever happened to an adequate extent, but, of course, the amnesty \nprovision went into effect immediately. What happens when you combine \ninadequate enforcement with real amnesty? What you do is make the \nproblem worse and not better, encourage more illegals to come into the \ncountry.\n  The proof of the pudding is in the eating. In this case it is in the \nnumbers. What was then, in 1986, a problem of 3 million illegal aliens \nin this country, is now a problem of 12 or 13 million or more. So what \ndid that one-time solution do? It quadrupled the problem. It proved not \nto be a solution at all.\n\n  I suggest we do something that some might consider novel around here. \nLet's listen to the common sense and wisdom of the American people. \nLet's say no to amnesty, as we did in June by defeating the immigration \nbill sponsored by Senator Kennedy and others. Let's say yes to real \nenforcement both at the border and in the workplace. And let's offer \nthat message again by defeating this very ill-conceived Durbin \namendment.\n  To help defeat this amendment, I will be offering a second-degree \namendment to the Durbin amendment. My second-degree amendment is very \nsimple. It simply says nothing in the Durbin amendment goes into \neffect, goes into law, until the US-VISIT Program is fully operational. \nThe US-VISIT Program is something that was first proposed in 1996, an \nentry/exit system so we know who is coming into the country, who is \nleaving the country--something very basic, very necessary in terms of \nenforcement.\n  Although it was proposed in 1996, it has never come close to being \nfully operational because Congress, folks in Washington, this \nadministration and previous administrations, have never had the \npolitical will to get it done.\n  So, again, my second-degree amendment to the Durbin DREAM Act \namendment is very simple. That cannot go into effect until the US-VISIT \nsystem is fully operational at our borders. I will be proposing that \namendment assuming the Durbin amendment is, in fact, called up for \nconsideration on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield back my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about Iraq and \nabout this amendatory process and this legislative quagmire in which we \nfind ourselves.\n  The American people are having difficulty understanding why the \nSenate can't get anything done. It is because we have a rule that says \nwe can't pass something here without 60 votes out of 100 Senators. We \nneed 60 votes to close off debate on a motion for cloture. That is a \nfancy term for closing the debate. We have to have 60 votes. With a \nSenate that is so partisan, and so split ideologically, it is hard to \nget those 60 votes. We see this on the amendments that have already \nattempted to be brought, either on a motion just to proceed, which \ntakes 60 votes, or a motion to close off debate to get to the subject \nmatter of the amendment. We can't get the votes. Thus, the American \npeople are increasingly frustrated, as are the Senators, that we can't \nget more unanimity when, in fact, most of us know in this country what \nhas to be done.\n  Now, what is that? What needs to be done to make the best of a very \nbad situation? Now, I am not talking about why we got there; that is a \ndebate in itself which we have had innumerable times here on the floor. \nWe are where we are. We are there.\n  What is the goal? The goal in the best interests of the United States \nis to stabilize Iraq, but there is not a soul who has testified in any \nof these innumerable hearings who says that you can get to that goal of \nstability in Iraq without political reconciliation between the Sunnis \nand the Shiites. The difficulty there is they have been at it for 1,327 \nyears, ever since the Battle of Karbala in 680 A.D. It is very \ndifficult for them, with all of that history, all of that hatred, to be \nable to reconcile into some kind of stability so that a government can, \nin fact, function in Iraq.\n  So given those circumstances, what is the very best we can do? I \ncan't tell my colleagues that I have the complete answer, but the best \nanswer I have is the plan that was laid out unanimously last December \nby the Iraq Study Commission consisting of very prominent people who \nknow the defense business and who know the foreign relations business. \nThey unanimously recommended a gradual withdrawal and to keep enough \nU.S. troops there to do three things: to train the Iraqi Army, to go \nafter al-Qaida, and to provide force protection for the Americans who \nare there and, at the same time, they said, have a very aggressive \ndiplomatic effort with the other nations of the world, and especially \nwith the nations in the region, including Syria and Iran, to try to get \na political settlement and then to have that political settlement \nstick.\n  Now, what should that political settlement be? Well, I am not sure \nanybody within the U.S. Government can tell us, but the best plan I \nknow of is going to be offered by the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, \nwhich is to have a shared power arrangement under the Iraqi \nConstitution of an autonomous region--three in Iraq--with the Kurds in \nthe north, Sunnis in the center, and Shiites in the south. Now, no one \nhas been able to come up with a better idea as to how we can have a \npolitical solution where we ultimately get to the goal of political \nstability with reconciliation between Sunnis and Shiites.\n  Part of it is functioning right now in the north of Iraq. The Kurds \nvirtually have their own self-government. Isn't it interesting that not \none American troop has been killed in that region called Kurdistan? \nThey have a measure of stability there. They have their own self-\ngovernment. Isn't it interesting--in an area almost exclusively Sunnis \nin western Iraq called Al Anbar Province is where our surge with the \nmarines has, in fact, helped because it has turned the Sunni tribal \nchieftains into helping us to go after al-Qaida. We have had success.\n  Where we have not had success with the surge is in the center part, \nin the Baghdad region, where the Sunnis and the Shiites are going at \neach other. Thus, what is happening is they are voting with their feet \nas they are voluntarily separating, since they can't get along.\n  I think a solution such as Senator Biden's, which he will offer as an \namendment and which I will support, is the best that has come up where \nthere would be three autonomous regions. Then there would be the \nnational government that would represent the country in its foreign \nrelations but at the same time would have the ability, under an Iraq \noil law, to distribute the oil revenues according to the percentage of \nthe population. I don't know anybody who has a better plan. If they do, \nI want to hear it.\n  But what we need to do is to come together, Republicans and Democrats \ntogether, and get over this threshold that has us in a political and \nlegislative and procedural straitjacket, that we can't get anything \ndone in this Senate because we can't get 60 votes because we can't get \nDemocrats and Republicans together to start charting the course. It is \nclear that the White House isn't going to do it. They have their \nmindset and what they want to do, but that is not ultimately going to \nget us to the solution. Even General Petraeus has recommended--or has \ntestified that a year from now, we are still likely to have 140,000 \ntroops there, with no plan of any of this political success, even \nthough everybody who testified says\n\n[[Page S11780]]\n\nyou have to get political reconciliation in order to have that \npolitical success.\n  Come on, Democratic Senators. Come on, Republican Senators. Let's get \ntogether. The amendment from Senator Biden is one we can get together \non.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I know we are in the middle of working \non a very important bill, but I do wish to take a moment to respond to \na press conference the President just held where he spoke about his \nintent to veto the bipartisan children's health care bill we will be \nsending to him.\n  It is very important we indicate that just because the President has \na bully pulpit does not mean he is accurate or right. It does not \nmatter how much spin they want to put on this situation, the reality is \nthe President of the United States gave us a budget earlier this year--\nand the Budget Committee looked at this very carefully--this President \nproposed a budget that would cut, according to CBO, 1.6 million \nchildren from health care, current children. So when I hear the \nPresident at a press conference talking about the fact that he wants to \nmake sure children are covered with health insurance, actions speak \nlouder than words.\n  The President asked us to put forward a budget that would cut 1.6 \nmillion children of working families who currently have health \ninsurance from their health care. We rejected that request. We looked \nat the fact that there are from 6 to 7 million children who currently \nqualify to receive children's health insurance. Again, these are \nworking families, folks who do not qualify for low-income help. They \nare moms and dads working one, two, maybe three minimum wage jobs, who \nare desperately concerned that at least their children have the health \ncare they need.\n  I am very proud the Senate came together and in a true bipartisan \neffort developed a health care program, an expansion that will not only \nmake sure every child who currently has health insurance will keep that \nhealth care, but that 4 million more children will be able to have \nhealth care in this country. Their moms and dads will not have to go to \nbed at night praying: Please don't let the kids get sick.\n  Sixty-eight Members of this Senate, not counting the fact that \nSenator Johnson who is now back with us would make that 69 Members, \nvoted together in true bipartisanship to say that one of the basic \nvalues of this country is to make sure the children of working families \nhave the opportunity to get the health care they need. It is pretty \nbasic. This is a matter of values and priorities.\n  Later today, in a few moments, I am going to be joining with Families \nUSA to announce their new study that says that 90 million Americans \nsometime in the last 2 years did not have health insurance. One out of \nthree Americans sometime in the last 2 years did not have health \ninsurance. This is a national tragedy. And for us not to at least focus \non children, at least say our value as Americans is to make sure that \nchildren of low-income working families get the basic health care they \nneed, to me is something I find incredibly important and appalling, \nquite frankly, that the President of the United States says on the one \nhand he will veto a bipartisan bill to expand health care coverage to \nchildren of working families and then have--I hate to say what I was \ngoing to say--the amazing position to come to us shortly and to ask \nsomewhere up to another $200 billion for the war in Iraq that the \nmajority of Americans want to see changed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nMichigan for making this statement on the floor of the Senate. I \nlistened to the news reports this morning and heard that some from the \nWhite House said they did not believe we should be helping to pay for \nhealth insurance for families who are well off, such as families making \n$60,000 a year. That was the reference that was made.\n  The Senator from Michigan, I am sure, is aware that health insurance \npremiums--assuming the whole family is healthy--could, in some \ncircumstances, cost a family thousands of dollars each year. If their \ngross income is $60,000, and they are trying to get by with $3,000 or \n$4,000 a month, an $800 health insurance bill for a healthy family, let \nalone $1,200 or more for a family with a sick child, it is hard for me \nto understand how the White House could say a family making $60,000 a \nyear is so well off they would not need help in providing health \ninsurance to their children.\n  I suggest to the Senator from Michigan that the President's position \nhere seems to me to be inconsistent, in that he is willing to provide \ntax cuts for the wealthiest people in America and then is saying folks \nwho make $60,000 a year are well off and don't need a helping hand when \nit comes to their children's health insurance. So in addition to the \ncost of the war in Iraq, I ask the Senator from Michigan, isn't it a \nlittle difficult to understand the President's position of giving tax \nbreaks to the wealthy and not giving working families making $60,000 a \nyear a helping hand with their health insurance for kids?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Well, my distinguished colleague is absolutely correct, \nand I thank him for his comments.\n  This is truly a question of values and priorities. That is what we \nare about in this business, in this Chamber, when we make decisions. \nThe President has said the wealthiest among us are much more important \nthan moms and dads, most of whom, by the way, are making much less than \nwhat we are talking about or the numbers the White House has put out. \nThose families ought to be able to, at a minimum, know that their \nchildren have health insurance when they get sick.\n  But what adds insult to injury, I believe, for the American people, \nis to know that on top of that--on top of tax priorities for the \nwealthy versus families and their health care--is the fact that on the \none hand we have put together something that is responsible, \nbipartisan, and fully paid for within the budget, and yet the President \nis going to be sending us a request for anywhere from $150 billion to \n$200 billion more for a war in Iraq that the American people want to \nchange, a policy that is not supported by the majority of Americans. To \nadd insult to injury, none of it is paid for. It will go directly on to \nthe national debt.\n  So this is a question of values and priorities. It doesn't matter, \nagain as I said when I began, how much the President wants to spin it. \nWe all know he has a very big megaphone, a very big bully pulpit. But \nthat doesn't mean he is right. The spin machine cannot outweigh what is \ngoing on here in terms of American families. We have something that we \nhave done together on a bipartisan basis. We should all be very proud \nof it. A basic for every single one of our families is the ability to \nknow they can care for their children and they will have the health \ncare they need.\n  Far too many families today don't get help because they do not have a \nlow enough income. They are working and putting it together. Maybe it \nis a single mom, maybe it is a single dad, maybe it is mom and dad. \nThey are putting together the income in a way where they can pay all \nthe increased costs that everybody is having to deal with--the gas \nprices that are going up and the possibility of losing jobs. Certainly \nin my State wages are going down, and health care costs going up--all \nof the things that are squeezing our working families. But we are \nsaying, you know what, one of the things we can do together, and we \nhave already done it here and we are going to be sending it to the \nPresident, is to allow for 4 million more children to get the health \ncare they need for those moms and dads who are working but not making \nenough to be able to pay for health insurance.\n  We, as a country, ought to be able to say we at least want the \nchildren to receive the health insurance they need. Health care, in my \nopinion, should be a\n\n[[Page S11781]]\n\nright for the greatest country in the world, not a privilege. Too many \nthings have been given to the privileged in this country while working \nfamilies are trying hard every day to make ends meet.\n  So I wish to thank all our colleagues who have worked so hard on this \nlegislation. It is something we can all be very proud of, and I ask the \nPresident to take another look. This body together, 68 Members who \nvoted, were not playing politics. We were coming together in a \nbipartisan way to be able to give more children, American children, the \nability to get their health care needs taken care of. It is time we had \nthe President join with us in the right set of priorities for American \nfamilies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \ncoming to the Senate floor. Occasionally, there are debates in this \nChamber that really matter. The debate on the war in Iraq certainly \nleads that list. We have a deadly war underway. A hundred American \nsoldiers are killed, on average, every single month. Almost 4,000 have \ndied, with 30,000 having been injured. At least 10,000 have been \nseriously injured, with amputations and burns and traumatic brain \ninjury. That should be the focal point of what we do on the floor of \nthe Senate, and it is.\n  Yesterday, sadly, an important amendment by Senator Webb of Virginia, \nan important amendment for soldiers and their families, was defeated, \ndefeated on a vote of 56 to 44. The average person might say: It sounds \nlike you won. Not by Senate math. By Senate math it takes 60 votes on \ncontroversial issues, and this required 60, so that wasn't enough. We \nwere defeated in an effort to say something very straightforward: If \nyou are going to ask our soldiers to be deployed in combat, risking \ntheir lives for 12 months, you should at least give them 12 months \nafterward to rest, be reunited with their family, retrained and \nreequipped, before they go back into combat. So 12 months on duty, 12 \nmonths off duty. That was defeated.\n  If you meet with these soldiers and their families, if you know the \nstress they are under, if you read the numbers about the divorce rate \namong our soldiers, the suicide rate, the post-traumatic stress \ndisorder which they are battling as they return from the stress of \nbattles, it is hard to imagine the Senate would not give that kind of \nconsideration to our soldiers and their families. That is a critically \nimportant debate.\n  Now, we will soon move to another very important debate. It is about \nhealth insurance. Everybody in America knows there is something that \nneeds to be done on health insurance. There are 47 million of our \nneighbors in America, people who live with us in our communities and go \nto church with us, who have no health insurance. In my home State of \nIllinois, I went back in August in deep southern Illinois, near \nHarrisburg, in Saline County, and a woman came to me and said: I am 63 \nyears old. I am a realtor. I have never had health insurance 1 day in \nmy life. It is hard to imagine, but that is the reality many working \nAmericans face every single day. They are one diagnosis, one illness \naway from bankruptcy. Those are the people with no health insurance.\n  Now, let us speak about those who have health insurance but it isn't \ngood enough; it costs more each year and covers less. We know the \nstory. Businesses tell you, labor unions tell you, families tell you: I \ndon't have the kind of coverage I want, and it costs a fortune. That is \nthe reality.\n  We also know that in our great Nation there are 15 million children--\nof the 47 million I mentioned earlier, 15 million are children--with no \nhealth insurance. These are kids from families not poor enough to \nqualify for Medicaid and not fortunate enough to have a parent with a \njob that has health insurance. There are 15 million kids for whom the \nonly opportunity for health care is a trip to an emergency room.\n  We wanted to change that 5 years ago, and we passed this CHIP \nprogram, Children's Health Insurance Program, and said let us do \nsomething about it. So we covered 6 million of the 15 million kids, but \nnow the program is going to expire in a few days. Our hope with this \nnew Congress was we could expand health insurance to cover more \nchildren, at least 3 million more. We want to make sure all 15 million \nare covered, but we are not going to quite reach that goal. We want to \nat least get closer, with 9 million covered.\n  We had a bipartisan agreement to do that. The Senate came together, \ncooperated, compromised, and reached an agreement to expand health \ninsurance protection to another 3 million kids. This morning, the \nPresident of the United States had a press availability and announced \nhe would oppose this bill expanding health insurance for children. At \nthe time, the spokesman for his administration said: We don't want to \ngive health insurance to families who are well off. They defined a \nfamily that is well off as one that makes $60,000 a year.\n  Now, I have to tell you, $60,000 is more than the average wage in my \nhometown of Springfield, IL, but not by much. And $60,000 a year, after \nyou pay your taxes, doesn't leave a lot of money for your mortgage \npayment, for your utility bills, for your property taxes, and for the \nkids' school expenses. If you happen to not have health insurance where \nyou work, $60,000 doesn't leave much of a cushion to turn around and \nbuy health insurance. That insurance is going to cost you $60 or $80, \nmaybe $1,000 or more a month.\n  We think those families, with kids who don't have health insurance, \nmaking $60,000, deserve a helping hand so they can at least have the \nsecurity of health insurance and know their kids are covered. But it is \ngoing to be a battle. We are going to pass this bill and send it to the \nPresident. He is going to veto this bill--at least he promises to. I \nhope he reconsiders. But if not, we will then get a chance to override \nhis veto.\n  This is the kind of debate which matters. For millions of Americans \nand their families, this debate gets down to one of the real issues \nthat keep parents awake at night, worrying about their kids.\n  Some of us in our lives have been through this experience. I was a \nlaw student when my wife and I had a little baby and were without \nhealth insurance. We had some medical issues with our baby. I didn't \nhave health insurance to turn to. That happened many years ago. My \ndaughter is now 40 years old. But let me tell you, I will never forget \nit. There was a sinking feeling that my girl was not going to get the \nbest doctor and the best care because, as a father, I didn't have \nhealth insurance to cover her. It was only for a short period in my \nlife, but I will never forget it. I can't imagine people living with \nthat feeling every day, every week, every month, and every year. \nShouldn't we, as a great and giving nation, care about our own first?\n  This President will not even blink when he sends us a bill in a week \nor so asking for $198 billion more for the war in Iraq--$198 billion. \nYet he is unwilling to spend $6 billion for health insurance for \nchildren. That is about what it is each year over a 5-year period of \ntime. He will spend $198 billion for the war in Iraq but not $6 billion \nto make America stronger, to make America's families stronger.\n  This is a debate worth waging. This is an issue worth fighting for. \nThis Senate will return to that issue in a week or two, and I hope the \nAmerican people, on a bipartisan basis, as this bill is bipartisan, \nwill join us in urging the Senate to pass the bill and to override the \nPresident's veto.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11781-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11781-S11782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 1585, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1585) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2008 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Nelson (NE) (for Levin) amendment No. 2011, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n       Warner (for Graham/Kyl) amendment No. 2064 (to amendment \n     No. 2011), to strike section 1023, relating to the granting \n     of civil rights to terror suspects.\n       Cornyn amendment No. 2934 (to amendment No. 2011), to \n     express the sense of the Senate that General David H. \n     Petraeus, Commanding General, Multi-National Force-Iraq, \n     deserves the full support of the Senate and strongly condemn \n     personal attacks on the honor and the integrity of General \n     Petraeus and all the members of the United States Armed \n     forces.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after Senator \nBoxer offers an amendment related to the subject matter of the pending \nCornyn amendment, the Boxer and Cornyn amendments be debated \nconcurrently for 20 minutes, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Boxer and Cornyn or their designees; that \nno amendments be in order to either amendment; that upon the use or \nyielding back of time the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the \nBoxer amendment; that upon disposition of that amendment there be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the Cornyn amendment; \nthat each amendment be subject to a 60-vote threshold, and if the \namendment does not achieve 60 votes, the amendment then be withdrawn, \nwith the above occurring without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I wonder if my friend would modify that to have the second \nvote for 10 minutes rather than 15 minutes?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I so modify the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nthink the distinguished chairman and I have had a conversation that, \nfollowing that, for the benefit of our colleagues, we would move to the \nFeingold amendment and with it we will seek a time agreement. Then with \nthe cooperation of our colleagues, we will at least try as much as \npossible to dispose of Iraq amendments today, if we could.\n  I remind my colleagues we still have the basis of this bill, which \nhas Wounded Warriors, pay raises, housing, training, and equipping of \nthe men and women of the Armed Forces. We do have a number of pending \namendments on the bill. I think, in fairness, we should try to dispose \nof the Iraq issue as soon as possible so we could move on to the rest \nof the bill and pass it so we can get to conference and get it signed. \nThere are vital parts of this bill on which the chairman and members of \nthe Armed Services Committee have worked literally months, and I hope \nwe could get to that aspect of the legislation as well.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield for a moment, on that point I \nagree totally with what he just said about the importance of this bill. \nWe are circulating a request to our Members on this side that no \namendments be in order to this bill--that no amendments be filed after \na certain point this afternoon, which I believe we have tried to \nidentify as 3 o'clock. I don't know, I didn't have a chance to talk \nwith my friend from Arizona about that, but hopefully on your side \nsomething similar could be hot-lined so we could bring this to an end.\n  We have literally 250 amendments already. We have disposed of a lot. \nWe disposed of 50. We can dispose of more today at some point, but we \ncan't have more amendments coming in than we are able to work out.\n  I hope on both sides we can get a unanimous consent agreement that no \namendments will be in order to this bill in the first degree if they \nare filed later than a fixed time this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the initial unanimous \nconsent request, as modified, by the senior Senator from Michigan?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2947 to Amendment No. 2011\n\n  (Purpose: To affirm strong support for all the men and women of the \n   United States Armed Forces and to strongly condemn attacks on the \n honor, integrity, and patriotism of any individual who is serving or \n has served honorably in the United States Armed Forces, by any person \n                            or organization)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2947 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Levin, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 2947:\n       At the end of subtitle E of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. _ SENSE OF SENATE\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The men and women of the United States Armed Forces and \n     our veterans deserve to be supported, honored, and defended \n     when their patriotism is attacked;\n       (2) In 2002, a Senator from Georgia who is a Vietnam \n     veteran, triple amputee, and the recipient of a Silver Star \n     and Bronze Star, had his courage and patriotism attacked in \n     an advertisement in which he was visually linked to Osama bin \n     Laden and Saddam Hussein;\n       (3) This attack was aptly described by a Senator and \n     Vietnam veteran as ``reprehensible'';\n       (4) In 2004, a Senator from Massachusetts who is a Vietnam \n     veteran and the recipient of a Silver Star, Bronze Star with \n     Combat V, and three Purple Hearts, was personally attacked \n     and accused of dishonoring his country;\n       (5) This attack was aptly described by a Senator and \n     Vietnam veteran as ``dishonest and dishonorable.''\n       (6) On September 10, 2007, an advertisement in the New York \n     Times was an unwarranted personal attack on General Petraeus, \n     who is honorably leading our Armed Forces in Iraq and \n     carrying out the mission assigned to him by the President of \n     the United States; and\n       (7) Such personal attacks on those with distinguished \n     military service to our nation have become all too frequent.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to reaffirm its strong support for all of the men and \n     women of the United States Armed Forces; and\n       (2) to strongly condemn all attacks on the honor, \n     integrity, and patriotism of any individual who is serving or \n     has served honorably in the United States Armed Forces, by \n     any person or organization.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the clerk for reading those words. \nI hope Members of the Senate heard them well because in this amendment, \nwhat we are doing is saying that there is essentially a terrible trend \nin America today: to launch attacks on honorable people who serve in \nthe military. By the way, it isn't just folks who were mentioned or \nalluded to. I have an article I would like to have printed in the \nRecord from the San Diego Union Tribune, April 16, 2004, and another \nfrom the Seattle Times of May 13, 2007.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have two articles printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the San Diego Union Tribune, Apr. 16, 2004]\n\n              Retired General Assails U.S. Policy on Iraq\n\n                            (By Rick Rogers)\n\n       Retired Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni wondered aloud yesterday \n     how Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld could be caught off \n     guard by the chaos in Iraq that has killed nearly 100 \n     Americans in recent weeks and led to his announcement that \n     20,000 U.S. troops would be staying there instead of \n     returning home as planned.\n       ``I'm surprised that he is surprised because there was a \n     lot of us who were telling him that it was going to be \n     thus,'' said Zinni, a Marine for 39 years and the former \n     commander of the U.S. Central Command. ``Anyone could know \n     the problems they were going to see. How could they not?''\n       At a Pentagon news briefing yesterday, Rumsfeld said he \n     could not have estimated how many troops would be killed in \n     the past week.\n       Zinni made his comments during an interview with The San \n     Diego Union-Tribune before giving a speech last night at the \n     University of San Diego's Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace & \n     Justice as part of its distinguished lecturer series.\n       For years Zinni said he cautioned U.S. officials that an \n     Iraq without Saddam Hussein would likely be more dangerous to \n     U.S. interests than one with him because of the ethnic and \n     religious clashes that would be unleashed.\n\n[[Page S11783]]\n\n       ``I think that some heads should roll over Iraq,'' Zinni \n     said. ``I think the president got some bad advice.''\n       Known as the ``Warrior Diplomat,'' Zinni is not a peace \n     activist by nature or training, having led troops in Vietnam, \n     commanded rescue operations in Somalia and directed strikes \n     against Iraq and al Qaeda.\n       He once commanded the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force at \n     Camp Pendleton.\n       Out of uniform, Zinni was a troubleshooter for the U.S. \n     government in Africa, Asia and Europe and served as special \n     envoy to the Middle East under the Bush administration for a \n     time before his reservations over the Iraq war and its \n     aftermath caused him to resign and oppose it.\n       Not even Zinni's resume could shield him from the \n     accusations that followed.\n       ``I've been called a traitor and a turncoat for mentioning \n     these things,'' said Zinni, 60. The problems in Iraq are \n     being caused, he said, by poor planning and shortsightedness, \n     such as disbanding the Iraqi army and being unable to provide \n     security.\n       Zinni said the United States must now rely on the U.N. to \n     pull its ``chestnuts out of the fire in Iraq.''\n       ``We're betting on the U.N., who we blew off and ridiculed \n     during the run-up to the war,'' Zinni said. ``Now we're back \n     with hat in hand. It would be funny if not for the lives \n     lost.''\n       Several things have to happen to get Iraq back on course, \n     whether the U.N. decides to step in or not, Zinni said.\n       Improving security for American forces and the Iraqi people \n     is at the top of the list followed closely by helping the \n     working class with economic projects.\n       But it's not the lack of a comprehensive American plan for \n     Iraq nor the surging violence that has cost allied troops \n     their lives--including about 30 Camp Pendleton Marines--that \n     most concerns Zinni.\n       ``In the end, the Iraqis themselves have to want to rebuild \n     their country more than we do,'' Zinni said. ``But I don't \n     see that right now. I see us doing everything.\n       ``I spent two years in Vietnam, and I've seen this movie \n     before,'' he said. ``They have to be willing to do more or \n     else it is never going to work.''\n       Last night at the Kroc institute during his speech ``From \n     the Battlefield to the Negotiating Table: Preventing Deadly \n     Conflict,'' Zinni detailed the approach he believes the \n     United States should take in the Middle East.\n       He told an overflow crowd that the United States tries to \n     grapple with individual issues in Middle East instead of \n     seeing them as elements of a broader question.\n       ``We need to step back and get a grand strategy,'' he said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Seattle Times, May 13, 2007]\n\n                 Retired Gen. Batiste Lashes Out on War\n\n                           (By Thom Shanker)\n\n       Rochester, NY.--John Batiste has traveled a long way in \n     four years, from commanding the 1st Infantry Division in Iraq \n     to quitting the Army after 31 years in uniform, and, now, \n     from overseeing a steel factory in Rochester to openly \n     challenging President Bush on his management of the war.\n       ``Mr. President, you did not listen,'' Batiste says in new \n     TV ads being broadcast in Republican congressional districts \n     as part of a $500,000 campaign financed by Vote Vets.org. \n     ``You continue to pursue a failed strategy that is breaking \n     our great Army and Marine Corps. I left the Army in protest \n     in order to speak out. Mr. President, you have placed our \n     nation in peril.''\n       Those are inflammatory words from Batiste, a retired major \n     general.\n       Many senior officers say privately that such talk makes \n     them uncomfortable; they say that when your first name \n     becomes ``General,'' it is for the rest of your life. But \n     Batiste says he has received no communications from current \n     or former officers challenging his stance, although he \n     occasionally gets an anonymous e-mail with the heading \n     ``Traitor.''\n       Having quit the Army in anger over what he calls \n     mismanagement of the Iraq war, he says he chose a second \n     career far from Washington and the Pentagon so he could speak \n     freely on military issues.\n       ``I am outraged, as are the majority of Americans,'' he \n     said. ``I am a lifelong Republican. But it is past time for \n     change.''\n       Officials of VoteVets.org, an Internet-based veterans \n     advocacy organization, say the TV ads, which challenge the \n     president's argument that he listens to his commanders and \n     say his Iraq policies endanger U.S. security, will run in the \n     home districts of more than a dozen members of Congress.\n       Two other retired generals, Paul Eaton and Wesley Clark, \n     speak in the VoteVets.org campaign's other ads.\n       In response, White House spokeswoman Emily Lawrimore said: \n     ``We respectfully disagree.'' She said Bush confers routinely \n     with senior officers, citing a meeting Thursday with the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff and a conversation last week with Gen. \n     David Petraeus, the senior U.S. commander in Iraq.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is one where General Zinni, who criticized the war \nin Iraq, said, ``I have been called a traitor and a turncoat for \nmentioning these things.'' Outrageous--because he spoke out against the \nwar in Iraq.\n  Then you have retired General Batiste, who lashed out on the war and \nsays he gets e-mails with the heading, ``Traitor.''\n  My friend from Texas is taking one example, attacking an organization \nthat he doesn't agree with--I am sure of that--and we are going to be \npretty busy in the Senate if we turn into the ad police. When Senator \nCleland was attacked we didn't have a resolution on the floor of the \nSenate. When Senator Kerry was attacked we didn't do it. When General \nBatiste was attacked we didn't do it. For General Zinni we didn't do \nit. We did speak out, and we did speak out about the ad, all of us on \nboth sides of the aisle, that attacked General Petraeus. But we didn't \nhave a resolution all these times.\n  Suddenly, now, a political organization is attacked by name in a \nresolution in something that reminds me of the old, bad days in America \nwhen organizations were attacked by the Government. So what we have \ndone is we have written this. I thank Senators Levin and Reid and \nDurbin and other Senators who believe what we see is a trend to attack \nheroes. We say it is wrong. We don't go after one organization. We say \nit is wrong.\n  Let me show you the Max Cleland ad. We have the picture of Max \nCleland in the same ad with Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.\n  This is what Senator McCain had to say about that ad. Here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       I've never seen anything like that ad. . . .Putting \n     pictures of Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden next to a man \n     who lost three limbs on the battlefield, it's worse than \n     disgraceful, it's reprehensible.\n\n  But we didn't come down and pass a resolution attacking the campaign \nthat ran this ad. But now we have an attack on one organization. It is \nwrong. It should be defeated. This amendment I have offered is the one \nthat ought to pass this Chamber.\n  I yield to Senator Durbin my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to be notified when I have spoken for 2 \nminutes and leave the remaining time under the control of Senator \nBoxer.\n  This is a balanced amendment that Senator Boxer, Senator Levin, and I \nhave offered to this bill. I am not sure this is a debate in which we \nought to engage on a regular basis, but Senator Cornyn has the right to \nraise this issue, and he has raised it.\n  The point we want to make is this: The Cornyn amendment focuses on \none organization and one attack on an honorable, patriotic leader of \nour military, General Petraeus. If this resolution that he offers would \nbe fair, it would also take into consideration the situations that we \nhave raised in our amendment with Senator Boxer.\n  I asked Senator Cornyn last night: Will you amend your resolution so \nother attacks--unwarranted, disgraceful attacks--on the military can be \nincluded? And I gave him two examples, and he said no because those \nwere involved in a political campaign.\n  I am sorry, but that isn't good enough. If the principle is sound, it \nis sound whether it is in the course of a political campaign or not. If \nwe are going to stand up for the honor, integrity, and patriotism of \nthose who serve our country in uniform, let's do it without partisan \nfavor and certainly not arguing that a political campaign is somehow \nfair game to say anything about anybody. That is what is wrong with \nAmerican politics, and that is what has to change.\n  The Boxer amendment, which I am honored to cosponsor, changes it. I \nthink the examples we have cited in this amendment include not only the \nMoveOn ad, which has been dismissed and criticized by many on both \nsides of the aisle, but also goes to the so-called Swift Boat Veterans \nfor Truth out of Texas, an organization that attacked our colleague, \nSenator John Kerry, in what I think was one of the lowest moments in \nPresidential politics. It goes to the attacks on Senator Max Cleland, a \nman who used to sit in a wheelchair, having lost three limbs in \nVietnam, a disabled veteran struggling to be a Senator from Georgia \nwhose patriotism and courage were attacked in a political ad--something \nwhich I am sure is going to remain a shameful chapter in American \npolitics.\n  Those who want to join in standing up for men and women in uniform, \npast and present, have a chance to do it with the Boxer amendment. I am \nhonored to be a cosponsor.\n\n[[Page S11784]]\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in decrying the tone \nof modern politics where there are all too many personal attacks. But \nwhat they fail to recognize is those who volunteer to put ourselves up \nfor public office, to run for public office, we know what we are going \nto be subjected to in the back and forth of a political campaign. What \nthis amendment seeks to do, what the Boxer amendment seeks to do, is to \nchange the subject. The subject is this ad. The subject of my amendment \nis this ad put in the New York Times on September 9, 2007, attacking a \nfour-star general wearing the uniform of the U.S. Army, the Commander \nof the Multi-National Forces in Iraq--not only this individual, but \neveryone under his command, 170,000, approximately, members of the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  What does it accuse him of? Cooking the books for the White House. \nThe ad asks: Is it General Petraeus or General Betray Us? My friends on \nthe other side of the aisle want to change the subject. They do not \nwant to confront organizations such as MoveOn.org, which have the right \nto express their view thanks to the first amendment of the \nConstitution, thanks to people like General Petraeus and the brave men \nand women of the U.S. military who protect moveOn.Org's right to have \nits say. But we ought to have our say, too, and to condemn, in the \nstrongest possible words and by our actions, this kind of irresponsible \nad. It is clear, according to the New York Times Magazine of September \n9, this was a part of an orchestrated effort, both on the Hill and off \nthe Hill, to disparage this general before he even had a chance to make \nhis report to the Congress.\n  The Boxer amendment, with all due respect, is an effort to change the \nsubject, is a smokescreen to try to distract colleagues on the floor \nfrom holding MoveOn.org and those who would slander and by character \nassassination attack the reputation of leaders of the U.S. military who \nare doing nothing more than their duty and what the Commander in Chief \nand this Congress asks them to do. This is an attempt to excuse this \nkind of conduct by trying to change the subject. I would urge my \ncolleagues to reject it.\n  Frankly, if colleagues are going to vote against my amendment, it \nwill be tantamount to saying this kind of character assassination is \nokay. It is my hope that on a bipartisan basis we would rise up and we \nwould say it is not okay, it is unacceptable.\n  If, in fact, there are colleagues who think the amendment offered by \nmy distinguished colleague from California is going to be a fig leaf, \nwell, I tell you, it is not big enough, as most fig leaves are, to \ncover up the shame that will be on this body if we see colleagues vote \nagainst--basically vote for this kind of irresponsible ad.\n  There is a difference in kind, and I hope colleagues would, on calm \nreflection, recognize the differences between those of us who run for \npublic office and hold public office, and while we may all decry the \nkinds of personal attacks that have become all too common in political \ncampaigns, it is a difference in kind for MoveOn.org and those who \nsupport them to make personal attacks against a four star general in \nthe U.S. military commanding 170,000 American military servicemembers \nin a war zone in Iraq.\n  It is my hope that colleagues would vote unanimously for the \namendment which I have offered and reject the Boxer amendment as an \nattempt to change the subject and obscure the fact that this shameful \nad is out there without the disapproval, so far, of this body.\n  I think we all recognize that political campaigns are different. We \ndo not necessarily like them, but we are all volunteers, and we \nvolunteer to subject ourselves, unfortunately, to the tone of modern \npolitical campaigns today. I wish we could change it, and if there was \na way to do so, I would support that effort. But I do not support the \nBoxer amendment because it fails to recognize the key distinction \nbetween those who are public figures by choice and those who are public \nfigures by duty, people such as General Petraeus. It is a shame that we \nhave not been able to get a vote yet on this amendment, but I am glad \nwe will here in the next few minutes. I encourage my colleagues to vote \nin favor of my amendment on this character assassination against this \ngood man and to vote against the Boxer amendment for the reasons I \nmentioned.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I might say that my friend and colleague--\nmaybe he didn't read the Boxer amendment because we specifically \npointed to the Petraeus ad, and we say, in fact, that it was an \nunwarranted personal attack. I will just tell you right now, if my \ncolleague wants to vote no on all such attacks, whether it is against \nGeneral Batiste or Zinni, then vote no on the Boxer amendment. If you \nwant to vote no on the amendment that says two things here--we reaffirm \nour strong support for all the men and women in the U.S. Armed Forces, \nand we strongly condemn all attacks on the honor, integrity, and \npatriotism of any individual who is serving as or has honorably served \nin the U.S. Armed Forces by any person or organization--if my friend \nwants to vote against this, then so be it because just to attack one \norganization and not look at the larger problem of what is happening \nout there in our country seems to me a political vendetta and nothing \nmore.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wish to join with Senator Boxer in saying that there is \nno way I know of that one can justify or rationalize the attacks on \nSenator Cleland or on Senator Kerry. You can't, I believe, do that by \nsaying: Oh, no, they are in a political campaign; therefore, we can \nimpugn their service because they run for office. To say it is \ndifferent to impugn the honor of veterans such as Senator Cleland and \nSenator Kerry, it seems to me, is totally unacceptable. It is an effort \nto justify, differentiate, rationalize attacks which I consider to be \nabhorrent, just as I do the attack on General Petraeus, and I have said \nso very publicly. And this amendment, the Boxer amendment, makes it \nvery clear that attacks on men and women who have worn the uniform \nhonorably, attacking their service, their patriotism--this was not an \nattack on Senator Cleland's politics; this was an attack on his \npatriotism. Aligning him with Osama bin Laden in an ad is an attack on \nhis patriotism. You can't just single out one attack which you \ndislike--and we all do, I hope; I hope we all condemn the ad in the New \nYork Times. I have personally, and I feel very personal about it. I \nthought it was a disgraceful ad. But you can't just then say: But we \nare not going to talk about other attacks on men and women who have put \ntheir lives on the line, given up parts of their body, because they \ndecide to run for public office.\n  No, I am afraid the Cornyn amendment is the effort to justify and \nrationalize something which cannot be justified or rationalized just \nbecause a veteran who has served honorably, put his life on the line, \ndecides to run for public office. They are all disgraceful ads, and we \nought to treat them the same way. They impugn the honor, integrity, and \npatriotism of real heroes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four and a half minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I offered this resolution on the \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill about \n10 days ago, and it was objected to at that time, so that is the reason \nI am back again today and yesterday. It took until today for our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to come up with some reason \nnot to support this amendment which condemns this ad against this four \nstar general who wears the uniform of the U.S. Army and commands \n170,000 soldiers currently serving in harm's way in Iraq.\n  There is too much venom and too much poison in the political arena \ntoday. I do not like it any more than my colleagues on the other side. \nBut we have a tradition in this country of, after the campaigns are \nover, trying to work together in the best interests of the American \npeople. That is what we all try to do despite our differences, despite \nour party affiliation. But I would think we ought to rise up \nunanimously and condemn this character assassination of General \nPetraeus. And the fact\n\n[[Page S11785]]\n\nthat political campaigns in 2002 and 2004 involved ads that I think we \nall would find over the line as far as the political discourse in a \ncontested election should not detract from or dilute our condemnation \nof this particular ad.\n  You know, there is an unfortunate trend in our society today by \npeople refusing to take personal responsibility for their conduct by \nsaying: Well, we ought to condemn everybody, as if we should not \ncondemn those individuals and those organizations which have clearly \ncrossed the line in this case by saying: Well, we have to condemn \neverybody.\n  Well, I think this is the place to start, by condemning this ad, this \nirresponsible ad run in the New York Times at a discount by that \norganization, by that business entity, in favor of MoveOn.org, for the \nkind of ad I would hope we would unanimously condemn. Rather than \nrelitigating political campaigns in the past, my hope is we would vote \nfor this amendment and vote against the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  I ask the Senator from Texas, I was down here yesterday spending \nquite a bit of time on this particular issue. I was not aware the \nSenator from California was going to come in with her amendment. I \nassume the first vote we have is going to be on the Boxer amendment; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Well, let me just suggest to you, I think if the defining \nmoment--if you really agreed with what MoveOn.org did and what they \nsaid and how they demeaned one of the finest officers in the history of \nthis country--the guy has a Ph.D. from Princeton; he is not just a \nnormal person. The guy was unanimously agreed to and supported by the \ngroup here to go and do this work and take over the war in Iraq. This \nis the right guy for the right time. Huge successes are taking place.\n  I listened with some interest this morning to the House Foreign \nRelations subcommittee proceedings yesterday, and the very people who \nwere complaining that General Petraeus consulted with the White House \nto come up with his information are now saying he should have consulted \nwith White House and did not do it. You can't have it both ways.\n  I would just say this: The vote we are about to take is not a vote on \nan amendment by Senator Boxer; it is a vote as to whether you agree \nwith MoveOn.org coming in and saying the things they have articulated \nabout one of our top military leaders. That is what the vote is all \nabout.\n  I urge everyone to oppose the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, when General Petraeus was confirmed, the \nmajority leader called him a great man. My colleague from California \nreferred to him as an amazing man, saying: Of course I listen to \nGeneral Petraeus.\n  The Senator from Delaware said: I do not know anyone better than \nPetraeus. This is the thanks he gets after 9 months of service in Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) and \nthe Senator from Washington (Ms. Cantwell) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2934\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior a vote in relation the \namendment No. 2934, offered by the Senator from Texas.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to proceed for a few \nminutes on my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it has been more than a week since the \njunior Senator from Texas offered an amendment condemning an ad by \nMoveOn.org that appeared last Monday in the New York Times.\n  The ad was, by any standard--by any standard--abhorrent. It accused a \nfour-star general, who has the trust and respect of 160,000 men and \nwomen in Iraq, of betraying that mission and those troops, of lying to \nthem and to us.\n  Who would have ever expected anybody would go after a general in the \nfield at a time of war, launch a smear campaign against a man we have \nentrusted with our mission in Iraq?\n  Any group that does this sort of thing ought to be condemned.\n  Let's take sides: General Petraeus or MoveOn.org. Which one are we \ngoing to believe? Which one are we going to condemn? That is the \nchoice.\n  MoveOn says he is a traitor. If we believe that, we should condemn \nhim. If we do not believe that, then we ought to be condemning them, \nnot him.\n  Now, here is what we know about this group. I will bet you a lot of \nour Democratic colleagues do not know everything MoveOn is for. I think \nyou probably know they try to come to your aid from time to time, but I \nbet you do not know everything they advocate.\n  In the days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, it urged--\nMoveOn.org urged--a pacifist response to al-Qaida.\n  They rejected the idea that governments should be held responsible \nfor terrorists such as al-Qaida who operate within their borders.\n  This is the group that called defeating the PATRIOT Act ``a success \nstory,'' the group that ran an ad on its Web site equating the \nPresident to Adolf Hitler, the group that thinks organizations such as \nthe U.N. will rid the world of al-Qaida.\n  That is MoveOn.org. This is what we are dealing with. I cannot \nbelieve those are the views of a vast majority of my friends and \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  Now, what do we know about General Petraeus? Commander of the Multi-\nNational Force-Iraq; been in Iraq for about 4 years; literally wrote \nthe U.S. counterinsurgency manual; commanded the 101st Airborne \nDivision\n\n[[Page S11786]]\n\nduring the first year of Operation Iraqi Freedom; Assistant Chief of \nStaff for Operations of the NATO Stabilization Force and Deputy \nCommander of the U.S. Joint Interagency Counter-Terrorism Task Force in \nBosnia; Assistant Division Commander for Operations of the 82nd \nAirborne Division at Fort Bragg; West Point; aide to the Chief of Staff \nof the Army; battalion, brigade, and division operations officer; \nAssistant to the Supreme Allied Commander-Europe; Distinguished Service \nMedal; Defense Superior Service Medal; Legion of Merit; Bronze Medal \nfor Valor; NATO Meritorious Service Medal; one of America's 25 Best \nLeaders, according to US News & World Report; and a four-star general \nof the Army.\n  That is what we know about General Petraeus.\n  Here is what our friends on the other side of the aisle said about \nGeneral Petraeus when they confirmed him back in January.\n  The junior Senator from California called him ``an amazing man.''\n  The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the senior Senator \nfrom Delaware, said: ``I don't know anybody better than Petraeus.''\n  The senior Senator from Massachusetts said he is ``an outstanding \nmilitary officer, and our soldiers really deserve the best, and I think \nthey're getting it with your service,'' referring to General Petraeus.\n  The chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the senior Senator from \nMichigan, said: ``General Petraeus is widely recognized for the depth \nand breadth of his education, training, and operational experience.''\n  They praised him up and down in January, confirmed him unanimously, \nfunded his mission, and sent him the troops.\n  So now is the time to be heard. Is it right to call General Petraeus \na traitor or not? That is what this vote is about. Is it right to call \nGeneral Petraeus a traitor or not?\n  This group, MoveOn.org, is crowing all over the papers. They say they \nhave my colleagues on the other side of the aisle on a leash. They brag \nabout it. Their executive director has said, referring to the party on \nthe other side of the aisle, they are ``Our party.'' MoveOn.org says: \n``we bought it, we own it, and we're going to take it back.'' That is \nMoveOn.org saying that about our friends on the other side of the \naisle.\n  They claim to be in constant contact with people on the other side of \nthe aisle. I do not believe this group is telling all these great \nSenators on the other side of the aisle what to do. I do not believe \nthat. This is an opportunity to demonstrate it.\n  So this amendment gives our colleagues a chance to distance \nthemselves from these despicable tactics, distance themselves from the \nnotion that some group literally has them on a leash, akin to a puppet \non a string.\n  It is time to take a stand--not to dredge up political battles of the \npast but to condemn this ad.\n  What about this ad should not be condemned? Is there anything about \nthis ad that should not be condemned?\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with General Petraeus and against this \nad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the only thing my friend left off regarding \nGeneral Petraeus, he also has a Ph.D. from Princeton. He is a man we \nall have great regard for. I think no one disputes that General \nPetraeus is a good soldier. He follows orders, and that is what \nsoldiers are supposed to do, even a general. This general follows the \norders of the Commander in Chief, and that is the way it should be.\n  This is not the Petraeus war. It is the Bush war. I would say my \nfriend from Kentucky, my dear friend, my counterpart, is talking about \nan organization that has more than 3 million members. I do not know \nwhat any one of them may have said at any given time. I certainly \ncannot support everything they say, that is for sure.\n  But understand, the amendment that was offered by my friend, Senator \nBoxer, is very clear. It says the September 10, 2007, advertisement in \nthe New York Times ``was an unwarranted personal attack on General \nPetraeus.'' That is what it says. We just voted on that. I cannot \nimagine why some of my colleagues on the other side voted against this. \nThat is what it says. One reason, maybe it brought up some things from \nthe past, the recent past, such as yesterday.\n  For a party that endorsed longer troop time in Iraq for our soldiers; \nthat is, our people who are serving us so valiantly in Iraq cannot stay \nhome for the same amount of time they go over there--that is what this \nparty voted against. They voted in favor of second and third and fourth \ntours of duty for these young men and women.\n  We condemn all attacks on our valiant soldiers. That is what the \namendment we voted on said. I read what it says about the ad. We don't \nsupport that ad. We clearly voted accordingly.\n\n  But we also said we should remember--as I hope we remember the vote \nyesterday endorsing longer tours for our soldiers--I hope we also \nremember what happened to Max Cleland, a man who lost three limbs. \nEvery day of his life, including today, he wakes up and spends 2 hours \ngetting dressed. He dresses himself. He does his exercise, running on a \nmattress, with his stumps. He was decorated for heroism. But he wasn't \npatriotic enough to serve in the Senate, according to people who are in \nthis Chamber. They ran ads against Max Cleland. John Kerry: Two Silver \nStars, two Purple Hearts. Did I hear my friends complaining about these \nvicious ads against John Kerry when he was running for President? Not a \nsingle murmur. Some were cheering on the Swift Boat demons.\n  So as we say in this resolution, we do not support any unwarranted \nattack on General Petraeus or any other of our military members. But \nwhat we want to do here is talk about the war--the war. The policy is \nbad. We will soon be starting the sixth year of this war, costing this \ncountry right now about three-quarters of a trillion dollars, and we \nare fighting for pennies for children's health, pennies for doing \nthings about the environment, and education. The President is \ncomplaining because what we want to do in our appropriations bills is \n$21 billion over this magic number he came up with, $21 billion in an \napproximately $1 trillion bill, ultimately how much it will be for \ntaking care of things the Government wants. But we are going to have in \na few days another supplemental appropriations bill for Iraq \napproaching about two hundred billion more dollars.\n  The American people are fed up with this. No one over here endorses \nthe ad that was in that newspaper. None of us do. But we want to talk \nabout the war. They want to talk about an ad in a newspaper. None of us \nin any way criticized General Petraeus. He is a soldier. He is \nfollowing a policy set by the Commander in Chief. But that doesn't take \naway from the problems the American people feel are as a result of this \nwar: death, injury to men and women. So I hope--we are on the Defense \nauthorization bill--we can proceed on the Defense authorization bill, \ncomplete this legislation, have civil debate on Iraq policy, and we \nhope to do that. I say respectfully to my friends, focus on the policy \nof this war, not on an ad we had nothing to do with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. If we have time left, I yield it back, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, could I ask what the parliamentary \nsituation is? I thought Senator Cornyn was going to have an amendment \nand I was going to have an amendment this morning. Is that accurate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 2934 offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this amendment is about the difference \nbetween a uniformed leader of our U.S. military, GEN David Petraeus, \nthe difference between him and a political candidate. Surely our \ncolleagues--all of us in the Chamber understand, having run for office \nourselves, that there\n\n[[Page S11787]]\n\nare things said in political campaigns which many of us regret. But our \nfocus should not be distracted from this character assassination \nagainst a great American patriot. I can't believe any Member of this \nSenate would vote against this amendment which condemns this character \nassassination and by their vote against this amendment would say it is \nOK.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, John Kerry and Max Cleland are great \nheroes. My colleagues on the other side voted not to condemn the \nattacks against them, even though the Senator from Arizona did so, and \nI have the chart of what he said.\n  This is about politics, let's face it. Since when are we the ad \npolice who go after organizations by name and wave around their name? \nWhat are we going to do next when there is a health care debate? Are we \ngoing to condemn one organization on one side and one on the other, or \nare we going to do it on choice and hold up some very tough ads that we \nsee running all over this country? I would hope not.\n  This is the United States of America. We condemn all attacks against \nour men and women serving honorably in the military, not just one \norganization. We condemn all the attacks. I hope our colleagues will \nvote ``no.'' Otherwise, we are starting a terrible precedent around \nhere we will regret.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2934. The yeas and nays \nare ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, it is our understanding--and Senator McCain \nand I have discussed this--that Senator Feingold will be recognized to \noffer amendment No. 2924.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 hours of debate, with the \ntime divided as follows: 90 minutes under the control of Senator \nFeingold or his designee, 30 minutes under the control of Senator \nMcCain or his designee; that no amendment be in order to the amendment \nprior to the vote; that upon the use or yielding back of time, without \nfurther intervening action or debate, the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the amendment, and that if the amendment doesn't receive 60 \nvotes, it be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I thank the distinguished chairman, Senator Levin. I want \nto mention this: Is it the chairman's understanding that after that, we \nwould probably go to the Levin-Reed amendment and have a time agreement \nfollowing that? Is it also the chairman's understanding that any Iraq-\nrelated amendment would probably be a 60-vote requirement? Finally, is \nit also the understanding of the chairman that at 3 p.m. today we would \nexpect all amendments to be filed on this bill?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do not object.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is our hope to work out an arrangement so we can \nproceed next to the Levin-Reed amendment. If that is the situation, we \nwould hope to work out a time agreement as well on that amendment. \nThere are two other matters that we may want to try to dispose of--at \nleast one other matter--prior to the Levin-Reed amendment. It is our \nhope as well, as the Senator from Arizona expects, that amendments that \nare Iraq related include the 60-vote requirement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Also, if I could be recognized briefly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the unanimous consent \nagreement is agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I remind my colleagues--and I again thank \nthe chairman, Senator Levin. I think we have had an excellent degree of \naccommodation, with occasional differences of opinion. But I appreciate \nhis leadership. I remind my colleagues this is the 12th day of debate \non this bill. The total time of debate has been 69 hours. We still have \nnot gotten to the body of the legislation. That is 12 days, 69 hours.\n  I know this is called a ``deliberative'' body, but we are now \nreaching the limits of that description. So I hope all of our \ncolleagues will work with us to dispose--hopefully today--of the Iraq-\nrelated amendments, and then we can close out the filing of amendments \non the bill itself and, hopefully, have some kind of agreement to \ndispose of this legislation.\n  Again, as we have pointed out several times, on this legislation is \nthe Wounded Warrior legislation, for our veterans, a pay raise, and so \nmany other important aspects of the legislation. We don't want us, for \nthe first time in more than 46 years, not to pass this important bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me also add one comment to Senators. We \nhave already, on this side, hotlined a unanimous consent agreement that \nno amendment would be in order to this bill, unless it is filed by 4 \np.m. this afternoon--no first-degree amendment would be in order. We \ndon't know what the response is. We hope all of the Democrats will \nagree to that. We believe that a similar unanimous consent request has \nbeen hotlined on the Republican side, but the ranking member would know \nthat.\n  We hope that works, for the reason the Senator gave, which is that \nthis bill is extremely important. We have been on it a long time. We \nare going to need a number of days, obviously, to resolve the hundreds \nof amendments\n\n[[Page S11788]]\n\nthat are still filed and have not been resolved. We are working to \nclear amendments, and we need the cooperation of everybody.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, one final comment. I am not sure I will \nneed all the time on this side for this amendment. We have debated this \namendment before, and I alert my colleagues that perhaps we can vote \nearlier than the 2-hour time that is involved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2064.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Amendment No. 2064?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nbe set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2924 to Amendment No. 2011\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I now call up amendment No. 2924.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Reid, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n     Sanders, and Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 2924 \n     to amendment No. 2011.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To safely redeploy United States troops from Iraq)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title XV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1535. SAFE REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES TROOPS FROM \n                   IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Transition of Mission.--The President shall promptly \n     transition the mission of the United States Armed Forces in \n     Iraq to the limited and temporary purposes set forth in \n     subsection (d).\n       (b) Commencement of Safe, Phased Redeployment From Iraq.--\n     The President shall commence the safe, phased redeployment of \n     members of the United States Armed Forces from Iraq who are \n     not essential to the limited and temporary purposes set forth \n     in subsection (d). Such redeployment shall begin not later \n     than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and \n     shall be carried out in a manner that protects the safety and \n     security of United States troops.\n       (c) Use of Funds.--No funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available under any provision of law may be obligated or \n     expended to continue the deployment in Iraq of members of the \n     United States Armed Forces after June 30, 2008.\n       (d) Exception for Limited and Temporary Purposes.--The \n     prohibition under subsection (c) shall not apply to the \n     obligation or expenditure of funds for the following limited \n     and temporary purposes:\n       (1) To conduct targeted operations, limited in duration and \n     scope, against members of al Qaeda and affiliated \n     international terrorist organizations.\n       (2) To provide security for United States Government \n     personnel and infrastructure.\n       (3) To provide training to members of the Iraqi Security \n     Forces who have not been involved in sectarian violence or in \n     attacks upon the United States Armed Forces, provided that \n     such training does not involve members of the United States \n     Armed Forces taking part in combat operations or being \n     embedded with Iraqi forces.\n       (4) To provide training, equipment, or other materiel to \n     members of the United States Armed Forces to ensure, \n     maintain, or improve their safety and security.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, last week, as the administration was \ntrying to convince us to stay the latest course in Iraq, it made very \nlittle mention of the fact that in every month this year, January \nthrough August, substantially more U.S. troops have died in Iraq than \nin the corresponding month in 2006.\n  It also had little to say about the British survey released last week \nwhich found that nearly one in two Baghdad households has lost at least \none member to war-related violence and that 22 percent of surveyed \nhouseholds across the nation have endured at least one death. Based on \nthe number of households in Iraq, this could mean that upwards of 1 \nmillion civilian deaths have occurred as a result of the war in Iraq.\n  Despite these facts, this administration assures us that violence is \ndecreasing and that the security situation in Iraq is getting better. \nThey tell us success is within reach and that we are closer to \nattaining our objectives, even though those objectives keep changing--\nmost recently from supporting a strong central government to a more \nbottom-up and local approach. Just give us more time, they say, just as \nthey said in 2004 and in 2005 and in 2006. The slogan may be different. \nWe have had ``Mission Accomplished'' and ``Stay the Course'' and ``The \nNew Way Forward'' and now ``Return on Success.'' But each time, we are \ntold we are on the right road until, that is, we reach another dead end \nand then a new slogan is invented to justify our open-ended presence in \nIraq. As the administration blunders from one mistake to another, brave \nAmerican troops are being injured and killed in Iraq, our military is \nbeing overstretched, countless billions of dollars are being spent, the \nAmerican people are growing more and more frustrated and outraged, and \nour national security, quite frankly, is being undermined.\n  Our top national security priority should be going after al-Qaida and \nits affiliates. They are waging a global campaign from north Africa to \nSoutheast Asia. We cannot afford to continue to focus so much of our \nresources on one single country without a legitimate strategy for \ndealing with the threats posed by al-Qaida's global reach.\n  Instead of seeing the big picture, instead of placing Iraq in the \nactual context of a comprehensive and global campaign against a \nruthless enemy, this administration persists in the tragic mistake it \nmade over 4 years ago when it took this country to war in Iraq. That \nwar has led to the deaths of more than 3,700 Americans and perhaps as \nmany as 1 million Iraqi civilians, it has deepened instability \nthroughout the Middle East, it has jeopardized our credibility, and it \nhas clearly alienated our friends and allies.\n  This summer's declassified National Intelligence Estimate confirms \nthat al-Qaida remains the most serious threat to the United States. \nIndeed, key elements of that threat have been regenerated, have even \nbeen enhanced. While we have been distracted by the war in Iraq, al-\nQaida has protected, rebuilt, and strengthened its safe haven in the \nborder region between Pakistan and Afghanistan and has increased its \ncollaboration with regional terrorist groups in other parts of the \nworld. With its safe haven, al-Qaida is working to expand its network \nand, therefore, its ability to strike Western targets, including ones \nright here in the United States.\n  The administration has much to say about al-Qaida in Iraq. They will \nnot tell you al-Qaida in Iraq is an al-Qaida affiliate which was \nspawned by this disastrous war, however, and they would rather not talk \nabout al-Qaida's safe haven in the Pakistan-Afghanistan region or even \nrecognize the serious global threat that continues to exist and that \nhas even been strengthened while our troops are dying in Iraq. That \ntells you all you need to know about the administration's painfully \nnarrow focus on Iraq.\n  The war in Iraq is not making us safer. It is making us more \nvulnerable. It is stretching our military to the breaking point and \ninflaming tensions and anti-American sentiment in an important and \nvolatile part of the world. It is playing into the hands of our \nenemies, as even the State Department recognized when it said the war \nin Iraq is ``used as a rallying cry for radicalization and extremist \nactivity in neighboring countries.''\n  Of course, it would be easy to put all the blame on the \nadministration, but I am afraid Congress is complicit too. Congress \nauthorized the war. Congress has so far allowed it to continue despite \nstrong efforts from the new Democratic leadership. Now, once again, it \nis up to us in Congress to reverse this President's intractable policy, \nto listen to the American people, to save American lives, and to \nprotect our Nation's security by redeploying our troops from Iraq. We \nhave the power and the responsibility to act, and we must act now.\n  I am not suggesting that we abandon the people of Iraq or that we \nignore the political stalemate there and the rapidly unfolding \nhumanitarian crisis which has displaced more than 4 million Iraqis from \ntheir homes. These critical issues require the attention and \nconstructive engagement of U.S.\n\n[[Page S11789]]\n\npolicymakers, key regional players, and the international community. \nBut such turbulence cannot and will not be resolved by a massive \nmilitary engagement. The administration's surge is another dead end. \nThe surge was supposedly aimed at creating the space necessary for \npolitical compromise, but the Iraqi Government is no more reconciled \nthan it was when the surge began, and American troops are dying in \ngreater numbers--greater numbers--than last year or the year before.\n  That is why I am again offering an amendment, with the majority \nleader, Harry Reid, and Senators Leahy, Boxer, Whitehouse, Harkin, \nSanders, Schumer, Dodd, Durbin, and Menendez. Our amendment, which is \nsimilar to legislation we introduced earlier this year, would require \nthe President to begin safely redeploying U.S. troops from Iraq within \n90 days of enactment, and it would require the redeployment to be \ncompleted by June 30, 2008.\n  At that point, with our troops safely out of Iraq--and I repeat \nthat--at that point, with our troops safely out of Iraq, funding for \nthe war would be ended, with four narrow exceptions: providing security \nfor U.S. Government personnel and infrastructure, training the Iraqi \nsecurity forces, providing training and equipment to U.S. service men \nand women to ensure their safety and security, and conducting targeted \noperations limited in duration and scope against members of al-Qaida \nand other affiliated international terrorist organizations.\n  By enacting Feingold-Reid, we can finally focus on what should be our \ntop national security priority--waging a global campaign against al-\nQaida and its affiliates. Our amendment will allow targeted missions \nagainst al-Qaida in Iraq, but it will not allow the administration to \nmaintain substantial numbers of U.S. troops in that country.\n\n  The amendment will also allow training of Iraqis who have taken steps \nto address serious concerns about the loyalties of the ISF. The \nGovernment Accountability Office has found that the ISF have been \ninfiltrated by Shia militia, and General Jones's recent report \nindicated ISF are compromised by militia and sectarian alliances. In \naddition, there have been several reports of ISF attacks upon U.S. \ntroops. That is why we do not allow training for Iraqis who have been \ninvolved in sectarian violence or attacks upon Americans.\n  We also prevent the ``training'' exception from being used as a \nloophole to keep tens of thousands of U.S. troops in Iraq. We do this \nby stipulating that U.S. troops providing training cannot be embedded \nor take part in combat operations with the ISF. Training should be \ntraining, not a ruse for keeping American troops on the front lines of \nthe Iraqi civil war. Of course, U.S. troops can take part in combat \noperations specifically against al-Qaida and its affiliates.\n  Some of my colleagues will oppose this amendment. That is their \nright. But I hope none of them will suggest that Feingold-Reid would \nhurt the troops by denying them equipment or support. Why do I hope \nthey don't say that? Because there is no truth to the argument. None. \nThis is an absolutely phony argument used time and again to try to get \naway from what this amendment actually does. Passing this legislation \nwill result in our troops being safely redeployed by the deadline we \nset. At that point, with the troops safely out of Iraq, funding for the \nwar would end, with the narrow exceptions I listed. That is what \nCongress did in 1993 when it voted overwhelmingly to bring our military \nmission in Somalia to an end by setting a deadline after which funding \nfor that mission would end. And that is what Congress must do again to \nterminate the President's unending mission in Iraq.\n  In order to make clear our legislation will protect the troops, we \nhave added language requiring that redeployment ``shall be carried out \nin a manner that protects the safety and security of United States \ntroops,'' and we have specified that nothing in this amendment will \nprevent U.S. troops from receiving the training or equipment they need \n``to ensure, maintain, or improve their safety and security.'' So I \nhope we will not be hearing any more phony arguments about troops on \nthe battlefield somehow not getting the supplies they need.\n  Other amendments might set goals for redeployment or merely call for \na change in mission, but those proposals do not go far enough. Nor is \nit sufficient to pass legislation that allows substantial numbers of \nU.S. troops to remain in Iraq indefinitely. As the President's Iraq \npolicy continues unchecked, we need to invoke the power and the \nresponsibility bestowed upon us by the Constitution and bring this to a \nclose.\n  This war doesn't make sense. It is hurting our country, our military, \nand our credibility. It is time for this war to end. The American \npeople know this, and they are looking to us to act. I hope we will not \nlet them down again.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered \nby my good friend from Wisconsin. I would prefer to be discussing other \nreform issues with him than this one, but this is an important \namendment.\n  As usual, the Senator from Wisconsin makes a passionate and \npersuasive case. Unfortunately, the pending amendment would mandate a \nwithdrawal of U.S. combat forces within 90 days of enactment and cut \noff funds for our troops in Iraq after June 30, 2008. One exception \nwould be for a small force authorized only to carry out narrowly \ndefined missions.\n  The Senate, once again, faces a simple choice: Do we build on the \nsuccesses of our new strategy and give General Petraeus and the troops \nunder his command the time and support needed to carry out their \nmission or do we ignore the realities on the ground and legislate a \npremature end to our efforts in Iraq, accepting thereby all the \nterrible consequences that will ensue? That is the choice we must make, \nand though politics and popular opinion may be pushing us in one \ndirection, we have a greater responsibility, in my view, a duty to make \ndecisions with the security of this great and good Nation foremost in \nour minds.\n  We now have the benefit of the long-anticipated testimony delivered \nby General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, testimony that reported \nunambiguously that the new strategy is succeeding in Iraq. \nUnderstanding what we know now--that our military is making progress on \nthe ground and that their commanders request from us the time and \nsupport necessary to succeed in Iraq--it is inconceivable that we in \nCongress would end this strategy just as it is beginning to show real \nresults.\n  We see today that after nearly 4 years of mismanaged war, the \nsituation on the ground in Iraq is showing demonstrable signs of \nprogress. The final reinforcements needed to implement General \nPetraeus's new counterinsurgency plan have been in place for over 2 \nmonths, and our military, in cooperation with the Iraqi security \nforces, is making significant gains in a number of areas.\n  General Petraeus reported in detail on these gains during his \ntestimony in both Houses and in countless interviews. The No. 2 U.S. \ncommander in Iraq, GEN Ray Odierno, said today--Madam President, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article today by AP \nconcerning General Odierno's comments saying ``that a seven-month old \nsecurity operation has reduced violence by 50 percent in Baghdad but he \nacknowledged that civilians were still dying at too high a rate.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                U.S. Commander: Violence Down in Baghdad\n\n                         (By Katarina Kratovac)\n\n       The No. 2 U.S. commander in Iraq said Thursday that a \n     seven-month-old security operation has reduced violence by 50 \n     percent in Baghdad but he acknowledged that civilians were \n     still dying at too high a rate.\n       The comments came as relations between the U.S. and Iraqi \n     governments remained strained in the wake of Sunday's \n     shooting involving Blackwater USA security guards, which \n     Iraqi officials said left at least 11 people dead. Prime \n     Minister Nouri al-Maliki suggested the U.S. Embassy find \n     another company to protect its diplomats.\n       The Moyock, N.C.-based company has said its employees acted \n     ``lawfully and appropriately'' in response to an armed attack \n     against a State Department convoy.\n       But a survivor who said he was three cars away from the \n     convoy denied the American guards were under fire, claiming \n     they apparently started shooting to disperse more than\n\n[[Page S11790]]\n\n     two dozen cars that were stuck in a traffic jam.\n       ``It is not true when they say that they were attacked. We \n     did not hear any gunshots before they started shooting,'' \n     lawyer Hassan Jabir said from his hospital bed.\n       On Thursday, Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno told reporters that \n     car bombs and suicide attacks in Baghdad have fallen to their \n     lowest level in a year, and civilian casualties have dropped \n     from a high of about 32 to 12 per day.\n       He also said violence in Baghdad had seen a 50 percent \n     decrease, although he did not provide details about how the \n     numbers were obtained and said that was short of the \n     military's objectives.\n       ``What we do know is that there has been a decline in \n     civilian casualties, but I would say again that it's not at \n     the level we want it to be,'' Odierno said. ``There are still \n     way too many civilian casualties inside of Baghdad and \n     Iraq.''\n       Al-Qaida in Iraq was ``increasingly being pushed out of \n     Baghdad, ``seeking refuge outside'' the capital and ``even \n     fleeing Iraq,'' Odierno said.\n       Lt. Gen. Abboud Qanbar, the Iraqi military commander, said \n     that before the troop buildup, one-third of Baghdad's 507 \n     districts were under insurgent control.\n       ``Now, only five to six districts can be called hot \n     areas,'' he said. ``Al-Qaida now is left only with booby-\n     trapped cars and roadside bombs as their only weapon, which \n     cannot be called quality operations, and they do not worry \n     us.''\n       Qanbar also reported the release of 1,686 detainees from \n     Iraqi jails.\n       Odierno said the U.S. military had separately released at \n     least 50 detainees per day, or a total of at least 250, since \n     beginning an amnesty program for inmates as a goodwill \n     gesture linked to the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.\n       Meanwhile, a U.S. soldier died Wednesday in a non-combat \n     incident in Anbar west of Baghdad, the military said, adding \n     that the incident was under investigation.\n       After the shooting Sunday in the Mansour district of \n     western Baghdad, Blackwater spokeswoman Anne E. Tyrrell said \n     the employees acted ``lawfully and appropriately'' in \n     response to an armed attack against a U.S. State Department \n     convoy.\n       But Iraqi witnesses claim seeing Blackwater security guards \n     fire at civilians randomly.\n       Speaking from his bed in the Yarmouk hospital four days \n     after the incident, Jabir said he was one of the wounded when \n     Blackwater's security guards opened fire in Nisoor Square.\n       He said he was stuck in a traffic jam near Nisoor Square in \n     western Baghdad when he saw the American convoy of armored \n     vehicles and black SUVs parked about 20 yards away at an \n     intersection, apparently following an explosion.\n       Jabir said the Americans began yelling to disperse the \n     vehicles, then opened fire as the cars were trying to turn \n     around.\n       ``Some people, including women and children, left their \n     cars and began crawling on the street to avoid being shot but \n     many of them were killed. I saw a 10-year-old boy jumping in \n     fear from one of the minibuses and he was shot in his head. \n     His mother jumped after him and was also killed,'' Jabir \n     said, adding that his car flipped over in the chaos.\n       The incident has angered Iraqis, uniting them in blaming \n     U.S. forces for the violence in their country and backing the \n     government's announcement to ban Blackwater from Iraq.\n       U.S. and Iraqi officials announced they would form a joint \n     committee to try to reconcile widely differing versions of \n     the incident. Conflicting accounts were circulating among \n     Iraqi officials themselves.\n       Land travel by U.S. diplomats and other civilian officials \n     outside the fortified Green Zone was suspended following the \n     Iraqi government order that Blackwater stop working.\n       The U.S.-based company is the main provider of bodyguards \n     and armed escorts for American government civilian employees \n     in Iraq and banning it from Iraq would hamper and make \n     movement of U.S. diplomats and others difficult.\n       Al-Maliki, who disputed Blackwater's version of what \n     happened, spoke out sharply against the company Wednesday, \n     saying the government would not tolerate the killing of its \n     citizens ``in cold blood.''\n       He also said the shootings had generated such ``widespread \n     anger and hatred'' that it would be ``in everyone's interest \n     if the embassy used another company while the company is \n     suspended.''\n       Eager to contain the crisis, the State Department said \n     Wednesday a joint U.S.-Iraqi commission will be formed.\n       The size and composition of the commission have yet to be \n     determined but its members are charged with assessing the \n     results of both U.S. and Iraqi investigations of Sunday's \n     incident, reaching a common conclusion about what happened \n     and recommending possible changes to the way in which the \n     embassy and its contractors handle security, the State \n     Department said.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. He said that the violence, as I said, has been reduced by \nsome 50 percent, that car bombs and suicide attacks in Baghdad have \nfallen to their lowest levels in a year, and that civilian casualties \nhave dropped from a high of 32 per day to 12 per day.\n  His comments were echoed by LTG Abboud Qanbar, the Iraqi commander, \nwho said that before the surge began, one-third of Baghdad's 507 \ndistricts were under insurgents' control. Today, he said, only five to \nsix districts can be called hot areas.\n  I want to be clear to my friend from Wisconsin and my colleagues, \nnone of this is to argue that Baghdad or other regions have suddenly \nbecome safe or that violence has come down to acceptable levels. As \nGeneral Odierno pointed out, violence is still too high and there are \nmany unsafe areas. Nevertheless, such positive developments illustrate \nGeneral Petraeus's contention last week that American and Iraqi forces \nhave achieved substantial progress under their new strategy.\n  The road in Iraq remains, as it always has been, long and hard. The \nMaliki government remains paralyzed and unwilling to function as it \nmust, and other difficulties abound. No one can guarantee success or be \ncertain about its prospects. We can be sure, however, that should the \nCongress succeed in terminating the new strategy by legislating an \nabrupt withdrawal and a transition to a new, less effective, and more \ndangerous course--should we do that, then we will fail for certain.\n  I wish to remind all of my colleagues of a statement made by the \nPresident of Iran approximately 1 week ago. Every American should hear \nthis statement. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadi-Nejad declared \nyesterday that U.S. political influence in Iraq was ``collapsing \nrapidly,'' and said Tehran was ready to help fill any power vacuum. He \nstated at a news conference in Tehran, referring to U.S. troops in \nIraq:\n\n       The political power of the occupiers is collapsing rapidly. \n     Soon, we will see a huge power vacuum in the region. Of \n     course, we are prepared to fill the gap, with the help of \n     neighbors and regional friends like Saudi Arabia, and with \n     the help of the Iraqi Nation.\n\n  That is what this is about. That is what this is about. Let us make \nno mistake about the cost of such an American failure in Iraq. In his \ntestimony before the Armed Services Committee last week, General \nPetraeus referred to an August Defense Intelligence Agency report that \nstated:\n\n       A rapid withdrawal would result in the further release of \n     strong centrifugal forces in Iraq and produce a number of \n     dangerous results, including a high risk of disintegration of \n     the Iraqi Security Forces; a rapid deterioration of local \n     security initiatives; al-Qaida-Iraq regaining lost ground and \n     freedom of maneuver; a marked increase in violence and \n     further ethno-sectarian displacement and refugee flows; and \n     exacerbation of already challenging regional dynamics, \n     especially with respect to Iran.\n\n  These are the likely consequences of a precipitous withdrawal, and I \nhope the supporters of such a move will tell us how they intend to \naddress the chaos and catastrophe that would surely follow such a \ncourse of action. Should this amendment become law, and U.S. troops \nbegin withdrawing, do they believe Iraq would become more or less \nstable? That the Iraqi people become more or less safe? That genocide \nbecomes a more remote possibility or even likelier? That al-Qaida will \nfind it easier to gather, plan, and carry out attacks from Iraqi soil, \nor that our withdrawal will somehow make this less likely?\n  No matter where my colleagues came down in 2002 about the centrality \nof Iraq to the war on terror, there can simply be no debate that our \nefforts in Iraq today are critical to the wider struggle against \nviolent Islamic extremism. Earlier this month, GEN Jim Jones, who was \nwidely quoted by opponents of this new strategy, testified before the \nArmed Services Committee and outlined what he believes to be the \nconsequences of such a course.\n\n       A precipitous departure which results in a failed state in \n     Iraq, will have a significant boost in the numbers of \n     extremists, jihadists in the world, who will believe they \n     will have toppled the major power on earth and that all else \n     is possible. And I think it will not only make us less safe; \n     it will make our friends and allies less safe. And the \n     struggle will continue. It will simply be done in different \n     and in other areas.\n\n  I don't see how General Jones could have made himself more clear and \nsuccinct, and yet I continue to hear selective quotes from his \ncommissioned reports and his testimony that somehow would lead people \nto believe he would support such a proposal as being made today by my \nfriend from Wisconsin.\n\n[[Page S11791]]\n\n  Should we leave Iraq before there is a basic level of stability, we \ninvite chaos, genocide, terrorist safe havens, and regional war. We \ninvite further Iranian influence at a time when Iranian operatives are \nalready moving weapons, training fighters, providing resources, and \nhelping plan operations to kill American soldiers and damage our \nefforts to bring stability to Iraq. If our notions of national security \nhave any meaning, they cannot include permitting the establishment of \nan Iranian-dominated Middle East that is roiled by wider regional war \nand riddled with terrorist safe havens.\n  The supporters of this amendment respond they do not by any means \nintend to cede the battlefield to al-Qaida. On the contrary, their \nlegislation would allow U.S. forces, presumably holed up in forward \noperating bases, to carry out ``targeted operations, limited in \nduration and scope, against members of al-Qaida and other international \nterrorist organizations.'' But such a provision draws a false \ndistinction between terrorism and sectarian violence. Let us think \nabout the implications of ordering American soldiers to target \n``terrorists'' but not those who foment sectarian violence. Was the \nattack on the Golden Mosque in Samarra a terrorist operation or the \nexpression of sectarian violence? When the Madhi army attacks \ngovernment police stations, are they acting as terrorists or as a \nmilitia? When AQI attacks a Shia village along the Diyala River, is \nthat terrorism or sectarian violence? What about when an American \nsoldier comes across some unknown assailant burying an IED in the road? \nMust he check for an al-Qaida identity card before responding?\n  The obvious answer is such acts very often constitute terrorism in \nIraq and sectarian violence in Iraq. The two are deeply intertwined. To \ntry to make an artificial distinction between terrorism and sectarian \nviolence is to fundamentally misunderstand al-Qaida's strategy, which \nis to incite sectarian violence. It is interesting that some supporters \nof this amendment embrace the recent GAO report, which said it could \nnot distinguish between sectarian violence and other forms of violence \nbecause that would require determining an intent--an impossible task. \nYet these same supporters would have our troops in the field attempt to \ndo just that. Our military commanders say trying to artificially \nseparate counterterrorism from counterinsurgency will not succeed, and \nthat moving in with search-and-destroy missions to kill and capture \nterrorists only to immediately cede the territory to the enemy is the \nfailed strategy of the past 4 years. We should not and must not return \nto such a disastrous course.\n\n  The strategy General Petraeus has put into place--a traditional \ncounterinsurgency strategy that emphasizes protecting the population, \nwhich gets our troops out of the bases and into the areas they are \ntrying to protect, and which supplies sufficient force levels to carry \nout the mission--is the correct one. It has become clear by now we \ncannot set a date for withdrawal without setting a date for surrender.\n  This fight is about Iraq, but not about Iraq alone. It is greater \nthan that and more important still about whether America still has the \npolitical courage to fight for victory or whether we will settle for \ndefeat, with all the terrible things that accompany it. We cannot walk \naway gracefully from defeat in this war. Consider one final statement \nfrom the August National Intelligence Estimate. It reads:\n\n       We assess that changing the mission of the Coalition forces \n     from a primarily counterinsurgency and stabilization role to \n     a primary combat support role for Iraqi forces and \n     counterterrorist operations to prevent AQI from establishing \n     a safe haven would erode any security gains achieved thus \n     far.\n\n  Should we pass this amendment, we would erode the security gains our \nbrave men and women have fought so hard to achieve and embark on the \nroad of surrender. For the sake of American interests, our national \nvalues, the future of Iraq, and the stability of the Middle East, we \nmust not send our country down this disastrous course. All of us want \nour troops to come home, and to come home as soon as possible. But we \nshould want our soldiers to return to us with honor, the honor of \nvictory that is due all of those who have paid with the ultimate \nsacrifice. We have many responsibilities to the people who elected us, \nbut one responsibility outweighs all the others, and that is to protect \nthis great and good Nation from all enemies foreign and domestic. I \nurge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Feingold amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I surely agree with the Senator from \nArizona. I also wish we were out here working on something else, \nperhaps one of our political reform bills. We had started working on \nour campaign finance reform bill long before 9/11, and we are still \nworking on those issues together. It is certainly tragic for this \ncountry that, instead, we are mired in a situation in Iraq that takes \nus away not only from our national security issues but also our \ndomestic issues that need attention.\n  But I thank my colleague from Arizona. He argues on the merits. He \ndoesn't hide behind the resume of a general or talk about or use some \nother person as a human shield. He talks about the merits of the issue. \nHe and I have had a chance, thanks to his invitation on two occasions, \nto visit Iraq and look at what was happening. Frankly, we just come to \ndifferent conclusions. In fact, we couldn't be more far apart on this \nissue. Nonetheless, I respect the way he argues and the way we discuss \nthis, and I thank him for it.\n  In a moment, I will turn to one of my colleagues to speak, but I want \nto briefly respond to a couple of the issues that were brought up by \nthe Senator from Arizona. The Senator from Arizona and I agree \nabsolutely on something: We fear failure in the fight against \nterrorism. We want to defeat those who attacked us on 9/11.\n  For me, the fight is a global fight, which we have been distracted \nfrom due to Iraq. So what I am concerned about is that a continued \neffort in Iraq could lead to the ultimate failure in the fight against \nthose who attacked us on 9/11. It could lead to a surrender, a true \nsurrender against those who declared war on our country on September \n11, 2001. So that is the failure I fear. That is the failure I want to \nmake sure doesn't happen, because we have to protect the American \npeople.\n  The Senator from Arizona points out the very difficult problem of \nIran, which is related to but also separate from the question of al-\nQaida.\n  He says: What happens if we leave Iraq?\n  Let me tell you something. What we are doing in Iraq right now is the \nbest deal Iran ever had. We take all the hits, we lose the people, we \npay for everything, and their influence in Iraq increases every day. \nAnd they do not have to worry about a restive Sunni population in their \ncountry because they are not moving into Iraq directly. But if we left, \nthey would have to think twice about their own stability, if they tried \nto mess around in Iraq directly.\n  So, almost unbelievably, our strategy in Iraq plays into both the \nhands of al-Qaida and Iran. It is the most foolish move we could make \nin the fight against those who attacked us on 9/11 and against those \nwho are being very threatening to us at this point in the name of the \nIranian leader. It is the wrong strategy in both regards.\n  The Senator from Arizona asks: How are we going to get other \ncountries engaged if we leave Iraq? It is the reverse. None of these \nbordering countries are going to get serious. None of them are going to \nbecome engaged if they think we are going to just stay there--for a \ncouple of reasons. One is, Why should they? We are there putting up \nwith all the violence and difficulties and taking all the losses. They \ndon't have to spend anything.\n  The Senator from Arizona and I heard the Kuwaitis talk about this in \nKuwait, saying: Well, you know, you went in there; now you deal with \nit. If we are not in there, not only Iran and Syria, Jordan and others \nhave a definite interest in Iraq not being chaotic. That is when they \nstart to perform.\n  The other problem is, How can these Islamic countries help stabilize \nIraq now when in their countries our involvement in Iraq is perceived \nas an occupation of an Islamic country? So our very strategy stymies \nthe potential for stability being assisted by the other countries in \nthe region.\n  Those are just a couple of responses on the merits to some of the \npoints\n\n[[Page S11792]]\n\nmade by the Senator from Arizona. I firmly believe our strategy is \nhurting our country desperately in terms of our national security, and \nthat is why I and others offer the amendment.\n  At this point, I would like to yield 10 minutes to one of the \nstrongest advocates for this policy of trying to terminate this \ninvolvement, the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me say to both my colleague from \nWisconsin and my colleague from Arizona, I was the floor manager of the \nMcCain-Feingold campaign finance reform legislation. I feel as though, \nin a sense here, I am assuming the role again as the manager between \nthe McCain and Feingold camps on this question. They were two people \nwho joined forces together on a critical issue before our country, and \nI was honored and pleased to manage the legislation which was named for \nthem.\n  We find ourselves here again on a different subject matter and \nassuming different roles. I am not managing the issue, but I would be \nremiss if I didn't also express my deep respect for my colleague, the \nSenator from Wisconsin, for his leadership and my affection and respect \nfor my colleague from Arizona, with whom I have worked on a number of \nissues over the years.\n  I rise in support of the Feingold-Reid amendment. I believe it is a \nvery important amendment. This may be the critical vote, candidly, on \nwhether we are going to persist over the coming months, until January \n2009, in a policy that has failed--or whether we can actually make a \ndifference here, and change the direction of this policy, and give our \nNation a sense of new hope, new optimism, and give those who have \nserved so valiantly an opportunity to come home or to engage in an area \nwhere their leadership is needed. This is the moment. This may be the \none opportunity we have between now and 2009 to make a difference on \nthis issue. This is no small proposal; this is a serious one.\n  For those who would like to wish it were a little bit this way or \nthat way, that is no reason to be against it. Senator Feingold, once \nagain, has offered us an opportunity here to make a difference in this \npolicy. This may be the one real opportunity we get to do that. My hope \nis that in the next hour and a half, those who are listening to this \ndebate, thinking about this, will understand the moment before us, and \ntake advantage of this opportunity, and make a decision that could \naffect the future of our country in this century.\n  Out of 2 full days General Petraeus spent testifying before Congress, \nI think the most telling exchange took only four lines. There were \nhearings that went on in the House of Representatives. We had hearings \nin the Foreign Relations Committee and hearings in the Armed Services \nCommittee. There were very good questions raised by members of both \nparties, but I commend my colleague from Virginia, Senator John Warner, \nthe former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the ranking member \ntoday, for his simple question. We have often seen this happen in \nhistory. It is one simple sentence, one simple question--not the \ncomplicated, multiphrase question, which gets into all the nuances and \ndetails of an issue--that will shed the most light on where we stand.\n  Senator McCain said something a minute ago with which I totally \nagree, and Senator Feingold reiterated it. The primary purpose, the \nfundamental issue before this body, before every Member here and \ncertainly before the President of the United States, is the issue of \nthe safety and security of our country. That is our paramount \nresponsibility above all else--to keep our country safe and secure. So \nthe four-line question that was raised to General Petraeus in his \ntestimony on September 11 was the most important question, in many \nways, that was asked of him.\n\n       Senator Warner: Do you feel that [the Iraq war] is making \n     America safer?\n       General Petraeus: I believe that this is indeed the best \n     course of action to achieve our objectives in Iraq.\n       Senator Warner: Does it make America safer?\n       General Petraeus: I don't know, actually.\n\n  ``I don't know, actually.'' It could be the epitaph of this war. And \nto the families of the 3,791 men and women who lost their lives in \nIraq, it must be cold comfort indeed that the commanding general has \nnot even convinced himself that this war serves our security. But in \nanother sense, General Petraeus gave precisely the right answer. He has \nno opinion because it is his job to have none.\n  His job is to execute a mission--work that he has done with great \nfortitude and intellect. But the job of deciding whether the mission \nserves our interests--deciding what our interests are, deciding what \nthe mission itself will be--that is a task for the general's \nsuperiors--that is, the President of the United States, this body and \nthe other, and the American people, who are our superiors.\n  This amendment is our best attempt--maybe the only attempt--to give \nvoice to their shared conclusion: that our current course has failed to \nmake Iraq safer, has failed to make America safer, and so must change \ndramatically. The amendment would accomplish two critical things.\n  One: Redeploy combat forces from Iraq.\n  Two: Focus those forces remaining on counterterrorism, training Iraqi \nforces, and force protection for U.S. personnel and infrastructure.\n  I will not rehearse for you the administration's ever-shifting \njustifications and stalling and stonewalling that have brought us, with \na battered military and an equally battered reputation, to this sad \npoint. It is enough to say that they have been given every chance. For \nmonths and months, they denied that there was a civil war in Iraq. \nThen, when denial became impossible, and when the bipartisan Iraq Study \nGroup report gave them a unique chance to change course, they scrapped \nthe report and gambled on a surge.\n  Then we were told that, despite the administration's catastrophic \npolicy failures, we should take their word for it--that we couldn't \njudge this new tactic's success until American forces had ``surged'' to \ntheir maximum levels. And that would take up 6 months.\n  Once the surge was at full force, we were told yet again that the \ntime wasn't right, that we had to withhold judgment again and wait \nuntil General Petraeus's report. And last week, General Petraus came \nbefore Congress and told us--to wait some more.\n  For what?\n  Early this month, Comptroller General David Walker testified that \n``the primary point of the surge was to improve security . . . in order \nto provide political breathing room'' for the Iraqi Government.\n  Seven hundred American service men and women sacrificed their lives \nfor that breathing room, and nearly 4,400 took wounds for it. What has \nthe Iraqi Government done with it? It failed to meet its own political \nbenchmarks, failed to enact oil legislation, sustained a mass \nresignation of Sunni politicians, leaving more than half of its cabinet \nseats vacant, and enjoyed a month-long vacation.\n  At the height of the surge, a BBC poll reported that 60 percent of \nIraqis--and 93 percent of Sunnis--think it is justified to kill \nAmerican troops. It is no surprise that Walker concluded that ``as of \nthis point in time, [the surge] has not achieved its desired outcome.''\n  That is what the surge has gotten us. What has it gotten Iraqis? At \nthe very best, a reduction in violence to still-catastrophic early-2006 \nlevels. And even so, the statistics we saw last week were extremely \nsubject--as are all statistics--to the biases of those compiling and \ncategorizing them. According to the Washington Post, ``Intelligence \nanalysts . . . are puzzled over how the military designated attacks as \ncombat, sectarian, or criminal''--difficult categorizations that, I \nmight add, make all the difference to selling the surge as success, or \nrecognizing it as a failure.\n  Comptroller General Walker added that ``there are several different \nsources in the administration on violence, and those sources do not \nagree.'' One intelligence official put it succinctly: ``Depending on \nwhich numbers you pick, you get a different outcome.'' In that context, \nit is significant that the military cannot track, and does not track, \nShiite-on-Shiite and Sunni-on-Sunni violence. And in Baghdad alone, \naccording to the Iraqi Red Crescent, ``almost a million people . . .\n\n[[Page S11793]]\n\nhave fled their homes in search of security, shelter, water, \nelectricity, functioning schools or jobs to support their families.''\n  And those are the results with the surge--a surge that, given the \nexhausted state of our military, cannot physically be sustained. The \nadministration's supporters need to explain to us: Without the surge, \nwhat could possibly happen, that has not taken place already, to bring \npolitical reconciliation to Iraq?\n  What more could possibly happen to quell the violence between and \namong Iraq's Sunnis and Shiites? What new development could possibly \nchange the face of this war? We all know the honest answers to those \nquestions.\n  And so the choice we have today is not, as some would have it, \nbetween victory and defeat. That has never been the issue. We can \nchoose indefinite war for invisible gains; or we can choose to cut our \nlosses here and recognize that there is a better opportunity with a \ndifferent course of action. I can't remember a more painful choice in \nall my years in this body. But to govern is to make just such painful \nchoices, without fear or flinching. And I believe the American people \nare far ahead of us on this issue--they've made their choice. We must \nmake ours as their Representatives.\n  This amendment seeks to put that choice into action and to stop \nIraq's downward spiral. First, it sets firm and enforceable timelines \nfor the phased redeployment of combat troops out of Iraq.\n  The redeployed forces would be comprised of a majority of the \ndeployed Army Brigade Combat Teams and the Marine Expeditionary Force \ncurrently in theater. Some may claim that such a redeployment is \nlogistically impossible within the timeframes laid out in the \namendment. But I would remind them that in the ramp-up to the first \ngulf war, the Department of Defense coordinated the movement of over \n500,000 troops, and 10 million tons of cargo and fuel in the same \ntimeframe that this amendment grants to redeploy a force one-fifth the \nsize.\n  In January of 1991--1 month alone--the Transportation Command moved \n132,000 troops and 910,000 tons of equipment. So it is clear that we \nhave the wherewithal to end this war, if Congress could find the will. \nAt the same time, we cannot simply wish the conflict away. We do have \nenemies in Iraq, enemies equally committed to killing Americans and \nsowing sectarian violence. That is why this amendment carves out \nexceptions to the general redeployment.\n  Using the name of al-Qaida is a means to frighten Americans into \nbuying a far broader agenda of continuous occupation. It's no \ncoincidence that, in President Bush's televised remarks on Iraq last \nweek, the word ``al-Qaida'' crossed his lips some 12 times in a speech \nroughly 15 minutes long.\n  The amendment makes three noncombat exceptions: first, conducting \ncounterterrorism operations; second, training and Iraqi forces; and \nthird, protecting U.S. personnel and infrastructure.\n  It is beyond clear that continuing our course in Iraq harms America \nin the broader fight against terrorism. In an article in the Financial \nTimes, Gideon Rachman summarized the key ways the war in Iraq has \nactually strengthened terrorism: by diverting resources from fighting \nal-Qaida in Afghanistan; by turning Iraq into a failed state and \nterrorist-incubator; by delivering al-Qaida a potent recruiting tool; \nand by harming America's standing with its traditional allies, whose \ncooperation is necessary to foil terrorists. All four reasons are \nclearly being enhanced because of our continued military presence in \nIraq.\n  On the other side of the coin, tightly focusing our Iraq mission \nactually aids our security in the long run.\n  That certainly is the case when you consider the quote from a recent \nIPS article on CENTCOM's commander, ADM William Fallon--General \nPetraeus's superior, I might add. Admiral Fallon ``believed the United \nStates should be withdrawing troops from Iraq urgently, largely because \nhe saw greater dangers elsewhere in the region.'' With al-Qaida \nreconstituting itself on the Pakistan-Afghan border, I could not agree \nmore.\n  With redeployment complete, I want our military to begin to regather \nits strength. After a one-time redeployment cost estimated by the \nCongressional Budget Office at $7 billion, which is about equal to this \nwar's cost every month, our Armed Forces will have the resources needed \nto prepare for future challenges.\n  Those resources are sorely needed. Long, arduous deployments are not \nonly testing the morale of our troops and families, they are taxing \ncritical stocks of aircraft, vehicles, and other equipment. Two-thirds \nof the U.S. Army--two-thirds of the U.S. Army--is unable to report for \ncombat duty.\n  According to the National Guard Bureau Chief, LTG Steven Blum, ``88 \npercent''--his words, not mine--``88 percent of the Army National Guard \nforces that are back here in the United States are very poorly equipped \ntoday.''\n  That shortage affects National Guard units in every State, and every \none of our colleagues knows it. It is the picture of a military that \nhas been ground into the dirt, unit by unit, machine by machine, \nsoldier by soldier.\n  Do the President's supporters think this can go on forever? Will they \ncome to this floor and claim we are invulnerable? If General Petraeus \ndoes not know, actually, whether this war is making us safer, let's ask \nanother question: Is this war endangering our security?\n  Our military's top generals and admirals know the answer to that \nquestion. They have submitted to Congress a list of critical priorities \nthat President Bush's budget ignores. As we squander billions of \ndollars every week in Iraq, they are calling out for help to meet our \nmilitary's needs to repair the damage this administration has caused.\n  Our top generals and admirals know better than anyone how deeply our \nmilitary is hurting. We must meet these obligations to our war-fighters \nbecause it is, in the end, our obligation to keep safe the people we \nrepresent.\n  As I said at the outset, the question from Senator John Warner--the \nsimple, one-line question asked of General Petraeus--was the single \nmost important question asked during 2 days of hearings: Are we safer? \nThe answer, tragically, is no. What a disaster if this war of choice \nultimately left us unready and unarmed to fight a war we did not \nchoose.\n  Clear data, long experience, and common sense tell us all how to \nanswer the question that General Petraeus could not. I do not blame him \nfor staying silent. It is his duty, in that moment, to be agnostic. I \nunderstand that. But it is our duty not to be agnostic. We do not have \nthat luxury as Members of the Senate charged with the responsibility of \ndeciding whether this conflict goes on.\n  We cannot remain silent. We cannot beg off the answer to that \nquestion: Are we safer? Are we more secure? We know what the answer is. \nNow we bear the responsibility to this generation and to history to \nanswer the question. It is our duty to choose, a duty to choose at this \nmoment, even when there is heartache in either hand. I choose to draw \nthe line here because I cannot stand to lose one more life in the name \nof misplaced hope and blind faith.\n  I call on our colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, not to lose \nthis moment. This will be the only moment, I suspect, before January of \n2009 to answer this question. How many more lives will be irreparably \ndamaged and lost because we failed to answer the question posed by our \ncolleague from Wisconsin, which I am proud to join him in asking today. \nLet us bring this tragic chapter in our history to a close and offer \nnew hope to this country, and the Iraqis, and that desperate region.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut \nfor his very strong statement in support of our amendment, and even \nmore for his extremely passionate and consistent support all year.\n  I yield 10 minutes to another cosponsor of the amendment, the \nassistant majority leader, Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Chair please advise me when I \nhave 2 minutes remaining?\n  Madam President, this room we work in, this Chamber where the Senate \nmeets, is a Chamber that has seen a lot of history in its time. There \nhave been moments of great pride, and, unfortunately, moments I am sure \nwhere the\n\n[[Page S11794]]\n\nopposite has occurred in the history of this great Chamber.\n  It has been my honor to represent the wonderful State of Illinois for \n10 years as a Senator. Fewer than 2,000 Americans have ever had this \nchance to serve as a Senator. But the men and women who have been given \nthe opportunity are also given a responsibility far beyond the \nresponsibility of any individual citizen.\n  Votes come and go. If you put me on the spot and say: Tell me all \nyour votes from 2 weeks ago, I would be hard pressed to remember. But \nthere are some votes you can never forget. Whether as a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives or a Member of the Senate, I have found the \nvotes that gnaw into my conscience and keep me awake at night are votes \nrelated to war because when you vote on war, you know that at the end \nof the day, if you move forward, people will die. It may be the enemy, \nbut it is likely to also include many of your own and innocent people.\n  So in October of 2002, just weeks before reelection, we gathered in \nthis Chamber late at night, with the President who insisted that we \nvote to give him authority to go to war in Iraq. It was not that long \nafter we had given him the authority to go after those responsible for \n9/11, our current war in Afghanistan against the Taliban and al-Qaida.\n  But sadly before that vote, the American people were misled; misled \nby the President, the Vice President, the Cabinet, and the leaders of \nour Nation about the war in Iraq. The information given us about that \nwar was wrong. We were told that Saddam Hussein was a threat to the \nUnited States of America. That was not true. He was a bloody tyrant, \nruthless with his own people. He would certainly not win the approval \nof anyone in this Chamber for what he had done to his nation, but he \nwas not a threat to us.\n\n  We were told about weapons of mass destruction that beat the drums of \nwar and had our people anxious to respond quickly to protect us. People \nin the White House were talking about mushroom-shaped clouds and \nchemical weapons and biological weapons and stockpiles and aerial \nphotographs to prove that they all existed. It turned out none of that \nwas true.\n  The most grievous sin in a democracy is to mislead the American \npeople into a war, and that is what occurred. We were misled into a war \nthat night with a vote in this Chamber. On that evening there were 23 \nof us who voted against that war. There were a variety of reasons, but \nmost of us believed the President had not made a solid case for the \nwar, for the invasion of Iraq, and that he had not thought through what \nmight occur if we made that invasion.\n  I can recall one of my colleagues saying: It is far easier to get \ninto a war than it is to get out. In the fifth year of this war, that \ncertainly has been proven true.\n  I voted against the war that evening, 1 of 22 Democrats, less than a \nmajority of our own, with 1 Republican. Of all the votes that I have \never cast in the House and Senate, it is the one of which I am the \nproudest. I have never looked back with any doubt about that vote, not \none time.\n  Look what has happened since. Almost 3,800 of our best and brightest \nsons and daughters of Illinois and every State in the Union have died \nin Iraq. Thousands have been injured, some gravely injured. I visit \ntheir hospital rooms, I meet with their families, I watch as they \nstruggle to make life out of a broken body, trying to regain the spirit \nto look forward instead of backward. It is a bitter struggle.\n  Today, Senator Feingold of Wisconsin gives us a clear choice. Will we \ncontinue this war or will we bring it to a close? Will we change our \nmission and start to bring our troops home or will we allow this war to \ncontinue?\n  I sincerely hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will look \ncarefully at his amendment. He has worked long and hard on it.\n  He makes it clear that we are not going to pick up and leave \ntomorrow. We are going to redeploy in an orderly fashion. We are going \nto make certain our war against al-Qaida can still be waged within Iraq \nand wherever they raise their ugly heads. He is also going to make sure \nthat we protect our own and make certain that we provide training \nassistance, limited, but training assistance to the Iraqis so they can \nstand up and defend their own country.\n  So many of our colleagues have come to the floor and said: Do not \nchange a thing. Stick with the strategy. Well, I have been there three \ntimes now. I was just there a few weeks ago. It is a grim, sad, \nhorrific situation in Iraq. And there is no way to sugarcoat it. No \nreport from any general or any ambassador can change the reality of \nwhat is happening on the ground there.\n  To be given body armor when you go into Iraq, and a helmet, and be \ntold: You better wear this wherever you go, tells me this is not a safe \ncountry. In the fifth year of this war, the safest area in Baghdad, in \nthe Green Zone, they tell you: Put the body armor and helmet down at \nthe end of the bed because when the sirens go off you have 4 to 6 \nseconds to put it on.\n  See, we cannot have rocket attacks into what we call the safest area \nof Baghdad. There are parts of that city where they would not even \nconsider sending a Congressman or a Senator, just too dangerous, in the \nfifth year of this war with 160,000 or 170,000 of the best soldiers in \nthe world.\n  This administration is in complete denial about what is occurring in \nIraq. They are in complete denial about what the American people feel \nabout this war. And they are in complete denial about the utter failure \nof the Iraqi Government to lead its own people forward.\n  The Iraqis need to make some fundamental decisions before we can \ncelebrate democracy in Iraq. And the first question they have to \nresolve is, are they Iraqis first or are they members of a religious \nsect first? I do not think that question has been resolved. It \ncertainly has not been resolved in parts of the Muslim world for 14 \ncenturies, and sadly the crucible of this battle now is Iraq.\n  Our soldiers, our men and women in uniform, have been tossed into \nthis bloody, deadly sectarian fight that continues by the day. The \nIraqi Government finds excuse after excuse not to produce the most \nbasic elements of governance, and as they plunder and blunder away, our \nsoldiers die in the streets of their cities.\n  I have had it. Someone said to me earlier: Well, are the American \npeople putting a lot of pressure on you about this war?\n  I said in response: The American people could not put more pressure \non me about this war than I already feel. I feel for every one of those \nsoldiers I sat down with for lunch in that country. I feel for all of \nthem I see shipping out from my State and all across America. I feel \nfor every wife and husband back home, trying to keep these kids \ntogether during a lengthy deployment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I feel it is time for a change. I cannot in good \nconscience continue to give this President a blank check for this war \nbecause I know what he is going to do with that money. He is going to \ncontinue this failed policy with no end in sight. We are going to \ncontinue to lose 100 or more soldiers every single month until he can \nback out of the exit of this Presidency on January 20, 2009.\n  I am sorry, but I can no longer be party to financing what I consider \nto be the worst foreign policy mistake in our history. I will support \nSenator Feingold. I will provide the funds for the orderly redeployment \nof our troops to make sure that the terrorists are fought where they \nshould be fought and to do what we can to help the Iraqis. But in the \nfifth year of this war, it is time to change.\n  Now, I listen on the floor of the Senate while many of my colleagues \nwant to change the subject. They want to talk about ads and newspapers \nabout General Petraeus. Well, let me tell you something. I respect \nGeneral Petraeus. But we have more important things to do than debate \nads in newspapers. And instead of looking for ways to change the \nsubject, we need to join together in a bipartisan fashion to change the \nwar. That is why we are here. That is what we will be judged by. And \nthe question is whether we will stand up now that we have a choice and \na vote. Will we march in blind allegiance to a President who has \nbrought us to this sad, tragic moment in our history or will we in the \nSenate have the courage, on a bipartisan basis, to stand up for people \nacross America, for our soldiers and their families who need a change \nin\n\n[[Page S11795]]\n\npolicy, need a change in direction, and need to be brought home?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 3 minutes to the cosponsor of the Feingold-Reid \namendment, the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the situation in \nIraq and the continuing efforts of this administration and my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to paint a rosy picture, when \nthe situation in Iraq suggests otherwise.\n  First, I thank Senator Carl Levin for the good work that he and the \ncommittee have done on drafting the Defense authorization bill. Next, I \nwould like to take a few minutes to discuss Senator Feingold's \namendment.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Feingold amendment because I believe it is \nimperative that we change the mission in Iraq to reflect the ugly \nreality on the ground.\n  We are worse off today in Iraq than we were 6 months ago. The \nposition of America, democracy and stability continue to erode. If \nthere was ever a need for a change of course in Iraq, it is now.\n  Despite the fact that 70 percent of Iraqis believe that the surge has \nworsened the overall security and political situation of their country, \nit remains terribly clear that President Bush and my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are equally determined to maintain our present, \nfailing course in Iraq.\n  Months ago, the violence in Iraq devolved into a civil war between \nthe Shiites and the Sunnis, and U.S. troops are still stuck in the \nmiddle. Our troops have no business policing a civil war.\n  And the fundamentals in Iraq stay the same: there is no central \ngovernment and the Shiites, the Sunnis and the Kurds dislike one \nanother far more than they like or want any central government. This \ndooms the administration's policy in Iraq to failure.\n\n  That is why I am here in support of the Feingold amendment. This \namendment will ensure that most our troops will be safely redeployed \nfrom Iraq by next summer, and those that remain will undertake a \nmission that reflects the reality in Iraq.\n  U.S. troops will conduct limited counterterrorism missions, and they \nwill train Iraqi security forces that support the U.S. mission. We will \nnot train Iraqis that have attacked U.S. troops.\n  This amendment will make sure that U.S. troops are no longer policing \na civil war between the Sunnis and the Shiites. It will let the Maliki \nGovernment know that U.S. troops will not, nor cannot, remain in Iraq \nindefinitely. Only that understanding will make the Maliki Government \nmove forward in the difficult process of political reconciliation that \nIraq needs.\n  The Democratic Congress will continue to fight this administration's \nfailing policy, and help chart a new way forward in Iraq. This \namendment is the first step in that direction, and I strongly urge all \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  I salute my colleague from Wisconsin for his undaunted leadership. He \nis way ahead of his time on this issue. I am a cosponsor of the \nFeingold amendment because I believe it is imperative we change the \nmission in Iraq to reflect the ugly reality on the ground. We are worse \noff today in Iraq than we were 6 months ago. Our troops are doing an \nexcellent job--make no mistake about it--but if the whole purpose was \nto strengthen the Government, by every standard the Government is \nweaker. Despite the fact that 70 percent of Iraqis believe the surge \nhas worsened the overall security and political situation of their \ncountry, it remains terribly clear that President Bush and my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are equally determined to \nmaintain our present failing course in Iraq. To change that course does \nnot require weak medicine. It requires strong medicine. That is what \nthe Feingold amendment is.\n  Months ago, the violence in Iraq devolved into a civil war between \nthe Shiites and Sunnis, and U.S. troops are stuck in the middle. Our \ntroops have no business policing a civil war, and we should not \ncontinue to do that with our troops, with our dollars, and with the \nheart and soul of this Nation. We must change course, and we must do \nwhat it takes to change course.\n  That is why I support the Feingold amendment. It will ensure that \nmost of our troops will be safely redeployed from Iraq by next summer, \nand those who remain will undertake a mission that reflects the reality \nin Iraq. This amendment will make sure U.S. troops are no longer \npolicing a civil war between Sunnis and Shiites. It will let the Maliki \nGovernment know U.S. troops will not remain in Iraq indefinitely. Only \nthat understanding will make the Iraqi Government move forward.\n  The Democratic Congress will continue to fight this administration's \nfailing policy until we change it. One of the best tools we have to do \nthat is the amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nhis support and his very strong, effective statement about how \nimportant it is that we move forward on this amendment.\n  I now yield to another of our excellent cosponsors and supporters \nthroughout this process, the Senator from New Jersey, 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin for his leadership on this issue. As someone who voted \nagainst this war from its outset, I rise in strong support of the \nFeingold-Reid amendment. The last time we gathered to vote on a change \nof course in Iraq was July 18, approximately 2 months ago. Since that \nday, the Iraqi Parliament, with its country in the grips of a civil \nwar, with much work to do to achieve political reconciliation, took a \nmonth-long vacation. Since that day, four bombs were set off in concert \nin northern Iraq, leaving more than 500 dead, the deadliest coordinated \nattack since the beginning of the war. Since that day, despite a much \nballyhooed cease-fire in Al Anbar, Shiek Abu Risha, our main ally in \nthe province, was murdered, a mere 10 days after he shook hands with \nPresident Bush. Since that day in July when we last had a chance to \nchange course, another 160 sons and daughters of America have lost \ntheir lives in Iraq. Another 160 flag-draped caskets flown to Dover, \nanother 160 renditions of ``Taps'' played at tear-soaked funerals, \nanother 160 American families who will have an empty seat at the table \ncome Thanksgiving.\n  So here we are again. The calendar changes but the challenges do not. \nYet again we meet on the Senate floor to consider another proposal to \nresponsibly and safely transition our mission in Iraq and bring our \ntroops home, out of another country's civil war. Yet again, as we have \nheard many times before through the course of this failed war policy, \nthe President and his loyalists in this Chamber are using that tired \nrefrain: The plan is working. It needs more time. We cannot leave.\n  Now, as then, these words ring hollow. The administration that \nbrought us the search for weapons of mass destruction, the \n``cakewalk,'' and ``last throes'' is now pitching ``a return on \nsuccess.'' But this President lost his credibility on Iraq about the \ntime he stood on an aircraft carrier underneath a banner reading \n``mission accomplished,'' almost 4\\1/2\\ long years ago. The \nadministration may be shopping a new catch phrase, but we are not \nbuying anything they are selling anymore. The President, armed with \nquestionable statistics, presented us an open-ended, no-exit plan for \nthe sons and daughters of America who continue to fight and die in \nIraq. As a matter of fact, he said it will be up to the next President, \nin 2009 and beyond.\n  The reality is that ``a return on success'' is ``staying the course'' \nby another name. We have tried this road. We have gone down it for 4\\1/\n2\\ years, with no turn of the wheel. Going down this road has diverted \nattention from Osama bin Laden, who is back in business and roaming \nfree in a safe zone along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. It has \nfomented terrorism, creating a training ground in Iraq and allowing al-\nQaida to regroup to its strongest level since September 11, according \nto intelligence estimates. It has stretched our military thin, wearing \ndown troops serving extended\n\n[[Page S11796]]\n\ntours, depleting our Reserves and National Guard, and compromising \nnational security with a diminished preparedness to tackle other \ninternational threats. It has cost us dearly in national treasure and, \nmost importantly, precious lives.\n  Going down this road has not brought stability to Iraq nor made us \nany safer at home. It is clear we are being driven down a dead-end \nstreet by an administration without a roadmap for a lasting peace. Now \nthey expect the American people to buy the no-exit occupation they are \nselling, the deployment of more than 130,000 American troops for as far \nin the future as the eye can see. No end in sight?\n\n  Today we are living with the consequences of the administration's \nfailed policy. Over 3,700 troops have been killed in Iraq since the \nbeginning of the war, including 97 servicemembers with ties to the \nState of New Jersey. We have now spent over $450 billion on the war in \nIraq, with a burn rate of $10 billion a month. Frankly, I never \nbelieved the administration's estimate that the so-called surge would \nonly cost $5.6 billion, and these new numbers only prove once again we \nhave been misled.\n  Despite the meager improvements in the Anbar Province cited in \nGeneral Petraeus's report last week, the situation in Iraq continues to \ngrow worse. Sectarian violence surrounding Baghdad has surged this past \nweek in connection with the holy month of Ramadan. At least 22 people \nhave been killed in a series of bombings and shootings in Diyala and \nKirkuk. Moreover, GEN William Caldwell has reported there is evidence \nSunni extremist groups in Iraq have been receiving funds from Iran. In \nterms of reconstruction, oil production in Iraq is still lower than it \nwas before the war 4\\1/2\\ years ago, and Baghdad is getting \napproximately 7 hours of electricity a day, significantly less than \nbefore the war.\n  How can we be expected to support a war plan about which every \nindependent report portrays a situation of chaos far away from \nstability or political reconciliation? In fact, according to the latest \nreport card on Iraqi progress, the President's war policy is still \nflunking. Even if the debatable metrics used to compile the report are \nsolid, half of the benchmarks have not even seen a minimal amount of \nprogress. Now that it is clear the benchmarks are perhaps impossible to \nachieve with our current strategy, we see a concerted effort to play \nthem down in terms of their importance.\n  In General Petraeus's testimony, it was evident. The original goals \nof the escalation, to give the Iraqi Government and political factions \nbreathing room to achieve reconciliation, have not been met. The \nbenchmarks are now an afterthought and success is being measured in \ndifferent and less stringent terms. It is a recurring pattern that no \nlonger fools anyone: Make a bold proclamation, fail to meet \nexpectations, fail to meet legally established benchmarks brought in by \nthe Iraqi Government as well as our own, passed in law by the Congress, \nsigned by the President, change the discussion. Moving the goalposts \nmay appease some in this Chamber, but it does not help us achieve a \nlasting peace that is ultimately more important.\n  When all else fails, the President and his supporters often respond \nto rightful criticism of their disastrous war plan with a question \nmeant to change the subject: What are your ideas? What they fail to \nrealize is a majority of Congress and an overwhelming majority of the \nAmerican public have long been unified behind a course of action that \nwe believe gives us the best chance for success and security, both in \nIraq and at home. That is the purpose of this amendment. A responsible \ntransition of our mission and withdrawal of our troops from Iraq on one \nhand gives a sense of urgency to the Iraqi Government and security \nforces that is currently absent. Until they actually believe we will \nnot be there forever, they will not take control of their own country. \nAt the same time, bringing our troops home allows our overburdened \nmilitary to regroup. It allows us to have the capability to respond to \nother threats in the world that might arise. It allows the \nreplenishment of our National Guard which is currently stretched so \nthin that response to disasters in the homeland has been affected. \nYesterday it was announced that half the Army National Guard in my \nState of New Jersey--that is 6,200 soldiers--will be deployed as soon \nas next year, almost 2 years before the deployment was originally \nscheduled. That will leave our National Guard at half strength in a \nState at serious risk for a terrorist attack. That is 6,200 soldiers \ntaken away from their loved ones to be tossed into another country's \ncivil war.\n  Most important about our plan and this amendment, it allows American \nfamilies who have been separated and stressed by an ill-conceived war \nto be made whole again. The alternative is an endless occupation in \nIraq with more American blood spilled and no light at the end of the \ntunnel.\n  Throughout this war many have drawn the obvious parallels between \nthis failed war policy and another quagmire 40 years ago. The \ncomparison in some respects is valid and important. It is said those \nwho do not learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat it. \nBecause I fear history is being repeated, I wish to draw upon the words \nof Robert Kennedy, who served in this Chamber and delivered this \nstatement about the Vietnam War in March of 1968:\n\n       We are entitled to ask--we are required to ask--how many \n     more men, how many more lives, how much more destruction will \n     be asked, to provide the military victory that is always just \n     around the corner, to pour into this bottomless pit of our \n     dreams?\n       But this question the Administration does not and cannot \n     answer, it has no answer. It has no answer--none but the \n     ever-expanding use of military force and the lives of our \n     brave soldiers in a conflict where military force has failed \n     to solve anything in the past.\n\n  Our past teaches us our current struggle and our current predicament \nare best solved by a new course. Future generations will judge this war \npolicy and the choice to continue it indefinitely harshly. They will \nstill be paying the price. We have another opportunity today to write \nan end to this sad chapter, to turn the page and recommit to \nstrengthening the military and targeting Osama bin Laden. We have the \nopportunity to change history for the better.\n  I urge my colleagues to begin that change today and vote for a new \ncourse in Iraq by supporting the Feingold amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for \nhis sponsorship of our amendment and for his powerful statement on its \nbehalf, recognizing the reality of what is happening in Iraq and our \nneed to change course.\n  How much time do we have remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 32 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 5 minutes to speak in opposition to the Feingold amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as to the author of the amendment, no one \nshould ever question his motivation, his patriotism. He has been a firm \nbeliever that we should be out of Iraq as soon as possible. Senator \nFeingold believes our continued presence in Iraq is creating more \nterrorism in terms of solving the problem; it is creating the problem \nin a larger sense. I personally disagree.\n  The reason al-Qaida went to Iraq is not because we were in Iraq. They \nwent to Iraq because of what the Iraqi people are trying to do. We are \nall over the world. They have not followed us to every country we have \nbeen in. They have decided to make Iraq a central battlefront in their \nwar against moderation because they fear a successful outcome among the \nIraqis. The biggest fear of an al-Qaida member is that a group of \nMuslims will get together and be tolerant of each others' differences \nwhen it comes to religion, and elevate\n\n[[Page S11797]]\n\nthe role of a woman so she can have a say about her children. That is \nwhy al-Qaida is in Iraq.\n  The military surge has produced results beyond my expectation. The \nold strategy clearly was going nowhere. After about my third visit to \nIraq, after the fall of Baghdad, I had lost faith in the old strategy \nand those who were proposing it was working. This new general has come \nup with a new idea. This is not more of the same with more people. You \nare getting out behind walls. You are getting out into the community. \nWe are living with the Iraqi Army and police force--very good gains in \nterms of operational capabilities of the Iraqi Army. We are going to \nhave to start all over with the police.\n  But the surge has allowed a real diminishment of the al-Qaida \nfootprint in Anbar Province. Anytime Sunni Arabs turn on al-Qaida \nanywhere in the world, that is good news. So the surge has provided us \na level of security not known before. It has been al-Qaida's worst \nnightmare. There is still a long way to go.\n  Senator Feingold's amendment would basically bring the surge to a \nhalt. It would withdraw troops at a very rapid pace. We would be out of \nIraq by June of next year. My big fear is, instead of reinforcing \nreconciliation, it would freeze every effort to reconcile and people \nwould start making political decisions based on what happens to their \ncountry when there is no security.\n  The American mistake of the ages was letting Iraq get out of control, \nnot having enough troops. We paid heavily for that mistake. Now we have \nit turned around. Militarily, politically they are not where they need \nto be in terms of the Iraqis. But the best way, I believe, to get \npolitical reconciliation to happen in Baghdad is to make sure those who \nare trying to reconcile their country--families--are not killed. So the \nbetter the security you can provide, the more likely the \nreconciliation.\n  One thing is for sure: more troops have helped embolden the Iraqi \npeople in terms of extremists. They are taking on extremists after the \nsurge better than they had ever done before the surge. I think this \nconfidence given to the Iraqi people by a surge of military support has \npaid dividends.\n  We need political, economic, and military support to continue, not \njust because of Iraq but because of our own national interest. If I \nthought it were only about who ran Iraq, I would be willing to leave. \nIt is not about who controls Iraq. It is about whether we can create a \nstable, functioning government in Iraq that would contain Iran and deny \nal-Qaida a safe haven. If it were only about sectarian differences and \na power struggle for Iraq, it would be a totally different dynamic.\n  To me, Iran is ready to fill a vacuum. If we have a failed state, \nthat is a military, political, and economic problem far worse than the \nones we are dealing with now. A failed state is a state that breaks \napart, people stop trying to work with each other, and regional players \ncome in and take sides.\n  A dysfunctional government is what we have in Iraq, probably what we \nhave here. A dysfunctional government has hope of getting better \nbecause people keep trying. So the way to have a government go from a \ndysfunctional status to a secure, stable status is to provide security. \nI want this dysfunctional government to act sooner rather than later, \njust as you do, I say to the Presiding Officer. The best way to make \nthat happen is to ensure that the politicians involved understand we \nhave a commitment to their cause that will embolden them.\n  The Feingold amendment, no matter how well intentioned, will \nreenergize an enemy on the mat and make it harder to reconcile Iraq. \nThat is why I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time in the quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan, Ms. Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I first thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Wisconsin for his foresight and his leadership on this very \ncritical issue, the most critical issue facing our country.\n  I rise today to support the Feingold amendment, as I have in the \npast. The American people want us to stop this direction we are going \nin and to, in fact, bring our military home so they can be effectively \nrefocused, to redeploy to address the real threats that are facing \nAmerica.\n  We all heard during the Armed Services hearing the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, ask what I think is the most \nimportant question to General Petraeus. After General Petraeus had laid \nout the strategy and what was happening on the surge, Senator Warner \nasked him: General, are we safer? Is America safer? He then first began \nto answer that question by talking about the fact that he was \nproceeding on the mission that had been given to him.\n  Then he was asked again, and I believe it was the third time he was \nasked by the Senator. He was asked: Is America safer? The general said: \nI don't know.\n  Three-quarters of a trillion dollars spent, lives lost--thousands of \nlives, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and innocent civilians--and the \nanswer is: I don't know. I think the American people do know.\n  I think the American people understand that when we are directing our \nforces--our brave men and women, the best trained, the most highly \nrecognized and effective troops in the world--when we are placing them \nin the middle of a civil war in Iraq, and then we turn on our \ntelevision sets and we see the man who has the organization that \nattacked us and killed over 3,000 Americans on American soil speaking \nto us through a video, commenting on American politics and what is \nhappening here in the Senate, they are appalled. People understand we \nshould be addressing ourselves to the people who attacked us and the \nreal threats we have. We know where they are, at least close to where \nthey are. We know the region, and we need to redeploy our troops to \naddress the threats that have, in fact, been serious for America--not \nthe middle of a civil war, but the people who attacked us, and those \nnow who have joined them in their cause.\n  My husband is a veteran of the Air Force and the Air National Guard; \n14 years. He reminds me all the time that our men and women in uniform \nare doing their duty to complete the mission that is laid out for them \nin a democratic society by their civilian leaders, by their President, \nby their Congress. They look to us, they are counting on us to make \nsure it is the right one, to give them what they need, but to also give \nthem a strategy that makes sense. They are counting on us to ask tough \nquestions, to probe. They are there putting their lives on the line \nevery single day. Their families are at home sacrificing every single \nday, and they are counting on us to get this right.\n\n  As one of the people who voted no on going into this war in Iraq, I \nnow join with colleagues in saying: Enough is enough. This has to \nchange. There are real threats. We need to refocus and redeploy in the \nname of safety for Americans. But we need to make sure we are ending \nthis civil war participation we have put our soldiers into. The \nFeingold amendment does this. It brings our troops home and refocuses \nthem, redeploys them, as we should, in a way that will truly focus on \nthe ways to keep us safe for the future, so that\n\n[[Page S11798]]\n\nwhen the next general is testifying before the Armed Services Committee \nand that general is asked: Is America safer, we can join together and \nsay yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very grateful to the Senator from \nMichigan for her support and for her statement as well.\n  At this point, I want to turn to the majority leader. I am delighted \nthat he has joined me on this amendment and has been such a strong \nleader over the many months since the election in trying to end this \nwar in Iraq. I thank him for his courage and his leadership, and I \nyield him 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, too, appreciate the work of the junior \nSenator from Michigan on this legislation. She is truly a great Senator \nand does so much to help her State and our great country.\n  I don't seek any attention. I get some on occasion, but I don't seek \nit. But, today, I want everyone to understand. On this amendment, I \nwant this amendment to be known as the Feingold-Reid amendment. I \nproudly add my name, as I have from the very beginning, to this \namendment. This is the future. We must proceed, and we will, at some \ntime with this legislation.\n  Yesterday, the Senate voted, once again, on legislation with real \nteeth that would protect our troops and prevent the President from \nirresponsibly overburdening these troops. It was a good amendment. It \nsimply said: If you are in country for 15 months in a war in Iraq or \nAfghanistan, then come home and spend at least 15 months. The old rule \nused to be you would be home twice that long, three times that long, \nbut now, no, we have our troops going back on fourth tours of duty \nwithin a couple of years. This has led to all kinds of problems in our \nStates.\n  Look at the people who have been killed and injured during their \nsecond tour of duty or their third tour of duty. I can't get out of my \nmind, and I never will, Anthony Schober from Las Vegas--no, he was from \nnorthern Nevada--I am sorry. He knew he wasn't going to come back from \nhis fourth tour of duty. He told everybody. He told his family. He \nsaid: I have been too lucky. I have had explosions next to me. I have \nsurvived them all. I have seen my buddies killed. I am not going to \ncome back. And he didn't. He was killed. That is what the Webb \namendment was all about.\n  The vote yesterday wasn't a vote of symbolism; it was a binding \nnational policy. Yet, again, the Republican minority filibustered the \nWebb amendment. The reason I say ``filibustered the Webb amendment'' is \nbecause a majority in the House and the Senate support a change in \ndirection of the war in Iraq. A majority in the House and a majority in \nthe Senate have voted time and time again to change direction, to bring \nour troops home.\n  The rules in the Senate are such as they are, and I live by them, and \nI love this institution. The fact is, the Republicans have stopped us \nfrom enacting policies supported by a majority in the Senate and in the \nHouse and, by far, the American people by filibustering the Webb \namendment, the amendment about which I just spoke.\n  We don't have to take my word for this. Headlines from newspapers \nfrom around the country--from the Wall Street Journal: ``Republicans \nBlock Troop Measure.'' From the Associated Press: ``GOP Opposes Bill \nRegulating Combat Tours.'' From Reuters: ``Senate Republicans Block \nIraq Bill.'' Headline after headline all across this country--``Senate \nRepublicans Block Iraq Bill.''\n  I understand the Senate is a deliberative body that was created to \nprevent haste and promote consensus. But what we are seeing here on \nthis issue, the issue of the war in Iraq, is a far cry from \ndeliberation. It is obstructionism, strictly outright obstructionism. \nThat is what we saw yesterday, and except for a courageous few, that is \nwhat we continue to see from the Republican Senate. They represent a \nsmall minority of the American people.\n  Countless Republicans have said the right thing. Countless Senators \nwho are Republicans say the right things when they go home. They say: \nWe must support our troops, we must protect our national security, and \nwe must change course in Iraq. But here, these same Republican \nSenators, when they come back to Washington, have consistently voted \nthe wrong way. They have voted to put their arms around the Bush war \nand to make it also their war. Back home, they assert their \nindependence, but in Washington, they walk in lockstep with the \nPresident and continue to support his failed war.\n  General Petraeus, whom we have talked about all morning, has said the \nwar cannot be won militarily. That is what he said. Can we work \ntogether? Of course we can. We have proven that. Not on this, not on \nthe Iraq war, but we have worked together this year on bipartisan \nissues. We have made progress. We hope to have next week the SCHIP \nhealth care for children. We have done stem cell research on a \nbipartisan basis. We passed an energy bill with 62 votes; student \nfinancial aid--the largest probably since the GI bill of rights; \nminimum wage; mental health parity. We have done a lot of good things \nworking together. The issue dealing with Iraq has been one side against \nthe other.\n  I very much appreciate the Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer \nhas worked his heart out trying to come up with something that would \nchange the course of the war in Iraq, and I admire and appreciate his \nhaving done this. He is continuing to do it. As we speak, he has people \nworking to try to come up with something, a bipartisan consensus that \nwould change the course of the war in Iraq.\n  I have reached out to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ntime and time again. With the exception of about five or six courageous \nSenate Republicans, these efforts have been rebuffed. That is their \nright. I understand that. There is nothing the Democratic majority can \ndo to force the Republican colleagues to vote the responsible way. When \nI talk about the Democratic majority, remember, it is a slim majority--\n51 to 49. With Senator Johnson ill until a week or so ago, it was 50 to \n49. But so long as young Americans continue to fight and die and be \nwounded in another nation's civil war with no end in sight, we are \ngoing to keep fighting to responsibly bring them home, rebuild our \nmilitary, and return our focus to fighting the real war on terror \nagainst Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida network.\n\n  By the way, we hear today he has another video coming. I don't know \nif he will be gray-bearded this time or black-bearded, but he has \nanother video coming, and it is on its way within a matter of a few \ndays.\n  The President and his Republican supporters here in the Senate say we \nshould just continue the current policy; things are going OK, so \ncouldn't we just let things keep going on as they are, and hopefully--I \nguess they think things will turn out OK. But tell that to the 20,000 \nIraqis who flee their country every month, left homeless and hopeless. \nTell that to the families of innocent civilians, 1.2 million of them \nwho have been killed in this war. Tell that to the 2 million Iraqi \nrefugees who are in Jordan and Syria and anyplace they can find. Tell \nthat to the families of 3,800 dead American troops, that things are \ngoing OK. Tell the families of the countless thousands who have been \ngrievously wounded in this war that it is OK, we just need a little \nmore patience and a little more time. Tell our troops who have served \nus so bravely, so bravely without proper equipment on occasion or rest, \nthat now is not the time to change course of the war.\n  Today, we have another chance to forge a responsible and binding path \nout of Iraq. The amendment before us is the best path for the United \nStates and for the people of Iraq. Should we care about the people of \nIraq? Of course we should. The worst foreign policy blunder in the \nhistory of this country was the invasion of Iraq. Am I glad we are rid \nof Saddam Hussein? Of course I am. What we have done to that country I \nhave outlined in some detail here this afternoon. This amendment \nchanges our fundamental mission away from policing the civil war, \nreduces our large combat footprint, and focuses on those missions which \nare in the national security interests of our country. It uses \nCongress's powers, its constitutional powers to limit funding after \nJune 1 of next year--that is well into the sixth year of the war--to \ncounterterrorism, force protection, and targeted training of Iraqi \nforces.\n\n[[Page S11799]]\n\n  This amendment recognizes we have interests in Iraq, but it does not \nfacilitate the open-ended role of U.S. forces in a civil war. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this responsible legislation. It is one more \nchance for the Senate to chart a new way forward in Iraq.\n  President John Kennedy:\n\n       A man does what he must--in spite of personal consequences, \n     in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures--and that is \n     the basis of all morality.\n\n  If we send this amendment to the President, those who voted for it \ncan return home, look their constituents in the eyes, and tell them \nthey had the courage to finally do what is right for our troops and for \nour country.\n  Let me close by saying this: As my good friend knows, the comanager \nof this bill, we came to the Congress on the same day of the same year \n25 years ago. I respect the senior Senator from Arizona because he \ndoesn't hide what he stands for. I admire him. He stands for what he \nthinks is the right thing to do. I disagree with him, but what I am \ncriticizing is not my friend from Arizona. I am reaching out to my \nfriends across the aisle who say one thing at home, issue press \nreleases one way, and then come here and vote another way.\n  So it is time we do the right thing. I believe it is the right thing. \nLook what has happened to our country since this invasion took place. \nWe are mired in civil war in Israel with Palestinians fighting each \nother, we have a near civil war in Lebanon, and we have this terrible \nsituation in Iraq. We have Iran thumbing their nose at us, and our \nstanding in the world community has gone down, down, down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feingold and echo the words \nof the Democratic leader, the majority leader, Harry Reid, and his \ncomments about this war and about the future of our country and what we \nneed to do. I rise in support of the Feingold amendment.\n  General Petraeus confirmed that our troops, operating under horrific \nconditions, are displaying the courage and the skill that define this \nwhole engagement. Our troops have been courageous. Our troops have been \nskillful. Our troops have been effective. Our troops have been \nselfless. Our troops have done everything we have asked them to.\n  But the civilians at the Pentagon and the politicians at the White \nHouse have bungled this war. The administration is selling one war and \nfighting another. They are selling a war where they are saying with a \nlittle more patience, we can truly say ``mission accomplished,'' as if \nwe didn't hear that last year and the year before and the year before \nthat. The President's fighting of the war is one step forward, two \nsteps back, and one that will require perhaps a decade-long engagement.\n  More than anything, Americans deserve the truth. We are losing men \nand women, without a clear idea of whether or when we can bring our \ntroops home. We are refraining from redeploying troops based on \npossibilities--possibilities that are no worse than the realities we \nare facing now.\n  Especially and mostly, we have lost our focus. We have lost our focus \non Afghanistan, on rooting out al-Qaida, finding Osama bin Laden, and \nprotecting our borders. Instead, we spend $2.5 billion a week on a \nwar--$2.5 billion a week on a war that even General Petraeus, by not \nanswering Senator Warner's question, acknowledges this war is making us \nno safer. So we spend $2.5 billion a week and the war is not making us \nsafer and we are not doing what we should be in Afghanistan, what we \nshould be doing in rooting out al-Qaida, what we should be doing in \nfinding Osama bin Laden, and what we should be doing in protecting our \nborders.\n  Instead, we are mired in a civil war, with no end in sight. As long \nas the Iraqis, as Senator Feingold said, and so many of us who have \nwanted to have a plan to redeploy our troops out of Iraq for 2 or 3 \nyears now--as long as our commitment looks open-ended, as long as there \nis no end in sight to this civil war, there is no incentive for the \nIraqis to do what they need to do; there is no incentive for a \npolitical settlement, where Sunnis and Shia and Kurds work together on \na political settlement with a political compromise, and there is no \nincentive for the Iraqis because they think we are always going to be \nthere in this open-ended commitment to the civil war. There is no \nincentive for them to do what they need to do to build a military \nsecurity and police security force until the Iraqis know that, yes, \nthere is an end date. We need to pass the Feingold amendment and the \nmessage will be that U.S. troops are going to redeploy out of Iraq, so \nit is now incumbent upon the Iraqis to do what they need to do through \npolitical compromise and through building their military and police \nsecurity forces, and then Iraq can move forward. As long as we stay \nmired in a civil war and they think it is an open-ended commitment, we \nwill continue to see this lack of progress.\n  Military victories we can win, and have, and our soldiers and marines \nhave waged and won those battles. But until we have a political \nvictory, a compromise, a settlement, and the Iraqis build up their own \nsecurity forces, the war goes on and on. It is time to bring our troops \nhome in the safest and most orderly way we can, as Iraq accomplishes \nother urgent goals, such as border security, and we address the issues \nin Afghanistan and with al-Qaida.\n  I support the Feingold amendment. It makes sense that we finally \nchange course in Iraq and do the right thing for the Iraqi people and \nfor our country.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Feingold amendment, \nof which I am a cosponsor. This is the strongest amendment for changing \ncourse in Iraq among the proposals that we will consider this week. It \nis the only proposal that addresses the President's failed Iraq policy \nhead on, and that would begin the much needed redeployment of our \nforces within 90 days.\n  The invasion of Iraq, and the catastrophe it has caused for the Iraqi \npeople, for Iraq's neighbors, and for the United States, must end. It \nhas been a failure--a failure in terms of our strategic interests, a \nfailure in making us safer, a failure in terms of the President's naive \ngoal of imposing a new Iraqi Government by force.\n  Our troops have stepped up time and time again, many of them \nsacrificing their lives, and many more suffering severe injuries. Their \nperformance has been superb. Despite what the President and some who \ndefend his policies say, our troops are not the issue. The issues are \nthe glaring shortfalls, and the appalling incompetence, of the \nPresident's strategy.\n  The ``surge'' has not brought the Iraqi factions any closer to \npolitical reconciliation, which after all is the ultimate goal of the \nsurge strategy. In fact, the divisions among the Iraqi people--already \ndeep because of the brutal manipulations of the Saddam Hussein regime--\nseem to be worsening. The White House seems to have no idea how to call \nthings off and get our troops out from the middle of Iraq's civil war.\n  The cold hard truth is that the President has presented the American \npeople with no real option, just more of the same. If the President is \ngoing to ignore our true national interests by prolonging this \nconflict, if the Commander-in-Chief of our Armed Forces is not going to \ntake responsibility, then Congress, as representatives of the people, \nmust be the catalyst to chart a new course.\n  The Iraqi Government is only getting more dependent on a continued \nAmerican presence. It is the consensus view of our intelligence \ncommunity, as reflected in the latest National Intelligence Assessment, \nthat there is no prospect that in the next year the Iraqis will come \ntogether and reach a political settlement.\n  Even the new White House report, buttressed in part by the \nnonpartisan and professional General Accountability Office, shows that \nIraq is getting a failing grade in its ability to meet key military and \npolitical metrics on its path toward reconciliation and stability.\n  The administration cites the positive developments in Anbar Province \nas justification for continuing this perpetual deployment of American \nforces. There has been progress there, much of it pre-dating the so-\ncalled ``surge.'' Hundreds of members of the Vermont National Guard \nknow how bad the situation was in Anbar less than a year and a half\n\n[[Page S11800]]\n\nago, when these soldiers helped make up Task Force Saber in Ramadi. \nThey were in the worst place in Iraq at the worst time. Since then the \nsituation has clearly improved, and our troops and their commanders \ndeserve credit and our thanks for that tough and dangerous work.\n  But the new-found calm is based on a set of agreements between Sunni \ntribes and American forces, not with the Iraqi Government. The Iraqi \nGovernment sees newly organized and perhaps newly armed groups of \nSunnis as a threat to its power, and it is doubtful that will change \nany time soon.\n  In the meantime, the situation elsewhere continues to implode.\n  Passage of the Feingold amendment would force the Iraqis--and \nneighboring nations with a stake in Iraq's future--to recognize that \nthe open-ended deployment of U.S. forces is ending. The drawdown of our \nforces, coupled with a strong U.S.-led diplomatic initiative, might \nbring about the political reconciliation that no amount of additional \nmilitary force can bring about.\n  It might also cause Iraq's warring ethnic factions to go their own \nway, splitting the country into separate states. But that is where they \nare currently headed anyway. The administration's policies and \nincompetence have brought us to the point where there are no good \noptions. But either of these scenarios is better than the future \noffered by the President. His war is costing us horrific casualties and \nenormous sums that could be better spent repairing our frayed \ninternational reputation and strengthening our security at home.\n  I urge my colleagues to take the only responsible step and pass this \namendment that will finally bring our troops home.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Feingold-Reid \namendment.\n  This amendment would remove our troops from the middle of a civil war \nand give them three achievable missions. First, to conduct targeted \noperations against al-Qaida and affiliated terrorist organizations; \nsecond, to train and equip Iraqi security forces that have not been \ninvolved in sectarian fighting or attacks against our forces; and \nthird, to provide security for U.S. personnel and infrastructure. For \nall other U.S. forces not essential to these three missions, the \namendment calls for their safe redeployment beginning in 3 months and \nto be completed by June 30, 2008.\n  On May 16, the Senate failed to end a filibuster on the Feingold \namendment by a vote of 29-67. Since that time, 389 Americans have been \nkilled in Iraq. In fact this has been the deadliest summer for U.S. \nforces since the war began.\n  Our troops have done everything asked of them. They achieved every \nmission they have been given. When they were given a clear task, it was \naccomplished. Our military forces defeated the Iraqi army, hunted for \nnonexistent stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, captured Saddam \nHussein and his sons, provided security for three elections, and \ntrained 350,000 Iraq police and army.\n  But there are some missions that are beyond the capacity of our \nmilitary. Our military cannot give the Iraqi people the political will \nto achieve a national reconciliation among Sunni, Shia and Kurds. And, \nour military cannot convince Iraq's neighbors to play a positive role \nin ending the violence in Iraq.\n  The Iraqi people do not want us in Iraq and 70 percent of them \nbelieve that the surge has made the security situation worse.\n  Passage of the Feingold-Reid amendment will allow us to renew our \nfocus on al-Qaida.\n  I voted to go to war against al-Qaida. I strongly supported the \ndecision to use military force in Afghanistan to oust the Taliban \ngovernment. But then this administration made one of the biggest \nstrategic blunders in the history of this nation. It took its eye off \nof al-Qaida and became obsessed with Iraq, a country that had no links \nto al-Qaida.\n  The cochairs of the 9/11 Commission, Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton, \nrecently wrote, ``no conflict drains more time, attention, blood, \ntreasure and support from our worldwide counterterrorism efforts than \nthe war in Iraq. It has become a powerful recruiting and training tool \nfor al-Qaida.''\n  It is finally time to change the mission in Iraq and redeploy our \ntroops out of the middle of this civil war.\n  And so, Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the Feingold-Reid \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I agree with much of the Feingold \namendment, particularly as it relates to the desire to transition the \nmission of U.S. forces in Iraq and to commence the reduction of U.S. \nforces from Iraq. Indeed, I have long sought those actions in an \nattempt to put the Iraqi security forces in the lead and to bring \npressure on the Iraqi Government to make the political compromises \nnecessary for reconciliation among the three main Iraqi groups.\n  My concerns with the Feingold amendment are principally two. First of \nall, the mission to which U.S. forces would be limited after June 30, \n2008, are too narrowly drawn and would not, in my view, allow our \nforces to carry out the missions that would be required. For example, I \ndon't believe we should limit the duration and scope of targeted \noperations against al-Qaida as the amendment provides. I also don't \nbelieve we should preclude our forces from being embedded with Iraqi \nforces. I also believe the continuing mission of U.S. forces should \ninclude providing logistic support to the Iraqi security forces, which \nis prohibited by the Feingold amendment. In that regard, I would note \nthat the Independent Commission on the Security Forces of Iraq that was \nled by retired Marine general Jim Jones specifically pointed out the \nlogistic shortfalls of the Iraqi security forces and that they would \nneed to rely on Coalition support for this function.\n  My second chief concern is that restricting appropriations for our \nmilitary sends the wrong message to our troops who are performing so \nheroically on the battlefield in Iraq. It would also pose \nextraordinarily difficult decisions for our field commanders. They \ncould be faced, for instance, with determining whether a member of the \nIraqi security forces has ever been involved in sectarian violence or \nin attacks against U.S. forces, because if they were they could not be \ntrained by our forces under the terms of the amendment. Indeed, an \nincorrect determination could subject the commander to violations of \nour antideficiency laws which prohibit the expenditures of appropriated \nfunds except to specified purposes.\n  It is concerns such as these which lead me to vote ``no'' on the \nFeingold amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Ohio for his important \nstatement. I am grateful to him. I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided between the two \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are about to have a vote. I again thank \nmy friend from Wisconsin for the level of this debate. My only comment \nand conclusion is that I urge my colleagues to reject an amendment that \nbasically returns the failed strategy we had for nearly 4 years. I keep \nhearing, as I did from the majority leader, it is time to change \ncourse, time to change course. Well, we did change course, thank God; \nthat new course has been succeeding. Do we have a long, hard struggle \nahead? Of course we do. After a few months of the new strategy--and I \nrecognize the other challenges, such as the political one and the \nMaliki Government and the police. But I am convinced the new strategy \ncan succeed and the consequences of failure, as outlined by people who \nwere opponents for the war in Iraq initially--this course of action, \ngoing back to the old failed strategy would lead to chaos, destruction, \ndeterioration, and an eventual return on the part of American military \npeople with further service and sacrifice.\n  I again thank my friend from Wisconsin for his level of debate. I \nrespect\n\n[[Page S11801]]\n\nvery much his commitment to the security of this Nation.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I, too, thank the Senator from Arizona \nfor the quality of the debate and, in particular, on such a difficult \nand emotional issue. I thank all the leadership on our side for \nspeaking on behalf of our amendment.\n  I appreciate, in particular, the Senator's last comment. He and I \nshare one top priority, and that is the national security of the United \nStates of America. We disagree on what role this Iraq situation plays. \nI think it weakens our country; he happens to think it will strengthen \nour country. But our goals are the same.\n  This amendment is a reflection of my belief and the majority leader's \nbelief that the only way to truly respond to those who attacked us on \n9/11 and stop them from continuing activities is to stop the \nhemorrhaging of our country regarding the Iraq intervention.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) and \nthe Senator from Washington (Ms. Cantwell) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nWashington (Ms. Cantwell) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar).

Under the previous order, requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for the information of all Members, the \ntwo managers are trying to work out a consent agreement that we would \nmove next to the Levin-Reed amendment, and we would debate that this \nafternoon and vote on that in the morning. We are having a difficult \ntime trying to figure out what time to do it in the morning. Some want \nearly, some want late, but it won't be earlier than 10:30. We will work \nthat out in just a bit, as soon as the two managers have this under \ncontrol.\n  After that, with the permission of the minority, after we finish the \nLevin-Reed amendment, we will move to the Biden amendment. The managers \nof the bill know what that amendment is about, and we will have further \ninformation later, but that at least outlines today and tomorrow.\n  The Republican leader and I are talking about how to work through \nMonday. There are different scenarios we are working on. One thing is \nfor sure, we are going to do WRDA. We are going to move to that \ntomorrow, and we will complete that sometime Monday or Tuesday.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there will be no more votes today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes consideration of H.R. 1585 tomorrow, Friday, September \n21, that the time until 9:50 a.m. be equally divided and controlled \nbetween myself and Senator McCain or our designees; that the time from \n9:50 to 10 a.m. be under the control of the two leaders or their \ndesignees, with the majority leader or his designee controlling the \nfinal 5 minutes; that at 10 a.m., without further intervening action or \ndebate, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Levin amendment, \nwith no amendment in order to the amendment prior to the vote; that the \namendment be subject to a 60-vote threshold, and if it does not achieve \nthat threshold, the amendment be withdrawn; that upon disposition of \nthe Levin-Reed amendment, Senator Biden be recognized to offer his \namendment; that whenever the Senate resumes consideration of the Biden \namendment, there be 30 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to \nthe amendment, with the time equally divided and controlled between \nSenators Biden and McCain, or their designees, with no amendment in \norder to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I will not object. I wish \nto make it clear, according to the discussions the chairman and I had, \nthe next amendment that would be offered would be the Lieberman-Kyl \namendment, and this--we are not exactly sure when that happens, because \nwe are not sure at what point we return to the Biden amendment. It \ncould be possible, if we are not prepared to resume debate on the Biden \namendment, we could begin debate on the Kyl-Lieberman amendment. But, \nin any case, the Kyl-Lieberman amendment would be scheduled for \nconsideration depending on how it fits in with the Biden amendment.\n  I hope I was not confusing in that comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask the Senator to yield.\n  It is my understanding we are attempting to go back and forth when \nthere are amendments on both sides, and that the floor manager, Senator \nMcCain, would have the opportunity in any event to designate Senator \nKyl to offer an amendment.\n  I would agree that that then be the next amendment, if that is his \nintent, after the Biden amendment is either disposed of or is pending, \nand for reasons that are obvious needs to be set aside, because it is \nnot ready for resolution, then we would go to the Kyl-Lieberman \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we were of the understanding that we had \nworked something out on WRDA, and hopefully that is the case, that we \nwould not have to do the cloture vote\n\n[[Page S11802]]\n\nat noon on Monday, that we would have a vote on final passage of the \nbill at 5:30. But everyone should be aware that it appears someone on \nthe minority side has objected to that. If that is the case, we are \ngoing to go ahead and have our noon vote. I thought we had worked that \nout and I hope we can. But in fairness, whoever is holding this up, let \nus know one way or the other, because Members need to know about what \ntheir schedule is going to be on Monday. We have people coming in from \nall over the country. Some people have to take all-night flights to get \nback for that 12 o'clock vote. Whoever is trying to make a decision on \nthis, I wish they would do it as quickly as possible--today is \nThursday--in fairness, so people can make their weekend plans. We \nshould know if, in fact, we are going to have a vote at noon on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: Under the \nunanimous consent that is now in operation, it is my understanding the \nLevin-Reed amendment would be called up. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2898 to Amendment No. 2011\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I call up the Levin-Reed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself and Mr. \n     Reed, proposes an amendment numbered 2898 to amendment No. \n     2011.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a reduction and transition of United States \n                            forces in Iraq)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title XV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1535. REDUCTION AND TRANSITION OF UNITED STATES FORCES \n                   IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Deadline for Commencement of Reduction.--The Secretary \n     of Defense shall commence the reduction of the number of \n     United States forces in Iraq not later than 90 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Implementation of Reduction Along With a Comprehensive \n     Strategy.--The reduction of forces required by this section \n     shall be implemented along with a comprehensive diplomatic, \n     political, and economic strategy that includes sustained \n     engagement with Iraq's neighbors and the international \n     community for the purpose of working collectively to bring \n     stability to Iraq. As part of this effort, the President \n     shall direct the United States Special Representative to the \n     United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the \n     United States to seek the appointment of an international \n     mediator in Iraq, under the auspices of the United Nations \n     Security Council, who has the authority of the international \n     community to engage political, religious, ethnic and tribal \n     leaders in Iraq in an inclusive political process.\n       (c) Limited Presence After Reduction and Transition.--After \n     the conclusion of the reduction and transition of United \n     States forces to a limited presence as required by this \n     section, the Secretary of Defense may deploy or maintain \n     members of the Armed Forces in Iraq only for the following \n     missions:\n       (1) Protecting United States and Coalition personnel and \n     infrastructure.\n       (2) Training, equipping, and providing logistic support to \n     the Iraqi Security Forces.\n       (3) Engaging in targeted counterterrorism operations \n     against al Qaeda, al Qaeda affiliated groups, and other \n     international terrorist organizations.\n       (d) Completion of Transition.--The Secretary of Defense \n     shall complete the transition of United States forces to a \n     limited presence and missions as described in subsection (c) \n     by not later than nine months after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, as I understand it, there is no time \nagreement on this, other than that we complete debate today on the \nLevin-Reed amendment, except for the time allocated tomorrow morning?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise in support of the proposal my \ncolleague Senator Levin has offered. I participated in this with him. \nThis is a legislative proposal we have advanced in various forms for \nover a year. It seeks, quite simply, to initiate a withdrawal of our \nforces from Iraq. I think it is interesting to note that General \nPetraeus announced he too is recommending a withdrawal of forces, about \n5,700 troops, before the end of this year, which essentially complies \nwith at least a portion of our proposal dating back over a year.\n  But it goes further than that. It would require a transition to three \ndiscrete missions from the open-ended war-based mission that today our \nforces are pursuing.\n  The first mission would be counterterrorism, which is essential not \nonly in Iraq but across the globe. That requires attention, energy, and \npersistence, and we would urge and support such a mission in Iraq; not \njust in Iraq, but, frankly, worldwide.\n  The second mission would be to continue to train Iraqi security \nforces and provide robust training, support for those forces, because \nwe need to provide the Iraqis the ability to defend themselves and \npursue opponents of the legitimate Government of Iraq. Third, and \nsomething that is essential every time we deploy our forces, is to \nprotect our forces, to give commanders in Iraq the ability and the \nforces needed to ensure that American forces will be protected. Those \nthree missions represent not only what is in the long-term interest of \nthe United States but also within the capacity of the United States to \neffectively carry out not just in the next several weeks or months but \nfor a period of time.\n  My perspective has always been that the President is much more \ncomfortable with slogans than strategies. We have a new one now, \n``return on success.'' It follows a long line of slogans, ranging from \n``when they stand up, we will stand down,'' ``mission accomplished,'' \nand many others. But what we need now at the national level, not at the \ncircumscribed level of just Iraq, is a national strategy that in the \nlong run will deal with the significant threats that face this country.\n  In the interim of our involvement with Iraq, starting several years \nago, we have seen some remarkable developments which suggest very \nstrongly that the strategy the President pursued is deeply flawed. We \nhave seen the resurgence of al-Qaida. That is not the opinion of myself \nalone. It is the conclusion of the National Intelligence Estimate most \nrecently released to the public. We are seeing a virtual--in fact, a \nreal safe haven in Pakistan for bin Laden, Zawahiri, and others. And \nfrom that relative area of safety for them, unfortunately, they are \nable both to direct in a limited way actions across the globe and also \nto inspire other unrelated cells who are conducting these operations.\n  We just witnessed recently in Germany where, through good police and \nintelligence work, the capture of a cell comprising ethnic Germans who \nconverted to Islam and Turks, who were contemplating a major terrorist \nattack against American facilities, not perhaps directly related to al-\nQaida but certainly inspired. And there is evidence that suggests \nperhaps there was even some remote link. But they are there in Pakistan \nin a safe haven. It seems to me ironic that the President would talk \nabout creating a safe haven in Iraq when, for all intents and purposes, \nwe are at least acknowledging, recognizing, perhaps even not \neffectively acting against the safe haven in Pakistan.\n  Also, when it comes to the discussion of a safe haven for Sunni \njihadists in Iraq, we have to recognize, too, that one of the benefits \nof the last several weeks in Iraq has been what is required and called \nthe Sunni awakening. That has been an incidental result of our \nincreased troop presence. It was not the purpose, but certainly it is a \nfavorable development. That is simply the result of Sunni sheiks \nrealizing that Sunni jihadists of al-Qaida are more a threat to them, \nto their families, and to their way of life than the new government in \nBaghdad or the presence of American forces. Through the able and \neffective and courageous work of American soldiers and marines, these \nsheiks have been enlisted to attack and are attacking al-Qaida \nelements. That is a positive sign and tends, in my view, to mitigate \nagainst those dire warnings that there will be an automatic and \npredictable reflexive creation of a safe haven for al-Qaida in Iraq.\n  In addition, there is a Shia government there that is committed to \ncertainly disrupting and eliminating Sunni insurgents, particularly al-\nQaida\n\n[[Page S11803]]\n\ninsurgents. So we see, in terms of the strategic picture, a virtual or \na real safe haven in Pakistan, arguably problems in Iraq, but certainly \nI think showing how our preoccupation in Iraq is taking our eye off a \nmuch more serious and potential threat.\n  The other very serious threat that faces us in the region and \nworldwide is the growth of Iran. That growth has been fueled by oil \nprices at $80 a barrel. That makes their bottom line look a lot better \nand gives them a greater sense of confidence as they look out and \npursue their plans.\n  Second, frankly, is our vulnerabilities in Iraq, the fact that the \nIranians have strong influence in that country, the fact that the \ngovernment in Baghdad, the Maliki government, has not just associations \nbut long-time associations with Iranians. They are coreligionists. I am \nnot trying to suggest that they are agents or clones, but there \ncertainly is a rapport and understanding and an appreciation of the \nproximity of the Iranians and their potential impact in Iraq. That \nsituation has given rise to a resurgence and a strategically more \nempowered Iran. So you have a strategy that the President has pursued \nthat has not mitigated these major threats against the United States \nbut actually has enhanced them. That might be the definition of a bad \nstrategy.\n  So our involvement in Iraq has taken us away from critical threats. \nIn that term alone, we have to begin to think seriously about our \napproach forward. The status quo has not worked. There is scant \nevidence it will in the next several months.\n  There is another issue we have to look at. That is not only in terms \nof the strategic threats, but it is our capacity. The real driving \nfactor in the proposal that General Petraeus made is not what is \nhappening on the ground in Iraq, it is the force structure. It is the \nnumber of Army and marines that we have to commit. If you talked to \nanyone months ago, they could have told you essentially what General \nPetraeus was going to say, which is by next spring, beginning in April \nand going through July, we would have to reduce by 30,000 our forces in \nIraq; that the surge had an end point unrelated to what was happening \non the ground, to the success or lack of success. Simply we could not \nsustain that large a combat force on the ground. That is essentially \nwhat General Petraeus confirmed in his testimony to the Congress when \nhe returned from his mission in Baghdad.\n\n  So we are limited in what we can do. That is not a function of \nsuccess, return on success, or anything else. In fact, I was always \nunder the impression that in a military context, when you have success, \nyou reinforce it. You don't talk about a return on success, you \nreinforce it. But, quite frankly, we do not have the resources \navailable to reinforce. So we are being driven by the constraints of \nour military forces more than what is happening on the ground. We have \nto respond to that.\n  It also drives the real question: In the next several months, after \nthe surge is over and it has been announced it is over, what missions \ncan we responsibly take on, what missions will support our national \nsecurity, and what missions will be within the grasp of our manpower \nand personnel resources? Again, that underscores the need for change \nand underscores the need for adoption of limited missions as we propose \nin the Reed-Levin amendment.\n  When General Petraeus came before the committee, he made several \npoints. First, he would recommend a redeployment of forces this year. \nThat is something we have been arguing for and urging for over a year, \nmany of us. Many accusations have been hurled at us that we were \nirresponsible and reckless. They are not being hurled at General \nPetraeus. But the reality is, he, too, recognizes that we have to begin \nto redeploy our forces. Second, he is talking about reducing the forces \nby 30,000. If you recall, the military premise of the surge was, if you \ninserted 30,000 additional troops focused on Baghdad, you would have \nnow sufficient forces to conduct a different type of mission, \npopulation protection. You could disperse them in the localities. You \ncould conduct more aggressive patrolling.\n  I think the announcement by General Petraeus that those troops are \ncoming out begs the obvious question: How do you maintain that \npopulation protection mission without those 30,000 troops, and \nparticularly without, as most people recognize, the ability of the \nGovernment of Iraq to replace our forces with reliable Iraqi security \nforces? In a sense, the progress we have seen--and there is progress on \nthe ground; there is tactical momentum. No one should be surprised when \nwe commit American forces to a mission that they obtain dramatic and \nimmediate results. But the real question is, are those successes \npermanent or transitory? Are they reversible or irreversible?\n  My sense is that they are highly reversible, that as we depart, \ninsurgents, opponents of the Government in Iraq, will move back in and \ntry to exploit the absence. Without a sufficient and reliable Iraqi \nsecurity force, that probably could be accomplished. So I think that \njust the numbers drive us to start thinking about missions that we can \nperform.\n  The other factor of General Petraeus's testimony is that he very \nclearly begged off from any suggestion of what do we do after next June \nor July. Frankly, we have to have a strategy, a plan that goes beyond \nthe next 6 months. It is unsatisfactory that both, it seems, the \nPresident and, indeed, the commander on the ground will say simply they \ndon't know. No one knows perfectly, but we have to have at least their \nsense of what their best guidance is beyond that in terms of troop \nlevels, in terms of some of the questions I have raised.\n  Going back, again, to this notion of troop levels, if you recall, the \nfocal point of the surge was stabilizing Baghdad, a large city, stable \npopulation. But the operations since then necessarily have taken our \nforces well beyond Baghdad, and the areas in dispute in Iraq are well \nbeyond Baghdad. So the simple calculation of military forces versus \npopulation has been thrown out the window in the sense of the \nappropriate level of forces versus the real population and the real \narea that we are trying to stabilize.\n  In this regard, we have to recognize what is happening in the south; \nthat is, the British forces are, for all intents and purposes, \nwithdrawing into base camps. Their presence has shrunk dramatically, \nroughly 5,000 troops. That area now is becoming an area that is \nextremely hospitable to Shia militia, to Iranian influences, and has a \nlong-term potential to provide further instability in the country. Yet \nwe don't have the forces to go down there. We are not attempting to go \ndown there, and yet that poses a real challenge to the long-run \nsecurity and safety and stability of the country.\n  I sense, for all these different reasons, that we do have to change \nour course. That is at the heart of the Levin-Reed amendment, to \nidentify, first, clearly the direction of our forces, which is to begin \na phased redeployment; second, to focus on missions that are within our \ncapacity and will, to the best of our capacity, advance our interests \nin the region, not just in Iraq but in the whole region.\n  We all were waiting for the report of General Petraeus and Ambassador \nCrocker. There were other reports. General Jones and the General \nAccounting Office came forth almost simultaneously. We hoped these \nreports would provide both the President and the Congress with the \ninformation they needed to begin to change our direction in Iraq.\n  Unfortunately, it appears at this juncture, unless we are successful \nwith this amendment, that change is not going to take place.\n  The GAO was the first to release their report, and it was sobering by \nanyone's standards. Of the 18 economic, security, and legislative \nbenchmarks set by the Iraqis themselves last January, GAO found that 3 \nhad been met, 4 had been partially met, and 11 had not been met.\n  I think it is important to emphasize--because now the benchmarks were \nbeing seen as, oh, just some interesting construct of the Congress \nunrelated to what was happening in Iraq, et cetera--but these were the \npoints the Iraqis stressed as critical to their progress. They were the \npoints that were deliberately embraced by the President of the United \nStates.\n  In January, when he talked about the surge, part of that--a large \npart of it--\n\n[[Page S11804]]\n\nwas to allow the Iraqis the political space, the time to achieve these \nbenchmarks. What appears to have happened, having failed the test, the \nPresident decided the test was not worth giving, and he ignores the \nresults. But those results, I think, speak volumes.\n  For example, the Iraqi Government still has not completed revisions \nto the constitution, or enacted legislation on de-baathification, oil \nrevenue-sharing, provincial elections, amnesty, or military \ndisarmament.\n  When Ambassador Crocker was here, he said: Well, we have not done it \nformally out there, but they informally are distributing the oil \nrevenues. That goes, I think, to the point I have tried to suggest in \nother contexts. If it is informal, then it is highly reversible. If it \nis informal, it is transitory. Legislation is not as reversible and \ntransitory. We do a lot of that around here, but at least you have to \ngo back through the legislative process. But these informal \narrangements may be just temporary and expedient, and probably are \ntemporary and expedient. But the real work, the commitment the \nGovernment of Iraq made months ago to make these changes, has not been \naccomplished.\n  The Iraqi Government has not eliminated militia control of local \nsecurity, eliminated political intervention in military operations, \nensured evenhanded enforcement of the law, increased Army units capable \nof independent operations or ensured that political authorities made no \nfalse accusations against security forces.\n  Again, we have been engaged for years in training Iraqi security \nforces. At the entry level of that training--to give the ability of a \nsquad leader to read a map, to call indirect fire, to call a medevac--\nwe have made progress. To give the skills for an individual infantryman \nto low-crawl, to clear a building, we have made progress. But it is at \nthe critical levels where politics and security intersect that there \nhas not been the adequate progress. That is the most decisive level. \nUntil there is a force in Iraq that is not only technically capable but \ncan operate with a certain degree of independence, then their ability \nis, I think, undermined. We are making progress in that direction.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment calls for the continued training to achieve \nnot just technical proficiency but we hope some day a force that is \nprofessionally capable and deployed in a way where they can secure the \ncountry of Iraq--their country--without fear or favor with respect to \npolitical or sectarian allegiance.\n  Now, the Iraqi Government also pledged to spend $10 billion of their \nown money on reconstruction. We have sent billions of American dollars \nover there for reconstruction. To date, only $1.5 billion of Iraqi \nfunds has been allocated to do that. I think it raises the question \namong many Americans: If we are spending all these billions of \ndollars--and the President is going to send the supplemental up shortly \nasking for billions and billions of dollars more--why cannot the Iraqis \nspend at least their own money they have for their own people for their \nown needs? I think it is a question that the longer it goes unanswered, \nthe more unsettling it is to the American public.\n  The GAO also noted:\n\n       It is unclear whether sectarian violence in Iraq has \n     decreased--a key security benchmark--since it is difficult to \n     measure the perpetrators intent and other measures of \n     population security show differing trends.\n\n  The situation, which is understandable given the chaotic nature, \ngiven the conflicting motivations that are engulfing the country and \nproducing violence--it is hard to say what is criminality, what is a \npolitically motivated event, what is the mixture of the two--but these \nmeasures, I think from our perspective, whether they go up or down, \nprobably do not suggest the atmosphere which most Iraqis endure, which \nis an atmosphere of violence, potential violence, of fear. It is an \natmosphere that has caused 2 million people to be external refugees, 2 \nmillion people, roughly, to be internally displaced.\n  It also is reflected in polling conducted within Iraq about the sense \nof security and the sense of the future the Iraqi people have. These \nnumbers have been declining. It was at a zenith, obviously, after the \noperations in March 2003. But since then there has been, I think, a \nsignificant and continued deterioration. Because this violence--to us \nit makes a difference that it is sectarian versus criminal--but to \nsomeone on the street, it is violence. Again, the progress in \nstabilizing the country that the Iraqi Government said they were \ncommitted to has not materially been changed throughout the country.\n  Now, General Petraeus and General Jones did report improvements in \nthe Iraqi security forces, and they should be recognized. But the \nprogress is uneven and slow. I suggested at the zenith, where it is \nmost critical in terms of stability of the country, where it is \ncommanders, not squad leaders, who are making decisions, that is the \nmost difficult to achieve, and it is, so far, lagging based upon the \nreports we have heard.\n  Now, we recognize the last 2 years have been enormously challenging \nfor the Government of Iraq and our participation there. We recognize, \ntoo, that both General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker came with great \nexperience, great professional acumen, and great patriotic service to \nthe country, and gave us their best report.\n\n  There is another aspect of this debate which is as important as what \nis going on in Iraq, and that is what is going on in the United States. \nFrankly, the support for our operations has rapidly faded since the \nheady days of March 2003. Before the September reports by Ambassador \nCrocker and General Petraeus and the speech by the President, 64 \npercent of Americans polled by CBS felt things were going badly in \nIraq; after the reports and speech, 63 percent.\n  My point is, that is an important factor in the conduct of any \nnational security policy: the support of the American people. In fact, \nthe manual General Petraeus helped author at Fort Leavenworth, the \ncounterinsurgency manual, makes that point specifically, that public \nsupport within the United States is a critical--critical--attribute for \npolicy, particularly long-term policy in a counterinsurgency conflict.\n  We have seen, frankly, the American public being quite concerned, in \nfact disheartened, about what is happening in Iraq. I think that also \ncalls--in addition to what is happening on the ground--for a change in \nour policy, for a change in the direction Senator Levin and I are \nsuggesting.\n  It is very difficult and some would argue impossible for any \nadministration to carry out a policy without the strong support of the \nUnited States, particularly a policy that does not seem to be matched \nby an equal commitment by those whom we are trying to help. I believe \nwe do need a change of policy, not only because it is a more effective \nway to go forward, but it, I think, would represent to the American \npeople a needed sense that we have heard them, we are moving forward, \nand we are moving forward in a way that can be sustained and be \nsupported by the American people.\n  Everyone has to recognize the extraordinary contribution of our \nmilitary forces. They are serving well, and they continue to serve \nwell. But I think their effort has to be matched by a wiser policy on \nour part. That policy, I think, is necessary. I hope we can do that \nwithin the context of the amendment we propose.\n  There is another issue here, too, and that is not just public support \nbut also the financial support. We are spending $12 billion a month in \nIraq, Afghanistan, et cetera. That price keeps going up. We understand \nthe costs are not short term. There are hundreds of thousands of \nveterans coming out of the gulf who for the next 50 years will require \nsupport and assistance. This is not going to be something that when we \nlook back 5 or 10 years, even when the fighting stops, we can ignore. \nWe have a long-term commitment to these individuals and a long-term \ncostly commitment. We have to measure our policy against our resources, \nnot just the brave men and women who serve, but our ability to finance \ntheir operations and finance their long-term care as they come back.\n  This amendment, as I indicated previously, calls for a transition \nwhich I believe is long overdue, a transition to counterterrorism, a \ntransition to training Iraqi security forces, and protection of our \nforces, coalition forces. I think the transition will help us in terms \nof what is happening on the ground, what is happening in the country, \nand what should be happening in the region.\n\n[[Page S11805]]\n\n  Also, our amendment talks about a very aggressive diplomatic \napproach, something I think has been missing. We have to engage the \nregional community and the world community to help us. I think there \nmight be an opportunity, indeed, when we talk about the context of \ntraining, to go forward to our allies in NATO and say: You could help \nus on this training mission. This is not a direct combat operation. \nThis is something well within the capacity of your armies across the \nglobe. This could put an international approach to our problems, which \nwould be very helpful not only in terms of putting men and women on the \nground to assist the Iraqi security forces, but indicating this is not \nAmerica's problem alone, this is an issue that should be addressed by \nall the nations of the world.\n  Now, for 5 years our military forces have fought with valor, courage, \nand sacrifice. Their families have borne their absences. They have \nsupported them remarkably and magnificently, and I think that has to be \nrecognized. But we have to provide them a diplomatic support that has \nbeen lacking all these years.\n  Many of my colleagues have traveled to Iraq many times. I have. Since \nthe beginning, there has not been an adequate complement through \ndiplomats and AID personnel and agronomists, and all the specialists \nyou need to provide the public nonkinetic--as military people describe \nit--aspects of counterinsurgency. Those forces have been lacking. There \nhave been efforts recently to improve them, but they are still \nsignificantly lacking.\n  So for many years--all these years--we have had an Army and Marine \nCorps at war, supported--I should say not just supported but it has \nintimately involved all our services--but we have not had the full \ncommitment of our national resources. We have not had a full commitment \nof our civilian agencies that is so necessary. Today, that, I think, is \nnot being manifested enough. So for that reason, also, I think we have \nto recognize a change is necessary.\n  I hope we can change the policy. I think in the long term it will be \nbeneficial to the United States. I hope we will allow ourselves to \nbegin to focus more resources on threats that are, I think, much more \nsevere: the virtual safe haven in Pakistan from where bin Laden sends \ntapes to us and al-Zawahiri sends tapes to us that inspire terrorist \norganizations in Europe that are approaching closer and closer to the \nUnited States--that was, I think, the whole premise for our global war \non terrorism, to effectively prevent another attack on our homeland--\nthe growing power of Iran, not only in terms of its influence in the \nregion, its connection to other terrorist groups, but its aspirations \nto be a nuclear power, which we are finding very difficult to counter \ndiplomatically.\n  I hope we can refocus our efforts in Iraq, and we can also refocus \nour efforts to meet these other emerging and very dangerous threats.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered \nby the chairman and the Senator from Rhode Island that would mandate a \nwithdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq.\n  Again, we find ourselves on the floor of this Chamber debating an \namendment that is nearly identical to one that failed 2 months ago. The \npending amendment would mandate a withdrawal of U.S. combat forces \nwithin 90 days of enactment, leaving a smaller force authorized only to \ncarry out narrowly defined missions. And the Senate faces, once again--\nfaces again--a simple choice: whether to build on the successes of our \nnew strategy and give General Petraeus and the troops under his command \nthe time and support needed to carry out their mission or to ignore the \nrealities on the ground and legislate a premature end to our efforts in \nIraq, accepting thereby all the terrible consequences that will ensue.\n  Many Senators wished to postpone this choice, preferring to await the \ntestimony of General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker. Last week, these \ntwo career officers reported unambiguously that the new strategy is \nsucceeding in Iraq. Knowing what we now know--that our military is \nmaking progress on the ground, and that their commanders request from \nus the time and support necessary to succeed in Iraq--a measure of \ncourage is required, not the great courage exhibited by those brave men \nand women fighting on our behalf but a smaller measure, the courage \nnecessary to put America's interests before every personal or political \nconsideration.\n\n  It is important that as we proceed with consideration of this \namendment, we spend a few moments reviewing the current state of \naffairs in Iraq. We see today that after nearly 4 years of mismanaged \nwar, the situation on the ground in Iraq shows demonstrable signs of \nprogress. The final reinforcements needed to implement General \nPetraeus's new counterinsurgency plan have been in place for over 2 \nmonths, and our military, in cooperation with the Iraqi security \nforces, is making significant gains in a number of areas.\n  General Petraeus reported in detail on these gains during his \ntestimony in both Houses and in countless interviews. The No. 2 U.S. \ncommander in Iraq, LT GEN Ray Odierno, said today the 7-month-old \nsecurity operation has reduced violence in Baghdad by some 50 percent, \ncar bombings and suicide attacks in Baghdad have fallen to their lowest \nlevel in a year, and civilian casualties have dropped from a high of 32 \nper day to 12 per day. His comments are echoed by LT GEN Abboud Qanbar, \nthe Iraqi commander who said that before the surge began, one-third of \nBaghdad's 507 districts were under insurgent control. Today, he said: \n``Only 5 to 6 districts can be called hot areas.'' Anyone who has \ntraveled recently to Anbar, Diyala or Baghdad can see the improvements \nthat have taken place over the past months. With violence down, \ncommerce has risen, and bottom-up efforts to forge counterterrorism \nalliances are bearing tangible fruit.\n  None of this is to argue that Baghdad or other regions have suddenly \nbecome safe or that violence has come down to acceptable levels. As \nGeneral Odierno pointed out, violence is still too high and there are \nmany unsafe areas. Nevertheless, such positive developments illustrate \nGeneral Petraeus's contention last week that American and Iraqi forces \nhave achieved substantial progress under their new strategy.\n  It is instructive to reflect on how far some areas have come. One \nyear ago, in September of 2006--1 year ago, September 2006--The \nWashington Post ran a story titled: ``Situation Called Dire in West \nIraq; Anbar is Lost Politically, Marine Analyst Says.'' After an \noffensive by U.S. and Iraqi troops cleaned al-Qaida fighters out of \nRamadi and other areas of western Anbar, the province's tribal sheiks, \ndisgusted by the brutality and blatant disregard for human life \nexhibited by their aggressors, broke formally with the terrorists and \njoined the coalition side. As a result, Anbar, which last year stood as \nIraq's most dangerous province, is now one of its safest.\n  By the way, many critics of the war say that change would have \nhappened without the surge. That is patently false. The fact is, when \nthe sheiks decided to come over to our side, a brave colonel named \nMacFarland immediately sent 4,000 marines to protect them, and General \nPetraeus has testified that if they hadn't had those troops, then we \nprobably would not have seen Anbar in the condition that it is in \ntoday.\n  I asked General Petraeus, and he said the following:\n\n       The success in Anbar Province, correctly, is a political \n     success--\n\n  By the way, something we all seek----\n\n       But it is a political success that has been enabled, very \n     much, by our forces who have been enabled by having \n     additional forces in Anbar Province.\n\n  Ambassador Crocker added:\n\n       Such scenes are also unfolding in parts of Diyala and \n     Ninewa, where Iraqis have immobilized with the help of \n     Coalition and Iraqi security forces.\n\n  So as we all know, without military security, there is no political \nprogress, and that political progress is only enabled by the \nsubstantial military presence that was provided by the surge.\n  As in Anbar and elsewhere, where local populations have turned on al-\nQaida's brutal methods, there are reports of Shia extremists \nencountering a similar reception. Recent attacks by the Mahdi Army on \nworshipers in the holy city of Karbala prompted a public backlash that \nled Muqtada al-Sadr to\n\n[[Page S11806]]\n\norder a suspension of all military actions by his followers against \nIraqi and coalition forces.\n  In Baghdad, the military, in cooperation with Iraqi security forces, \ncontinues to man joint security stations and deploy throughout the city \nin order to bring violence under control. These efforts have produced \npositive results. Sectarian violence has fallen since the beginning of \nthe year. The total number of car bombings and suicide attacks \ndeclined, and the number of locals coming forward with intelligence \ntips has risen.\n  None of this is to suggest the road in Iraq remains anything but long \nand hard. Violence remains at unacceptable levels, the Maliki \nGovernment remains paralyzed and unwilling to function as it must, and \nother difficulties abound. No one can guarantee success or be certain \nabout its prospects. We can be sure, however, that should the Congress \nsucceed in terminating the strategy by legislating an abrupt withdrawal \nand a transition to a new, less effective and more dangerous course--\nshould we do that, then we will fail for certain.\n  Let's make no mistakes about the costs of such an American failure in \nIraq. Many of my colleagues would like to believe that should the \namendment we are currently considering become law, it would mark the \nend of this long effort. They are wrong. Should the Congress force a \nprecipitous withdrawal from Iraq, it would mark a new beginning, the \nstart of a new, more dangerous effort to contain the forces unleashed \nby our disengagement. If we leave, we will be back in Iraq and \nelsewhere. That is not just my view but that of General Jones and \nothers, in many more desperate fights to protect our security and add \nan even greater cost in American lives and treasure.\n  In testimony before the Armed Services Committee last week, General \nPetraeus referred to an August Defense Intelligence Agency report that \nstated:\n\n       A rapid withdrawal would result in the further release of \n     strong centrifugal forces in Iraq and produce a number of \n     dangerous results, including a high risk of disintegration of \n     the Iraqi security forces, a rapid deterioration of local \n     security initiatives, al-Qaida-Iraq regaining lost ground and \n     freedom of maneuver, a marked increase in violence, and \n     further ethno-sectarian displacement and refugee flows; an \n     exacerbation of already challenging regional dynamics, \n     especially with respect to Iran.\n\n  Those are the likely consequences of a precipitous withdrawal, and I \nhope the supporters of such a move will tell us how they intend to \naddress the chaos and catastrophe that would surely follow such a \ncourse of action.\n\n  No matter where my colleagues came down in 2003 about the centrality \nof Iraq to the war on terror, there can simply be no debate that our \nefforts in Iraq today are critical to the wider struggle against \nviolent Islamic extremism. Earlier this month, GEN Jim Jones testified \nbefore the Armed Services Committee on the effects of such a course.\n  The supporters of this amendment respond that they do not by any \nmeans intend to cede the battlefield to al-Qaida. On the contrary, \ntheir legislation would allow U.S. forces, presumably holed up in \nforward-operating bases, to carry out targeted counterterrorism \noperations. But our own military commanders say this approach will not \nsucceed and that moving in with search-and-destroy missions to kill and \ncapture terrorists, only to immediately cede the territory to the \nenemy, is the failed Rumsfeld strategy of the past nearly 4 years. We \nshould not and must not return to such a disastrous course.\n  It has become clear by now that we cannot set a date for withdrawal \nwithout setting a date for surrender. Should we leave Iraq before there \nis a basic level of stability, we invite chaos, genocide, terrorist \nsafe havens, and regional war. We invite further Iranian influence at a \ntime when Iranian operatives are already moving weapons, training \nfighters, providing resources, and helping plan operations to kill \nAmerican soldiers and damage our efforts to bring stability to Iraq. If \nany of my colleagues remain unsure of Iran's intentions in the region, \nmay I direct them to the recent remarks of the Iranian President who \nsaid:\n\n       The political power of the occupiers is collapsing rapidly. \n     Soon, we will see a huge power vacuum in the region. Of \n     course, we are prepared to fill the gap.\n\n  If our notions of national security have any meaning, they cannot \ninclude permitting the establishment of an Iranian-dominated Middle \nEast that is roiled by a wider regional war and riddled with terrorist \nsafe havens.\n  The hour is indeed late in Iraq. How we have arrived at this critical \nand desperate moment has been well chronicled, and history's judgment \nabout the long catalog of mistakes in the prosecution of this war will \nbe stern and unforgiving. But history will revere the honor and \nsacrifice of those Americans who, despite the mistakes and failures of \nboth civilian and military leaders, shouldered a rifle and risked \neverything so the country they love so well might not suffer the many \ndangerous consequences of defeat.\n  That is what General Petraeus and the Americans he has the honor to \ncommand are trying to do--to fight smarter and better in a way that \naddresses and doesn't strengthen the tactics of the enemy and to give \nthe Iraqis the security and opportunity to make the necessary political \ndecisions to save their country from the abyss of genocide and a \npermanent and spreading war. Now is not the time for us to lose our \nresolve. We must remain steadfast in this new mission, for we do not \nfight only for the interests of Iraqis, we fight for ours as well.\n  In this moment of serious peril for America, we must all of us \nremember to whom and what we owe our first allegiance--to the security \nof the American people and the ideals upon which our Nation was \nfounded.\n  This is the same amendment that was rejected 2 months ago. In the \nintervening 2 months, our opposition to this amendment has been \nvalidated by the progress on the ground of the military strategy which \nGeneral Petraeus designed and our brave young Americans who are serving \nhave implemented. So we are here 2 months later with tangible success \non the ground and addressing the same amendment. The effect of this \namendment would return us to the failed strategy of nearly 4 years ago. \nIf there was any doubt the last time in anybody's mind about whether we \nshould go back to that failed strategy of the past or we should \ncontinue with this successful strategy, I think the events of the last \n2 months, since we rejected this amendment the last time, should \nconvince the objective observers.\n  So I hope my colleagues will understand this debate and this \namendment is very important, and it is very important to the security \nof the United States of America, the region. We must never forget that \nif we fail--if we fail--Americans will be called back sooner or later \nand called upon to make greater service and sacrifice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Biden \namendment identified in a previous consent agreement be subject to a \n60-vote threshold, and that if the amendment does not receive 60 votes, \nit be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, there isn't any dispute about whether a \nstable and independent Iraq is in our national interest. Some of us \ndisagreed with the way we went to war with Iraq 4\\1/2\\ years ago. We \nhave disagreed, many of us, with many of the Bush administration's \npolicies in Iraq since then, including ignoring the advice of senior \nmilitary leaders such as General Shinseki in planning the invasion, \nfailing to properly plan for the occupation and its aftermath, \ndisbanding the Iraqi Army, banning low-level Baath Party members from \npost-Saddam Government employment, failing to pressure the Iraqi \nleaders to meet the benchmarks and the timetable they set for \nthemselves and, most recently, increasing the U.S. military presence in \nIraq with the so-called surge, when we should be reducing our military \npresence.\n  But the challenge facing us now, given where we are today, is what is \nthe best way to promote a stable and independent Iraq. Is the course we \nare on succeeding? So while the opponents of changing course argue that \nthose of us who want to change course don't see the importance of a \nstable and independent Iraq, they are exactly wrong. We see the \nimportance of it, but we see the current policy is failing to move us \nin the direction of a stable and independent Iraq. It is the status \nquo--\n\n[[Page S11807]]\n\nstaying the course--that jeopardizes the goal of a stable and \nindependent Iraq. So while there is disagreement on whether the current \ncourse is leading to a stable and independent Iraq, there is \nagreement--broad consensus--on the desirability of that goal.\n  There has also been a consensus for some time that there is no \nmilitary solution to the sectarian violence in Iraq, and that the key \nto ending the violence lies in bringing about a political settlement \namong the various factions in Iraq today. Even Prime Minister Maliki \nrecognized that fact a few months ago. This is what he said:\n\n       The crisis is political, and the ones who can stop the \n     cycle of blood letting of innocents are the Iraqi \n     politicians.\n\n  That is the Prime Minister of Iraq pointing out that it is the \nfailure of the Iraqi politicians that is resulting in the ongoing \nviolence. President Bush said this last January. He said the purpose of \nthe surge--the explicit purpose, the stated purpose of the surge--was \nto give Iraqi politicians ``breathing space'' to work out a political \nsettlement.\n  It is also pretty much undisputed that the stated purpose of the \nsurge--that explicitly stated purpose about giving the Iraqi \npoliticians breathing space to work out their political settlement--has \nnot been achieved. There are going to be arguments back and forth about \nhow much military progress there has been on the ground, and there are \nstatistics both ways. I accept General Petraeus's assessment--and I \nhave been there recently--that there has been some military progress on \nthe ground. But the purpose of the surge, the goal of the surge was to \nprovide breathing space to the Iraqi politicians; and the more the \nsurge has succeeded, the less excuse there is for the Iraqi politicians \nnot working out their political misunderstandings.\n  So it works exactly the opposite way from what the opponents of this \namendment say. To the extent the surge has succeeded militarily, it \nmakes it less understandable, less excusable, and less acceptable for \nthe Iraqi politicians to continue to dawdle. By the way, the President \nhas kind of shifted ground in terms of the purpose of the surge, \nanyway. Now the goal of the surge is to provide security and help Iraqi \nforces to maintain it. So having failed in its purpose, which was to \ngive the Iraqi politicians room to work out their political \nmisunderstandings, now we have a much more open-ended goal: to provide \nsecurity and help the Iraqi forces to maintain it.\n  Madam President, General Petraeus agreed in his testimony last week \nthat the purpose of the surge--to provide breathing space to work out a \npolitical settlement--has not been achieved. He was asked a direct \nquestion and he gave that answer. He acknowledged the political \nsettlement has not been achieved and that that was the stated purpose \nof the surge.\n  There has been a lot of debate on whether the current situation on \nthe ground in Iraq shows significant progress in terms of security--by \nthe way, even though, as I said, this can be argued back and forth, \nthere has been a public opinion poll taken in Iraq. The Iraqi people \nhave been asked that question--not by supporters or opponents of the \npolicy but by ABC News. Here is what the poll results were, and this is \nthe Iraqi citizens being asked whether they feel more or less secure as \na result of the surge. Here is the analysis by ABC News:\n\n       The surge broadly is seen to have done more harm than good, \n     with 65 to 70 percent [of Iraqis] saying it's worsened rather \n     than improved security in surge areas, security in other \n     areas, conditions for political dialog, the ability of the \n     Iraqi government to do its work, the pace of reconstruction, \n     and the pace of economic development.\n\n  The result of the surge--or more accurately, the lack of political \nresults--underscores the reality that there is going to be no end to \nthe violence until Iraqi national leaders work out their political \ndifferences. As the Independent Commission on the Security Forces of \nIraq, under the leadership of retired Marine General Jim Jones, \nreported last week:\n\n       Political reconciliation is the key to ending sectarian \n     violence in Iraq.\n\n  The Iraqi politicians surely haven't done that. They have not kept \nthe commitments they made to achieve political reconciliation by \nadopting legislation setting the dates for provincial elections, \napproving a hydrocarbon law, a debaathification law, and submitting \nconstitutional amendments to a referendum.\n  I want to emphasize that the Iraqis' commitments to work out their \nkey differences and the timetable to do so were their commitments and \ntheir timetable. So when Prime Minister Maliki complains that outsiders \nare not going to dictate to the Iraqi Government, what he is trying to \ndo is obscure the fact that his own government set the benchmarks and \ntimetables for themselves.\n  Back in January, when President Bush proposed the surge, this is what \nhe said about the benchmarks and the need for the Iraqis to meet them:\n\n       America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it \n     has announced.\n\n  Last Thursday, we heard the same old song from the President. He \nsaid:\n\n       The [Iraqi] government has not met its own legislative \n     benchmarks, and in my meeting with Iraq leaders, I have made \n     it clear that they must.\n\n  Eight months after saying we are going to hold the Iraqi Government \nto the benchmarks, the President's words ring hollow. We are not \ninsisting the Iraqi leaders keep their commitments, and there have been \nabsolutely no consequences for the Iraqi leaders' failure to do so. \nJames Baker, Lee Hamilton, and the rest of the Iraq Study Group \nrecommended the following:\n\n       If the Iraqi government does not make substantial progress \n     toward the achievement of milestones on national \n     reconciliation, security, and governance, the United States \n     should reduce its political, military, or economic support \n     for the Iraqi government.\n\n  Now, those were the words of the Iraq Study Group. That is exactly \nwhat is needed: consequences--clear, direct, and understandable \nconsequences. But the only response to the Iraqi politicians' continued \ndawdling has been the repeated calls by the President for patience.\n  I make reference to a letter from the Secretary of State, Condoleezza \nRice, dated January 30, 2007. The question had been raised whether the \ntimelines that were set by the Iraqi Government were in fact their \ntimelines or ours. This is what Secretary Rice said about the \ntimelines:\n\n        . . . Iraq's Policy Committee on National Security agreed \n     upon a set of political, security, and economic benchmarks \n     and an associated timeline in September 2006. These were \n     reaffirmed by the Presidency Council on October 16, 2006, and \n     referenced by the Iraq Study Group; the relevant document \n     (enclosed) was posted at that time on the President of Iraq's \n     website.\n\n  Madam President, we have been told by the--at least the public has \nbeen told by, I believe, the Prime Minister of Iraq that they are not \ngoing to accept America's timeline, that we are not going to impose a \ntimeline on Iraq. What Secretary Rice's letter to me confirmed very \nprecisely is that the Presidency Council of Iraq on October 16, 2006, \nadopted, reaffirmed--in her words, ``Iraq's Policy Committee on \nNational Security agreed upon a set of . . . timelines.''\n  The dates are here. Here is the timeline.\n  September 2006: To form a review committee and to agree on a \npolitical timetable.\n  October 2006: Approve a hydrocarbon law and approve a provincial \nelection law.\n  November 2006: Approve a debaathification law and approve provincial \ncouncil authorities law.\n  December 2006: Approve amnesty, militias, and other armed formations \nlaw.\n  January 2007: Constitutional Review Committee completes its work.\n  February 2007: Form independent commissions in accordance with the \nconstitution.\n  March 2007: Constitutional amendments referendum.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary Rice to me \ndated January 30, 2007, be printed in the Record at this point, which \nmakes the very clear statement that, No. 1, the timelines I have \nreferred to attached to her letter are the Iraqi Government's \ntimelines, and they formally adopted those.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                                       Washington.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your recent letters \n     regarding the way forward in\n\n[[Page S11808]]\n\n     Iraq and the role of benchmarks for political issues Iraq \n     must solve. The President has also asked that I reply on his \n     behalf to your December 12, 2006, letter to him concerning \n     the importance of announcing a deadline for beginning a \n     phased redeployment from Iraq.\n       I share your view that the Iraqi Government must meet the \n     goal it has set for itself--establishing a democratic, \n     unified, and secure Iraq. We believe the Iraqi Government \n     understands very well the consequences of failing to make the \n     tough decisions necessary to allow all Iraqis to live in \n     peace and security. President Bush has been clear with Prime \n     Minister Maliki on this score, as have I and other senior \n     officials in discussions with our counterparts. We expect the \n     Prime Minister to follow through on his pledges to the \n     President that he would take difficult decisions.\n       In his January 10 address, the President stated that after \n     careful consideration he had decided that announcing a phased \n     withdrawal of our combat forces at this time would open the \n     door to a collapse of the Iraqi Government and the country \n     being torn apart. The New Way Forward in Iraq that the \n     President announced on January 10 is designed to help the \n     Government of Iraq to succeed. This strategy has the strong \n     support of General Petraeus and his commanders, and we must \n     give the strategy time to succeed.\n       On your point about a political solution being critical to \n     long-term success, I also agree. However, with violence in \n     the capital at the levels we have seen since the Samarra \n     attack on February 22, 2006, extremists and terrorists have \n     been able to hold the political process hostage. The \n     President's strategy is designed to dampen the present level \n     of violence in Baghdad and ensure that Iraq's political \n     center has the security and stability it needs to negotiate \n     lasting political accommodations through Iraq's new \n     democratic institutions.\n       At the same time, the President has made clear to the Prime \n     Minister and other Iraqi leaders that America's commitment is \n     not open-ended. It is essential that the Government of Iraq--\n     with our help, but its lead--set out measurable, achievable \n     goals and objectives on each of three critical, strategic \n     tracks: political, security, and economic. In this regard, \n     Iraq's Policy Committee on National Security agreed upon a \n     set of political, security, and economic benchmarks and an \n     associated timeline in September 2006. These were reaffirmed \n     by the Presidency Council on October 16, 2006, and referenced \n     by the Iraq Study Group; the relevant document (enclosed) was \n     posted at that time on the President of Iraq's website.\n       Beyond that, as the President said, Prime Minister Maliki \n     made a number of additional commitments including: Non-\n     interference in operations of the Iraqi Security Forces; \n     Prosecution of all who violate the law, regardless of sect or \n     religion; Deployment of three additional Iraqi army brigades \n     to Baghdad; and Use of $10 billion for reconstruction.\n       We will continually assess Iraq's progress in meeting these \n     commitments as well as other initiatives critical to Iraq's \n     development.\n           Sincerely,\n     Condoleezza Rice.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Unofficial Translation\n\n\n                      National Political Timeline\n\n       September 2006: Form Constitutional Review Committee; \n     Approve law on procedures to form regions; Agree on political \n     timetable; Approve the law for Independent High Electoral \n     Commission (IHEC); and Approve the Investment Law.\n       October 2006: Approve provincial elections law and set date \n     for provincial elections; and Approve a hydrocarbon law.\n       November 2006: Approve de-Ba'athification law; Approve \n     provincial council authorities law; and Approve a flag, \n     emblem and national anthem law.\n       December 2006: Approve Coalition Provisional Authority \n     Order 91 concerning armed forces and militias; Council of \n     Representatives to address amnesty, militias and other armed \n     formations; and Approve amnesty, militias and other armed \n     formations law.\n       January 2007: Constitutional Review Committee completes its \n     work.\n       February 2007: Form independent commissions in accordance \n     with the Constitution.\n       March 2007: Constitutional amendments referendum (if \n     required).\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that another \nletter that I will read a part of be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2007.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter inquiring \n     about the benchmarks that the Government of Iraq set for \n     itself last fall.\n       As you mentioned, I sent to you a letter in January in \n     which I noted that Iraq's Political Committee on National \n     Security agreed upon a set of benchmarks and an associated \n     timeline, which were reaffirmed by the Iraqi Presidency \n     Council in October 2006.\n       We have confirmed with Iraqi President Talabani's Chief of \n     Staff that the benchmarks were formally approved last fall by \n     the Iraqi Political Committee on National Security. This \n     committee includes the Presidency Council--the President and \n     the two Vice Presidents--as well as the leaders of all the \n     major political blocs in Iraq. The Iraqi Presidency Council \n     then posted the benchmarks on its website for several months.\n       Thank you for your interest in this issue. Please feel free \n     to contact us on this or any matter of concern to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Condoleezza Rice.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. This is a June 13, 2007, letter to me from Secretary Rice. \nThe setting for this--before I read this paragraph--is that Iraq said \nthey never adopted those timelines, they never adopted those \nbenchmarks. They contested what Secretary Rice said to me in the letter \nI am making part of the Record, dated January 30. I asked Secretary \nRice about that. I said the Iraqis are saying you are wrong, that they \ndidn't adopt the benchmarks. They say you are wrong, Secretary Rice. \nWhat do you have to say about that? She wrote me back:\n\n       Thank you for your letter inquiring about the benchmarks \n     that the Government for Iraq set for itself last fall.\n\n  I emphasize the words ``set for itself last fall.''\n  Addressing me, she wrote:\n\n       As you mentioned, I sent to you a letter in January in \n     which I noted that Iraq's Political Committee on National \n     Security agreed upon a set of benchmarks and an associated \n     timeline, which were reaffirmed by the Iraqi Presidency \n     Council in October 2006.\n\n  She continued:\n\n       We have confirmed with Iraqi President Talibani's Chief of \n     Staff that the benchmarks were formally approved last fall by \n     the Iraqi Political Committee on National Security. This \n     committee includes the Presidency Council--the President and \n     two Vice Presidents--as well as the leaders of all major \n     political blocs in Iraq. The Iraqi Presidency Council then \n     posted the benchmarks on its website for several months.\n\n  I have already made this part of the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to the Secretary, which \nprecipitated this response on June 13 also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2007.\n     Hon. Condoleezza Rice,\n     Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: I am writing in connection with your \n     letter of January 20, 2007 in which you advised me regarding \n     a set of benchmarks that the Government of Iraq has set for \n     itself.\n       You wrote that ``Iraq's Policy Committee on National \n     Security agreed upon a set of political, security, and \n     economic benchmarks and an associated timeline in September \n     2006. These were reaffirmed by the Presidency Council on \n     October 16, 2006, and referenced by the Iraq Study Group; the \n     relevant document (enclosed) was posted at that time on the \n     President of Iraq's website.''\n       Yesterday, I met with Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Prime Minister \n     Maliki's national security adviser. During the course of our \n     meeting, Dr. Rubaie stated that the Presidency Council never \n     reaffirmed the benchmarks. He was adamant on this point even \n     after I showed him the statement in your letter.\n       This is an important point as the Presidency Council, whose \n     three members, President Jalal Talabani (Kurd), Deputy \n     President `Adil `Abd al-Mahdi (Shia Muslim) and Deputy \n     President Tariq al-Hashimi (Sunni Muslim), are elected by the \n     Council of Representatives and represent the three major \n     ethnic groups of the country.\n       Earlier today, State Department Spokesman Sean McCormack \n     stated ``These are the benchmarks that they've laid out for \n     themselves. We didn't come up with them. They came up with \n     them. And they need to be seen in the eyes of the Iraqi \n     people as delivering for the Iraqi people.''\n       It seems to me that it would make a difference if the \n     benchmarks and associated timeline were only approved by an \n     advisory group as compared to the Presidency Council.\n       Accordingly, please confirm that the benchmarks and \n     associated timeline, which you attached to your January 30, \n     2007 letter, were reaffirmed by the Presidency Council after \n     being agreed upon by the Policy Committee on National \n     Security, as stated in your letter.\n       Thank you for your assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Success in Iraq--creating a stable, independent Iraq--\ndepends on Iraqi leaders finally seeing the end of the open-ended U.S. \ncommitment. The Iraq Study Group correctly pointed out almost a year \nago that ``An open-ended\n\n[[Page S11809]]\n\ncommitment of American forces would not provide the Iraqi government \nthe incentive it needs to take the political actions that give Iraq the \nbest chance of quelling sectarian violence.'' In the absence of such an \n     incentive, the Iraqi Government might continue to delay \n     taking those actions.\n\n  The President's current strategy is nothing less than stagnant \nbecause it is open-ended. It lacks the key ingredient of an action-\nforcing mechanism aimed at getting the Iraqi leaders to resolve their \npolitical differences. What is that mechanism? What is the mechanism \nthat will finally force the Iraqi leaders to get on with the job of \nnegotiating their political differences? It is action on our part, not \njust rhetoric, that clearly demonstrates to the Iraqi Government that \nour open-ended commitment to the American troops in the middle of their \ncivil war is over, and that while we will provide support to their \narmy, we have decided, as did the British, to transfer principal \nresponsibility for security to Iraqi forces.\n  It is not good enough to do what the President did a few days ago and \nsay we are going to take another look next March. That maintains the \nopen-ended commitment. That does not have a timetable for the reduction \nof our troops to the levels which are necessary to carry on the \nmissions which are identified.\n  The Jones Commission reported that ``The Iraqi armed forces . . . are \nincreasingly effective and are capable of assuming greater \nresponsibility for the internal security of Iraq.'' The Commission went \non to say that a number of Iraqi Army battalions that are capable of \ntaking the lead are not in the lead. That was a fact acknowledged by \nGeneral Petraeus in our hearings about a week ago.\n  The Commission did one other thing: The Jones Commission also \nrecommended--and these are the keywords--``the size of our national \nfootprint in Iraq be reconsidered'' and that ``significant reductions . \n. . appear to be possible and prudent.'' Those are the words of General \nJones and his Commission that significant reductions in our presence \nappear to be prudent. This is a group of retired generals and police \nofficers.\n  I asked General Petraeus about whether there are these units of the \nIraqi Army that are capable of assuming greater responsibility, as \nGeneral Jones's Commission said, but they have not done so. General \nPetraeus acknowledged that there were such Iraqi units. I asked him how \nmany, and he said he would supply that number for the record.\n  The Jones Commission emphasized that ``there is a fine line between \nassistance and dependence.'' When I was in Iraq last month, I asked a \nyoung American soldier who is on his third deployment to Iraq what his \nideas were about transferring greater responsibility to the Iraqis. His \nanswer was:\n\n       The Iraqi soldiers will let U.S. soldiers do the job that \n     they're supposed to be doing forever, and we need to let them \n     do it on their own.\n\n  I could not agree more.\n  In addition to getting our troops out of the middle of their civil \nwar, success also depends on a transition of missions. According to the \nIraq Study Group:\n\n       By the first quarter of 2008, subject to unexpected \n     developments in the security situation on the ground, all \n     combat brigades not necessary for force protection could be \n     out of Iraq.\n\n  That Commission proposed that a far smaller U.S. military presence \nwould remain only for limited missions to include force protection, \ncounterterrorism, and training the Iraqi security forces. I believe it \nis essential that transition to the limited missions be announced now \nas a way of ending this open-ended commitment which the Iraqi political \nleaders have taken to be such a security blanket and have taken them \noff the hook from doing something that only they can do--work out the \npolitical differences that divide them which, in the words of their own \nPrime Minister, the failure to do has resulted in the continuation of \nviolence.\n  Everybody seems to agree that there is no military solution, and yet \nwhen it comes to telling the Iraqi political leaders that the open-\nended commitment is over, we are not only going to begin to reduce our \ntroops, but we are going to transition their mission and complete that \ntransition in a reasonable period of time, not precipitous but in a \nreasonable period of time, and our amendment provides 9 months after \nenactment of this law, it is the only way--the only way--that this \nopen-ended commitment can finally be brought to an end. So we not only \nhave to transition to the limited missions and announce it now, we have \nto adopt a timetable for the completion of that transition.\n  Those are the key provisions of the amendment before us. It is the \nkey to ending the open-endedness, and it is long overdue. Presenting \nIraq's political leaders with a timetable to begin withdrawing our \nforces and transitioning those that remain from mainly combat to mainly \nsupport roles is the only hope that Iraqi leaders will realize their \nfuture is in their hands, not in the hands of our brave men and women \nwho proudly wear the uniform of our country.\n  Taking this step will also recognize another fact of life: that the \nstress on our forces--especially the wear and tear on the Army and \nMarines--must be reduced. We cannot continue to deploy our forces at \nthe current level without seriously weakening our ability to respond to \nother challenges that might confront us.\n  So how can Congress bring about a change of course in Iraq when \nPresident Bush delays and delays and delays making any change? A clear \nmajority of the Senate indicated support for Levin-Reed last July when \nwe voted 53 to 46 to cut off the filibuster of the Republican \nleadership against the Levin-Reed amendment. Madam President, 53 to 46 \nwas the vote.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment required the Secretary of Defense to begin a \nreduction in the number of U.S. forces in Iraq not later than 120 days \nafter the date of enactment. It would have also required a transition \nto a limited presence only to carry out the missions of protecting U.S. \nand coalition personnel and infrastructure, training, equipping, and \nproviding logistics support--and those are important words--to the \nIraqi security forces and engaging in targeted counterterrorism \noperations against al-Qaida, al-Qaida affiliated groups, and other \ninternational terrorist organizations. The transition to the limited \npresence in mission would have had to have been completed by April 30, \n2008. This reduction would have been implemented along with a \ncomprehensive diplomatic, political, and economic strategy that \nincludes sustained engagement with Iraq's neighbors and the \ninternational community.\n  The continued inability of the Iraqi Government to make any progress \ntoward a political settlement and the refusal of the Bush \nadministration to change course reinforces the need for the Levin-Reed \namendment. So that amendment is now before us. It is essentially the \nsame as the amendment we voted on last July. The changes in the \ntimetable are slight to accommodate the fact that we are voting at a \nlater time, essentially. We would require the reduction to begin no \nlater than 90 days after the date of enactment and to be completed \nwithin 9 months of the date of enactment in order to adjust the \ntimetable to be both clear and to respond to the fact that we will be \nvoting on this months later than the last vote in July.\n\n  The challenge before us is to get to the 60 votes. Sixty votes is the \ngoal that I guess almost all our Iraq legislation has to meet because \nof the filibuster that took place the last time we offered Levin-Reed \nand because the threat of that filibuster exists again.\n  The reality is that we are going to continue to plug away to get to \nthose 60 votes. We hope we can get them on this version of Levin-Reed. \nIt is a version which finally, if we can get to the 60 votes and defeat \nthis filibuster, will change course in Iraq. The majority of us in this \nSenate have voted to change course in Iraq, in effect, when there were \n53 of us who voted to end the filibuster last July.\n  The majority of the American people clearly want a change of course \nin Iraq. They do not want a precipitous withdrawal. They understand we \nare going to need some troops there for force protection and for \ntraining of the Iraqi Army and for providing logistics to the Iraqi \nArmy and for some targeted counterterrorism efforts against al-Qaida, \ntheir affiliates, and other terrorist groups. The American people \nunderstand. They want something that is\n\n[[Page S11810]]\n\nplanned in terms of reduction of our forces, and they want a timetable. \nWhat they want more than anything else is to get the Iraqi leaders to \nend their dawdling so our troops can come home.\n  Everybody wants a stable, independent Iraq. The course we are on now, \nthe course of status quo, an open-ended course, the course of, ``well, \nwe will figure out next July whether we want to go further, whether we \nwant to go below the presurge level,'' that stagnant course is exactly \nthe wrong signal to the Iraqi leaders.\n  The course the President is on keeps that open-ended commitment of \nAmerican forces. It does not do what we must do, and because the \nPresident will not do it, Congress must do it, which is to tell the \nIraqis that the future of their country is in their hands and we will \ncontinue to be helpful.\n  We have given them an opportunity they have not seized, and 4\\1/2\\ \nyears later, almost 4,000 American troops have been killed, 7 times \nthat many wounded, $600 billion now spent, $10 billion more every \nmonth. It has to come to an end. We want to bring it to a successful \nend. We cannot do it militarily. Every military leader says there is no \nmilitary solution. There is only a political solution, and only the \nIraqi political leaders can achieve it.\n  That is what this amendment will help to bring about, that final \nstatement to the Iraqi leaders: We cannot save you from yourselves.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 2875, 2865, 2867, 2868, 2871, 2866, 2869, 2293, 2285, \n  2880, 2892, 2278, 2119, 2123, 2921, 2233, as Modified, 2299, 2300, \n 2864, 2262, 2939, 2940, 2893, and 2941 to Amendment No. 2011, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Does the Senator withdraw his request for a \nquorum call?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Of course, I withdraw the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2898\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the choice for the Congress is whether or \nnot we retreat from a policy that appears to be working by adopting \nthis amendment which would redeploy troops in a fashion very \ninconsistent with what we are doing on the ground. What we are doing \nnow is a long overdue change in strategy. We have more forces than we \nhave ever had before, and they are very much needed.\n\n  The one thing I can say without any doubt is the old strategy, before \nthe surge, was not producing the results we were hoping for in terms of \nsecurity and political reconciliation. After about the third trip to \nBaghdad, it was obvious to me the game plan we had in place after the \nfall of Baghdad was not working. I was told time and time again, we \nhave enough troops, the insurgency is in its last throes, and there are \na few dead-enders. Well, that was the furthest thing from the truth.\n  The truth is the security environment in Iraq got completely out of \nhand, al-Qaida flourished under the old strategy, they were able to \nthrive in parts of Anbar, and it was evolving into complete chaos. \nThank God we had the ability and the willingness as a nation, through \nour Commander in Chief and through this Congress, to appoint a new \ngeneral with a new idea. The idea that he is employing now is long \noverdue. More troops have provided better security, and they have been \nable to accomplish this by partnering with the Iraqi Army in a new way.\n  The old strategy, which we are trying to go back to with this \namendment, had us in a training role. We were living behind walls, \ntraining during the day, and pretty much disengaged from the fight. We \nare now out from behind those walls, living with the Iraqi troops in \njoint security stations all over Baghdad and all over the country. We \nare living, eating, training, and fighting with the Iraqi Army. And \nGeneral Jones tells us they are getting better.\n  Anbar Province is dramatically different. Six months ago, it was \nreported by the Marine Corps to have been lost to the enemy called al-\nQaida. Well, a couple of things happened that are indeed good news. No. \n1, the people who lived in Anbar, who had a taste of al-Qaida life, \ndecided they did not want to live that way. Why? Well, what happened in \nAnbar Province when al-Qaida was in charge? Awful, terrible, vicious \nthings that really cannot even be talked about on the floor of the \nSenate. They imposed a way of life on the Anbar Sunnis that did not \nmeet the test of human decency, and the people living in Anbar rejected \nal-Qaida because they overplayed their hand.\n  The difference between us and our enemy in Iraq, al-Qaida, is pretty \nobvious. This organization that is tied to bin Laden, but also has \nIraqi members, they are the type of people if you don't do what they \nsay, they will take the family out into the street, take a 5-year-old \nchild in the presence of the parents, cover the child in gasoline, and \nset the child on fire. That is our enemy. That is the enemy of \neverybody\n\n[[Page S11817]]\n\nwho loves freedom and human decency. That happened in Anbar, and things \nlike that happened time and time again.\n  The agenda that al-Qaida has for the world is a very dark view of the \nworld, particularly for women. And, thank God, it has been rejected by \nthose in Anbar. The surge gave the ability to those living in Anbar to \nmake a choice they never had before. The additional military support \nprovided by the surge came along at a magic moment in time when the \npeople in Anbar were ready to take on al-Qaida. This additional combat \ncapacity cannot be underestimated in terms of how it has changed Iraq. \nIt certainly liberated Anbar from the clutches of al-Qaida. And the \nfact that Sunni Arabs are willing to turn on al-Qaida and join \ncoalition forces is good news for the world.\n  This amendment would basically undo many of the successes we have had \nin terms of adding more combat power. Things are getting better around \nBaghdad. There is still a lot of fighting. Al-Qaida has not been \ncompletely vanquished, but they are certainly diminished. Iran is \nplaying hard in Iraq right now. They understand what is going on on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Why are the Iranians trying to kill American forces? What is the goal \nof the Iranian regime when it comes to Iraq? I think the goal is to \ndrive us out. Does Iran want a completely chaotic Iraq? No. Does Iran \nwant a representative government in Iraq? Absolutely not, because the \nbiggest threat to this Iranian theocracy would be a representative \ngovernment on their border where Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds would live \ntogether and elect their own leaders. The biggest threat to Syria, this \ndictatorship in Syria, would be a representative democracy on their \nborder.\n  So if you are waiting on Iran and Syria to come in and help us form a \nmoderate way of doing business, where people can elect their leaders \nand accept each other's differences and live together with tolerance, \nyou can forget it because it is a threat to the dictatorships and the \ntheocracies that exist.\n  I think it is in our national security interests to allow General \nPetraeus to continue a strategy that is bringing about better security \nthan we have ever seen before. Now is not the time to pull back. Now is \nthe time to recommit American forces, and the political, military, and \neconomic power to finish the job that has been started.\n  I think the idea that the war in Iraq is a civil war just misses the \nboat. The truth is, there are many things going on in Iraq. Some of \nthem are local to Iraq, but many of them have international \nimplications and longstanding national security consequences for this \ncountry. Why did the Iranian President say he stood ready to fill any \nvacuum created in Iraq? Because he would like to expand his power. The \nquestion for us is, is it in our national security interest to allow a \nvacuum to be created?\n  Now, my good friend, Senator Levin, has a view that the more troops \nwe have in Iraq, the longer we stay there with large numbers, the less \nlikely the politicians in Baghdad will reconcile their differences \nthrough the political process. I have a totally opposite view. I \nunderstand what he is saying, but there is no evidence that less troops \nwill provide quicker reconciliation. The Iraqis are dying three to one \ncompared to our deaths and our injuries. The sacrifices of this country \nare enormous, but do not forget the Iraqi people are fighting and dying \nagainst extremist forces, and they are not indifferent to their fate.\n  The political reconciliation necessary to occur to bring this war to \na successful conclusion has not occurred in Baghdad, but it is \noccurring at the local level. So, in my opinion, it is just a matter of \ntime before the local reconciliation we see in Anbar and other places \nin Iraq comes to Baghdad. And the best pressure to put on any \npolitician in any place in the world where people vote to elect their \npoliticians is for all people to speak up and put pressure on their \nelected officials--not for Senator Graham or Senator Levin or Senator \nClinton or Senator McCain to tell the Maliki government what to do, but \ntheir own people telling them what to do.\n\n  After being there eight times, the people in Iraq I meet are more war \nweary than ever. They are coming together more at the local level than \nat any other time. Better security is emboldening the Iraqi people to \nmake the hard decisions that will eventually reconcile their country. \nThe idea of terminating this operation now, putting a deadline or a \ntimeline to withdraw will undercut everything we have achieved. The \npoliticians will change their attitude. Instead of looking at how to \nreconcile their country, they will be looking at how to protect their \nfamilies when the Americans leave.\n  So I am not for an unending, unlimited commitment of 160,000 troops. \nI am for keeping an American military presence in Iraq that helps my \ncountry--helps our country. We need to look at every decision we make \nin Iraq now and in the future from the viewpoint of, does it enhance \nour national security? Is it better to have 160,000 American forces in \nIraq now to stabilize a dysfunctional government or is it better to \nbring them home, knowing the most likely result will be a failed state?\n  A dysfunctional government exists in Iraq and here in Washington. But \nthere is a big difference between a dysfunctional government and a \nfailed state. A dysfunctional government is one that keeps trying but \nfails to do the hard things. A failed state is a place where no one \ntries anymore. They go back to the corners of their own country and the \nregional players begin to take sides and you have absolute chaos. Iran \nis the biggest winner of a failed state because they will dominate the \nsouthern part of Iraq.\n  Another problem of a failed state is that the Kurds will likely go to \nwar with Turkey over an independent movement in the north. If the \nSunnis think they are going to win in Iraq and have the good old days \nof Saddam come back by using force, they are crazy and they are naive. \nIf the Shias think they are going to create a theocracy in Iraq, like \nIran, and no one will say anything about it, they misunderstand the \nregion.\n  I am convinced all three groups are better off working together than \ntrying to work apart. I know this: We are better off if they do that. \nIf they break apart and this country becomes a failed state, 160,000 \ntroops for a limited period of time will not be what our country will \nbe faced with in terms of choices. We will have a large American \nmilitary presence in the Mideast, containing a variety of conflicts \nthat do not exist today because the problems in Iraq will spill over in \nthe region.\n  I believe that is a likely consequence. That is a reasonable \nconsequence of a failed state. I cannot promise that they will go from \na dysfunctional government to a stable government, a secure government, \none that is an ally on the war on terror with us that would reject al-\nQaida and contain Iran. But I believe this: the best shot to bring that \nabout is to continue the mission and the surge as planned out by \nGeneral Petraeus, to continue the strategy that we have now that has \nshown results we have never known before. If we pull back now, it will \nundo all the accomplishments that have come from a lot of sacrifice, a \nlot of blood, and a lot of treasure.\n  At the end of the day, the Iraqi political leadership has to embrace \nthe hard decisions necessary to pull their country together. They are \nmore likely to do that when they are less worried about their families \nbeing killed as they reach across the aisle.\n  It is hard to reach across the aisle here. The Presiding Officer and \nI have worked on immigration. We know how hard it is. We will keep \ncoming back and bringing up hard issues such as Social Security and \nimmigration until we find a solution. But imagine reaching across the \naisle in Iraq where the consequence would be that your family is \nmurdered.\n  The better security we can bring about in terms of Iraq for the \njudges, the politicians, and the population as a whole, the more likely \nthey are to do the hard things. And I do believe they are ready to do \nthe hard things because they have had a hard life. The Iraqi people are \nnot perfect. I don't think we realized how hard it was to have lived in \nthat country under Saddam Hussein. The fear that if your daughter \nwalked down the street, she might catch the eye of one of Saddam's \nsons; the way they have had to live under Saddam Hussein is \nunimaginable, and the chaos that they have experienced from al-Qaida \ncoming there, throwing bombs at different mosques and bringing up old\n\n[[Page S11818]]\n\nwounds has been very difficult to deal with. But they keep trying. When \none police officer is killed, someone else takes their place. When an \narmy person is killed, someone else joins the army. When a judge is \nassassinated, somebody else comes forward to be a judge.\n  They are trying. And I do believe, if we will continue the strategy \nemployed by General Petraeus, even though political reconciliation is \nlagging behind security, it will not be much longer until the \npoliticians in Baghdad embrace the hard decisions necessary to bring \nreconciliation to their country. And I believe that for a couple of \nreasons. No. 1, their people want it; and, No. 2, they have the \nopportunity now, through better security, to bring it about.\n  So to my good friend, Senator Levin, I understand exactly his \nconcern. It is a judgment call. I think when you are dealing with \nextremists, when you are dealing with the Iranian President, the last \nthing in the world you do is to show weakness. You make sure they \nunderstand, al-Qaida and Iran, and any other extremist group, that \nAmerica is going to do what is necessary to defend her vital interests \nand that we are going to stand with forces in moderation.\n  My biggest fear, if we begin to withdraw now and redeploy to the old \nmission, is that all of those who have risked their lives to help us \nwill surely meet the fate of that 5-year-old boy. And that is not in \nour national interest. That is not the right thing to do. We will come \nhome. But as Senator McCain says, we need to come home with honor. \nEqually important, we need to come home with a more secure America.\n  I think we are on the road to bringing about withdrawal with honor \nand a more secure America by having a more stable Iraq. The worst thing \nto do now is to go back to a strategy that has failed when the one that \nwe have in place is beginning to work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 1495\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, \nSeptember 24, at 3 p.m., the Senate turn to the consideration of the \nconference report on the water resources bill, H.R. 1495; that the time \nuntil 5:45 p.m. be divided for debate as follows: 30 minutes under \nSenator Feingold's control, with the remainder of the time under the \ncontrol of the two leaders or their designees; and that at 5:45 p.m. \nthe Senate, without any intervening action or debate, vote on passage \nof the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the war in \nIraq, and in particular to speak about an amendment that we will be \nvoting on tomorrow, the Reed-Levin amendment.\n  I want to note, first of all, that this amendment has been offered \nbefore. We voted on similar amendments over the course of this year, \nand I am glad we are voting on it again because I think the American \npeople, time and again, have told us it is time, at long last, to \nchange the course in Iraq and to focus on a new policy.\n  Sometimes we talk about this amendment and we fail to mention \nsomething about the sponsors of this amendment. We are talking about \ntwo Members of the Senate with broad experience in this body, \ntremendous years of public service, but also a lot of years on the \nArmed Services Committee and other committees that have informed their \njudgment. The two Members of the Senate, Jack Reed and Carl Levin, I am \nspeaking about, have both been to Iraq innumerable times, learning \nabout what is happening there and focused in a real way on helping us \nget this policy right.\n  Our troops have done everything we asked of them, time and again. \nEvery mission, every battle, they have done their job. It is about time \nthe Congress of the United States and the President of the United \nStates do our job to change the course in Iraq and to focus on a new \npolicy.\n  Fortunately, this amendment, I think, has tremendous support in the \nSenate. We have already seen this before. Much more than a majority of \nSenators will vote for this amendment. I hope we can get it to 60 votes \nat long last.\n  Let's talk about it for a moment. This is a very basic amendment, \nwhich fundamentally says we have to change the course in Iraq; we have \nto begin to redeploy our combat forces so the Iraqi forces can \ntakeover, ultimately. But it also focuses in a real way on \ntransitioning this mission. Our mission should be about a couple of \nthings our soldiers have already proven time and again that they do \nvery well. The mission should be transitioned to a much more focused \nmission: First of all, to hunt down and kill terrorists in Iraq. That \nis fundamental to our mission. Our mission has to include training of \nthe Iraqi security forces. We see in report after report, especially at \nthe level 1 of readiness, the ability for the Iraqi forces to \nindependently, without help from American forces, take over the fight \nagainst the enemy. We have to make sure that training moves forward \nmuch more aggressively and in a much more focused way than we have seen \nalready. But that is not happening. So we need to train the Iraqi \nsecurity forces.\n  Finally, we have to make sure we protect our troops and their \ninfrastructure and also the civilian personnel we have in Iraq. We have \nseen all those personnel doing a great job as well--from the State \nDepartment and other parts of our Government. But if we can focus, as \nwe should, on a redeployment of our combat forces and focus on the \nterrorists, focus on training, and focus on diplomacy--which I will \ntalk about at length a few minutes later--that has to be the mission we \nshould focus on in Iraq.\n  That is what Reed-Levin does, among other things. It focuses at long \nlast on a mission that we know our troops can continue to achieve. But \nalso it focuses in a real way on transitioning this mission and \nfocusing on a redeployment of our forces, our combat forces.\n  I think some of what has formed the way I vote and the way lot of us \nvote is our time in Iraq. I spent a day and a half in Iraq. Some people \ncan say: What can you learn in a day and a half? You can learn a lot \nabout Iraq in that short amount of time. I learned, not just in the \nmeetings we had but a good part of our time in Iraq--Senator Durbin and \nI were there in the early part of August--a good part of our time was \noutside the Green Zone. You get a sense, a fleeting sense, a glimpse, \nbut you get a sense of the insecurity of Baghdad when you are outside \nof that Green Zone.\n  I have heard a lot of discussion about things that have been \nhappening in Anbar. Frankly, our marines have done a great job there \nand our troops have done a great job in Baghdad. But Baghdad is a lot \nmore complicated than Anbar, and we should recognize that. It is a lot \nmore difficult assignment going forward.\n  What do we see in Baghdad? Every time you go outside the Green Zone \nyou travel in a convoy. We were given great protection, not only by \nthose who were traveling with us but also by people from the State \nDepartment and others. We appreciated that. But you wear body armor \nwherever you go--inside the vehicle, outside the vehicle. You wear a \ncombat helmet, a Kevlar helmet. You are surrounded by people with \nweapons to protect you. So you get a sense of the insecurity there.\n  Then, when we were traveling to the President's house our second day \nthere, almost the entire trip to President Talabani's house where he \nresides was in a military convoy with helicopters flying overhead to \nprotect us. When I got on a Blackhawk helicopter to go from an airport \nto a patrol base outside the city of Baghdad where our forces are doing \na great job against al-Qaida, what do we have to do? We get into a \nBlackhawk helicopter and fly at a very high rate of speed over the \nrooftops to avoid being attacked. We saw in the last couple of weeks \nwhat happened to a C-130, with distinguished Members of the Senate, \nsome of them here on the floor today, being fired upon by the enemy.\n  You see the insecurity all around you. You see the insecurity when we \nwere meeting at the patrol base and a missile landed and we heard the \nexplosion 400 yards from us.\n  What I am trying to convey is the sense we had of the insecurity of \nBaghdad. It is a real presence there, that feeling of insecurity. It is \na fact. We should recognize this mission is very\n\n[[Page S11819]]\n\ndifficult for our troops. They have met every assignment.\n  What we have to do is give our troops a policy and a strategy which \nmatches their valor. We don't have that right now. The President should \nstart acting more like a Commander in Chief instead of someone who is \nreading talking points for his side of the argument. When I was \nlistening to the President the other night, unfortunately, what he \nconveyed to me was a sense that he was selling a message instead of \nleading. I don't think he has led in a way that has brought this \nCongress together, frankly. It is about time we had a mission and a \nstrategy that matched the brilliance and the valor of our troops.\n  When I was in Iraq, we would hear these phrases from the Iraqi \nleaders: We need more time. You need to be patient in America. I heard \nthis phrase I have never heard before, we need ``strategic patience.'' \nI still don't know what that means, but the Iraqi political leaders \nwere telling us that over and over again. I have to say, on behalf of \nthe people of Pennsylvania and on behalf of the 175 families who lost \nsomeone in Iraq already, I have to say to these Iraqi leaders: We have \nshown strategic patience, whatever that means. We have shown patience \nand forbearance and our troops and their families have sacrificed over \nand over again. It is about time for you, Mr. or Mrs. Iraqi Leader, to \nget your act together and take overt responsibility of taking on this \nenemy for the next generation, taking the corruption out of your police \nforce, and governing your country so you can have a government of \nnational unity.\n\n  But all they ask for is patience. Whenever the Iraqi political \nleaders ask for patience, the one who pays most of the price is not \nanybody in Congress. It isn't anybody in the White House. The people \nwho pay the price are the troops and their families--over and over \nagain. We are reaching the end of our patience, I think I would say and \nhave said to those Iraqi leaders.\n  Finally--I don't wish to spend too much time on our trip--one of the \nmost poignant parts of our trip, and it has connection and relevance to \nwhat we voted on today and yesterday and will tomorrow, is the sense \nyou get from our troops. You know the bravery of those troops--troops \nfrom Pennsylvania, from small towns in Bradford County, way up in \nnortheastern Pennsylvania, troops from the inner city of Philadelphia, \nwho were in the same mission, sitting at the same table to have what \ngoes for lunch over there--very simple food that they have to eat every \nday. But what I got from our troops was a real sense of commitment, a \nreal sense of focus on their mission. We have to do everything we can \nto make sure they have the resources they need.\n  But a lot of our troops are being asked to referee a civil war. No \nAmerican fighting men or woman has ever been asked to referee someone \nelse's civil war. We have asked them to do that. I heard language in \nthis Chamber, and we heard it from the President--he talks about \nvictory, victory, victory. He uses phrases such as that and some people \nhere have used those phrases.\n  Do you know what. I think the more accurate phrase and the more \ndescriptive, to describe what is happening there, is what Ambassador \nCrocker said to me in Baghdad. I challenged him and General Petraeus, \nand they both said: No, that is not the right language. What the \nmission has to be is to stabilize that Government, not to have some \nHollywood victory that sets our troops up for something not achievable. \nOur troops have done their job. It is about time we have the right \npolicy and the right language that matches the valor of our troops.\n  We see what these troops and their families have sacrificed, and we \nsee some of the horror of battle. We went into the combat support \nhospital, right in the middle of Baghdad. You see in that hospital \ndoctors and nurses, enlisted men and women who are doing that job 24 \nhours a day under the most difficult circumstances. In one case, taking \ncare of a little child, a girl who had been left in the streets of \nBaghdad when her parents were killed. These doctors and nurses were \nministering to her, just like they minister to the troops who come in \nfrom the battlefield.\n  We think of a lot of lessons from history. We remember what Abraham \nLincoln said when he was talking about the Civil War. He talked about \nwhat happens to those who die or are wounded in battle--especially \nthose who die. He talked, at the time, about making sure we are doing \neverything possible to remember and to help the families of those who \nperished. As Abraham Lincoln said: `` . . . to help him who has borne \nthe battle, and his widow and his orphan.''\n  When we debate on this floor about this policy, debate about veterans \nhealth care, we are trying to do our best to enact policy that is \nsupportive of those troops who have perished in battle and those \nfamilies.\n  We have to make sure we do everything possible to get this policy \nright. I believe a giant step forward to doing that would be to support \nthe Reed-Levin amendment and to support other measures that help us \nchange our course. We lost an opportunity yesterday when we didn't get \nto 60 votes on the Webb amendment. That was a bad day in the Senate. \nBut we have to keep trying, and we will try again tomorrow on this \nvote.\n  I wish to conclude with some remarks about an amendment I have \noffered along with Senator Murkowski, an amendment which focuses on \nsomething we all talk about a lot but, frankly, the administration has \nnot done nearly enough about, and that is diplomacy. This amendment is \na sense-of-the-Senate amendment expressing a very simple notion that it \nis time we implement a diplomatic surge that matches any military \nsurge. It sends a crystal-clear message to the White House: The time \nfor sustained regional diplomacy is now, and it deserves the highest \npriority of the President, President Bush, and the Secretary of State, \nSecretary Rice.\n  We all recognize in hindsight how diplomacy was critically missing \nfrom the strategic planning of the United States in the runup to this \nwar. We all know that now. That is almost not even debated anymore. Yet \nwe have paid little heed to diplomacy in the frustrating years since \nour initial invasion. The United States continues to treat Iraq as some \nkind of isolated box, failing to recognize the complex linkages between \nthe various sectarian groups inside Iraq and their patrons and \nsupporters in the broader Middle East region. It is time we made Iraq \nless America's problem and more a responsibility for its regional \nneighbors and the international community.\n  Let me highlight quickly the elements of this amendment, very \nspecific steps. First of all, the United States should implement a \ncomprehensive diplomatic offensive. It has not been done yet. No. 2, \nthe United States should bring together Iraq's neighbors through a \nregional conference or other mechanism. That has not been done yet--\npart of it has, but it has not been done as it should. No. 3 definitely \nhas not been done, especially when it pertains to the President: The \nPresident and the Secretary of State should invest their personal time \nand energy in these diplomatic efforts. This cannot be done by proxy or \nsurrogate. They have to be engaged fully. In addition to that, the \nPresident, I believe, and Senator Murkowski believes, should appoint a \nhigh-level Presidential envoy to the region. The U.S. Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations should seek the appointment of an international mediator \nin Iraq to engage the political, religious, ethnic, and tribal leaders \nin Iraq.\n  Finally, the United States should more directly press Iraq's \nneighbors to open fully operating embassies in Baghdad.\n  I will conclude with that. There is so much that has to be done on \ndiplomacy and there is so much more we have to do. We have to keep \ndebating this issue, keep pushing forward to achieve a better policy.\n  I believe two parts of that are the enactment of the Reed-Levin \namendment, first of all, and in addition to that the amendment that I \nand Senator Murkowski have worked together on, to have a real \ndiplomatic surge in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators now \nbe recognized in the following order: Senator Lieberman, Senator Smith, \nSenator Kyl.\n\n[[Page S11820]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the amendment \nintroduced by Senators Levin and Reed, my friends. I actually say that \nwith full meaning. I have great respect for the Senators from Michigan \nand Rhode Island. I even like them. But in this case, I am in deep \ndisagreement about the amendment they have offered.\n  This is the most recent iteration of a series of amendments Senators \nLevin and Reed have put in. It changes slightly from earlier versions, \nbut the strategy is essentially the same, and in doing so, it ignores, \nI say respectfully, all the changes that have occurred in Iraq on the \nground in the months that have gone by since the first Levin-Reed \namendment was introduced. It also ignores the clearly stated counsel of \nthe National Intelligence Estimate, of the head of the independent \nCommission to evaluate Iraqi security forces, GEN Jim Jones, and it \nignores much of the testimony General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, \nwho live on the ground, gave to Congress and the American people last \nweek.\n  I rise to oppose it because I think it does not reflect the successes \nwe have had, and if it ever passed, it would take us from this strategy \nwhich is bringing success to a strategy which would bring us to \nfailure. It orders a change of a strategy that is working and puts us \non a course to a strategy that I believe will fail disastrously. But at \nleast everyone would have to acknowledge that we do not know how it \nwill work as compared to the Petraeus strategy that is now working.\n  This amendment, as has been said, would first order the beginning of \na reduction of U.S. forces in Iraq not later than 90 days from its \nenactment. Well, the interesting thing to say is that General Petraeus \nand President Bush announced last week that a withdrawal of American \nforces will begin this month. It will reach over 5,000 by the end of \nthis year, by Christmastime. Quite remarkable. Unexpected. Not \npredicted. But why is it happening? It is happening because the surge \nstrategy, combined with the improvement in the performance of the Iraqi \nsecurity forces, has allowed our commander on the ground to recommend \nto the Commander in Chief, who has accepted the recommendation, that we \ncan reduce some of our troop presence in Iraq without compromising the \nmission and the security of Iraq.\n  But General Petraeus said very clearly that he is not for \ncongressionally-mandated deadlines, including this one; that as a \ngeneral principle of war, not just to support his own position, he \nfeels--and I could not agree with him more--that withdrawals of \nAmerican troops in battle ought to be made on the basis of what is \nhappening on the battlefield and at the recommendation of the \ncommanders on the battlefield.\n  Then the Levin-Reed amendment represents essentially a transition of \nU.S. forces to a limited presence, undefined number, to carry out the \nfollowing missions: to protect the U.S. and coalition personnel and \ninfrastructure, training, equipping, providing logistical support to \nthe Iraqi security forces, and engaging in targeted counterterrorism \noperations against al-Qaida, al-Qaida affiliated groups, and other \ninternational terrorist organizations.\n  As I will make clear in a moment, I am particularly troubled that \nthat does not include the groups Iran is training, equipping, and then \nsending back into Iraq which have killed hundreds of American soldiers \nand thousands of Iraqi soldiers and civilians.\n  In ordering a withdrawal within 90 days, in ordering a transition \nfrom a strategy that is working to a strategy that I believe will fail, \nas I said at the outset, this amendment ignores the best evidence and \njudgment we have based on what is happening on the ground.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate commented quite clearly about what \nwould happen if we limited the mission our solders in Iraq were allowed \nto undertake prematurely. It warned us in no uncertain terms that:\n\n       Changing the mission of coalition forces from a primarily \n     counterinsurgency and stabilization role [which is the \n     current Petraeus strategy] to a primary combat support role \n     for Iraqi forces and counterterrorism operations [which is \n     the strategy that would be imposed by this amendment] would \n     erode the security gains achieved so far.\n\n  Not ``might'' but ``would'' erode the security gains achieved thus \nfar.\n  General Jones made very clear in testimony he gave just 2 weeks ago \nthat:\n\n       Deadlines can work against us. I think a deadline of this \n     magnitude would be against our national interests.\n\n  General Petraeus warned us last week that:\n\n       We need to ensure that we do not surrender a gain for which \n     we fought very, very hard by being locked into a timetable.\n\n  Likewise, we heard from General Petraeus, who bluntly told us:\n\n       While one may argue that the best way to speed the process \n     in Iraq is to change the mission from one that emphasizes \n     population security, counterterrorism and transition, to one \n     that is strictly focused on transition and \n     counterterrorism, making that change now would, in our \n     view, be premature.\n\n  That is diplomatic language chosen by a military man speaking to \nCongress last week: ``would be premature.''\n  Look, as our mission in Iraq succeeds and hopefully continues to \nsucceed as it is now both in terms of stabilizing the country, reducing \nvictims of sectarian violence, chasing al-Qaida, and, most \nsignificantly, improving the capacity of the Iraqi security forces, we \nwill transition our mission because the Iraqis and the environment will \nallow us to do that, and there will be transition to something, I would \nguess, quite like the goal of this amendment. But if you force this by \ncongressional action before the commanders on the ground tell us it can \nbe safely implemented, it will be more than General Petraeus's \ndiplomatic term, ``premature,'' and probably more than the NIE's direct \nterm, ``would erode the security gains achieved so far.'' I think it \nwould begin to unwind Iraq and lead to a victory for al-Qaida and \nIranian-backed terrorists. I think it is particularly unjustified for \nCongress to take up this amendment now, the moment we are seeing \nevidence of real progress in Iraq.\n  I know some of the supporters of the amendment suggest that by \nwithdrawing forces, we would force the Iraqi Government to achieve the \npolitical progress we all want. There is no military solution, only a \npolitical solution that will ultimately end this. That is true. But let \nme say this: That misses one powerful reality in Iraq today. We are now \nnot just fighting to give Iraqis the stability to reach political \nreconciliation and the ability to self-govern, we are fighting al-Qaida \nand Iranian-backed terrorists. That requires a military solution. So to \nsay the goal here is just to make sure the Iraqi leadership reaches \nsome accommodations with one another--that is not the end of it. You \ncan have that happen, and if we pulled out prematurely, al-Qaida and \nIran could blow the whole thing apart, and it would be a devastating \nloss for Iraq, for the region, and for the security of the people of \nthe United States.\n  But listen to what Ambassador Crocker said about this idea to \nCongress last week:\n\n       An approach that says we are going to start pulling troops \n     out regardless of the objective conditions on the ground and \n     what might happen in consequence of that could actually push \n     the Iraqis in the wrong direction, to make them less likely \n     to compromise, rather than more likely. It would make them \n     far more focused on building the walls, stacking the \n     ammunition, and getting ready for a big nasty fight without \n     us around, than it would push them toward compromise and \n     accommodation with the people who would be on the other side \n     of that fight.\n\n  That is Ambassador Crocker, who lives with those people every day, \nthe leaders, the political leaders of Iraq, and he is saying: Watch \nout, a premature withdrawal by the U.S. forces would do exactly the \nopposite. It would not encourage the Iraqis to political \nreconciliation; it would basically lead them to hunker down for a civil \nwar they fear would be following.\n  You know what, from this distance, although I have been there six or \nseven times now, it seems like common sense and human nature that if we \npull out too soon, they are not going to wake up and suddenly make \ndifficult political agreements; they are going to get ready for civil \nwar. This amendment is based on a premise that disregards exactly what \nour Ambassador, a nonpolitical career person, an expert on the Middle \nEast, is telling us would happen.\n  I would also point out, as I mentioned briefly at the beginning, that\n\n[[Page S11821]]\n\nthe amendment, I fear, would leave our troops unable, even in their \nreduced mission role, to respond to and go after Iranian operatives and \nIranian-backed militias, the so-called special groups that are in the \nmidst of fighting a vicious proxy war against American troops and \nIraqis in Iraq.\n  General Petraeus testified last week that:\n\n       These elements have assassinated and kidnapped Iraqi \n     governmental leaders, killed and wounded our soldiers with \n     advanced explosive devices provided by Iran, and \n     indiscriminately rocketed civilians in the international zone \n     and elsewhere.\n\n  So even in the reduced mission, it does provide for allowing our \ntroops to go after al-Qaida but not the Iranian-backed operatives. And \nas Senator McCain I think quite compellingly pointed out on the floor \nearlier today, what are our troops supposed to do when they see someone \nwalking along with an IED? Go up to them and say: Excuse me, sir, are \nyou a member of a sectarian militia or are you al-Qaida? If you are \nsectarian militia, go ahead. If you are al-Qaida, I am sorry, I am \ngoing to have to capture you.\n  That is not going to work.\n  I am sure my colleagues, including the sponsors of this amendment, \nagree that the United States has a vital national interest in \npreventing the dominance of Iraq by the fanatical anti-American regime \nin Tehran, and yet this amendment would give our forces, as I read it, \nno authority to deal with that critical mission after the transition \nperiod is over.\n  I just want to say that at the end of last year, after too many \nmonths, too many months of a strategy that was not working in Iraq, \nPresident Bush, as the Commander in Chief, finally said: I have to \nchange the strategy. He called in a lot of people to ask how should he \nchange it in response to the reality on the ground, which is that what \nwe were doing was not working, was not succeeding. He met General \nPetraeus, a man who had been in Iraq before, had disagreed with the \nprevailing strategy, and instead of being honored, he was sent out to \nFort Leavenworth, where he did some great work. It is a great place. \nBut he really should have been raised up to continue the fight in Iraq. \nPresident Bush brought him back to Iraq, accepted his ideas for a new \nstrategy of counterinsurgency, of stabilizing Iraq. He gave him the \n30,000-plus troops, and it has worked. Remarkable.\n  We all know Iraq has not reached the goals we want it to reach, but \nassassinations are down, deaths from sectarian violence are down. \nAmerican and Iraqi forces are in control of most of Baghdad now, not \nthe militias.\n  Most significantly, al-Qaida is on the run. I heard bin Laden and \nZawahiri put out other tapes today. I wonder whether these tapes are a \nsign not of confidence but of insecurity by al-Qaida's leaders. I am \nbeginning to wonder whether they are worried about the fact that they \nare essentially being chased out of an Arab country, Iraq, particularly \npainful for them, chased out of an enormous Sunni Arab province, \nbecause they are all Sunni Muslims, and that they are on the verge of \nwhat could be a humiliating defeat, if we continue to move this \nstrategy forward against them. As we all know in our own lives, \nsometimes the people who bark the loudest are the ones who are the most \ninsecure. I am beginning to wonder whether bin Laden and Zawahiri, who \nmasterminded the attack against us on 9/11, are now, on what has become \nthe central battlefield of the war with Islamist extremism, al-Qaida, \nwhether they are badly losing that war.\n  What I am saying is, after a long time President Bush looked at the \nfacts, changed the strategy, and the new strategy is working. This \namendment, respectfully to its sponsors, does not regard the facts, \ndoes not look at the facts, does not accept the changes that have \noccurred in our strategy and the success it is bringing and basically \ncontinues as if nothing had changed. In doing so, if adopted, it would \ndo a disservice to our forces in Iraq who are succeeding, to the cause \nof freedom in Iraq and throughout the Muslim world, and to the cause of \nsecurity of every American threatened by al-Qaida who we know is \nworking, plotting, and intends to strike us again, and the fanatics \nwho, unfortunately, control the Government of a great country, Iran, \nwho lead thousands and tens of thousands on any occasion they can in \nchants to ``death to America.'' That is what is on the line. That is \nwhat would be jeopardized if this amendment were passed. That is why I \nrespectfully ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Levin-Reed \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Before Senator Kyl is recognized, before Senator Smith is \nrecognized, under the current UC, we would then go to Senator Kyl. I \nask unanimous consent that after Senator Kyl, Senator Kennedy be \nrecognized on this side of the issue and that after Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Bill Nelson be recognized as the next speaker in support of the \nLevin amendment. If there is a speaker in opposition after Senator \nKennedy, that Senator would then come immediately after Senator Kennedy \nand before Senator Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a speaker at \nthat point before Senator Nelson. But if Senator Lott wishes to speak, \nI will yield to him.\n  Mr. LEVIN. With that amendment, I offer that UC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today as the lead Republican on the \nLevin-Reed amendment. I am proud to cosponsor this amendment because it \ncalls for what I have been stating all year. It sets up a timetable--a \ntimetable we all know is inevitable--to draw down our troops. Last week \nGeneral Petraeus's testimony highlighted what I consider to be the \nremaining primary function of American troops in Iraq: to defeat al-\nQaida, our mortal enemy. The organization which attacked us on 9/11 is \nbeing hounded from its refuge in Anbar, fleeing from a lethal mix of \nAmerican forces and their own destructive ideology. American troops \nshould by all means continue this assault on al-Qaida. But Anbar \nProvince is not all of Iraq. In past years supporters of the war have \npointed to areas other than Anbar, such as the Shia and Kurdish \nprovinces, to show that things are not going as badly as they were in \nFallujah and Ramadi. Today they point to Anbar to show that things are \nnot going as badly as the violence in Baghdad.\n  I have visited Iraq numerous times; and wherever I am with our \ntroops, I am inspired by them. I have also become increasingly \nconscious of the fact that I am in the eye of the hurricane. Relative \npeace wherever our troops are, but outside of us are swirling the winds \nof hatred and violence such of which the American people can scarcely \nimagine.\n  This amendment explicitly defines the role of the U.S. military in \nIraq as threefold. An appropriate amount of troops will remain to \nprotect our diplomats, our military installations, and our \ninfrastructure. We will continue to train, equip, and provide \nlogistical and intelligence support to Iraqi security forces, sharing \nintelligence with them. Thirdly, and most importantly, we will be there \nto turn over every rock, every crevice, and seek out every al-Qaida \nkiller who wishes to harm Americans.\n  As I have spoken out pleading for a new course in Iraq, there has \nbeen a great cacophony of noise about how to go forward. Some of my \ncolleagues have wanted to cut off funding. In fact, we voted that plan \ndown resoundingly. Such a course, in my view, would be more than \ndishonorable; it would be dangerous. Some, on the other hand, say: \nLet's stay the course. I find that troubling as well. What ``stay the \ncourse'' means is, we will continue to spend $12 billion a month. We \nwill lose roughly three American soldiers a day, some of them \nOregonians. In addition, there will be countless traumatized, wounded, \nand maimed for life, for which I cannot find a number.\n\n  Underpinning the current course and the argument of many of my \ncolleagues is the hope, the predicate, that at the end of the road \nthere will be an Iraqi Government that will govern effectively and \ndemocratically. I believe President Bush's formulation that we will \nstand down when they can stand up has it backwards. I have come to the \nreluctant conclusion that based on my numerous trips to Iraq, they will\n\n[[Page S11822]]\n\nnot stand up politically until we begin standing down militarily. Like \nmany of my colleagues, I have been to Iraq repeatedly. To be with the \ntroops, again, is to be inspired, to be humbled in their presence \nbecause of the remarkable work they are doing and the cause for which \nthey are fighting. As inspiring as that is, it is equally depressing to \nmeet with Iraqi political leaders, democratically elected, who we think \nought to be focused on reconciliation. What I have found is they are \nfocused on revenge.\n  In Iraq there is ancient sectarian strife which has produced a low-\ngrade civil war, a war which is not ours to win and not one we can win. \nIt is theirs to win. We won the first war--Saddam was overthrown. \nIraqis must now win the peace. Civil wars end in one of two ways: One \nside wins and the other loses, or they fight it out until they figure \nit out. My belief is that we delay the day for them figuring it out \nwith our current posture.\n  I would love to be proven wrong. I pray President Bush is right. But \nI believe it is our obligation to have this debate to help change the \ncourse in the policy of the United States Government, and more \nimportantly, to help change also the course in the policy of the Iraqi \nGovernment. I intend to use all my leverage as a Senator to change that \ncourse in Iraq, to get their Government to govern.\n  My fear is that what our presence and current posture are doing is \nsimply keeping their civil war at a low-grade level, a no-win situation \nfor American troops in Iraq. There is no good option for how we come \nhome, but it does seem to me this amendment best expresses my own \nconclusions. That is why I cosponsored the amendment, to recognize al-\nQaida as our mortal foe. We must take them on wherever we can, even now \nin Iraq, but ultimately we have to get capable and effective Iraqi \npolitical leaders, too, to do the most basic kinds of governing: \ndebaathification, setting up of local elections, allowing the processes \nof democracy to work, establishing a rule of law that gives people \nconfidence, spending their oil revenue money for the restructuring and \nthe rebuilding of their own country. We cannot want functioning \ndemocracy for Iraqis more than they want it for themselves. What they \nseem bent on now is ethnic cleansing of their neighborhoods and \nreligious division. Ultimately, those are their decisions, not ours. As \nlong as we say--we will take the bullet, we will take it first--they \nwill let us.\n  The Reed-Levin amendment provides a different way forward with a \nresponsible division of labor. Let the Iraqi forces we have trained and \nequipped handle their security in Baghdad and in other communities. Let \nus help them and ourselves by taking on al-Qaida as we find it in Iraq.\n  This should not be a Republican-Democratic debate. I do not want to \nsling mud around this Chamber and point fingers at which parties and \nwhich voters and which Government branch got us where we are. That \nshould not be the focus of our discussion today. But for the sake of \nthe American people, we should be discussing the way forward, a way \nthat includes a United States victory over al-Qaida. Therefore, I rise \nas a Republican from Oregon to support the amendment. I believe this \nlegislation strikes the right balance between the same old stay the \ncourse policy and a panicked flight to the exit.\n  Do we have moral and strategic interests in Iraq? Of course, we do. \nWill we have those interests in the future? Of course, we will. Should \nwe ignore those interests? Of course not. This language addresses those \nconcerns, the language of the Reed-Levin amendment. I believe this \nlegislation is the best, most effective, most responsible way forward.\n  I urge the amendment's adoption and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto be the next Democrat to speak after the Chair, who is already in \nline in the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Arizona is to \nbe recognized next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in view of the fact that there are a series \nof other speakers who wish to address this matter, I am going to ask \nunanimous consent to put an article in the Record to respond to one of \nthe arguments that has been made, and then I will briefly respond to \nthe others.\n  To the point that this is a civil war in Iraq and that is the \njustification for American forces being withdrawn, I ask unanimous \nconsent that an article by Frederick Kagan entitled ``Al Qaeda in \nIraq,'' dated September 10 and appearing in the Weekly Standard, be \nprinted in the Record after my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Fred Kagan is a respected expert, a resident scholar at the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute. The point he makes in this erudite \narticle is that the primary problem for our forces in Iraq is al-Qaida \nin Iraq. It is the Iraq component of al-Qaida, that either we are \nfighting the al-Qaida forces directly--about 90 percent of whom are \nIraqis, though the leadership significantly primarily comes from other \nplaces--Egypt, Jordan, and so on--or we are fighting to maintain peace \nbetween people whom al-Qaida in Iraq have instigated a conflict with, \nas they did when they bombed the Golden Mosque in Samarra, and that our \nprimary effort, therefore, is in defeating al-Qaida in Iraq.\n\n  The reason I bring that point up here is also to go to the heart of \none of the points of the Levin-Reed amendment which is, we need to \nchange our mission. Part of it is to change the mission to deal \nprimarily with the counterterrorism operations against al-Qaida and al-\nQaida affiliated groups. That would be certainly al-Qaida in Iraq and \nother international terrorist organizations. That is going to be one of \nthe three new missions in addition to protecting U.S. and coalition \nforces and infrastructure and training and equipping the Iraqis.\n  All three of those are part of our mission today. It is simply not \nthe case that we can separate our mission today from this mission in \nany meaningful way. As General Petraeus testified when he was asked \nabout a new mission, he said counterterrorism requires not just the \nspecial operations forces--a relatively small force that would be left \nbehind under the proposal that is pending before us here--but it \nrequires other forces as well, including the kind of combat operations \nwe engage in today, our general conventional forces, along with \nintelligence, reconnaissance, surveillance, and all of the other \nforces, which also include logistical support, that are currently used \nin the operations against al-Qaida and the other terrorists who are \nthere.\n  So it is simply a mistake in concept here that somehow we are \nperforming a different mission today than would be performed in the \nfuture, that that is a counterterrorism mission and it can be performed \nwith different and less troops. General Petraeus has said that is \nsimply not true.\n  If you stop and think about it for a moment, you have heard reports \nof the way some of these operations are conducted. You get good \nintelligence from a predator aircraft or a human source or someone you \nhave an Iraqi, al-Qaida, or other terrorist group that is going to be \nplanting an IED in a location or they are making explosives in a \nlocation, and you have an F-16 that has been up in the air for an hour \nor two, and they get this information, and they relay it to the F-16, \nand they say: Go to these coordinates and drop a bomb on those \ncoordinates, and he does that.\n  Now, it is not some special forces thing that deals with al-Qaida, in \nother words, as a counterterrorism type of war that is totally \ndifferent than anything else. You use many of the same kinds of \npersonnel and tactics and equipment you use in conventional warfare. \nThat is the point General Petraeus was trying to make. It is an \nartificial distinction to say there is going to be a new and different \nmission under the Levin-Reed proposal than exists today and it can be \ndone with a much smaller and different kind of force. General Petraeus \nsays: It is simply not so. That is the primary reason\n\n[[Page S11823]]\n\nI have trouble with this proposal that is pending. I hope my colleagues \nwill defeat it.\n  I did want to also make this point in the debate: We sometimes get so \nwrapped up in discussing what we think that we do not stop and think \nabout the people who are actually doing the fighting there. I have in \nmind both our troops and the very fine officers who lead the troops. We \nhave all visited them in Iraq. We have visited those who have been \nwounded, and we grieve with the families of those who have been lost. \nThese are America's finest, and they are fighting the worst of the \nworst. They are fighting killers who prey on innocent people, have no \nconscience in killing anyone who is necessary to suit their needs.\n  This is a brutal war against a brutal enemy. We are asking some of \nour finest young men and women to go into harm's way to perform this \nmission. They want to know what they have done so far--the gains they \nhave produced, as General Petraeus called them--will not have been won \nin vain, that those gains can be helped.\n  What General Petraeus said in his testimony--I am going to summarize \nthese quick four points--``the military objectives of the surge are, in \nlarge measure, being met,'' ``that Coalition and Iraqi forces have \ndealt significant blows to al-Qaeda-Iraq''--incidentally, it is a point \nFrederick Kagan makes in some detail in this article I am having \nprinted in the Record--third, ``Iraqi elements have been standing and \nfighting and sustaining tough losses, and they have taken the lead in \noperations in many areas,'' and, finally--this is the point I am \nleading up to--``we will be able to reduce our forces to the pre-surge \nlevel of brigade combat teams by next summer without jeopardizing the \nsecurity gains that we have fought so hard to achieve.''\n  That is the key, and that is what the President said should unite us. \nWe would all like to bring our troops home, as many as soon as \npossible. The more success we have, the better we are able to do that. \nBut we do not want to do it if it means we lose what we have fought so \nhard to gain. I think almost all of us can agree with that proposition. \nBut that is why I reached the conclusion that the particular amendment \nthat has been proposed here would be counterproductive.\n  Fortunately, polls of the American people are beginning to show they \nsupport the Petraeus recommendations. In fact, I was told of a new Pew \npoll within the last few days that had the American people supporting \nthe Petraeus recommended troop reductions by the number 57 to 28. That \nis an astounding change from American public opinion of a few months \nago.\n  So the American public supports what our troops are accomplishing \nnow. To try to find some way to politically triangulate between an \nimmediate withdrawal and following the Petraeus recommendations, which \nis essentially what I gather the amendment before us would attempt to \ndo, is to try to impose an artificial political construct in a very \ndangerous and very complex environment. There is an old saying that for \nevery complex problem there is a simple and wrong solution. I think \nthat is what we have here. We have a very complex situation, a very \nbrutal enemy, and an attempt to try to triangulate it in order to get a \ncertain number of votes in the Senate, to suggest that we can change \nthe mission with a different mix of force than we have, contrary to \nGeneral Petraeus's testimony, I think would be a big mistake.\n  So I urge my colleagues to take these considerations into account \nwhen they cast their vote and, in particular, again, go back to what \nGeneral Petraeus said. There was a lot of wisdom in his testimony. I \nthink all of us here recognize General Petraeus, General Odierno, and \nall of the other fine officers who are in Iraq have given us a path to \nachieve success in Iraq. The sooner that success can be consolidated, \nthe sooner our troops can come home.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Weekly Standard, Sept. 10, 2007]\n\n       Al Qaeda in Iraq--How To Understand It. How To Defeat It.\n\n                        (By Frederick W. Kagan)\n\n       Al Qaeda In Iraq is part of the global al Qaeda movement. \n     AQI, as the U.S. military calls it, is around 90 percent \n     Iraqi. Foreign fighters, however, predominate in the \n     leadership and among the suicide bombers, of whom they \n     comprise up to 90 percent, U.S. commanders say. The leader of \n     AQI is Abu Ayyub al-Masri, an Egyptian. His predecessor, Abu \n     Musab al Zarqawi, was a Jordanian.\n       Because the members of AQI are overwhelmingly Iraqis--often \n     thugs and misfits recruited or dragooned into the \n     organization (along with some clerics and more educated \n     leaders)--it is argued that AQI is not really part of the \n     global al Qaeda movement. Therefore, it is said, the war in \n     Iraq is not part of the global war on terror: The ``real'' al \n     Qaeda--Osama bin Laden's band, off in its safe havens in the \n     Pakistani tribal areas of Waziristan and Baluchistan--is the \n     group to fight. Furthermore, argue critics of this \n     persuasion, we should be doing this fighting through precise, \n     intelligence-driven airstrikes or Special Forces attacks on \n     key leaders, not the deployment of large conventional forces, \n     which only stirs resentment in Muslim countries and creates \n     more terrorists.\n       Over the past four years, the war in Iraq has provided \n     abundant evidence to dispute these assertions.\n\n\n                           AL QAEDA WORLDWIDE\n\n       Al Qaeda is an organization pursuing an ideology. Both the \n     organization and the ideology must be defeated. Just as, in \n     the Cold War, the contest between the United States and its \n     allies and the Soviet Union and its captive nations was the \n     real-world manifestation of an ideological struggle, so \n     today, the global war on terror is a real-world contest \n     between the United States and its allies and al Qaeda and its \n     enablers. We can hope to defeat the ideology only by \n     defeating its champion, al Qaeda.\n       Al Qaeda's ideology is the lineal descendant of a school of \n     thought articulated most compellingly by the Egyptian \n     revolutionary Sayyid Qutb in the 1950s and 1960s, with an \n     admixture of Wahhabism, Deobandi thought, or simple, \n     mainstream Sunni chauvinism, depending on where and by what \n     group it is propounded.\n       Qutb blended a radical interpretation of Muslim theology \n     with the Marxism-Leninism and anticolonial fervor of the \n     Egypt of his day to produce an Islamic revolutionary \n     movement. He argued that the secularism and licentious (by \n     his extreme standards) behavior of most Muslims was \n     destroying the true faith and returning the Islamic world to \n     the state of jahiliyyah, or ignorance of the word of God, \n     which prevailed before Muhammad. The growing secularism of \n     Muslim states particularly bothered him. According to his \n     interpretation, God alone has the power to make laws and to \n     judge. When men make laws and judge each other according to \n     secular criteria, they are usurping God's prerogatives. All \n     who obey such leaders, according to Qutb, are treating their \n     leaders as gods and therefore are guilty of the worst sin--\n     polytheism. Thus they are--and this is the key point--not \n     true Muslims, but unbelievers, regardless of whether they \n     otherwise obey Muslim law and practice.\n       This is the defining characteristic of al Qaeda's ideology, \n     which is properly called ``takfirism'' (even though al Qaeda \n     fighters do not use the term). The word ``takfir'' designates \n     the process of declaring a person to be an unbeliever because \n     of the way he practices his faith. Takfir violates the \n     religious understanding of most of the world's Muslims, for \n     the Koran prescribes only five requirements for a Muslim \n     (acknowledgment of the oneness of God, prayer, charitable \n     giving, the fast, and the pilgrimage to Mecca) and specifies \n     that anyone who observes them is a Muslim. The takfiris \n     insist that anyone who obeys a human government is a \n     polytheist and therefore violates the first premise of \n     Islam, the shahada (the assertion that ``There is no god \n     but God''), even though Muslims have lived in states with \n     temporal rulers for most of their history. The chief \n     reason al Qaeda has limited support in the Muslim world is \n     that the global Muslim community overwhelmingly rejects \n     the premise that anyone obeying a temporal ruler is ipso \n     facto an unbeliever.\n       Today's takfiris carry Qutb's basic principles further. \n     Some pious Muslims believe that human governments should \n     support or enforce sharia law. This is why Saudi Arabia has \n     no law but sharia. But to Osama bin Laden and his senior \n     lieutenant, Ayman al Zawahiri, it is not enough for a state \n     to rule according to sharia. To be legitimate in the eyes of \n     these revolutionaries, a state must also work actively to \n     spread ``righteous rule'' across the earth. This demand means \n     that only states aligned with the takfiris and supporting the \n     spread of takfirism--such as the Taliban when it was in \n     power--are legitimate, whereas states aligned with \n     unbelievers, like Saudi Arabia, are illegitimate even if they \n     strictly enforce sharia law. Some takfiris, particularly in \n     Iraq as we shall see, argue in addition that all Shia are \n     polytheists, and therefore apostates, because they \n     ``worship'' Ali and Hussein and their successor imams. This \n     distorted view of Shiism reflects the continual movement of \n     takfiri thought toward extremes.\n       These distinctions are no mere theoretical niceties. The \n     Koran and Muslim tradition forbid Muslims from killing one \n     another except in narrowly specified circumstances. They also \n     restrict the conditions under which Muslims can kill non-\n     Muslims. Takfiris, however, claim that the groups and \n     individuals they condemn are not really Muslims but \n     unbelievers who endanger the true faith. They therefore claim \n     to be exercising the right to defend the faith, granted\n\n[[Page S11824]]\n\n     by the Koran and Muslim tradition, when they endorse the \n     killing of these false Muslims and the Westerners who either \n     seduce them into apostasy or support them in it. This is the \n     primary theological justification for al Qaeda's terrorism.\n       Takfirism is a radical reinterpretation of Islam that \n     discards over a thousand years of Islamic scholarship and \n     cautious tradition in favor of a literal reading of the Koran \n     and Hadith that allows any layman--such as Osama bin Laden, \n     who has no clerical standing--to usurp the role of Islam's \n     scholars and issue fatwas and exercise other such clerical \n     prerogatives. Interestingly, ``takfirism'' is what the Muslim \n     enemies of this movement call it. Iraqis, for example, \n     commonly refer to the members of AQI as ``takfiris.'' This \n     term has a strong negative connotation, implying as it does \n     the right of a small group to determine who is a Muslim \n     and to kill those who do not practice their religion in a \n     particular manner. (Iraqis also sometimes call the \n     terrorists ``khawaraj,'' a reference to the Kharajites of \n     early Muslim history that is extremely derogatory, \n     implying as it does that al Qaeda members are schismatics, \n     well outside of the mainstream of Islam.)\n       While takfirism is the primary theological justification \n     for the actions of al Qaeda, it is not the only important \n     component of the terrorists' ideology. Western concepts are \n     deeply embedded in the movement as well, primarily Leninism. \n     Qutb was familiar with the concept of the Bolshevik party as \n     the ``vanguard of the proletariat''--the small group that \n     understood the interests of the proletariat better than the \n     workers themselves, that would seize power in their name, \n     then would help them to achieve their own ``class \n     consciousness'' while creating a society that was just and \n     suitable for them. Qutb thought of his ideology in the same \n     terms: He explicitly referred to his movement as a vanguard \n     that would seize power in the name of the true faith and then \n     reeducate Muslims who had gone astray.\n       Bin Laden underscored this aspect of the ideology in naming \n     his organization ``al Qaeda,'' which means ``the base.'' Qutb \n     and bin Laden envisaged a small revolutionary movement that \n     would seize power in a Muslim state and then gradually work \n     to expand its control to the entire Muslim world, while \n     reeducating lapsed Muslims under its power. Al Qaeda's \n     frequent references to reestablishing the caliphate are tied \n     to this concept. The goal is to recapture the purity of the \n     ``Rashidun,'' the period when Muhammad and his immediate \n     successors ruled. This was the last time the Muslim world was \n     united and governed, as bin Laden sees it, according to the \n     true precepts of Islam.\n       Leninism (along with the practical challenges faced by \n     revolutionaries in a hostile world) has informed the \n     organizational structure as well as the thinking of al Qaeda. \n     The group is cellular and highly decentralized, as the \n     Bolsheviks were supposed to be. It focuses on seizing power \n     in weakened states, as Communist movements did in Russia and \n     China, and on weakening stronger states to make them more \n     susceptible to attack, as the Communist movement did around \n     the world after its triumph in the Soviet Union. Al Qaeda's \n     center of gravity is its ideology, which means that \n     individual cells can pursue the common aim with little or no \n     relationship to the center. It is nevertheless a linked \n     movement, with leaders directing the flow of some resources \n     and ordering or forbidding particular operations around the \n     world.\n       These, then, are the key characteristics of al Qaeda: It is \n     based on the principle of takfirism. It sees itself as a \n     Muslim revolutionary vanguard. It aims to take power in weak \n     states and to weaken strong states. It is cellular and \n     decentralized, but with a networked global leadership that \n     influences its activities without necessarily controlling \n     them. How does Al Qaeda In Iraq fit into this scheme?\n\n\n                            AL QAEDA IN IRAQ\n\n       AQI is part of the global al Qaeda movement both \n     ideologically and practically. Ideologically, it lies on the \n     extreme end of the takfiri spectrum. It was initially called \n     the ``Movement of Monotheism (tawhid) and Jihad,'' referring \n     to the takfiri principle that human government (and Shiism) \n     are polytheist. From its inception, AQI has targeted mainly \n     Iraqis; it has killed many times more Muslims than Americans. \n     Its preferred weapon is the suicide car-bomb or truck-bomb \n     aimed at places where large numbers of Iraqi civilians, \n     especially Shia, congregate. When the movement began in 2003 \n     it primarily targeted Shia. Zarqawi sought to provoke a Shia-\n     Sunni civil war that he expected would mobilize the Sunni to \n     full-scale jihad. He also delighted in killing Shia, whom he \n     saw as intolerable ``rejectionists,'' who had received the \n     message of the Koran and rejected it. Even worse than \n     ignorance of the word of God is deliberate apostasy. The duty \n     to convert or kill apostates supersedes even the duty to wage \n     war against the regular unbeliever--hence Zarqawi's \n     insistence that the Shia were more dangerous than the \n     ``Zionists and Crusaders.''\n       Bin Laden's associate Zawahiri remonstrated with Zarqawi on \n     this point in a series of exchanges that became public. He \n     argued that Zarqawi erred in attacking Shia, who should \n     rather be exhorted and enticed to join the larger movement he \n     hoped to create. Zawahiri's arguments were more tactical and \n     strategic than ideological. He has no objection to killing \n     unfaithful Muslims, but he has been eager to focus the \n     movement on what he calls the ``far enemy,'' America and the \n     West.\n       Zarqawi too pursued attacks on Western targets, of course. \n     He was implicated in the 2002 murder of USAID official \n     Lawrence Foley in Jordan, and in the bombing of the United \n     Nations office in Baghdad on August 19, 2003. But Zarqawi \n     concentrated on attacking Iraqi Shia. A blast at the end of \n     August 2003, for example, killed 85 Shia in Najaf, including \n     Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim (older brother of Abd al-\n     Aziz al-Hakim, the leader of the Supreme Iraqi Islamic \n     Council, the largest Shia party in the Council of \n     Representatives), and a series of attacks on Shia mosques \n     during the Ashura holiday in March 2004 killed over 180. He \n     finally succeeded in provoking a significant Shia backlash \n     with the destruction of the golden dome of the Shia al-\n     Askariyah Mosque in Samarra in February 2006. Zarqawi was \n     killed by coalition forces Sunni areas to the north and \n     south, Diyala, Salah-ad-Din, and Ninewa. AQI bases in \n     Falluja, Tal Afar, and Baquba included media centers, \n     torture houses, sharia courts, and all the other niceties \n     of AQI occupation that would be familiar to students of \n     the Taliban in Afghanistan and takfiri groups elsewhere. \n     Local thugs flocked to the banner, and those who resisted \n     were brutally tortured and murdered. Imams in local \n     mosques--radicalized in the 1990s by Saddam Hussein's \n     ``return to the faith'' initiative (to shore up his highly \n     secular government by wrapping it in the aura of Islam)--\n     preached takfirism and resistance to the Americans.\n       The presence of large numbers of Iraqis in the movement has \n     contributed to confusion about the relationship between AQI \n     and al Qaeda. Apart from the radicalized clerics and some \n     leaders, most of the Iraqis in the organization are misfits \n     and ne'er-do-wells, younger sons without sense or \n     intelligence who fall under the spell of violent leaders. The \n     recruitment process in many areas is like that of any street-\n     gang, where the leaders combine exhortation and promises with \n     exemplary violence against those who obstinately refuse to \n     join. In this regard, AQI is subtly different from the al \n     Qaeda movement that developed in Afghanistan. The takfiri \n     elements of the mujahedeen who fought the Soviet invader in \n     Afghanistan were highly diverse in origin. That war attracted \n     anti-Soviet fighters from across the Muslim world. They did \n     not fit easily into Afghanistan's xenophobic society, and so \n     concentrated themselves in training camps removed from the \n     population centers after the Soviet withdrawal and the rise \n     of the Taliban. Americans saw these foreign fighters in their \n     camps as the ``real'' al Qaeda, the one that attacked the \n     United States in 2001.\n       But al Qaeda was only part of the story in Afghanistan. The \n     Taliban forces that seized power in 1994 imposed a radical \n     interpretation of Islam upon the population and attacked the \n     symbols of other religions in a country that had \n     traditionally tolerated different faiths and diverse \n     practices. Like their AQI counterparts today, the Taliban \n     tended to be ill-educated, violent, and radical. And they \n     were just as necessary to sustaining al Qaeda in Afghanistan \n     as the Iraqi foot soldiers of AQI have been to supporting \n     that movement. Bin Laden provided essential support, both \n     military and financial, to put the Taliban in power and keep \n     it there. In return, the Taliban allowed him to operate with \n     impunity and protected him from foreign intervention. The war \n     began in 2001 when Taliban leader Mullah Omar refused to \n     yield the al Qaeda members responsible for 9/11 even though \n     the Taliban itself had not been involved in the attacks.\n       Afghanistan's extremist thugs and misfits, once in power, \n     facilitated the foreign-led al Qaeda's training, planning, \n     and preparation for attacks against Western targets around \n     the world, including the attacks on two U.S. embassies in \n     Africa in 1998, the attack on the U.S.S. Cole in 2000, and 9/\n     11. In return, al Qaeda's foreign fighters fiercely defended \n     the Taliban regime when U.S. forces attacked in 2001, even \n     forming up in conventional battle lines against America's \n     Afghan allies supported by U.S. Special Forces and airpower. \n     In Afghanistan the relationship between al Qaeda and the \n     Taliban was symbiotic, mutually dependent, and mutually \n     reinforcing. It included a shared world view and a \n     willingness to fight common enemies. There was a close bond \n     between indigenous Afghan extremists and the internationalist \n     takfiris. Al Qaeda in Iraq benefits from just such a bond.\n       Yet there is a difference between the two movements in this \n     regard: Whereas in Afghanistan al Qaeda remained separate \n     from Afghan society for the most part, interacting with it \n     primarily through the Taliban, AQI directly incorporates \n     Iraqis. Indeed, the foreign origins of AQI's leaders are a \n     handicap, of which their names are a constant reminder: \n     Zarqawi's nom de guerre identified him immediately as a \n     Jordanian, and the ``al-Masri'' in Abu Ayyub al-Masri means \n     ``the Egyptian.'' The takfiris clumsily addressed this \n     problem by announcing their ``Islamic State of Iraq,'' which \n     they presented as an umbrella movement Iraqi in nature but \n     which was in fact a thin disguise for AQI, and by inventing a \n     fictitious leader with a hyper-Iraqi, hyper-Sunni name, Abu \n     Omar al-Baghdadi.\n       As for its local recruits, they undergo extensive training \n     that is designed to brainwash them and prepare them to \n     support and engage in vicious violence. One of the reasons \n     some Iraqi Sunnis have turned against AQI has been this \n     practice of making their\n\n[[Page S11825]]\n\n     sons into monsters. Many Iraqis have come to feel about AQI \n     the way the parents of young gang members tend to feel about \n     gangs.\n       These AQI recruits often remain local. Young Anbaris do not \n     on the whole venture out of Anbar to attack Americans or Shia \n     beyond their province; AQI recruits in Arab Jabour or Salah-\n     ad-Din tend to stay near their homes, even if temporarily \n     driven off by U.S. operations. The leaders, however, travel a \n     great deal--Zarqawi went from Jordan to Germany to \n     Afghanistan to Iraq, and within Iraq from Falluja to Baquba \n     and beyond, and his subordinates and successors have covered \n     many miles at home and abroad. The presence of AQI cells in \n     each area facilitates this movement, as well as the movement \n     of foreign fighters into and through Iraq and the movement of \n     weapons, supplies, and intelligence. AQI facilitators provide \n     safe houses and means of communication. Some build car bombs \n     that are passed from cell to cell until they are mated with \n     the foreign fighters who will detonate them, perhaps far from \n     where they were built. Even though most members of AQI remain \n     near their homes, the sum of all of the cells, plus the \n     foreign leadership and foreign fighters, is a movement \n     that can plan and conduct attacks rapidly across the \n     country and around the region, and that can regenerate \n     destroyed cells within weeks. The leaders themselves are \n     hooked into the global al Qaeda movement.\n       The integration of AQI into the population makes it harder \n     to root out than al Qaeda was in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, \n     American leaders could launch missile strikes against al \n     Qaeda training bases (as President Clinton did, to little \n     effect), and U.S. Special Forces could target those camps \n     with or without indigenous help. Not so in Iraq.\n       Intermingled with the population, AQI maintains no large \n     training areas and thus offers few targets suitable for \n     missile strikes. American and Iraqi Special Forces have been \n     effective at killing particular AQI leaders, but this has not \n     destroyed the movement or even severely degraded its ability \n     to conduct attacks across the country. New leaders spring up, \n     and the facilitation networks continue their work.\n       When the Taliban fell in Afghanistan, al Qaeda lost its \n     freedom of movement throughout the country. Most surviving al \n     Qaeda fighters fled to Pakistan's largely ungoverned tribal \n     areas, where they could count on enough local support to \n     sustain themselves. Today there is little support for al \n     Qaeda in Afghanistan, no large permanent al Qaeda training \n     camp, and certainly no ability to conduct large-scale or \n     countrywide operations against U.S. or Afghan forces.\n       The recent turn against Al Qaeda In Iraq by key Iraqis has \n     produced less dramatic results because of the different means \n     by which AQI maintains itself. Although much of AQI's support \n     originally came from locals who sought its aid, by 2006 the \n     takfiris had made themselves so unpopular that their \n     continued presence relied on their continuous use of violence \n     against their hosts. As Anbari tribal leaders began for \n     various reasons to resist AQI's advances, AQI started \n     attacking them and their families. Outside of Anbar Province, \n     AQI regularly uses exemplary torture and murder to keep \n     locals in line. The principles of takfirism justify this, as \n     anyone who resists AQI's attempts to impose its vision of \n     Islam becomes an enemy of Islam. AQI then has the right and \n     obligation to kill such a person, since, in the takfiri view, \n     execution is the proper punishment for apostasy. It is a \n     little harder to see the pseudo-religious justification for \n     torture, but AQI is not deterred by such fine points.\n       Like al Qaeda in Afghanistan, then, AQI initially relied on \n     support from the population more or less freely offered. \n     Unlike al Qaeda in Afghanistan--but like the Taliban--it also \n     developed means of coercing support when this was no longer \n     given freely. As a result, Iraq's Sunnis cannot simply decide \n     to turn against al Qaeda on their own, for doing so condemns \n     them to outrageous punishments. To defeat Al Qaeda In Iraq, \n     therefore, it is not enough to attack takfiri ideology or \n     persuade the Iraqi government to address the Sunnis' \n     legitimate grievances. Those approaches must be combined with \n     a concerted effort to protect Sunni populations from AQI's \n     terrorism.\n\n\n                           HOW TO DEFEAT AQI\n\n       One of the first questions Iraqis ask when American forces \n     move into AQI strongholds to fight the takfiris is: Are you \n     going to stay this time? In the past, coalition forces have \n     cleared takfiri centers, often with local help, but have \n     departed soon after, leaving the locals vulnerable to vicious \n     AQI retaliation. This pattern created a legacy of distrust, \n     and a concomitant hesitancy to commit to backing coalition \n     forces.\n       This cycle was broken first in Anbar, for three reasons: \n     The depth of AQI's control there led the group to commit some \n     of its worst excesses in its attempt to hold on to power; the \n     strength of the tribal structures in the province created the \n     possibility of effective local resistance when the mood swung \n     against the takfiris; and the sustained presence and \n     determination of soldiers and Marines in the province gave \n     the locals hope of assistance once they began to turn against \n     the terrorists.\n       The movement against the takfiris began as AQI tried to \n     solidify its position in Anbar by marrying some of its senior \n     leaders to the daughters of Anbari tribal leaders, as al \n     Qaeda has done in South Asia. When the sheikhs resisted, AQI \n     began to attack them and their families, assassinating one \n     prominent sheikh, then preventing his relatives from burying \n     him within the 24 hours prescribed by Muslim law. In the \n     tribal society of Anbar, this and related actions led to the \n     rise of numerous blood-feuds between AQI and Anbari families. \n     The viciousness of AQI's retaliation and the relative \n     weakness of the Anbari tribes as a military or police force \n     put the locals in a difficult position, from which they were \n     rescued by the determined work of coalition and Iraqi \n     security forces.\n       Throughout 2006, U.S. soldiers and Marines in Anbar refused \n     to cede the province's capital and major population centers \n     to the insurgents. Officers like Colonel Sean MacFarland \n     worked to establish bases in Ramadi, protect key positions \n     within the city, and generally contest AQI's control. At the \n     same time, Marine commanders strove to reach out to Anbaris \n     increasingly disenchanted with AQI. Commanders in the \n     province now acknowledge that they probably missed several \n     early overtures from tribal leaders, but they clearly grasped \n     the more obvious signals the sheikhs sent in late 2006 and \n     early 2007 indicating their interest in working together \n     against the common foe.\n       The change in U.S. strategy announced in January 2007 and \n     the surge of forces over the ensuing months did not create \n     this shift in Anbar, but accelerated its development. The \n     surge meant that American commanders did not have to shift \n     forces out of Anbar to protect Baghdad, as had happened in \n     previous operations. MacFarland's successor, Colonel John \n     Charlton, was able to build on MacFarland's success when he \n     took command in early 2007. He moved beyond the limited bases \n     MacFarland's soldiers had established and began pushing his \n     troops into key neighborhoods in Ramadi, establishing Joint \n     Security Stations, and clearing the city. Marine forces in \n     the province were augmented by two battalions in the spring \n     and a battalion-sized Marine Expeditionary Unit in the \n     summer. The latter has been attacking the last bastions of \n     AQI in northeastern Anbar.\n       The increased U.S. presence and the more aggressive \n     operations of American forces--working with Iraqi army units \n     that, although heavily Shia, were able to function \n     effectively with U.S. troops even in Sunni Anbar--allowed the \n     tribal turn against AQI to pick up steam. By late spring \n     2007, all of the major Anbari tribes had sworn to oppose AQI \n     and had begun sending their sons to volunteer for service in \n     the Iraqi army and the Iraqi police. By summer, the coalition \n     had established a new training base in Habbaniya to receive \n     these recruits, and the Iraqi army units had begun balancing \n     their sectarian mix by incorporating Anbari Sunnis into their \n     formations. Thousands of Anbaris began patrolling the streets \n     of their own cities and towns to protect against AQI, and \n     coalition commanders were flooded with information about the \n     presence and movements of takfiris. By the beginning of \n     August, AQI had been driven out of all of Anbar's major \n     population centers, and its attempts to regroup in the \n     hinterland have been fitful and dangerous for the takfiris. \n     The mosques in Anbar's major cities have stopped preaching \n     anti-American and pro-takfiri sermons on the whole, switching \n     either to neutral messages or to support for peace and even \n     for the coalition.\n       The battle is by no means over. AQI has made clear its \n     determination to reestablish itself in Anbar or to punish the \n     Anbaris for their betrayal, and AQI cells in rural Anbar and \n     surrounding provinces are still trying to regenerate. But the \n     takfiri movement that once nearly controlled the province by \n     blending in with its people has lost almost all popular \n     support and has been driven to desperate measures to maintain \n     a precarious foothold. The combination of local \n     disenchantment with takfiri extremism, a remarkable lack of \n     cultural sensitivity by the takfiris themselves, \n     and effective counterinsurgency operations by coalition \n     forces working to protect the population have turned the \n     tide.\n       Anbar is a unique province in that its population is almost \n     entirely Sunni Arab and its tribal structures remain strong \n     despite years of Saddam's oppression. The ``Anbar \n     Awakening,'' as the Anbari turn against the takfiris is \n     usually called, has spread to almost all of Iraq's Sunni \n     areas, but in different forms reflecting their different \n     circumstances. Sunni Arabs in Baghdad, Babil, Salah-ad-Din, \n     and Diyala provinces have long suffered from AQI, but they \n     also face a significant Shia Arab presence, including violent \n     elements of the Jaysh al-Mahdi, or Mahdi Army, the most \n     extreme Shia militia. Diyala, Ninewa, and Kirkuk provinces \n     also have ethnic fault lines where Arabs, Turkmen, and Kurds \n     meet and occasionally fight. Tribal structures in these areas \n     vary in strength, but are everywhere less cohesive than those \n     of Anbar.\n       Extreme elements of the Jaysh al-Mahdi, particularly the \n     Iranian-controlled ``secret cells,'' have been exerting \n     pressure against Sunni populations in mixed provinces at \n     least since early 2006. Some formerly Sunni cities like \n     Mahmudiya have become Shia (and Jaysh al-Mahdi) strongholds. \n     Mixed areas in Baghdad have tended to become more \n     homogeneous. AQI has benefited from this struggle, which it \n     helped to produce, posing as the defender of the Sunni \n     against the Jaysh al-Mahdi even as it terrorizes Sunnis into \n     supporting it. AQI's hold cannot be broken without addressing \n     the pressure of Shia extremists on these Sunni communities, \n     as well as defending the local population against AQI \n     attacks.\n\n[[Page S11826]]\n\n       This task is dauntingly complex, but not beyond the power \n     of coalition forces to understand and execute. American and \n     Iraqi troops throughout central Iraq have been working \n     aggressively to destroy AQI strongholds like those in Arab \n     Jabour, Baquba, Karma, and Tarmiya and in the Baghdad \n     neighborhoods of Ameriyah, Ghazaliya, and Dora, and have \n     largely driven the takfiris out of the major population \n     centers and even parts of the hinterland. As U.S. forces have \n     arrived in strength and promised to stay, thousands of Sunnis \n     have volunteered to fight the terrorists and to protect their \n     neighborhoods by joining the Iraqi army, police, or auxiliary \n     ``neighborhood watch'' units set up by U.S. forces. In these \n     areas, however, coalition forces have also had to work to \n     protect the local Sunni from attacks by the secret cells of \n     the Shia militia and by Shia militia members who have \n     penetrated the Iraqi national and local police forces. The \n     continued presence of American forces among the population is \n     a key guarantor against attack by the Jaysh al-Mahdi as well \n     as AQI reprisals. Indeed, the Sunni insist upon it as the \n     condition for their participation in the struggle against the \n     takfiris.\n       The description of the new U.S. strategy as ``protecting \n     the population'' is shorthand for this complex, variable, and \n     multifaceted approach to the problem of separating AQI from \n     the population and supporting the rising indigenous movement \n     against the takfiris. It has been extremely successful in a \n     short period of time--Anbar in general and Ramadi in \n     particular have gone within six months from being among the \n     most dangerous areas in Iraq to among the safest. AQI \n     strongholds like Arab Jabour and Baquba are now mostly free \n     of large-scale terrorist infiltration, and their populations \n     are working with the coalition to keep the takfiris out. The \n     overall struggle to establish peace and stability in Iraq \n     clearly goes beyond this fight against AQI, but from the \n     standpoint of American interests in the global war on terror, \n     it is vital to recognize our success against the takfiris and \n     the reasons for it.\n\n\n                              THE OUTLOOK\n\n       AQI--and therefore the larger al Qaeda movement--has \n     suffered a stunning defeat in Iraq over the past six months. \n     It has lost all of its urban strongholds and is engaged in a \n     desperate attempt to reestablish a foothold even in the \n     countryside. The movement is unlikely to accept this defeat \n     tamely. Even now, AQI cells scattered throughout the country \n     are working to reconstitute themselves and to continue mass-\n     casualty attacks in the hope of restarting widespread \n     sectarian conflict from which they hope to benefit. If the \n     coalition abandoned its efforts to finish off these cells and \n     to prevent them from rebuilding their networks, it is quite \n     possible that they could terrify their victims into taking \n     them back in some areas, although AQI is unlikely to be \n     viewed sympathetically by most Iraqis for a long time to \n     come.\n       If, on the other hand, coalition forces complete the work \n     they have begun by finishing off the last pockets of takfiris \n     and continuing to build local Iraqi security forces that can \n     sustain the fight against the terrorists after American \n     troops pull back, then success against the terrorists in Iraq \n     is likely. That success will come at a price, of course. The \n     takfiris have only the proverbial hammer in Iraq at this \n     point, and they are now in the position of seeing every \n     problem as the proverbial nail. Their hammer can be effective \n     only if no one is around to protect the population: Their \n     violence consistently drives Iraqi sentiment against them and \n     their ideology. So the prospect of a thorough and decisive \n     defeat of the terrorists in Iraq is real.\n       It is too soon to declare victory in this struggle, still \n     less in the larger struggle to stabilize Iraq and win the \n     global war on terror. AQI can again become a serious threat \n     if America chooses to let it get up off the mat. Other \n     significant takfiri threats remain outside Iraq, such as the \n     al Qaeda cell that has been battling Lebanese military \n     forces from the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and \n     the aggressive al Qaeda group in the Islamic Maghreb that \n     has proclaimed its intention of conquering all of North \n     Africa and restoring Muslim rule to Spain. Each al Qaeda \n     franchise is subtly different from the others, and there \n     is no one-size-fits-all solution to defeating them. But \n     our experience in Iraq already offers lessons for the \n     larger fight.\n       The notion that there is some ``real'' al Qaeda with which \n     we should be more concerned than with AQI or any of the other \n     takfiri franchises is demonstrably false. All of these \n     cellular organizations are interlinked at the top, even as \n     they depend on local facilitators and fighters in particular \n     places. The Iraqi-ness of AQI does not make it any less a \n     part of the global movement. On the contrary, if we do not \n     defeat AQI, we can expect it to start performing the same \n     international functions that al Qaeda and the Taliban did in \n     Afghanistan: Locally active AQI cells will facilitate the \n     training, planning, and preparation for attacks on Western \n     and secular Muslim targets around the world. As has often \n     been noted, the overwhelming majority of the September 11 \n     attackers were Saudis, yet their attacks were made possible \n     by facilitators who never left Afghanistan. AQI, if allowed \n     to flourish, would be no different. It has posed less of a \n     threat outside Iraq because of the intensity of the struggle \n     within Iraq--just as the takfiris among the Afghan mujahedeen \n     posed little threat outside that country as long as they had \n     the Soviet army to fight. If the United States lets up on \n     this determined enemy now and allows it to regain a position \n     within Iraqi society, it is likely that AQI cells will soon \n     be facilitating global attacks.\n       The idea that targeting these cells from the air or through \n     special operations is an adequate substitute for assisting \n     the local population to fight them is also mistaken. \n     Coalition forces have relied on just this approach against al \n     Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan since 9/11, with \n     questionable results. Granted, there have been few successful \n     attacks against Western powers, none of them in the United \n     States, for which this aggressive targeting is surely in part \n     responsible. But recent intelligence estimates suggest a \n     strengthening of the al Qaeda movement. In Iraq, years of \n     targeting AQI leaders weakened the movement and led it to \n     make a number of key mistakes, but did not stop mass-casualty \n     attacks or stimulate effective popular resistance to the \n     takfiris. It seems doubtful that Muslim communities--even \n     those that reject the takfiri ideology--are capable of \n     standing up to the terrorists on their own or with only the \n     support of intelligence-driven raids against terrorist \n     leaders and isolated cells.\n       Iraq has also disproved the shibboleth that the presence of \n     American military forces in Muslim countries is inherently \n     counterproductive in the fight against takfiris. Certainly \n     the terrorists used our presence as a recruiting tool and \n     benefited from the Sunni Arab nationalist insurgency against \n     our forces. But there is no reason to think that Iraq would \n     have remained free of takfiri fighters had the United States \n     drawn down its forces (or should it draw them down now); it \n     is even open to question whether a continued Baathist regime \n     would have kept the takfiris out. The takfiris go where \n     American forces are, to be sure, but they also go where we \n     are not: Somalia, Lebanon, North Africa, Indonesia, and more. \n     The introduction of Western forces does not inevitably spur \n     takfiri sentiment. When used properly and in the right \n     circumstances, Western military forces can play an essential \n     role in combatting takfirism.\n       This is not to say that the United States should invade \n     Waziristan and Baluchistan, or launch preemptive conventional \n     assaults against (or in defense of) weak Muslim regimes \n     around the world. Each response must be tailored to \n     circumstance. But we must break free of a consensus about how \n     to fight the terrorists that has been growing steadily since \n     9/11 which emphasizes ``small footprints,'' working \n     exclusively through local partners, and avoiding conventional \n     operations to protect populations. In some cases, traditional \n     counterinsurgency operations using conventional forces are \n     the only way to defeat this 21st-century foe.\n       Muslims can dislike al Qaeda, reject takfirism, and desire \n     peace, yet still be unable to defend themselves alone against \n     the terrorists. In such cases, our assistance, suitably \n     adapted to the realities on the ground, can enable Muslims \n     who hate what the takfiris are doing to their religion and \n     their people--the overwhelming majority of Muslims--to \n     succeed. Helping them is the best way to rid the world of \n     this scourge.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. Is the Senator from Arizona suggesting there is not a \ncivil war in Iraq?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, what I am saying is the primary conflict that \nconcerns the United States of America forces right now is defeating al-\nQaida in Iraq and the conflicts that al-Qaida in Iraq have instigated, \nwhich include conflicts between Sunnis and Shias.\n  Mr. KERRY. Is the Senator aware that 60 percent of Iraq is Shia, that \nShia are viewed by al-Qaida as complete apostates outside of Islam, \nthat they do not get along, that the Kurds do not get along--and they \nare 20 percent of Iraq; therefore, 80 percent of Iraq will have nothing \nto do with al-Qaida--and now the Sunni in Anbar decided they do not \nwant anything to do with al-Qaida, and that most of the injuries to our \ntroops are from IEDs, and that most of the conflict in Iraq that has \nmoved 2 million people out of Iraq and 2 million people within Iraq and \nchanged Baghdad from 60 percent Sunni to 75 percent Shia--is he aware \nthat, in fact, al-Qaida is not responsible for that, but it is the \nJaysh al-Mahdi and it is the militia and it is the Badr army and \neverybody except for, fundamentally, al-Qaida that is doing that?\n  That is the fundamental violence and conflict which requires the \npolitical settlement General Petraeus cannot produce, only the Iraqi \npoliticians can produce. Is he aware of that?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will be happy to respond by saying, I am \naware that many of the things asserted by the Senator from \nMassachusetts are incorrect.\n  I am aware al-Qaida in Iraq is a major force----\n\n[[Page S11827]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me ask the Senator--\n  Mr. KYL. May I complete my answer to the Senator's lengthy question?\n  Mr. KERRY. How many al-Qaida are in Iraq?\n  Mr. KYL. Al-Qaida in Iraq--as is evident from the article I had \nprinted in the Record; and I would be happy to share a copy of that \narticle with my friend from Massachusetts--is a major force in Iraq, \nand is, in addition to being part of the force we are fighting, an \ninstigator of violence between some of the groups the Senator from \nMassachusetts mentioned.\n  Now, let me say one other thing. I intended to conclude my remarks by \nlaying down an amendment which Senator Lieberman and I are prepared to \ndebate tomorrow, not right now. But the Senator from Massachusetts \nmentioned the IEDs. Of course, I know the Senator is aware that a lot \nof the newest equipment and training, and in particular this virulent, \nthis very destructive IED that is being used in Iraq, is coming from \nIran, and that part of what we need to do is to deal with Iran in the \ncontext of this conflict in Iraq as well, and in particular the group \nin Iran that is supplying this equipment. For that reason--\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I will be happy to yield the floor to the Senator as soon as \nI conclude my business. Then the Senator from Massachusetts can go \nahead and make his full statement, if that would be all right.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3017 To Amendment No. 2011\n\n  Mr. President, what I want to do, in concluding my remarks, is, on \nbehalf of Senator Lieberman and Senator Coleman and myself, send an \namendment to the desk that is a sense of the Senate on Iran, which is \nhow it is titled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand this is going to be simply \nsent to the desk, it is then going to be read, and then we are going to \nset aside that amendment. That is understood by the Senator from \nArizona?\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself, Mr. \n     Lieberman, and Mr. Coleman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3017.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding Iran)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title XV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1535. SENSE OF SENATE ON IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) General David Petraeus, commander of the Multi-National \n     Force Iraq, stated in testimony before a joint session of the \n     Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 10, \n     2007, that ``[i]t is increasingly apparent to both coalition \n     and Iraqi leaders that Iran, through the use of the Iranian \n     Republican Guard Corps Qods Force, seeks to turn the Shi'a \n     militia extremists into a Hezbollah-like force to serve its \n     interests and fight a proxy war against the Iraqi state and \n     coalition forces in Iraq''.\n       (2) Ambassador Ryan Crocker, United States Ambassador to \n     Iraq, stated in testimony before a joint session of the \n     Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 10, \n     2007, that ``Iran plays a harmful role in Iraq. While \n     claiming to support Iraq in its transition, Iran has actively \n     undermined it by providing lethal capabilities to the enemies \n     of the Iraqi state''.\n       (3) The most recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, \n     published in August 2007, states that ``Iran has been \n     intensifying aspects of its lethal support for select groups \n     of Iraqi Shia militants, particularly the JAM [Jaysh al-\n     Mahdi], since at least the beginning of 2006. Explosively \n     formed penetrator (EFP) attacks have risen dramatically''.\n       (4) The Report of the Independent Commission on the \n     Security Forces of Iraq, released on September 6, 2007, \n     states that ``[t]he Commission concludes that the evidence of \n     Iran's increasing activism in the southeastern part of the \n     country, including Basra and Diyala provinces, is compelling. \n     . . It is an accepted fact that most of the sophisticated \n     weapons being used to `defeat' our armor protection comes \n     across the border from Iran with relative impunity''.\n       (5) General (Ret.) James Jones, chairman of the Independent \n     Commission on the Security Forces of Iraq, stated in \n     testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate on September 6, 2007, that ``[w]e judge that the \n     goings-on across the Iranian border in particular are of \n     extreme severity and have the potential of at least delaying \n     our efforts inside the country. Many of the arms and weapons \n     that kill and maim our soldiers are coming from across the \n     Iranian border''.\n       (6) General Petraeus said of Iranian support for extremist \n     activity in Iraq on April 26, 2007, that ``[w]e know that it \n     goes as high as [Brig. Gen. Qassem] Suleimani, who is the \n     head of the Qods Force. . . We believe that he works directly \n     for the supreme leader of the country''.\n       (7) Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, the president of Iran, stated on \n     August 28, 2007, with respect to the United States presence \n     in Iraq, that ``[t]he political power of the occupiers is \n     collapsing rapidly. Soon we will see a huge power vacuum in \n     the region. Of course we are prepared to fill the gap''.\n       (8) Ambassador Crocker testified to Congress, with respect \n     to President Ahmedinejad's statement, on September 11, 2007, \n     that ``[t]he Iranian involvement in Iraq--its support for \n     extremist militias, training, connections to Lebanese \n     Hezbollah, provision of munitions that are used against our \n     force as well as the Iraqis--are all, in my view, a pretty \n     clear demonstration that Ahmedinejad means what he says, and \n     is already trying to implement it to the best of his \n     ability''.\n       (9) General Petraeus stated on September 12, 2007, with \n     respect to evidence of the complicity of Iran in the murder \n     of members of the Armed Forces of the United States in Iraq, \n     that ``[t]e evidence is very, very clear. We captured it when \n     we captured Qais Khazali, the Lebanese Hezbollah deputy \n     commander, and others, and it's in black and white. . . We \n     interrogated these individuals. We have on tape. . . Qais \n     Khazali himself. When asked, could you have done what you \n     have done without Iranian support, he literally throws up his \n     hands and laughs and says, of course not. . . So they told us \n     about the amounts of money that they have received. They told \n     us about the training that they received. They told us about \n     the ammunition and sophisticated weaponry and all of that \n     that they received''.\n       (10) General Petraeus further stated on September 14, 2007, \n     that ``[w]hat we have got is evidence. This is not \n     intelligence. This is evidence, off computers that we \n     captured, documents and so forth. . . In one case, a 22-page \n     document that lays out the planning, reconnaissance, \n     rehearsal, conduct, and aftermath of the operation conducted \n     that resulted in the death of five of our soldiers in Karbala \n     back in January''.\n       (11) The Department of Defense report to Congress entitled \n     ``Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq'' and released on \n     September 18, 2007, consistent with section 9010 of Public \n     Law 109-289, states that ``[t]here has been no decrease in \n     Iranian training and funding of illegal Shi'a militias in \n     Iraq that attack Iraqi and Coalition forces and civilians. . \n     . Tehran's support for these groups is one of the greatest \n     impediments to progress on reconciliation''.\n       (12) The Department of Defense report further states, with \n     respect to Iranian support for Shi'a extremist groups in \n     Iraq, that ``[m]ost of the explosives and ammunition used by \n     these groups are provided by the Iranian Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force. . . For the period of \n     June through the end of August, [explosively formed \n     penetrator] events are projected to rise by 39 percent over \n     the period of March through May''.\n       (13) Since May 2007, Ambassador Crocker has held three \n     rounds of talks in Baghdad on Iraq security with \n     representatives of the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran.\n       (14) Ambassador Crocker testified before Congress on \n     September 10, 2007, with respect to these talks, stating that \n     ``I laid out the concerns we had over Iranian activity that \n     was damaging to Iraq's security, but found no readiness on \n     Iranians' side at all to engage seriously on these issues. \n     The impression I came with after a couple rounds is that the \n     Iranians were interested simply in the appearance of \n     discussions, of being seen to be at the table with the U.S. \n     as an arbiter of Iraq's present and future, rather than \n     actually doing serious business...Right now, I haven't seen \n     any sign of earnest or seriousness on the Iranian side''.\n       (15) Ambassador Crocker testified before Congress on \n     September 11, 2007, stating that ``[w]e have seen nothing on \n     the ground that would suggest that the Iranians are altering \n     what they're doing in support of extremist elements that are \n     going after our forces as well as the Iraqis''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) that the manner in which the United States transitions \n     and structures its military presence in Iraq will have \n     critical long-term consequences for the future of the Persian \n     Gulf and the Middle East, in particular with regard to the \n     capability of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     to pose a threat to the security of the region, the prospects \n     for democracy for the people of the region, and the health of \n     the global economy;\n       (2) that it is a vital national interest of the United \n     States to prevent the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran from turning Shi'a militia extremists in Iraq into a\n\n[[Page S11828]]\n\n     Hezbollah-like force that could serve its interests inside \n     Iraq, including by overwhelming, subverting, or co-opting \n     institutions of the legitimate Government of Iraq;\n       (3) that it should be the policy of the United States to \n     combat, contain, and roll back the violent activities and \n     destabilizing influence inside Iraq of the Government of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran, its foreign facilitators such as \n     Lebanese Hezbollah, and its indigenous Iraqi proxies;\n       (4) to support the prudent and calibrated use of all \n     instruments of United States national power in Iraq, \n     including diplomatic, economic, intelligence, and military \n     instruments, in support of the policy described in paragraph \n     (3) with respect to the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran and its proxies;\n       (5) that the United States should designate the Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist \n     organization under section 219 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act and place the Islamic Revolutionary Guards \n     Corps on the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists, \n     as established under the International Emergency Economic \n     Powers Act and initiated under Executive Order 13224; and\n       (6) that the Department of the Treasury should act with all \n     possible expediency to complete the listing of those entities \n     targeted under United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n     1737 and 1747 adopted unanimously on December 23, 2006 and \n     March 24, 2007, respectively.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as I said, the chairman of the committee is \ncorrect, the intention was to simply lay this amendment down tonight on \nbehalf of Senators Lieberman, Coleman, and myself. We will debate it \nafter we have concluded further business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2898\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is no time agreement. As I \nunderstand, there is an order of speakers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is now recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this amendment.\n  As we continue debating how best to support America's brave military \nforces in Iraq, we must be clear where we stand on the war. I strongly \nsupport our troops, but I strongly oppose the war. The best way to \nprotect our troops and our national security is to put the Iraqis on \nnotice that they need to take responsibility for their future so we can \nbring troops back home to America.\n  The administration's policy has put our troops in an untenable and \nunwinnable situation. They are being held hostage to Iraqi politics in \nwhich sectarian leaders are unable or unwilling to make the tough \njudgments needed to lift Iraq out of its downward spiral. We are \nspending hundreds of billions of dollars on a failed policy that is \nmaking America more vulnerable and putting our troops at greater risk.\n  We have lost our focus on apprehending terrorists and on capturing \nthose who seek to destroy America. Osama bin Laden remains at large. \nThe war in Iraq has enabled al-Qaida to recruit terrorists more \neffectively to work against America.\n  Our policy in Iraq continues to exact a devastating toll. Nearly \n4,000 American troops have died--80 in my State of Massachusetts--and \n30,000 have been injured. We need to have a policy that is worthy of \nthe valor of the brave men and women who have been fighting there for \nthe last 4\\1/2\\ years. The toll on Iraqis is immense. Tens of thousands \nof Iraqis have been killed or injured, and more than 4 million Iraqis \nhave been forced to flee their homes. If that were in American terms, \nit would be 45 million Americans who would have lost their homes, \neffectively 20 Katrinas would have taken place here in the United \nStates--when we look at what has happened to the Iraqi families during \nthis period of time. Nearly a half trillion dollars has been spent \nfighting this war. Our generals have acknowledged over and over again \nthat a military solution alone is not the answer to Iraq's problems. \nAfter four bloody years, political reconciliation remains illusive, and \nIraqi politicians are not being held accountable to any standard of \nprogress or success. Yet the President unacceptably continues to impose \nthe enormous burden of Iraq's sectarian violence on the backs of \nAmerican troops, with an open-ended commitment--with an open-ended \ncommitment.\n\n  Our military is stretched to its limits; it is nearing its breaking \npoint. The American public has lost confidence in the current direction \nof the war. They are tired of a war based upon a failed policy that has \nmade America no safer and that is subjecting our military to Iraq's \nintractable civil war. They are tired of the administration's promises \nthat success is just around the corner. They want to know when the \nnightmare of Iraq will end.\n  How much longer will President Bush insist that our troops be held \nhostage to the abysmal failure of the Iraqi Government to make the \npolitical compromises essential to end violence, especially when there \nis no indication--no indication--that they will do so any time soon? \nHow many more brave Americans must die? How many more billions of \ntaxpayers' dollars must we spend? How much more of a burden must we \nplace on our military?\n  We all know what is going on. President Bush's strategy is delay and \ndelay. We never should have gone to war in the first place, and his \nmisguided war has now gone on for more than 4 years. The situation is \nnot improving; it is worsening. It is not showing signs of meaningful \nprogress. Year after year, it has failed to deliver political \nreconciliation. The President finally admitted to Congress and the \nAmerican people last week that his successor, the next American \nPresident, will inherit the war in Iraq. He calls himself a decider, \nbut he refuses to make the decision to end the war.\n  President Harry Truman said: ``The buck stops here.'' The last thing \nPresident Bush wants is for the buck to stop on his desk. He is \ndesperately trying to buy time in order to pass the buck to his \nsuccessor in the White House.\n  The first President Bush went to war with Iraq after 52 Senators \nvoted in favor of a resolution of approval. Now, 53 Senators have voted \nfor a timetable to end the war. But this President vetoed the bill \nbecause he refuses to accept responsibility to end a war he never \nshould have started.\n  It is time to stop this madness. This amendment does that. It \nrequires our combat troops to begin to come home in 90 days. It \nrequires a change in mission for our military. It requires the vast \nmajority of our combat troops to come home in 9 months. It is up to us \nto end the open-ended commitment of our troops that the President has \nbeen making year after year. The Iraqis need to take responsibility for \ntheir own future, resolve their own political differences, and enable \nour troops to come home.\n  We need to tell the Iraqis now that we are going to leave, and leave \nsoon. Only such a step can add the urgency that is so clearly necessary \nto end their differences. We can't allow the President to drag this \nprocess out any longer, and I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, any American I know should be, and is, \nvitally interested in what is happening in Iraq and what our policy \nshould be. There is no doubt that good people can disagree about how we \nshould handle this important and difficult situation. Nobody's \npatriotism should be questioned in this process. But I would urge that \nthese disagreements that might be expressed be expressed in ways that \nminimize the negative impact on what may be, and will be the decided \npolicy of the United States. In other words, we need to be sure that as \nwe conduct this debate--we have a policy in this country, and we need \nto make sure that we execute it in a way that most likely will provide \nus a method of success.\n  Let me recap the history of how we got here because I think it is \nimportant. By more than a three-fourths vote, 77 Senators in this body \nauthorized the use of military force in Iraq. The initial invasion and \nremoval of Saddam Hussein went well, surprisingly well--better than \nmost would ever have expected. But the postinvasion situation has been \nmuch more difficult than expected. My personal view, for what it is \nworth--and it\n\n[[Page S11829]]\n\nmay not be worth much--is that we underestimated the difficulties of \nestablishing a functioning democracy in an undeveloped nation that had \ndeep sectarian divides, that had no history of law or democracy, and \nthat had been traumatized by years of oppression in a war. So we can \nlook back and say there are a lot of mistakes out there that have been \nmade, but I think the real problem is we are facing a difficult job \nthat is not going to be easy, and no one should underestimate the \nchallenge.\n  But we must honestly evaluate our current position and use this time \nin this Congress right now to decide what we are going to do. I know \ngood people will disagree, but we will reach a decision before this \ndebate is out. So we owe nothing less to those fabulous men and women \nwho serve us in Iraq than to give this our best judgment, our hardest \nwork, our most sincere consideration. There can be no doubt but that \nthis is the correct time for a national evaluation.\n  Remember how we got here. In May--May 24 of this year--in a \nbipartisan vote, we voted to clearly affirm the surge; 80 to 14 was \nwhat that vote was. We debated the question. We knew General Petraeus \nwas there. The President asked that we fund 30,000 additional troops as \npart of this surge, and we decided to do so. We voted for it. This \nCongress said we will execute that surge. I remember Senator Reid and \nSpeaker Pelosi meeting with the President and working on the deal, and \nwe agreed to do the surge 80 to 14 on final vote. So it is really not \nPresident Bush's surge or General Petraeus's surge, it was and is \nAmerica's surge, and our troops are carrying out America's policies. I \nhope our colleagues here won't be adopting the reasoning of MoveOn.Org \ninstead of recognizing the responsibilities that we all have to those \nwe have sent into harm's way.\n  Now, no one in May was sure how things would work out. Things had not \ngone well in 2006 and in early 2007. All of us were worried about what \nwas happening. Violence had increased, the uncertainty had increased, \nand I think Congress rightly was concerned. After debate, we decided to \nexecute the surge operation which was more than just increased troops, \nand I will talk about that in a minute. We decided that, for the \npurpose of openness and accountability, as part of the funding of this \nwar that we had appropriated, we wanted some reports. In fact, we asked \nfor five separate reports. Those reports have been produced as \nrequired. A report was required on the status of 18 benchmarks \nsubmitted by July 15. A report was required for an \nindependent commission of experts to report not later than September 1 \nanalyzing the progress of the Iraqi security forces. That was the \nGeneral Jones commission, former supreme allied commander in Europe, \nformer commander of the United States Marine Corps, and 20 other \nexperts compiled that report. A report from the GAO, the comptroller \ngeneral, on whether the 18 benchmarks had been achieved by September 1; \na followup on the benchmarks report submitted by September 15. Then \npublic testimony was required from the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and the \ncommander of Multi-National Forces Iraq, General Petraeus, not later \nthan September 15.\n\n  We have had all of that in the Armed Services Committee, of which I \nam a member. We had Mr. Walker from GAO give the GAO report. We had \nGeneral Jones and his commission give their report, and we had General \nPetraeus and Ambassador Crocker give their reports. They testified \nbefore the House. They testified before other committees. We have had \nnow a national discussion about this situation, and it is time for us \nto begin to make some decisions. So what I hope we will do is make a \ndecision, and we will stick by it, and next week we would not have \nleaders in this body saying it is a failure before it ever gets \nstarted, as we have had in the past.\n  Let me summarize the reports that came in briefly. The administration \nreport on benchmarks, as well as a GAO report, shows that we had some \nprogress on some matters but that there had been limited political \nprogress in Iraq. I would note that the GAO report, which was valuable \nand I think not inaccurate but could be misinterpreted, was important. \nIt did not, however, incorporate data from August and early September \nfrom Iraq. That data shows remarkable progress in those recent weeks, \nand it was not part of its report. So the progress on the military \nfront that they reported was not as significant as the later reports \nwould show. It only measured whether the goals of each one of the \nbenchmarks were fully achieved. It didn't measure whether progress had \nbeen made.\n  Ambassador Crocker, on the benchmarks, made some important comments. \nThose I would point out to my colleagues. One, he said, yes, an oil law \nhad not been passed by the Iraqi Parliament. They couldn't get together \non that. Sometimes we can't get together in this body and agree on \nthings. So what happened is, they are indeed sharing oil revenue \nthroughout the provinces in a fair and just way, although they have not \nyet been able to pass an overall oil law. So we are saying, according \nto benchmarks, they haven't met the benchmarks because the benchmarks \nsaid they must pass an oil law that would share their resources. But, \nin fact, they are sharing.\n  He talked about a benchmark dealing with reconciliation with former \nmembers of the Baathist Party and the Saddam Hussein regime. He said, \nno, they had not been able to pass in the parliament the legislation \nthat would effectuate, as we would like to see it, a reconciliation \namong the former Baathists and the current leadership in Iraq, but it \nwas happening out there. He said in various different places throughout \nIraq former members of Baathist activities are coming into the \ngovernment, Sunnis who allied with al-Qaida are coming in and working \nwith the American military, and at the grassroots level real progress \nis being made and reconciliation is occurring in a lot of different \nplaces in Iraq.\n  Now, the Jones commission was a very valuable commission. General \nJones is a very distinguished, 40-year veteran of the U.S. Marine \nCorps, former commandant. He served as supreme allied commander of \nEurope and commander of USOCOM. This bipartisan commission he headed \nwas composed of 20 members representing senior military leaders, \ncivilian officials, former chiefs of police, former DC Police Chief \nCharles Ramsey, former TRADOC Commander General John Abrams, and Mr. \nJohn Hamre, former Under Secretary of Defense in the Clinton \nadministration, a respected voice on defense matters. Between them, the \ncommissioners had more than 500 years of collective military experience \nand more than 150 years of police experience.\n  The Commission reported strong progress within the Iraqi Army but \nmuch weaker progress among the national police--in fact, unacceptable \nactivity within the police. They called for massive reform and \nrestructuring of the Iraqi police forces.\n  I asked General Jones and his colleagues in this fashion--I told him \nthat before General Petraeus went to Iraq to take over the effort \nthere, he told us he would define the challenge as being ``difficult, \nbut not impossible.'' So I asked General Jones:\n\n       What are our realistic prospects for a long-term situation \n     in which there is some stability and a functioning government \n     that is not threatening to the United States?\n\n  This is what General Jones said:\n\n       Senator, I think that General Petraeus's words were \n     correct. I think it is a difficult situation that is \n     multifaceted. It is about bringing about in Iraq not only \n     safe and secure conditions, but a completely different method \n     of government, jump-starting an economy, rule of law. The \n     whole aspect of transition is just enormously complex.\n\n  He added this:\n\n       And regardless of how we got there, we are where we are. It \n     is, strategically, enormously important not only nationally, \n     but regionally and globally, for this to come out and be seen \n     as a success. And our report, I think, not only unanimous but \n     very hard-hitting in certain areas, intentionally makes the \n     point that there are some good things happening and that we \n     are all excited to see that. That is certainly encouraging, \n     but there is more work that needs to be done. We wanted to be \n     very specific about where we think that work should be done. \n     It doesn't mean it can't be done.\n\n  They call for a massive overhaul of the Iraqi police. He said it is \ndifficult and it needs to be done. More progress needs to be made, but \nit is not impossible. So I followed up with that. I said:\n\n       Did any of your commission members, or any significant \n     number of them, conclude that this could not work, that this \n     was a failed effort, or that we ought to just figure\n\n[[Page S11830]]\n\n     a way to get out of there regardless of the consequences?\n\n  Here is General Jones's answer:\n\n       I don't believe that there is a commissioner that feels \n     that way. But let me just take a poll right now.\n\n  He turned around and surveyed the Commissioners, and they all agreed \nwith General Jones.\n  Then General Petraeus and Ambassador Corker came before us last week \nto give their report, which detailed progress on a number of different \nlevels. General Petraeus is one of our most distinguished officers in \nthe Armed Forces. He graduated as an academically ``distinguished \ncadet'' from West Point. He was the General George C. Marshall Award \nwinner as the top graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff \nCollege, class of 1983. He also has a master's and a Ph.D. from \nPrinceton, and he served as a professor at West Point. He is on his \nthird tour in Iraq.\n  I know a lot of people in this body think they have figured out how \nto deal with Iraq. He spent 2 full years there and now over a half a \nyear again in Iraq dealing with these circumstances. He is a very \ncapable person, as anyone can well see.\n  Well, I have been to Iraq six times. On the first trip, I met General \nPetraeus. He commanded the 101st Airborne in Mosul. They were achieving \nsome fine success and reconciliation. They were able to catch Saddam's \nsons, Uday and Qusay. He worked with Alabama engineering National Guard \nunits impressively, in my opinion, to bring them on line in an \neffective way. I was impressed in my meeting with him.\n  The next year, he came home, and then they asked him to go back to \ntrain the Iraqi Army. He went back and took charge of that operation \nand spent a year doing that in Iraq, meeting people in Baghdad and \ngetting a real feel for that country. Then he came home.\n  When he got home, he wrote the counterinsurgency manual for the U.S. \nDepartment of Defense, which details the principles and tactics that \ncan work to defeat an insurgency. In fact, insurgencies can be defeated \nif you have a sustained and intelligent policy that is well led. So he \nwrote that manual, and President Bush met with him and decided to send \nhim back a third time in January, and he asked him to lead this effort. \nHe has been doing so with integrity, skill, and effectiveness. As a \nmatter of fact, one commentator said even in the early months you could \nfeel that there was a new atmosphere and a new strategic vision and new \nleadership. It was filtering down throughout the system.\n  So to have a group like MoveOn.org suggest--not suggest but call him \na traitor and a liar, that is despicable. I cannot imagine anybody who \nwould not condemn such a statement. This is a patriot of the highest \norder. We have asked him to go into harm's way for the third time to \nserve the national interests of the United States, not serve President \nBush--to serve this Congress, by a 80-to-14 vote in May.\n  So I am telling you that we need to get serious. We sent him there by \na unanimous vote, confirmed him to be commander, and we voted to fund \nthe operation, fund the surge. That wasn't President Bush who put up \nthe money; we put it up. We asked him to come back and give us a report \non how well it is going. We asked an independent commission to give us \nanother report. We asked the GAO to give us a report. We have gotten \nthose reports, and it is now time for this Congress to make some \ndecisions. It is just that serious. This is a very important matter for \nthe United States. It is important for us.\n  You tell me about the morale of the military. People say the morale \nof the military is not well. They are doing beyond anything I could \nexpect. Reenlistments remain very high. I have to be amazed at that, \nand I know others are. We have a good reenlistment rate, and we are \nable to retain people and bring people into the military. They are \ngoing to Iraq and serving ably. As a matter of fact, in a moment, I \nwill share a report from some of our Alabama people who came by to see \nme and what they had to say about their tour there. So we have done \nthis, and we are now at a point where we have to make some decisions.\n\n  I have been asked: Well, has the situation changed since General \nPetraeus has made his report? I think it has, mainly because of what he \nsaid, not how he said it. I asked him back in January at his \nconfirmation hearing would he always be truthful with the Congress and \nthe American people about the status of this war and would he tell us \nif he didn't think he could be successful. He said that he would.\n  I asked him at this hearing: General Petraeus, when you came before \nus in January, before you went to Iraq, you had previously told me that \nno matter what happened, you would tell the Congress the truth. He told \nme that in private the night before. So the next morning, I asked him: \nWill you tell the truth to the American people? He committed that he \nwould. So at this hearing last week, I asked him:\n\n       Have you, to the best of your ability, told this Congress \n     the truth about the situation in Iraq today?\n\n  He said:\n\n       I have, yes, sir.\n\n  You can call him a liar if you want to. I don't. I believe he gave us \nthe truth as he had the ability to give it to us.\n  I asked him further:\n\n       General Petraeus, in your opinion, is there a circumstance \n     in which--in your opinion, is this effort in Iraq such that \n     we cannot be successful, that we would be putting more effort \n     in a losing cause if we continue it, or, in your opinion, do \n     we have a realistic chance to be successful in this very \n     important endeavor?\n\n  He replied:\n\n       Sir, I believe we have a realistic chance of achieving our \n     objectives in Iraq.\n\n  So we received the reports and the information. What did some of that \ninformation tell us? I cannot tell my colleagues or the American people \nthat this will continue, but, remarkably, violence in Baghdad is down \ndramatically. Remember, it was the President and everybody who \nacknowledged that if the large capital city could not be stable and was \nsinking into violence, there is no way we could have a peaceful \nsettlement in Iraq and reconciliation and make progress. We had to \nreduce violence in Iraq. The report General Petraeus gave us and the \ncharts he produced showed that civilian deaths in Iraq, in Baghdad, \nwere down 70 percent. In his report, he declared that civilian deaths \nthroughout the nation of Iraq were down 55 percent. Now, that is really \nbig. Remember, the surge didn't reach full strength until June or July. \nHe has only had the full surge in place for a month or two. So this is \nreally big.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. On his own charts, he showed that two-thirds of the \nreduction of violence took place before our troops even got there; \nisn't that right?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will respond to that. I don't believe \nthat is accurate.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is the chart, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The most dramatic reductions in violence occurred in \nthe last months of August and September. Regardless of that, I would \nsay the Senator is making a point I think I can agree to--that it is \nnot just the number of troops that are affected. General Petraeus is \nexecuting a strategy utilizing counterinsurgency tactics that are more \nsuited to the problems in Iraq and are proving to be more effective in \nreducing violence and protecting the civilian people in Iraq.\n  Mr. KERRY. I further ask the Senator, if the civilian deaths are down \nto such a degree that Baghdad is such a security success, why did the \nIraqi Legislature not reconcile on the issue of oil or \ndebaathification?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will give my best answer to that. We had the \nPresident of the United States and the majority leader in the Senate \nsay we had to have an immigration bill. They tried to pass it right \nhere on the floor of the Senate. They could not pass it. The President \ncould have stood on his head, and that bill would not pass.\n  Just because we think we can order the Iraqi Parliament to vote out \nsome law doesn't mean they can do that. So I am really worried about \nit, frankly. I am fully willing to acknowledge that it is a very \ntroublesome development that the Iraqi Parliament hasn't been able to \npass laws to carry out some of these needed reforms. But I don't think \nthey are going to be more likely to be effective in passing legislation \nif we precipitously withdraw, allowing violence to increase again and \nwhatever\n\n[[Page S11831]]\n\nelse might happen, with Iran expanding its influence.\n  I have to tell you that the substantial reduction in violence we have \nseen is not small. This is really large. If you told me when the surge \nstarted that we would see a 70-percent reduction in civilian deaths in \nBaghdad, I would not have believed it. I would have thought that would \nbe more optimistic than I was prepared to be. So whether it will hold, \nI don't know. We have seen some improvement.\n  I know the Senator from Massachusetts would like to speak. I will \njust conclude by saying, OK, we have had these reports, we have seen \nthis progress, and we know what the difficulties are. I have decided, \nbased on General Petraeus's testimony, the Crocker testimony, the Jones \nCommission report, and other information we have, that things are \nmoving in a better direction.\n  I personally believe it is the new tactics, not so much the number of \nsoldiers. I am very happy General Petraeus has concluded he can draw \ndown troops while maintaining this progress of reducing violence. In \nfact, he has recommended that within the next few weeks, a Marine unit \nnot be replaced. So that represents an initial reduction in our forces \nwithin a few weeks. Then the next reduction will come before Christmas \nwill be an Army brigade, and he would have 30,000 troops withdrawn by \nnext summer and would report to us again in March on whether he could \ncontinue this rate of reduction or accelerate it.\n  There is not that much difference, I say to my colleagues, in what we \nwant. Senator Levin wants to see troops withdrawn. He wants to see a \nstable Iraq. The question is, Do we do it with a mandated withdrawal \nrate dictated by Congress or do we do it in harmony with the situation \non the ground that leaves us in the best possible position to allow a \nstable, peaceful Iraq, an ally to the United States, to exist?\n  I think we should accept the report. We should see this as good news, \ncelebrate that some progress has been made and recognize that serious \nchallenges are out there. I do believe Congress has every right to \nmonitor this situation closely. We have every right to reject the \nPresident's recommendation, to reject General Petraeus's \nrecommendation, to cut off funds and order our troops home if we so \ndesire. I think that would not be a good decision. I think it would not \nbe in the long-term interests of the United States of America. \nTherefore, I oppose the Levin amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe Senator Nelson was scheduled to \nbe the next speaker on this side of the aisle. He had to do that before \n7 o'clock, so he will be unable to take that position. Senator Kerry is \nnext in line on this side. However, I understand he is going to yield \nto Senator Kennedy for a couple minutes for him to offer a unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  I thank Senator Kerry for his patience, as always. There is a lot of \nconfusion and difficulty in scheduling speakers. He has been extremely \npatient. I appreciate it a great deal.\n  I wonder if Senator Kennedy can be recognized for a couple of moments \nto propound a unanimous consent request, and then Senator Kerry can be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Levin and my colleague \nand friend, Senator Kerry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11831-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11831-S11841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3580, received from the \nHouse and is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3580) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act to revise and extend the user-fee programs for \n     prescription drugs and for medical devices, to enhance the \n     postmarket authorities of the Food and Drug Administration \n     with respect to the safety of drugs, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, every day, families across America rely \non the Food and Drug Administration in ways they barely realize. When \nthey put dinner on the table, they are counting on FDA to see that it \nis free from contamination. When they care for a sick child, they are \ntrusting FDA to make sure the drugs prescribed are safe and effective. \nFrom pacemakers to treatments for cancer to the foods we eat, FDA \nprotects the health of millions of Americans, and oversees products \nthat account for a quarter of the U.S. economy. The agency does all \nthis on a budget that amounts to less than 2 cents a day for each \ncitizen.\n  Yesterday, the House of Representatives approved legislation on FDA \nreform by a broad bipartisan majority of 405 to 7. Our House colleagues \nfrom all parts of the political spectrum united to send that bill to \nthe Senate with a resounding bipartisan endorsement. We cannot wait \nanother month, another week--or even another day. We must take action \nhere and take action now to send that bill to the President.\n  The stakes could not be higher. Funding for the FDA's vital safety \nmission is reaching the breaking point. Unless we act, the FDA \nCommissioner will send a letter tomorrow to over 2,000 employees \ninforming them that their jobs are slated for termination. This \nlegislation provides nearly $500 million in new resources for FDA--\nincluding over $50 million for drug safety and $6 million for review of \ndirect to consumer ads.\n  Americans are worried about the safety of the products they use--from \nfood to toys to drugs--and they are right to be worried. Dangerous \nlapses in safety oversight have exposed American families to \nintolerable risks from lead paint in toys, to bacteria in foods, to \ndrugs that cause unreported and lethal side effects. The right response \nis comprehensive, considered and bipartisan legislation--and that is \nwhat we have before us today.\n  At the heart of our proposal is a new way to oversee drug safety that \nis flexible enough to be tailored the characteristics of particular \ndrugs, yet strong enough to allow decisive action when problems are \ndiscovered.\n  A second major element of our legislation is a public registry of \nclinical trials and their results. A complete central clearinghouse for \nthis information will help patients, providers and researchers learn \nmore and make better health care decisions. Now, the public will know \nabout each trial underway, and will be able to review its results.\n  Our bill recognizes that innovation is the key to medical progress by \nestablishing a new center, the Reagan-Udall Foundation, to develop new \nresearch methods to accelerate the search for medical breakthroughs.\n  The bill helps preserve the integrity of scientific review by \nimproving FDA's safeguards against conflicts of interest on its \nscientific advisory committees, and it will end the abuse of citizens \npetitions that are too often used not for their intended purpose of \nbrining important public health concerns to the attention of the FDA, \nbut rather to delay the approval of generic drugs.\n  The proposal before the Senate today strikes the right balance on \nthis issue. It rightly states that the mere filing of a citizen \npetition should not be cause for delay, but allows FDA to delay the \napproval of a generic application if it determines that doing so is \nnecessary to protect public health. This is the right approach. It \nprevents abuse, but protects health.\n  The legislation also includes important reforms of direct-to-\nconsumer, or DTC, advertising. I thank Senator Roberts and Senator \nHarkin for working with Senator Enzi and me and with many members of \nthe committee on this important provision.\n  Instead of the moratorium included in our original bill, the current \nproposal puts in place strong safety disclosures for DTC ads, coupled \nwith effective enforcement. Under current law, safety disclosures can \nbe an afterthought--a rushed disclaimer read by an announcer at the \nconclusion of a TV ad while distracting images help gloss over the \nimportant information provided. Our proposal requires safety \nannouncements to be presented in a manner that is clear and conspicuous \nwithout distracting imagery. We also give FDA the authority to require \nsafety disclosures in DTC ads if the risk profile of the drug requires \nthem.\n\n[[Page S11832]]\n\n  Our legislation also takes important first steps toward a safer food \nsupply. These are only first steps--our committee will work on a \ncomprehensive package of food safety legislation in the fall--but they \nare important steps. Consumers and FDA have too little information \nabout contaminated food. Our bill creates a registry and a requirement \nto report food safety problems. Consumers will have information about \nrecalls at their fingertips, and FDA's response will not be slowed by \nantiquated and inefficient reporting systems. Our bill also establishes \nstrong, enforceable quality standards for the food we give our pets, to \nguard against the problems of tainted pet food that we have seen in \nrecent months.\n  In this new era of the life sciences, medical advances will continue \nto bring immense benefits for our citizens. To fulfill the potential of \nthat bright future, we need not only brilliant researchers to develop \nthe drugs of tomorrow, but also strong and vigilant watchdogs for \npublic health to guarantee that new drugs and medical devices are safe \nand beneficial, and that they actually reach the patients who urgently \nneed them. Congress has ample power to restore the luster the FDA has \nlost in recent years, and this bipartisan consensus bill can do the \njob. I ask my colleagues to approve this needed legislation without \ndelay.\n  H.R. 3580, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments of 2007, does \na great deal to improve the regulatory process and to strengthen FDA's \nability to enforce drug safety standards, particularly in the \npostmarket period. A recent study by the Institute of Medicine \ndescribed FDA's post-market drug safety authority as ``aging and \ninadequate.'' Currently, FDA's ability to address potential health \nproblems that become known after the drug has gone on the market is \nvery limited. This is a serious weakness in the present system that \nmust be corrected. This legislation will give FDA the authority, for \nthe first time, to compel a drug company to add warnings of newly \ndiscovered risks on the drug label. As a result, in many cases the \nhealth risks involved in using potentially dangerous drugs will be \ndisclosed to the public much sooner than they are today.\n  At the same time, this legislation makes clear that drug companies \nwill continue to have the same independent responsibility to update the \nwarning labels on their drugs in the future that they have under \ncurrent law today. If a drug company learns of new dangers that its \nproduct potentially poses to the patients taking it, the company has a \nlegal responsibility to immediately warn those patients of the risk of \ninjury.\n  By enacting this legislation, we do not intend to alter existing \nstate law duties imposed on a drug manufacturer to obtain and disclose \ninformation regarding drug safety hazards either before or after a drug \nreceives FDA approval or labeling. We do not believe that the \nregulatory scheme embodied in this act is comprehensive enough to \npreempt the field or every aspect of state law. FDA's approved label \nhas always been understood to be the minimum requirement necessary for \napproval. In providing the FDA with new tools and enhanced authority to \ndetermine drug safety, we do not intend to convert this minimum \nrequirement into a maximum. The Institute of Medicine and others have \nfound that FDA's past performance has been inadequate. While we fully \nexpect substantial improvement as a result of the enactment of this \nbill, we cannot and do not expect the FDA or this new process to \nidentify every drug specific safety concern before a drug manufacturer \nbecomes aware or should have become aware of such concerns. Nor are the \nbill's requirements that companies disclose certain safety information \nto the government intended to substitute for the disclosure \nrequirements that may be required under state law.\n  No one should be under the mistaken impression that the new \nauthorities and resources provided under H.R. 3580 lessen in any way \nthe obligation of a drug company to scrutinize vigilantly the safety \nsignals for their drugs and proactively study such signals or change \ntheir labels when the evidence supports such a change. This new \npostmarket authority for FDA is not intended to alter the drug \ncompanies' independent obligation to promptly warn consumers of a \ndrug's risks. Under current FDA regulations, a drug company is required \nto add new warnings to its labels as soon as it learns about new risks \npotentially posed by its drugs. The company must add the new warning \neven if FDA has not required a labeling change.\n  It is worth putting the situation in a little perspective. The \nlegislation increases FDA's resources for post-market drug safety \nefforts significantly. FDA's current resources of about $25 million are \nincreased by almost $55 million in the first year, to nearly $80 \nmillion. There will be increases in the next four years of $10 each \nyear, so that FDA's post approval drug safety budget will be at about \n$120 million in 2012. This is the entire budget at the FDA to collect \nand analyze post-market safety information and respond with appropriate \nregulatory action. FDA must use these resources to police every \nprescription drug on the market--thousands of drugs.\n  By contrast, the drug industry had annual revenues in 2005 of over \n$200 billion. To be sure, significant portions of these revenues \nsupport research and development, profits, and marketing of drug \nproducts, but a mere 1 percent of these sales exceeds the entire budget \nof the FDA. It exceeds the agency's budget for postmarket drug safety \nby a factor of over one thousand. Many major brand drugs have annual \nrevenues that exceed FDA's annual budget for postapproval drug safety. \nConsider the top 200 selling drugs in 2006: Merck's drug Fosamax Plus D \ncame in 200th in 2006, with U.S. sales of $140 million. Sales from this \none drug alone exceed the entire $120 million FDA budget for drug \nsafety in the last year of this program. The 100th drug, Abbott's \nKaletra, had 2006 sales of $350 million, nearly three times the FDA's \nannual drug safety budget for 2012. Thirtyeight drugs had U.S. sales \nexceeding $1 billion in 2006. The top selling drug, Pfizer's Lipitor \nhad 2006 sales of nearly $6.6 billion, an amount more than 50 times \nFDA's annual drug safety budget in 2012 under this legislation.\n  Clearly, the resources of the drug industry to collect and analyze \npostmarket safety data vastly exceed the resources of the FDA, and no \nmatter what we do, they will always have vastly greater resources to \nmonitor the safety of their products than the FDA does. It is absurd to \nargue that the FDA, even with the enhanced resources and authorities \nprovided by this legislation, commands the field when it comes to \npostmarket drug safety. The drug companies have the capacity to do a \nfar more comprehensive job. If we are serious about quickly alerting \nthe public to the health risks posed by drugs, the companies must be \nrequired to take the initiative in monitoring the safety of their \nproducts and immediately warning the public of newly discovered risks. \nDrug manufacturers cannot be allowed to ignore their responsibility and \nwait for the FDA to act.\n  To be sure, the legislation gives FDA the authority to command some \nof the resources of a drug company. FDA can order an epidemiological \nstudy or even a clinical trial, but this authority is not unlimited. \nCertain standards must be met before FDA can act to require a drug \ncompany to investigate a safety signal.\n  Importantly, a drug company has the ability and the responsibility to \nconduct these studies or clinical trials on its own initiative. Nothing \nin H.R. 3580 requires a company to wait and react to an order from the \nFDA for such a study or clinical trial, or to wait for FDA to order the \ncompany to change its label. The legislation retains the current, \nongoing requirement, found in section 502(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, \nand Cosmetic Act, for a drug company to ensure that its label is not \nfalse and misleading. This statutory imperative is recognized in \ncurrent FDA regulations. Section 901 of H.R. 3580 cites these \nregulations in the new section 505(o) of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act. These regulations obligate a company to propose a \nlabeling change to enhance a warning or improve safety information \nwithout waiting to hear from FDA, and allow the company to implement \nthe labeling change before the FDA has reviewed and approved the \nchange.\n  In most cases, a drug company will learn about new risks from its \nproduct before the FDA does. Usually, it is the\n\n[[Page S11833]]\n\nmanufacturer that possesses the information demonstrating a potential \ndanger from the product. It is imperative that patients and health \nprofessionals learn about those new health risks as quickly as \npossible. For that reason, drug companies have, and must continue to \nhave, an independent duty to warn drug users of the danger as soon as \nthe company becomes aware of it. Otherwise, there will be long delays \nbefore consumers are alerted, and the number of injuries caused by the \nproduct will multiply.\n  What should motivate a drug company to investigate drug safety \nsignals and take appropriate action to mitigate a safety risk? You can \nfind the answer in several places: from the simple moral duty to do the \nright thing; from the duty to one's customers, who use one's products \nwith the understanding, often promoted by direct-to-consumer \nadvertising, that the company's highest interest is to bring safe and \neffective cures to the sick and ill of the Nation; and from a duty \nunder State law to offer products that are free of defects, with \nadequate warnings about their risks. This legislation changes none of \nthese duties, in any way, whether they arise from simple ethics, \nprinciples of contract law, or of tort law. Rather, the legislation \nprovides FDA with additional resources and authority to be better able \nto step in when a company fails to live up to these responsibilities.\n  But some drug companies don't want to fully inform the public about \nthese risks to patients' health, and they don't want to be held \naccountable when patients are injured or killed by their drugs. They \nwould have liked this legislation to change the law to escape this \nresponsibility. These drug companies wanted to convert FDA regulation \nfrom a safety floor into a ceiling, from a minimum safety standard \ndesigned to protect consumers into a liability shield designed to \nprotect the drug companies. But Congress firmly rejected this approach.\n  If companies were allowed to conceal safety information until the FDA \nordered them to disclose it, consumers would continue taking these \ndangerous drugs without knowing their risks for months or even years \nafter the risks were discovered. Then, when the public finally learned \nof the risk, the drug company would be immune from suit for failing to \nwarn its customers. Those who were seriously injured by the drug would \nhave no legal recourse, even though the company had concealed the risk. \nThe company would completely escape accountability for its failure to \nwarn consumers. That would be totally unacceptable, and is not what we \nintend by this legislation.\n  Regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and product liability \nlawsuits against the manufacturers of harmful drugs work together to \nprotect consumers. Both are needed to force drug companies to disclose \nhealth risks posed by their products as soon as those risks are \ndiscovered. Both are essential to identifying dangerous drugs and \ngetting them off the market quickly. Effective regulation by the \nfederal government and litigation by victims of dangerous drugs work \nhand-in-hand to keep patients safe and make drug companies more \nresponsible. This legislation improves FDA oversight of postmarket drug \nsafety, and does not undermine or preempt the efforts by injured \npatients to seek redress under State product liability law.\n  Congress has stated very clearly in the legislation that we do not \nintend the new authority being given to FDA to preempt common law \nliability for a drug company's failure to warn its customers of health \nrisks. The legal duty of drug companies to warn consumers of the health \nrisks of their products as soon as those risks are discovered is \nessential to effectively protecting the public from dangerous drugs. \nLegislation designed to protect consumers from dangerous drugs must not \nbe distorted into a shield protecting drug companies from \naccountability.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of HR 3580, the Food \nand Drug Administration Amendments of 2007. This comprehensive bill \nwill enhance drug safety and provide key resources to the Food and Drug \nAdministration. I am pleased that the House passed this bill yesterday, \nand that we have a chance to act on it today. It's been a long road for \nthis bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote yes and endorse \nthe most comprehensive drug safety overt1aul in more than a decade.\n  This key FDA package includes four reauthorizations that must be done \nthis year, along with essential new authorities for FDA to be able to \nreact in a timely way to any safety problems that arise after a drug \nhas been brought to market. With this new toolbox, FDA has the ability \nto identify side effects after the drug is marketed through active \nsurveillance. FDA also has the authority to request labeling changes in \nresponse to new safety information, as well as a separate study or \nclinical trial to learn more about a particular, potential safety \nproblem.\n  Not everyone got everything they wanted in this bill. That is as true \nof me as it is of anyone. I am deeply concerned about the provisions \nrelated to labeling changes and liability, given that we do not fully \nunderstand the implications of that language. This new rule of \nconstruction was part of the House-passed language and not something \nthe Senate fully debated. If I would have drafted the bill, that \nlanguage would not have been included. But this is a compromise bill, \none that provides important new authorities, while preserving the \nquality we have come to expect of the agency. The changes made in the \ndrug safety components of this legislation are critical to restoring \npeace of mind to Americans who want to be assured that the drugs they \npurchase to treat illnesses and chronic medical conditions can be \nrelied upon and trusted. By acting today, we are ensuring that nearly \n2000 dedicated public servants at FDA can continue to evaluate drugs \nand devices in a timely and thorough way, speeding these discoveries to \npatients while protecting the public health.\n  These new authorities will assist the agency in quickly and \neffectively responding to potential safety issues, including making \nlabeling changes and requiring post-market studies to more fully \nexamine potential risks. In addition, this bill expands access to \nclinical trials information for patients and providers and creates new \nmethods to address potential conflicts of interest of advisory \ncommittee members to ensure greater accountability and preserve \nscientific integrity.\n  FDA currently has no mechanism for active, routine surveillance of \npotential safety problems. It cannot easily detect safety problems \nafter a drug has been put on the market. This legislation fixes that \nchallenge and ensures that FDA has the right tools to address drug \nsafety after the drug is on the market. The legislation creates the \ncapacity for routine, active, safety monitoring using large linked \ndatabases, what I like to call ``health IT for drug safety.'' I want to \nthank Senator Gregg for being the champion of this provision and \nensuring that we crafted this provision appropriately.\n\n  This bill also includes renewal of two key provisions focused on \nchildren--the ``Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act'' and the \n``Pediatric Research Equity Act,'' which together ensure that drugs \nused in children are tested on children; as well as a proposal that \nwill increase our ability to develop medical devices for children.\n  There has been a lot of attention paid to medical products in this \ndebate. But we mustn't forget the ``F'' in FDA. This bill contains \nimportant food safety provisions to better protect our pet food supply, \nand track when food is adulterated.\n  I want to thank my colleagues Senators Roberts and Harkin for their \ntireless efforts to provide an appropriate balance for direct-to-\nconsumer advertising. I would also like to thank one of my colleagues \non the other side of the Capitol, Representative Schakowsky of \nIllinois, for her constructive involvement in these issues. It was not \nan easy task to reconcile some very different opinions, and I am so \npleased that we were able to reach a resolution to this issue that we \ncould all support.\n  I would like to thank Senator Alexander, Senator Allard, Senator \nBond, Senator Dodd, Senator Clinton and others for their leadership on \nbehalf of kids. Finally, I would like to thank Senator Hatch for his \nwork on the antibiotics and other Hatch-Waxman issues.\n  On the other side of the Capitol, I would like to thank Chairman \nDingell, Ranking Member Barton, and\n\n[[Page S11834]]\n\nRepresentatives Pallone and Deal for shepherding this legislation \nthrough the process.\n  I want to take a few minutes to thank the staff, who have spent \ncountless hours over the past months negotiating and drafting this \nlegislation. This dedication to public service often overlooked. They \nspent many evenings and weekends away from their homes and their \nfamilies.\n  My health team worked overtime to get this bill to the floor and \npassed in the Senate. I would first like to thank my Health Policy \nDirector, Shana Christrup. I also want to greatly thank Amy Muhlberg, \nfor her work on drug safety, food safety and PDUFA. Her knowledge and \ndrafting skills were central to this bill. I would also thank Keith \nFlanagan for his work on the children's statutes in this bill and Dave \nSchmickel, our resident drug patent expert for his work on citizens \npetitions and antibiotics issues. I would also like to thank Todd \nSpangler who provided the required backup that goes with moving a bill \nof this magnitude. Finally, I would like to thank my Staff Director, \nKatherine McGuire, whose steady hand and negotiating and communication \nskills provided the cement for the entire process.\n\n  I would also thank Ilyse Schuman, my chief counsel for her precision \nand attention to the details. Finally, I thank Amy Angelier Shank for \nher great work on the budget aspects of the bill and my press team \nCraig Orfield and Mike Mahaffey. My Chief of Staff Flip McConnaughey \nwas great at putting out brush fires throughout the process.\n  Megan Hauck with Senator McConnell's office, David Boyer with the \nWhite House, Craig Burton and Vince Ventimiglia at HHS and Stephen \nMason of FDA were key to helping with both policy and process issues \nthroughout the negotiations.\n  On Senator Kennedy's staff, I would like to thank: Michael Myers, \nDavid Bowen, and David Dorsey. Senator Kennedy's staffers were \nreasonable negotiators throughout the process and open and patient to \nhearing all sides of any issue.\n  On the other side of the Capitol, I would like to thank Chairman \nDingell, as well as John Ford, Virgil Miller and Pete Goodloe of his \nstaff for their tireless work. Bobby Clark with Mr. Pallone and John \nLittle with Mr. Deal were also instrumental in the negotiations. \nRanking Member Barton and his staff Ryan Long and Nandan Kenkeremath \nwere outstanding. Yesterday, when this bill passed the House, Mr. \nBarton reported that Ryan had been up all night working on the bill and \nwas therefore wearing the same clothes as the day before. I would like \nto state for the record that all my staff showered today--I think.\n  Warren Burke with House Legislative Counsel and Stacy Kern-Sheerer of \nSenate Legislative Counsel were tremendous in handling a long and \ncomplex bill with lots of moving parts. There would be no bill without \ntheir efforts.\n  I would like to thank Senator Hatch and his staff Pattie DeLoatche, \nTrisha Knight, Remy Yucel and Matt Sandgren for their efforts on the \nbill overall, but particularly on the Citizen Petitions, antibiotics, \nand enantiomers provisions. Leigh-Anne Ross of Senator Cochran's staff \nand Landon Stropko of Representative Cubin's office were also key on \nthese antibiotic provisions.\n  With Senator Gregg's office, and for their assistance with ``health \nIT for drug safety,'' I thank Dave Fisher and Liz Wroe. Stephanie \nCarlton, from Senator Coburn's staff and Jenny Ware with Senator Burr \nwere also integral to many parts of the bill.\n  I would also like to thank my colleague from Kansas, Senator Roberts, \nand his staff Jennifer Swenson, for their incredible work on direct-to-\nconsumer advertising. I also thank my colleague Senator Harkin and his \nstaffer Janelle Krishnamoorthy for their hard work on this issue. \nLindsay McAllister of Representative Schakowsky's office was also \nintegral to the success of these negotiations.\n  I would like to thank Isaac Edwards and Amanda Makki of Senator \nMurkowski's staff, Tyler Thompson with Senator Isakson, and Jennifer \nClaypool with Senator Allard for their hard work and dedication.\n  Ellie Dehoney of Senator Brown's office was critical to reaching \nagreement on the Citizen Petitions and tropical disease provisions. \nMelanie Benning of Senator Brownback's office was also instrumental on \nthe tropical disease issue.\n  I would like to thank Mary-Sumpter Johnson with Senator Alexander, \nKelly Childress with Representative Rogers, Jennifer Nieto with \nRepresentative Eshoo, Ann Gavaghan with Senator Clinton, Tamar Magarik \nand Jeremy Sharp with Senator Dodd for their exceptional work on the \npediatric provisions.\n  And last, but not least, Cameron Bruett of Senator Chambliss's \nAgriculture Committee staff, Adela Ramos of Chairman Harkin's \nAgriculture Committee staff, and David Lazarus of Senator Durbin's \nstaff were extraordinarily helpful on the food safety provisions in the \nbill.\n  As you can see, this was a real team effort. I urge my colleagues to \nvote yes on this important bill. Patients are waiting. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \npoised to pass H.R. 3580, a bill regarding the Food and Drug \nAdministration. This legislation addresses many important health care \nissues and I commend the Senate leaders and relevant committee chairmen \nfor coming to agreement on this complex bill. I have been monitoring \nthe ongoing negotiations between the House and Senate on this \nlegislation because a slight variation in language between the two \nrelevant bills could have affected the claims of thousands of injured \nAmerican consumers.\n  Last week, I chaired a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the \nemergence of regulatory agencies like the FDA asserting that its \nregulations preempt all State laws, even in the absence of \ncongressional intent to do so. At this hearing we received extensive \ntestimony that the Bush administration has been using this approach to \nshield corporations from civil liability. This regulatory preemption \nmodel has been especially troubling in the area of pharmaceutical \ndrugs. Several times in the past several years we have learned from \nwhistleblowers and smoking gun documents that certain corporations knew \nof dangers in their medical products yet failed to adequately warn \nconsumers. Many consumers have been injured as a result of this \ncorporate misconduct and it is certainly not congress' intent to shield \nsuch corporate decisionmaking.\n  The legislation we are set to pass today contains a rule of \nconstruction making clear that Congress has again decided that we are \nnot preempting State law regarding the responsibility of drug \nmanufacturers to immediately notify consumers of dangers without \nwaiting for the FDA to act. Drug companies maintain the authority to \ncorrect their warning labels if they learn of any information that \ntheir products could harm consumers. These corporations can and must \nimmediately correct any existing warning that has been issued and \ncannot hide behind the Byzantine regulatory structure of the FDA to \nshield them from liability for causing serious injury. To do otherwise \nwould endanger all Americans who may be injured by their products and \nwould remove the important incentive the corporations currently have to \nmake their products safer and to adequately warn consumers of potential \ndangers.\n  Mr. HATCH. As the Senate completes its consideration of H.R. 3580, \nthe Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, I want to take \nthis opportunity to commend publicly the Food and Drug Administration \nand especially to express support and appreciation to the dedicated FDA \nemployees who work so hard to ensure the safety of our drug and food \nsupply. They are led by a very capable and hard-working Commissioner, \nDr. Andrew von Eschenbach.\n  In our race to legislate and regulate, we often forget the impact of \nour actions on agency employees and their ability to safeguard American \nconsumers. And so I want to take this opportunity to thank them for \ntheir work.\n  While I will not belabor the point here, as the legislation makes \nclear, the agency is operating under severe funding constraints. That \nis a pressing public health issue of great priority and the Congress \nmust work to address it in a meaningful way.\n\n[[Page S11835]]\n\n  With passage of this legislation today, we will end the protracted \ngame of ``chicken'' that threatened the jobs of hundreds of FDA \nemployees, the stability of the agency, and indeed the integrity of \nCongress, an institution which has been under public criticism for not \ndoing its job.\n  I am proud to support the passage of H.R. 3580. I want to applaud the \nefforts of HELP Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Republican Member Enzi. \nThey have worked tirelessly to ensure this bill would be completed \nbefore the expiration of the user fee programs at the end of this \nmonth. They have worked in a bipartisan way and they have worked very \nhard to embrace the views of each and every member of our committee.\n  Let me highlight some of the important components of the FDARA bill.\n  First, it is imperative that we continue the drug and device user fee \nprograms. This is true for one simple fact--the agency relies greatly \non the funding from these programs, and without it there would be \nunconscionable delays in drug and device reviews.\n  This is particularly important for Utah, a State with the hallmark of \ninnovation, a State which is the home to countless drug and device \nmanufacturers.\n  And while there are some problems with how these programs have \nworked--problems I have been pursuing, and will continue to pursue, \nwith the FDA--all in all it must be recognized that there is no \nalternative to the user fee programs being continued.\n  The drug safety provisions that Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Minority \nMember Enzi developed will be seen as an important hallmark in our \nNation efforts to improve the safety of pharmaceuticals that Americans \nrely on.\n  The food safety legislation that our colleague Senator Durbin \ndeveloped--again, that is a vital component. I am supportive of that \nlanguage, and especially appreciative to my colleagues for including \nthe three pieces of language Senator Harkin and I authored to make \ncertain that the new food reporting system did not override the Dietary \nSupplement Health and Education Act's regulatory structure and that it \ndid not supersede the serious adverse event reporting system for \ndietary supplements enacted last year--the Dietary Supplement and \nNonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act.\n  This legislation also includes many other laudable provisions. One \nparticular provision in this legislation establishes a new and enhanced \nmechanism for the prompt consideration of new safety-related \ninformation and sets forth strict timelines for the evaluation of such \nnew data. That provision is designed to ensure that all potential \nsafety-related labeling changes are promptly raised and duly considered \nby the agency in carrying out its statutory duty to oversee the \nappropriate and accurate content of a drug's labeling.\n  This new procedure is designed to implement a more thorough and \nregularized methodology for the consideration and implementation of \nsafety-related labeling changes and to ensure that FDA is the ultimate \nauthority in making certain that drug labels convey safety information \nin a clear and consistent way.\n  This provision, which adds a new section 505(o) to the Federal Food, \nDrug and Cosmetic Act, is designed to ensure that both the agency and \npharmaceutical companies are able to modify quickly with the agency's \napproval drug labels so that physicians are alerted promptly to new or \nincreased risks associated with a drug. The provision does not affect \nthe agency's general policy on labeling or its current labeling rules \nand policy.\n  Also, the legislation promotes pharmaceutical and medical device \nadvancements in pediatric therapies. The bill reauthorizes the Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Research and Equity \nAct which have been vital for important research used by doctors and \nparents. The final language on both these provisions is a good \ncompromise between the House and Senate bills.\n  Finally, it is my profound regret that the bill we consider now does \nnot contain the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, \nlegislation that Senators Kennedy, Enzi, Clinton, Schumer, and I have \nauthored. This bill is intended to offer consumers access to lower cost \nbiosimilar products, copies of such important medications as insulin or \nhuman growth hormone, while preserving the incentives for researchers, \nuniversities and manufacturers to develop and market the innovator \nbiologics.\n  I am extremely disappointed that the bill could not be contained in \nH.R. 3580, but I recognize the importance of allowing the House to \ndevelop its version in regular order.\n  It remains my high priority, and I believe the priority of my \ncolleagues as well, that this legislation be enacted in 2007.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, the Senate will send a bipartisan \nbill to the President that will improve the FDA's ability to assure the \nsafety of drugs in our medicine cabinets and the food in our kitchens.\n  The FDA is an essential guardian of the public's health and safety. \nIn recent years, FDA's reputation has been marred by drug safety \nincidents and questions about its scientific independence.\n  In 2004, the public learned that taking Vioxx, a heavily marketed \npain medication, increased your risk of a heart attack and stroke. The \nrevelation raised serious questions about how the drug manufacturer \nresponded to signs of a problem and how FDA handled disagreements among \nits staff.\n  The Vioxx episode and problems with other FDA-approved drugs in \nrecent years exposed significant weaknesses in our Nation's drug-safety \nsystem.\n  This year, Congress decided to do something about it. In addition to \nreauthorizing user fee programs for prescription drugs and medical \ndevices, we have engaged in a serious effort to improve drug safety.\n  The bill gives the FDA more tools to detect the safety problems of \ndrugs after they are available to consumers. It also creates an active \nsurveillance system that will help detect problems that were not \napparent during the clinical trials conducted prior to a drug's \napproval and it promotes greater openness by requiring disclosure of \nclinical trials performed by drug companies. Lastly, the FDA is given \ngreater authority to require drug companies to add warning labels and \nto conduct safety studies.\n  I note the provisions in the bill that give FDA the authority to \ncompel a drug company to make changes to a drug's labeling. That \nauthority should not be seen as an absolution of the companies' \nresponsibility regarding drug labeling. Consumers should be made aware \nof a drug's risks at the earliest possible moment, and drug companies \nremain responsible for ensuring that consumers are provided with prompt \nand adequate warning of a drug's risks.\n  We have noticed a creeping trend in recent years towards implied and \nagency preemption of state laws. Last week, a Senate Judiciary \nCommittee hearing looked at techniques that Federal agencies, including \nFDA, have recently used to assert that agency rulemakings preempt state \nliability laws. The drug labeling provisions in today's legislation \ninclude a rule of construction that makes clear that Congress does not \nintend to preempt state requirements regarding drug companies' \nresponsibilities. Rather, this legislation recognizes that State \nliability laws, including liability laws for improper drug labeling, \nplay an essential role in ensuring that drug products remain safe and \neffective for all Americans.\n  The bill addresses two other issues of particular interest to me, new \nrestrictions on conflicts of interest for FDA advisory committees and \nimportant provisions related to food safety.\n  I have been troubled by the large number of waivers of conflicts-of-\ninterest rules that FDA issues to members of its advisory committees. \nThe public depends on these committees to make independent assessments \nabout the safety and effectiveness of drugs. Including members with \nfinancial conflicts can erode the public's trust in the process.\n  When the Senate debated this bill in May, I offered an amendment with \nSenator Bingaman that would have limited the number of waivers to one \nper advisory committee meeting. While the amendment was defeated on a \n47-47 vote, the House included the language in its FDA bill.\n\n[[Page S11836]]\n\n  The final bill includes a 25-percent reduction in waivers over the \nnext 5 years. I would have preferred more of a reduction, but this \ncompromise moves us in the right direction and I commend the conferees \nfor addressing concerns raised in both chambers around conflicts of \ninterest.\n  On the issue of food safety, I am happy to report that the bill \nincludes food safety language that I originally offered on the floor of \nthe Senate. The language passed on the Senate floor by a 94-0 vote.\n  The language creates a new reporting requirement for food companies \nthat determine there is a significant adulterated food product in their \nsupply chain. Previously, companies consulted trade associations and \nattorneys to determine when to report significant adulterations to the \nFDA. Uncertainty about reporting requirements and an incentive to keep \nproducts on store shelves resulted in uneven, delayed reporting of \nsignificant incidents to FDA.\n  Under this new policy, companies will now be required to report these \ntypes of incidents to FDA within 24 hours of determining the presence \nof such an adulteration. These reports will trigger an FDA review and, \ndepending on the findings of the review, FDA would then have the \nauthority to require further action from the company, including an \ninvestigation, submission of additional information, and the sending of \nnotifications to affected parties in the supply chain. Companies would \nbe required to maintain records of reports and notifications for a \nperiod of 2 years. Failures to report incidents, falsify reports, or \ncomply with follow-up FDA requirements would be subject to civil and \ncriminal penalties.\n  The effect of this language will be to involve Federal regulators in \nthe review process earlier, resulting in faster recalls, alerts, and \nnotifications through the supply chain. Contaminated products will be \ntracked and removed from the supply chain earlier and faster. Recalls \nwill be more targeted to specific lots and batches of contaminated \nproducts. We will minimize some of the uncertainty around the extent of \ncontaminations once they are discovered.\n  This provision is an important step forward for food safety.\n  In addition to this provision, the language directs FDA to establish \npet food ingredient, processing, and nutrition labeling standards. \nPreviously, these standards were completely voluntary and did not carry \nthe weight of law. This section also directs FDA to establish an early \nwarning and surveillance system to identify pet food adulterations and \noutbreaks of disease. In addition, the language directs FDA to improve \nits outreach and coordination with professional associations, \nuniversities, and state and local authorities during recalls. The \nagency is also asked to enhance the display of recalls on its website.\n  The bill directs FDA to strengthen its coordination with states to \nensure the safety of fresh and processed produce and requires the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to submit more detailed reports \nto Congress on the number of inspections conducted each year and the \nnumber of violations and adulterants discovered through inspections.\n  Lastly, it includes sense-of-Congress language that commits this \nCongress to working on comprehensive food safety reform.\n  On that note, I want to emphasize one thing--the food safety \nprovisions in this legislation are only the starting point for more \ncomprehensive efforts to improve our Nation's food safety system.\n  For too long we have gone without updating the resources and \nauthorities for our food safety efforts, and a broad coalition of \nstakeholders understands that our system is broken. We need to close \nthe gaps in our current system.\n  Several months ago, Robert Brackett, Director of the FDA's food arm \nsaid this in response to the pet food recall, ``These outbreaks point \nto a need to completely overhaul the way the agency does business. We \nhave 60,000 to 80,000 facilities that we're responsible for in any \ngiven year. We have to get out of the 1950s paradigm.''\n  Also in response to this recall, Dr. Stephen Sundlof, Director of the \nCenter for Veterinary Medicine of FDA, implied the same when he said, \n``We're going to have to look at this after the dust settles and \ndetermine if there is something from a regulatory standpoint that we \ncould have done differently to prevent this incident from occurring.''\n  I agree with their sentiments and look forward to making more \nprogress on the issue of food safety.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Chairman Kennedy and Senator \nEnzi, for their cooperation and willingness to work on this language. I \nwould also like to highlight the efforts of the following members of \ntheir staffs: David Noll; Amy Muhlberg; David Dorsey; and David Bowen. \nI look forward to working with the Senate HELP Committee on future food \nsafety efforts. I would also like to thank Senators Harkin, Brown, \nHatch, and Casey for their assistance with this language.\n  In particular, I also would like to thank Chairman Kennedy and \nSenator Enzi for their extraordinary leadership and hard work on this \noverall bill.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I wish to speak on an issue that is \nweighing on the minds of many Members of this body, employees of the \nFederal Government, and patients in the United States.\n  Many people working for the FDA are faced with the possibility of \nreceiving a reduction in force notice if new user fee legislation is \nnot passed quickly. The FDA needs the necessary resources so that they \nmay approve drug applications within a timely manner. Being able to \naccess new drugs can allow patients to live fuller lives, and in some \ncases, save them from death.\n  I am frustrated by what I have seen as a desire to have a partisan \ndebate on an issue of liability. We have been working for some time now \non a bipartisan level to ensure that we have a bill passed by Friday. \nWe should not be throwing partisan politics into the debate during the \n11th hour. Because I am committed to working on a bipartisan level, I \ncontinue to hope that we will have legislation passed to ensure that \npatients can get the drugs that they desperately need.\n  Some believe that the Senate position on liability may have favored \nthe pharmaceutical companies. However, I am of the opinion that the \nHouse position favored the trial lawyers. Should we make any changes we \nshould also ensure that any labeling change authority would not provide \nfor an opportunity for partiality by the courts. I strongly believe \nthat every individual should be allowed to argue equally for their \nparticular case in court.\n  Currently the FDA regulation allows for labeling changes by accepting \nsubmissions from companies, and the company may make a label change. \nThis is referred to as ``changes being effected'' or CBEs. A company \nalso has the opportunity to discuss the change with the FDA before \nmaking a label change, since the regulations have a particular bound on \nwhat sort of changes can and cannot be made under this regulation.\n  The current authority may not be adequate to deal with all cases in \nwhich a labeling change may be necessary. An example that is referenced \nfrequently deals with a Vioxx label change in which FDA had been \ntalking to the company for 18 months. This situation has led to many \npending suits related to Merck's ``failure to warn'' people that the \ndrug had some potential side effects.\n  In the user fee reauthorizations this year both the House and Senate \ndecided to give FDA the authority to do an expedited labeling change \nprovision. In addition to this new authority, the House and Senate \nlanguage included provisions that made it clear that the ``changes \nbeing effected,'' CBE, regulations should still stand. However, the \nHouse and Senate took different stances as to how that additional \ninformation or regulatory option should play out in court.\n  The Senate-passed language, which was done on a bipartisan level, \nwould have established a new labeling change process. This language \nwould have also implied that if a company was already in discussions \nwith the FDA about the labeling issue, and attempting to determine if \nthe labeling change was necessary, then a future lawsuit would have to \nargue how the company was acting in an improper way. In this situation, \nthe FDA regulation would have ``occupied the field'' with respect to \nliability for failure to warn.\n  The House-passed language would have the opposite effect. Essentially \na\n\n[[Page S11837]]\n\ncompany would not be able to use the argument that they were in the \nmidst of discussion with the FDA as a defense. In my mind, the House \nlanguage is a huge boon to trial lawyers. It also makes it harder for \ncompanies that are working in the best interest of the patient to prove \nthat they are doing so. I have long been a supporter of reducing the \nopportunity for frivolous lawsuits, and in my mind the House language \nincreases this.\n  I would even be happy dropping both the House and Senate language \nregarding liability. This would leave a situation in which either side \nwould be on an equal playing field to argue a case on failure to warn. \nThis situation would allow suits to be determined on a case-by-case \nbasis. Congress would not be weighing in one way or the other.\n  The legislation that is expected to pass uses the House language on \nliability. It provides a source for bias in the courts and opens the \nfloodgates for frivolous lawsuits. This is a definite boon for trial \nlawyers.\n  As with many other instances in which Congress has addressed the \ndemands of trial lawyers, I am not willing to risk the livelihood of \nthe employees at the FDA or the health of my constituents who rely on \nthe drug applications approved by the FDA. I will not hold up the \nlegislation, but I wanted to take this opportunity to express my dismay \nat the partisan way that the liability issue was addressed.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for H.R. \n3580, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007. H.R. 3580 contains two bills \nwhich I authored, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Amendments of \n2007 and the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of \n2007. I believe these bills will go a long way toward improving the \nhealth and safety our Nation's children. The bill will also make \nimportant changes to our Nation's drug safety system so that the FDA \nhas clear authority backed up by new enforcement tools to ensure the \nsafety of prescription drugs once they are on the market.\n  As the original author of BPCA in 1997 and its two subsequent \nreauthorizations, I am proud to say that no other program in history \nhas done more to spur research and generate critical information about \nthe use of prescription drugs in children than this one. In 10 years, \nnearly 800 studies involving more than 45,000 children in clinical \ntrials have been completed due to BPCA. Useful new pediatric \ninformation is now part of product labeling for more than 119 drugs. In \nsum, there has been a twentyfold increase in the number of drugs \nstudied in infants, children, and adolescents as a result of BPCA since \nits enactment.\n  Ten years ago when Senator Mike DeWine and I undertook this effort, \nonly 11 drugs on the market that were being used in children had \nactually been tested and studied for their use. Prior to the enactment \nof BPCA 10 years ago, pediatricians were essentially flying blind \nbecause they lacked information regarding the safety and effectiveness \nof drugs they were prescribing for children. But it was children who \nsuffered the most from taking drugs where so little was known about \ntheir effects.\n  With BPCA, we have changed the landscape both for drug companies and \nthe FDA with respect to prescription drugs and children. However, we \nstill have much further to go because even with the progress we have \nmade so far, still less than half of all drugs being used in children \nhave been studied for their use. H.R. 3580 makes several key \nimprovements to BPCA that will better inform parents, pediatricians, \nand the public about the safety and effectiveness of drugs used in \nchildren. For instance, H.R. 3580 will improve transparency and \naccountability by making written requests for pediatric studies public \nand it will improve the accuracy and speed of labeling changes as a \nresult of BPCA studies.\n  However, H.R. 3580 represents a real missed opportunity to inject a \nmeasure of rationality into this program to ensure that it will \ncontinue to thrive well into the future. H.R. 3580 dropped a Democratic \ncompromise provision reducing the length of pediatric exclusivity from \nthe current 6 months to 4.5 months only for blockbuster drugs, drugs \nwith annual sales exceeding $1 billion. Five years ago and again \nrecently, my colleagues on both sides of the Capitol dome have \ncriticized this program over the 6-month length of the exclusivity that \nmay be granted if the FDA believes a drug company successfully \ncompleted the pediatric studies it requested of them.\n  Most recently, data released by researchers at Duke University show \nthat some companies receive as much as 73 times the amount they spent \nto conduct the pediatric trial under the 6 months of exclusivity. BPCA \nhas always been about balancing the needs of children with the cost to \nconsumers. That is why I strongly supported the provision I authored in \nthe Senate bill, S. 1082, which reduced the length of exclusivity to 3 \nmonths for blockbuster drugs.\n  I was proud to have brokered a compromise between the House and \nSenate of 4.5 months for blockbuster drugs because this agreement was \nthe right policy. But I am profoundly disappointed that the decision \nwas made to drop this compromise. When my colleagues seek to make \nsimilar changes to the length of exclusivity in 5 years, I believe that \nthe deal the House and Senate cut in H.R. 3580 will only make doing so \nmore difficult.\n  I must also express my strong disappointment that the final bill \ninserts a 5-year sunset on the Pediatric Research Equity Act. As an \noriginal cosponsor of the reauthorization of PREA and a long-standing \nsupporter of ensuring FDA has the authority to require pediatric \nstudies of drugs in certain circumstances, there should be no \nexpiration date on FDA's authority to ensure the safety of drugs in \nchildren.\n  The interplay between BPCA and PREA is changed slightly in H.R. 3580 \nfrom the Senate-passed bill. It is my understanding that H.R. 3580 will \nnot delay the FDA's ability to utilize PREA's authority to require a \npediatric assessment of new drugs that have not yet been approved \nshould a company decline a written request under BPCA for such drug.\n  Similarly, an exhaustion provision was retained in BPCA that would \nallow the Secretary to take up to 30 days to certify in the affirmative \nthat the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health has \nsufficient funding to initiate and fund all studies in a declined \nwritten request before determining whether an assessment under PREA can \nbe required. Although the Secretary may take up to 30 days to make such \na certification, the Secretary need not impose any delay before \ndetermining whether an assessment under PREA is warranted. As the \nGovernment Accountability Office found in its March 2007 report on \nBPCA, contributions to the Foundation for the National Institutes of \nHealth by the drug industry totaled a mere $4 million since 2002. While \nI hope contributions to the foundation will improve significantly, \nthere should be no unnecessary delays when it comes to important safety \ninformation about medications prescribed to our children.\n  Mr. President, BPCA has shown us that it is unsafe to simply treat \nchildren as small adults. Children face a similar inequity with respect \nto medical devices. Far too few medical devices are specifically \ndesigned for children's small and growing bodies. Experts say that the \ndevelopment of children's medical devices lags 5 to 10 years behind \nthat of adults. That is largely due to the limited size of the market \nfor pediatric devices.\n  When a medical device suitable for a child is needed to save that \nchild's life but it does not exist, doctors are often forced to ``jury-\nrig'' adult versions of the device or, in some cases, perform a riskier \nsurgery on the child. Ventilator masks, for instance, are far too large \nto fit over a baby's mouth. Often, the only alternative is to run an \ninvasive tube down the baby's throat.\n  Because of what we witnessed over the past 10 years with the market \nincentives provided under BPCA, I introduced an initiative, the \nPediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act, to create similar \nincentives for device manufacturers. I am pleased that this legislation \nis contained within H.R. 3580 and I believe it will produce tremendous \nimprovements in children's health.\n  This legislation streamlines the approval process for cutting-edge \ntechnology and establishes grants for matchmaking between inventors and \nmanufacturers and the Federal Government. It is my hope that the FDA \nwill\n\n[[Page S11838]]\n\nutilize its Office of Orphan Products Development to administer these \nmatchmaking demonstration grants.\n  Balancing safety with reasonable incentives, this legislation closely \nmirrors recommendations made by the IOM in its 2005 report on pediatric \nmedical device safety to improve the serious flaws in the current \npostmarket safety surveillance of these devices. Specifically, the IOM \ncalled for and the legislation allows the FDA to require postmarket \nstudies as a condition of clearance or approval for certain categories \nof devices and it gives the FDA the ability to require studies longer \nthan 3 years with respect to a device that is to have significant use \nin pediatric populations if such studies would be necessary to address \nlonger-term pediatric questions, such as the impact on growth and \ndevelopment. This provision should not be seen to encourage or promote \noff-label pediatric use of devices that have been cleared or approved \nfor adult use but for which there is no or limited safety and \neffectiveness data concerning uses in children.\n  H.R. 3580 will also go a long way toward restoring the public's \nconfidence in the FDA to protect them against harmful prescription \ndrugs and foods. For too long, the FDA has lacked the clear authority \nto require labeling changes when new safety information about a drug \narises. H.R. 3580 will change that.\n  For too long, the pressure on FDA to approve drugs has outweighed the \nnecessity to have a systemic, unbiased review of the post-market safety \nof drugs whereby the FDA can take swift action should new safety \ninformation arise. I am pleased that the drug safety provisions of H.R. \n3580 will require contain requirements that the FDA's office \nresponsible for post-market safety of drugs have equal footing with the \noffice responsible for reviewing drugs.\n  As the author of S. 467, the Fair Access to Clinical Trials Act, I am \npleased that H.R. 3580 contains many major improvements to the clinical \ntrials provisions. Physicians, researchers, and the public will now \nhave access to a clinical trials registry with information on results, \nmaking it tougher for companies to hide or skew undesirable clinical \ntrial results data.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Kennedy for his leadership on this \nbill and his willingness to work so closely with me to improve \nchildren's health. I would also like to recognize the many staff who \nput in long hours and weekends working on this legislation. In \nparticular, I would like to commend Tamar Magarik and Jeremy Sharp, of \nmy staff, who worked extensively on this bill.\n  Mr. President, the past several years have been marked with major \ndrug controversies--Vioxx, Ketek, Avandia--with millions of families \naffected. The public deserves better. The mission of the FDA, to \nprotect the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy, and \nsecurity of human and veterinary drugs, must be restored. H.R. 3580 \nprovides the necessary reforms to restore the FDA as the gold standard \nfor assuring the safety of the public for many years to come.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I stand here with a heavy heart. Congress \nhad the chance to reauthorize many important programs at the Food and \nDrug Administration and pass a targeted drug safety bill. Instead, we \nare passing a massive bill that triples FDA regulation and \nresponsibility, puts clinical data out in the general domain that may \nbe misleading to patients, and contains conflict of interest language \nthat could harm participation on the FDA's advisory committees--a key \npart of the drug approval process.\n  I will start with a good part of the bill. This bill reauthorizes \nmany important programs at the FDA, including the pediatric exclusivity \nprogram. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act was originally \nenacted as part of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act \nin 1997, legislation I sponsored on the House side and was reauthorized \nin 2002. The goal of BPCA is to encourage the study of more drugs in \nthe pediatric population. BPCA provides that incentive by giving drug \ncompanies an additional six months of market exclusivity to a product, \nor pediatric exclusivity, in exchange for conducting voluntary studies \nof prescription drugs on children.\n  Since its enactment, BPCA has been viewed as a highly successful \nprogram and has produced at least 132 completed studies, leading to \napproximately 120 pediatric label changes. According to the most recent \nGeneral Accountability Office study on BPCA, issued March 22, 2007, \nprior to enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization \nAct few drugs were studied for pediatric use. As a result, there was a \nlack of information on optimal dosage, possible side effects, and the \neffectiveness of drugs for pediatric use. Almost all the drugs--about \n87 percent--that have been granted pediatric exclusivity under BPCA \nhave had important labeling changes as a result of pediatric drug \nstudies conducted under BPCA. Exclusivity is working.\n  Senator Dodd tried to change the Best Pharmaceutical for Children Act \nby decreasing the exclusivity for some drugs. At a Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pension Committee hearing, witnesses expressed concern about \nSenator Dodd's idea and speculated whether it would decrease the number \nof drugs studied for pediatric indications. I am pleased that the final \nbill does not include that misguided change to the pediatric program.\n  From the beginning of the HELP Committee's consideration of the drug \nsafety issue I recognized the need to clarify existing authority or \nprovide the FDA with a few new authorities in order to improve the \ninteraction between the FDA and drug companies on safety issues. It was \nclear that labeling changes and clinical trials and studies were two \nkey areas in which Congress should act.\n  To that end, I offered an amendment during the committee markup that \nprovided the Secretary with additional authority and control over a \ndrug or biological product's approved labeling, including the authority \nto require the holder of an approved application to make safety-related \nchanges following an accelerated labeling review process. Under the new \nprocedures added by my language, if either the Secretary or the holder \nof an approved application became aware of ``new safety information'' \nthat the party believed should be included in the labeling, the other \nparty should be notified promptly, and discussions should be initiated \nregarding whether a labeling change is needed and, if so, the content \nof any such labeling change.\n\n  That construct made sense to me and it made sense to Chairman Kennedy \nwho passed the amendment by unanimous consent. Given that current \npractice today is for a company to call the FDA when they become aware \nof new safety information, I thought it was a good idea to put current \npractice into statutory law. I want companies and the FDA to talk to \neach other about drug safety issues.\n  I support the safety labeling language in H.R. 3580, which reinforces \nthe FDA's broad authority over prescription drug labels. These \nprovisions allow the FDA to mandate changes to a drug's approved \nlabeling whenever the FDA becomes aware of new safety information that \nit believes should be communicated in the labeling. Although the FDA \nalready has broad authority over drug labeling and must approve all but \nthe most minor labeling changes, this provision will enhance FDA's \nauthority and help to ensure that labeling changes are made \nexpeditiously using a process that facilitates dialogue between the \ndrug company and the FDA. FDA has comprehensive authority over the \nregulation of drug products, particularly drug labeling, and this \nprovision further accomplishes that goal.\n  As I said earlier, I have three main concerns with H.R. 3580. First, \nthe bill is a complex web of regulation. It is going to take months, if \nnot years, for drug companies and the FDA to understand all of the new \nregulations. I supported improving the FDA's authority in two areas: \nsafety labeling changes, and clinical studies and trials. This bill \ngoes far beyond those two areas and sets up a structure called REMS--\nRisk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. The REMS does not add any \nsignificant new authority. The FDA currently uses Risk Maps which do \nthe same things as REMS. Now Risk Map regulations, which have never \nbeen studied for their effectiveness, are becoming law. It means more \npaperwork, deadlines, and checkpoints for drug companies, with\n\n[[Page S11839]]\n\nno guarantee that it will improve patient safety. I do not support \nregulation for the sake of regulation.\n  Second, H.R. 3580 expands the scope of the Government's current \nclinical trials website, www.clinicaltrials.gov, and adds clinical \ntrial results. I understand the desire of some members to make clinical \ntrials transparent and the desire of scientists to have as much access \nas possible to clinical trial data. But I am very concerned that \naverage citizens will not understand all of the complex scientific \ninformation being presented to them and instead of talking to their \nphysicians to understand the data about adverse events, primary and \nsecondary outcomes, and baselines, they will instead avoid taking drugs \nthat could make them feel better or save their lives. I hope that the \nNational Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration are \nvery careful while implementing this title of H.R. 3580. If expanded \nimproperly, clinicaltrials.gov will frighten people, not educate and \nassist them.\n  Third, this legislation changes the FDA process for granting waivers \nfor participation on advisory committees. The FDA has 23 advisory \ncommittees that meet to discuss applications pending before the FDA and \nother issues. Currently, only four of those advisory committees have \ncomplete membership. Serving on an advisory committee is not a \nglamorous job, even though we rely on those committees to guide the \nFDA's approval and regulatory processes. Understandably, scientists \nthat serve on the committees have more to gain from doing their \nresearch and making tenure, than working part-time for the Government. \nGiven all of those issues, instead of creating incentives to work on \nthe committees, this legislation makes it more burdensome and complex. \nPeople have expressed concern about biased committee members, but the \nfacts demonstrate that the FDA is quite vigilant about screening \nindividuals to serve on the committees. And the FDA has been working on \nnew regulations to strengthen the screening process even more. I hope \nthat we do not see a slowdown in the drug approval process due to an \ninability to fill the membership of advisory committees.\n  Senator Brown and I also worked on language that would help bring new \nantibiotics and generic versions of old antibiotics to market. At the \nlast minute, that language was stripped out of the House bill in order \nto pay for a half month of pediatric exclusivity. I hope that \nRepresentatives Dingell and Barton hold to their promise of moving that \nantibiotics legislation in the near future.\n  Overall, I am disappointed that necessary FDA reauthorizations became \nvehicles for legislation that need more work, are overly broad, and \nwill weigh down the FDA at a time when we need to be helping, not \nhurting, the FDA.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, today the full Senate will probably agree \nto legislation--H.R. 3580, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments \nAct of 2007--that constitutes a massive overhaul and expansion of the \nFood and Drug Administration's authorities. Up until a couple days ago, \ndetermining the scope and details of the bill was an open and \nbipartisan process. Unfortunately, all of that changed at the eleventh \nhour and we were locked out of discussions to determine what a final \nproduct would look like. Now we are forced to either accept what we do \nnot fully agree with or cause thousands of FDA employees to lose their \njobs. This is not the way to ensure that we ``get it right'' with drug \nsafety.\n  While this bill achieves the important and necessary objectives of \nreauthorizing the Pediatric Research Equity Act, the Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act, the Pediatric Medical Device Safety \nand Improvement Act, the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments, the \nMedical Device User Fee Amendments, and establishing a scientifically-\nbased surveillance system for drug safety risks. There was still \nimportant work to be done to complete a bipartisan product. Because of \nunfair Democratic Majority tactics I and my colleagues have no \nopportunity to further amend and perfect this legislation.\n  Furthermore, I am frustrated that certain important provisions were \nremoved from the final language of the bill at the last minute. We lost \na provision to provide incentives for developing new antibiotics--a \ndisastrous decision at a time when we are seeing a huge rise of \nantibiotic resistance in this country. Last minute negotiators also \nrefused to recognize that patients desiring marijuana for medical \npurposes deserve to know critical information about whether or not \nmarijuana can be safely used. Finally, the final bill did not contain \nan important Senate-passed resolution to protect American \npharmaceutical companies' intellectual property rights around the \nglobe.\n  This legislation is a very delicate balancing act. No drug is \ncompletely safe--otherwise a doctor's prescription wouldn't be needed--\nbut we do have to ensure that lifesaving medicines are able to get to \npatients. New authorities in the area of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation \nStrategies, REMS, labeling, and postmarket commitments should not be \ntaken lightly. These new authorities we are giving the FDA need to be \nused based on a measured assessment of risk vs. benefit in the intended \npatient population. For instance, labeling changes should only be \nundertaken when reliable data clearly shows safety problems that are \nnot already reflected in the drug's label. If that data happens to come \nfrom a third party unknown to the application holder they should have \nthe opportunity to review it along with the Agency so that appropriate \nlabeling changes can be made based on sound science.\n  Another new authority granted to the FDA in a REMS is possible \nrestrictions on distribution and use. If used, this restriction has the \npotential to impede patient access to important therapies and therefore \nshould not be imposed where less burdensome approaches are available. \nThis concept of a ``less burdensome approach'' is an important one and \nit is essential that product manufacturers have the opportunity to \npresent alternative proposals to the Agency that would accomplish the \ngoal of safety without imposing unduly restrictive actions to products \nand ultimately to patients. This legislation establishes that the FDA \nwill not limit or restrict distribution or use unless a drug has been \nshown to actually cause an adverse event. We absolutely need FDA to \nhave all the tools necessary to ensure the safety and efficacy of \ndrugs, but doctors need tools as well, and one of those important tools \nis new drugs on the market. I appreciate the significant changes that \nwere made in this language of the bill between Senate HELP Committee \nmarkup and full Senate consideration. These improvements remain in the \nfinal bill and are critical to ensure that physicians--not the FDA--can \nmake risk/benefit decisions with their patients.\n  This bill ensures that the FDA has broad and exhaustive authorities \nto make sure that drug companies are doing the right and \nscientifically-justified thing when it comes to drug safety and the \nlabeling of their drugs. This authority is placed rightly in the hands \nof highly-trained scientists at the FDA. It is clear that Congress \nrelies on the scientists at the FDA to assess safety risks and \ndrug labeling and this should be squarely and solely the FDA's role--\nthat is why we have spent months and months trying to get this issue of \ndrug safety right. The newly expanded role of the FDA does and should \npreempt State law when it comes to drug safety and labeling. In order \nto ensure scientific drug safety the last thing that we need is the \nregulatory nightmare of every State court being a mini-FDA.\n\n  Let me be clear, the FDA is the expert Federal agency charged by \nCongress with ensuring that drugs are safe and effective and that \nproduct labeling is truthful and not misleading. Appropriate preemption \nof State jurisdiction includes not only claims against manufacturers, \nbut also against health care practitioners for claims related to \ndissemination of risk information to patients beyond what is included \nin the labeling.\n  Product liability lawsuits have directly threatened the FDA's ability \nto regulate manufacturer dissemination of risk information for \nprescription drugs. I note a recent case in California, Dowhal v. \nSmithKline Beecham, where trial lawyers tried to assert that a drug \ncompany had failed to warn consumers that nicotine-replacement products \nallegedly cause birth defects--even though there wasn't scientific \nevidence to back that up. In this case, the FDA had previously told\n\n[[Page S11840]]\n\nSmithKline Beecham that they should not include such an unscientific \nwarning in its label because it would clutter up the label's warnings \nthat actually were scientifically justified. A California court \nasserted that more warnings were always better. Subsequently, that \nassertion was overruled unanimously by the California Supreme Court as \nthe FDA again asserted that its scientific judgment should prevail. The \ncase was not properly before the court by operation of the doctrine of \nprimary jurisdiction. Unless State law is preempted in this area, State \nlaw actions can conflict with the FDA's interpretations and frustrate \nthe FDA's implementation of its statutory and scientific mandate.\n  Should the FDA's scientific judgment on drug safety and labeling be \nset aside, we would risk eroding and disrupting the truthful \nrepresentation of benefits and risks that medical professionals need to \nmake decisions about drug use. As a physician, I know that exaggeration \nof risk can discourage the important and right use of a clinically \ntherapeutic drug. Superfluous liability concerns can create pressure on \nmanufacturers to expand labeling warnings to include merely speculative \nrisks and limit physician appreciation of potentially far more \nsignificant contraindications and side effects.\n  I note that the FDA has previously stated that ``labeling that \nincludes theoretical hazards that are not well grounded in scientific \nevidence can cause meaningful risk information to `lose its \nsignificance.' Overwarning, just like underwarning, can similarly have \na negative effect on patient safety and public health.'' In this bill, \nwe have created a clear labeling pathway between the FDA and a drug \nsponsor in this bill to ensure that consumers get scientifically \naccurate and appropriate warning of drug safety risks.\n  Furthermore, if not preempted in drug safety information and \nlabeling, State law could conflict with achieving the full objectives \nof Federal law if it precludes a firm from including certain labeling \ninformation. If a manufacturer then complies with State law, the firm \nwould be omitting a statement required under Sec. 201.100(c)(1) as a \ncondition on the exemption from the requirement of adequate directions \nfor use, and the omission would misbrand the drug under 21 U.S.C. \n352(f)(1). The drug might also be misbranded on the ground that the \nomission is material within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 321(n) and makes \nthe labeling or advertising misleading under 21 U.S.C. 352(a) or (n).\n  While it is true that a manufacturer may, under FDA regulations, \nstrengthen a labeling warning on its own, it is important to understand \nthat in practice manufacturers typically consult with FDA before doing \nso. Otherwise they could risk enforcement action if the FDA ends up \ndisagreeing.\n  Some misunderstand the FDA's labeling requirements to be a minimum \nsafety standard and have used State law to force manufacturers to \nsupplement safety regulation beyond that required by FDA. I want to be \nclear that the FDA's labeling requirements establish both a ``floor'' \nand a ``ceiling.'' Therefore, risk information beyond what is required \nby the FDA could be considered unsubstantiated or otherwise false or \nmisleading. Given the comprehensiveness of FDA regulation of drug \nsafety, effectiveness, and labeling additional requirements for the \ndisclosure of risk information are not necessarily more protective of \npatients.\n  Finally, I want to specifically comment on language in H.R. 3580 that \nincludes a new mechanism to further encourage the timely and accurate \ncommunication of new safety information on prescription drug labels. \nThat mechanism reiterates the FDA's primacy in determining the content \nof prescription drug labeling, including through the new power to \ncommand a safety labeling change. New section 505(o)(4)(I) also makes \nclear that this enhanced safety labeling mechanism does not affect the \nobligation of a company to maintain a drug product's labeling in \naccordance with FDA's regulations, including 21 C.F.R. Sec. 314.70. \nThis provision is meant to confirm the basic obligation of a drug's \nsponsor to propose--or, in some cases, make--changes to the approved \nlabeling to reflect changes in the conditions established in the \napproved application and/or new information. Nothing in this rule of \nconstruction changes that obligation or FDA's ultimate authority over \ndrug labeling; nor is it intended to change the legal landscape in this \narea. That is because there is an overriding Federal interest in \nensuring that the FDA, as the public health body charged with making \nthese complex and difficult scientific judgments, be the ultimate \narbiter of how safety information is conveyed. In this manner, there \ncan be confidence that uniform drug labeling conveys clear, consistent, \nand scientifically justified safety and medical information.\n  In fact, the courts have repeatedly upheld FDA's supremacy over \nprescription drug labeling in cases brought under State law. Nearly 20 \nyears ago, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit emphasized \nthat ``. . . manufacturers cannot change the language in the product \ninsert without FDA approval,'' and accordingly ``[i]t would be patently \ninconsistent for a state then to hold the manufacturer liable for \nincluding that precise warning when the manufacturer would otherwise be \nliable for not including it.'' Hurley v. Lederle Labs. Div. of Am. \nCyanamid Co., 863 F.2d 1173, 1179 (5th Cir. 1989). As a more recent \nCourt expressed this bedrock principle, allowing a State to decide what \nwarnings are appropriate, and thus potentially subject companies to \nliability for otherwise FDA-approved labeling, would upset the careful \nbenefit-risk balance that FDA has struck in approving a product for \nmarket, and doing so would ``undermine FDA's authority to protect the \npublic health through enforcement of the prohibition against false and \nmisleading labeling of drug products in the Federal Food, Drug and \nCosmetic Act.'' Sykes v. Glaxo-SmithKine, 484 F. Supp. 2d. 289, 312 \n(E.D. Pa. 2007) (internal quotation omitted) .\n\n\n                          citizens' petitions\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to clarify \none issue related to the language on citizens' petitions and petitions \nfor stay of agency action which is included in FDARA. As my colleagues \nare aware, I was a cosponsor of the citizens' petition amendment \nincluded in the Senate-passed bill, and I was pleased to work closely \nwith my colleagues in the Senate--Senators Kennedy, Enzi, Brown, \nStabenow, Lott and Thune to develop an acceptable compromise with the \nHouse. I understand the importance of making certain that generic drug \napprovals are not delayed unnecessarily, which is the intent of this \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Indeed, that was an important objective of the Food and \nDrug Administration Amendments Act, and I agree the citizens' petition \nlanguage is an integral part of the final legislative effort.\n  Mr. HATCH. As my colleagues are aware, we had a number of discussions \nabout this provision, and one issue we worked hard to balance was the \nneed for the Food and Drug Administration to have adequate time to \nreview any meritorious issues raised by a petitioner against the \nimportance of not holding up the Abbreviated New Drug Applications--or \nANDAs--or applications submitted under section 505(b)(2) of the Federal \nFood, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Our colleagues, Senators Brown and \nStabenow, were particularly forceful in their arguments that there \nshould be a deadline for FDA action on a petition, but that the agency \ncould have the ability to delay review of an application if it found \nthat the petition raised a legitimate public health issue.\n  My concern, which I want to discuss with the chairman, goes to the \ndiscussions we had about the operation of that language. In particular, \nI want to discuss the ability of the agency to conserve its resources \nand not waste time acting on petitions that do not merit review. \nIndeed, the concept we discussed over the course of many days was that \nthe agency would have the ability to deny a petition or a supplement if \nthe petition were based on meritless or frivolous issues. We all \nrecognized, however, that defining ``meritless'' and ``frivolous'' is \nimprecise at best. So, the final language contained in the bill we \nconsider today says that the agency may deny a petition at any point if \nthe Secretary determines that it was submitted ``with the primary \npurpose of delaying the approval of an application and the petition \ndoes not on its face raise valid scientific or regulatory issues . . \n.''\n  MR. KENNEDY. The Senator from Utah is correct.\n\n[[Page S11841]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. One concern that I raised, which we all agreed would have \nbeen included in the conference report language had we filed such a \nreport was a clarification about the meaning of ``scientific or \nregulatory issues.'' It was our agreement during negotiations on FDARA \nabout what is perhaps an obvious point: if the law requires a delay in \napproval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application, for example because of a \npatent or an exclusivity, this new provision will not change that \nrequired legal result. The law is the law, and its effect should not \ndepend on whether or not it was brought up in a petition to FDA. I \nwould appreciate the chairman clarifying if that was the agreement we \nhad.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I do agree. Let us be clear: The citizen petition \nprovision is designed to address attempts to derail generic drug \napprovals. Those attempts, when successful, hurt consumers and the \npublic health. The citizen petition provisions are not intended to \nalter laws not amended by the provision. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                          Medicare Claims Data\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today we have before us an important piece \nof legislation, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007. It has come to my \nattention that this bill includes a section that makes an effort to \nauthorize the FDA to use and release Medicare claims data for use in \npostmarket surveillance of drugs approved by the FDA. I fully support \nthe goal of making drugs safer for all Americans.\n  As chairman of the Finance Committee, however, I am obligated to \npoint out that any use of Medicare data is exclusively governed by \ntitle XVIII of the Social Security Act, and that the Finance Committee \nhas exclusive jurisdiction over title XVIII. I would ask the \ndistinguished chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, Senator Kennedy, to acknowledge that the Senate Finance \nCommittee has sole jurisdiction over Medicare data and title XVIII of \nthe Social Security Act and ask that he endeavor to consult us on \nmatters before the HELP Committee that touch on the Senate Finance \nCommittee's jurisdiction. I make the same commitment to him that he \nmakes to me: I will commit to consult on matters before the Finance \nCommittee that touch on the Senate HELP Committee's jurisdiction.\n  To avoid unnecessary confusion as to the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee or further delay in the consideration of this important \nconference agreement, I would agree to accommodate your request to \nwithhold any objection to the Senate's consideration of it with the \nacknowledgement that the release and use of Medicare data are governed \nby title XVIII of the Social Security Act and are under the exclusive \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee. This does not represent any \nwaiver of jurisdiction on the part of the Finance Committee on this \nsubject.\n  I would ask the chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Kennedy, \nwhether he would agree to this request.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is a great pleasure to work with my distinguished \ncolleagues from the Finance Committee on this reauthorization of \nimportant programs at the FDA. I know they have a deep interest in \nseeing that the medicines that Americans take are safe and effective.\n  Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley have rightly raised a question \nregarding the interpretation of section 905 of this bill. Section 905 \nadds a new paragraph (3) to section 505(k) of the Federal Food, Drug \nand Cosmetic Act. This new paragraph establishes a system for FDA to \nquery databases regarding information that may help detect adverse drug \neffects. It is essential to detect drug safety problems early, so that \nthey may be corrected before people are hurt and an electronic drug \nsafety system is one important tool for doing so.\n  The Medicare claims database is listed as one of several possible \nsources of data in section 505(k)(3)(C)(i)(III)(aa). I want to assure \nmy friends from Montana and Iowa that our intent is that Medicare's \nparticipation will be determined by provisions of the Social Security \nAct, over which the Finance Committee has exclusive jurisdiction. \nNothing in this section is intended to infringe on that jurisdiction or \nto in any way preempt the ability of the Finance committee to act to \nspecify the participation or nonparticipation of the Medicare claims \ndata base in the system established under section 905.\n  The matter before the Senate amends the Federal Food, Drug and \nCosmetic Act. The section to which you have raised concerns authorizes \nuse of Medicare data ``as available.'' I acknowledge that under current \nlaw, that is not possible.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the chairman. I intend to continue working with \nmy good friend Senator Grassley to address the release and use of \nMedicare data by Federal health agencies and private researchers soon \nthrough legislation written by the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with my colleague, Senator Baucus. I have been \nworking a long time on legislation to permit the use of Medicare data \nto improve drug safety. After all this is some of the best and most \ncomplete data available. In fact, Senator Baucus and I joined together \nto introduce legislation to accomplish just that during the 109th \nCongress, S. 3987, the Medicare Data Access and Research Act, and this \nCongress, S. 1507, the Access to Medicare Data Act of 2007. Improving \ndrug safety is a top priority of mine and the appropriate use of \nMedicare data will likely enhance drug safety. That will benefit all \nAmericans. I look forward to completing our goals for Medicare data \nlater this year and including this on legislation within the purview of \nthe Finance Committee. We intend to clarify how Federal health agencies \nmay use and release Medicare data and make the appropriate amendments \nin the Social Security Act. At that point, it will be important that \nthe use of Medicare data be appropriately tied into the drug safety \nprovisions of the FDA bill under consideration today. We would hope \nthat our colleague, Senator Kennedy, would agree to make conforming \namendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act as needed to make \nFDA law consistent with appropriate Medicare law.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate that conforming amendments in the Federal \nFood, Drug and Cosmetic Act may be necessary as you point out. I agree \nto work with the Senator in the future on this issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord, without further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3580) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the New England Journal of Medicine, \nwhich is probably the most distinguished medical journal in not only \nthis country, probably in the world, has made the comment that this \nlegislation is the greatest progress, in terms of drug safety, in a \ncentury. This ought to be reassuring for every family as to the safety \nof their prescription drugs and also in terms of their food.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from \nMassachusetts on another landmark piece of legislation that he has been \nable to shepherd through this institution. It adds to a remarkable \nstring of legislative accomplishments.\n  We are all pleased this important reform effort and advance is going \nto be made. It is a terrific step forward. I congratulate Senator \nKennedy, Senator Enzi, and others on the committee who worked so hard \nto make it happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11841-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11841-S11848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008--Continued\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have been listening to my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, and sometimes I think we are talking past \neach other and about different legislation.\n  The proposal in the Levin-Reed-Kerry and other Senators legislation \nsays nothing about precipitous. I don't know how one interprets \n``precipitous'' when we leave the President the discretion to decide \nhow many troops he is going to have there for training, for prosecuting \nthe war on terror against\n\n[[Page S11842]]\n\nal-Qaida, and for the job of protecting American facilities and forces.\n  The fact is that for many people in the country, this is inadequate. \nIt is not precipitous. To have a debate about buzz words that excite \nthe base does not serve our troops well, and it certainly does not \nserve our national security interests very well.\n  We keep hearing these words ``surrender'' and ``choose to lose,'' and \nso forth. It is insulting to a lot of people who have spent a lifetime, \nsome who served in the Armed Forces, being told this by people who have \nnot, that they are somehow choosing to put a strategy in place \npurposefully that is to surrender on behalf of America or to lose on \nbehalf of America. Come on. It happens that a lot of people in the \nSenate and the country believe there is a better way to defend American \ninterests.\n  I will tell you, if you take a real measurement by facts of where we \nare with respect to American security interests--let me give them to \nyou: Iran is stronger than Iran has ever been in recent years. Iran \nloves the fact that we are bogged down in Iraq. Iran is strengthened by \nthe fact that we are bogged down in Iraq. Our own national intelligence \nagency has told us we are now experiencing more terrorism, not less, \nbecause of our policy in Iraq. That is our intelligence community \ntelling us that, that there are more terrorists, not less. Osama bin \nLaden is free and doing what he does out of Pakistan, talking on the \nInternet to the world, attracting terrorists, and plotting to attack \nAmerica. Hamas is stronger than it has ever been. They took over the \nGaza and are creating havoc in the West Bank. Hezbollah is stronger \nthan it has been. Al-Qaida is reconstituted.\n  Those are all facts. Do you know what they add up to? They add up to \na weak foreign policy, to a weak defense policy and, in fact, those who \nclaim and talk about surrender and about choosing to lose are losing \ntoday when measured against the real interests of our country. They are \nnot making America safer. Interestingly, one of the most important \nthings General Petraeus said in that hearing, in answer to a question \nfrom the Republican former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nsomebody respected and revered by people on both sides of the aisle, \nSenator Warner, are we safer?--General Petraeus couldn't say. He said: \nI don't know.\n  So I have had enough of this gobbledygook talk about ``precipitous'' \nand ``surrender'' and ``walking away from responsibility.'' The \nresponsibility here is to get this policy right for America and for our \ntroops.\n  Where is the accountability? We were told by the President of the \nUnited States last January, when he stood up and he talked to the \nNation, one of those big televised ``We are going to talk to the \nNation,'' he said to America: The Iraqis are going to do the following. \nHere is what they are going to do: A, B, C, and D. Then he said: And we \nare going to hold them accountable.\n  Then after the Iraq Study Group reported, everybody said: OK, we are \ngoing to wait and give General Petraeus an opportunity to report; we \nare going to wait for September, and we will see whether we are going \nto change the strategy.\n  What did General Petraeus talk about when he finally gets here at \nthis long-awaited moment that everybody is waiting for to measure the \nstrategy with respect to Iraq? He talked about tactics, about military \ntactics that do not amount to a strategy for how you resolve the \nfundamental problems of Iraq.\n  The Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, a moment ago pointed out this \ncomplete contradiction where they are claiming: Well, the streets are \nsafer and they have been safer for, what, 7 months, 8 months now \nbecause General Petraeus's own chart shows the vast preponderance of \nthe violence went down before our troops even got on the line.\n  One of the reasons it went down is because there has been a massive \namount of ethnic cleansing because the militias have done their dirty \ndeed across the country, and Baghdad, which used to be 65 percent \nSunni, is now 75 percent Shia. That tells you the story.\n  There is a total mythology here about al-Qaida, not mythology in the \nsense that they are dangerous and they are real. We all understand \nthat. Al-Qaida is a threat. Al-Qaida is a serious challenge to all of \nus in both parties, to the country, to every citizen. But al-Qaida is \nnot the principal problem in Iraq.\n  It was again interesting that General Petraeus, in answer to a \nquestion in the Armed Services Committee, was asked about Osama bin \nLaden and al-Qaida in Iraq, whether they were there at the beginning, \nand he said no. There is no connection between al-Qaida in Iraq and 9/\n11, none whatsoever, despite countless, countless references by the \nPresident, the Vice President, and a bunch of folks on the other side \nto try to link them together and confuse Americans, grab their \nemotions, get them in the gut, and somehow that is going to excuse a \npolicy that cannot find another excuse.\n  It is a disgrace, and it doesn't serve our national security \ninterests. I repeat, we are not safer in the grander sense of strategic \ninterests of our country. When you measure what they have done with \nrespect to Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, they have \na failed national security policy for this country--a failed national \nsecurity policy for this country. The measurement is given to us by our \nown intelligence agency, which tells us al-Qaida is reconstituted and \ncapable of attacking from anywhere.\n  It is obvious for everybody to see how we have lost leverage and lost \ncredibility and lost influence in the world. That does not make our \nNation safer, not in the least.\n  While we have waited for General Petraeus to report, a lot of young \nAmericans have died. Meanwhile, today in the Senate, we were distracted \nby this much discussed, much condemned ad in a newspaper 2 weeks ago. \nSome saw a chance to score cheap political points on the floor of the \nSenate. Instead of joining with everybody to condemn all those kinds of \nads and involvements in American politics that people do not like, the \nother side could not bring themselves to do that. But they have to have \ntheir singular targeted, one-entity specific, not even affiliated party \nentity, and go on and attack it. Frankly, it is as insulting as it is \nilluminating that in a week-long debate about Iraq, in which both sides \nhave just five amendments to try to affect the policy, the Republicans \ntook one of those amendments to try to, instead, play pure politics.\n\n  Mr. President, all of us opposed any kind of personal attack on the \ndistinguished general, and we said so at the time. I think I was one of \nthe first people to speak out and say so. But I am not going to join in \nsome kind of hijacking of the Senate for political purposes to score \npoints and create 30-second advertisements as a consequence of votes. \nIt is a disgrace, and it does a disservice to what we are trying to do.\n  We have had a lot of colleagues who have referenced the fact that the \nescalation of sending more troops into Iraq was to give Iraqi \npoliticians the chance to be able to make up their own minds about \ntheir political future. And we have heard a lot of people talk again \nand again and again about how there is no military solution. I know \nwhat happens in the sort of ``speech-ifying'' that goes on here, and \nthe repetition, I guess, of some of these facts. They kind of get \nglossy. They just sort of slide by people and people don't really focus \non the real meaning or the impact of what is being said as a result. \nBut the fact is, the President very clearly told America the rationale \nfor sending more troops was not to go out and secure a whole bunch of \ncommunities for the sake of having a general come here and say we know \nhow to secure a community.\n  A lot of us, in discussing the so-called surge, said at the time that \nthis is not going to be the thing that changes the fundamental dynamics \nthat are now ruling Iraq absent an increase in significant political \ndiplomacy and political strategic thinking. And in that, we have been \nproven 100 percent correct. The Iraqis have not made fundamental \ndecisions.\n  Let me ask you, Mr. President, what is the relationship between more \nsecurity and making a decision about how you distribute oil revenues? \nAre you telling me they can't get into a room and figure out the Kurds \nhave this much, the south has this much, the Sunni triangle doesn't \nhave any? The Sunni are 20 percent of the population, so we have to \nhave some revenue going to them from a national basis. Do you\n\n[[Page S11843]]\n\nneed security to make that decision? There is a complete disconnect in \nwhat is being talked about here.\n  Do you need security to decide whether you are going to allow people \nwho were formerly members of the Baath Party, but who were there \nbecause they were coerced or because it was the only way to stay alive \nbut who never took part in the excesses of Saddam Hussein, do you need \nsecurity to make the decision--and I am not saying you can get them all \nto go into the mainstream of the life of Iraq--but to make the decision \nas to whether you are going to let them go in? You need security to do \nthat? No. You need a political will.\n  I will tell you why they are not making the decision. It is not \nbecause of the absence of security. It is because of the fundamental \nreality of their constituencies. The Shia have spent 1,300 years being \nbasically subjugated by Sunni, and they have now been given at the \nballot box what they could never achieve in any other way. They have \nbeen given the right to run the country. And guess what. After what \nhappened in 1990, when President Bush, 41, excited the notion they \ncould take on Saddam Hussein and encouraged them to revolt, and they \ndid, and then we pulled the rug out from under them, tens of thousands \nof them were brutally murdered, and they remember that. That is the \nfreshest massacre in their memory. That memory says to them, we are not \ngoing to let go of this power very easily, especially when we now have \nan opportunity to have a Shia Islamic state, which is what they want. \nThat is what the constituency wants.\n  The Sunni constituency, which has been running the place for most of \nthose years--not every single one of them but most of them--has now \nbeen emboldened in the notion that they have to reject this notion of a \nShia Islamic state, and Iran and Iran's influence, and they have the \nsense that they can return to power. In that struggle is written the \nhistory of the IEDs and most of the ethnic cleansing and most of the \nviolence we have seen. Now, not all of it. Yes, al-Qaida has been \ninvolved in brutal incidents; and, yes, al-Qaida is trying to stir \nthings up; and, yes, al-Qaida was involved in the Samarra mosque and \nother things. We all understand that. But my colleagues are dead wrong \nwhen they come to the floor of the Senate and they tell us, or tell \nAmerica, that al-Qaida is the principal problem that keeps us doing \nwhat we are doing in Iraq. It is not true.\n  Al-Qaida will not survive in Iraq, in any kind of Iraq, if we are not \nthere. The Sunni have made a decision. And, incidentally, the Sunni \ndidn't make a decision that was based on security. The Sunni made a \npolitical decision to work with the United States, and then the \nsecurity came as a consequence of the political decision. The political \ndecision came first, and the Sunni made up their minds, and now they \nare, indeed, being armed, being trained, and fighting back against al-\nQaida because they got tired of al-Qaida's cruelty.\n  The Shia will never get along with al-Qaida because al-Qaida and al-\nQaida's beliefs and its attempts to establish a caliphate in the region \nand out of Iraq does not include Shiism. You are better off as a \nChristian or a Jew in the eyes of al-Qaida than Shia are in the context \nof Muslim and the faith of Islam. So the Shia, and particularly Iran--\nand I heard my colleague from Alabama turn to Iran as the reason to \nsomehow talk about what is happening with Iraq and al-Qaida. Iran is \nnot going to tolerate al-Qaida, not for an instance.\n  The Kurds are not going to tolerate al-Qaida. Al-Qaida is not in \nKurdistan, and al-Qaida doesn't do so well down there where the Shia \nare, and it is not doing so well right now where the Sunni are. The \njihadists, as opposed to the former generals of Saddam Hussein--al-\nQaida in Iraq is made up of a number of different entities, and the \nworst, obviously, are the jihadists. Those are the foreign fighters who \ncome in across the Syrian border or across the Iranian border, but they \nare the first who are going to find a massive unwelcome in Iraq because \nthey are foreign and because there is no way that either Sunni or Shia \nor Kurd is going to allow the jihadists to get a foothold of any kind \nof consequence.\n  The Baathists are using al-Qaida in a way because it serves their \ninterests to foment some of the problems because they are targeting us \nas well as the Shia, and they want to create this disruption. The only \nway to resolve that is through this political issue, and that raises \nthe question of, how you do solve it? There are some very smart people \nwho know more about Iraq and its history than I do who suggest it may \nnot be possible, for the time being, because of what has been \nunleashed--the opening of Pandora's box, or the genie out of the \nbottle, or whatever you want to say. It has changed the possibilities \nnow so that you may not be able, for the time being, to achieve any \nkind of legitimate central government or pluralistic society. You may \nhave to have this federalism that has been talked about for some period \nof time because they may have to live apart before they can live \ntogether again in order to prove you can get over these hurdles and \ncreate some governments.\n\n  Even today, we had a meeting with the French Foreign Minister here, \nand he mentioned how there is a growing sense among some Iraqis that \nthis may be the way in which you have to try to build a resolution. \nThose are the kinds of things we should be talking about in the Senate. \nThese are the kinds of things we ought to be pursuing in diplomacy. And \nwhere is the diplomacy? Where is the significant standing summit? I \nthink 3 years ago, when I was running for President, I talked about the \nneed to have a standing summit and a standing conference. Senator Lugar \nhas talked about it repeatedly, to the point of exhaustion, that you \nhave to have people who are talking to each other every day. You have \nto have envoys of consequence.\n  Why couldn't we have former President Bush and President Clinton \nserve as special envoys to convene and meet with these folks and work \nthrough these differences on a daily basis, with the notion that you \nare going to try to create a resolution, or find the resolution, like \nwe did in Bosnia and Kosovo, as we have in so many other conflicts in \nthe world?\n  As a young person, when I came into politics, I remember one of the \nthings I admired on both sides of the aisle was those titans of \nAmerican diplomatic history. During the period that I grew up, there \nwere people with names such as Acheson and Ball and Bundy and a host of \nothers, and some did better than others. Kissinger and then Jim Baker, \nwho I remember made 15 trips to Damascus just to get President Asaad to \nagree finally to Desert Storm. And he went the last time, on the 15th \ntrip, without even knowing what the outcome would be, but he knew that \nhe had to repeatedly be there and be in their face and cajoling and \nworking and moving the process.\n  There has been such a total absence of that kind of effort over the \ncourse of these last years, it just frustrates me to think about young \nmen and women on the front lines suffering these grievous injuries and \nbelieving in our country and in the idea of trying to help Iraq and not \nhaving the kind of support and policy that does justice to the risks \nthey are taking. It is stunning, Mr. President.\n  I believe, as Tom Friedman said the other day, negotiating in the \nMiddle East--without leverage is playing baseball without a bat. And \nthat is basically what we have been doing because we will not get up \nfrom the table. There has never been a baseball owner in history who \nwent into negotiation with another player and said: I can't get up from \nthe table. That is a negotiation that is not going to end well. That is \nthe negotiation we are basically in today.\n  The President of the United States has said to the Iraqi Government, \nwe are going to have 130,000 troops there next summer. It is already \nthere. What did they have to do? What do you have to do if you are an \nIraqi sitting there playing your game, knowing you are going to be \nthere, not us, forever, if you stay alive; knowing that you are able to \nuse the 130,000-troop promise of next year and you can just float along \nand avoid any kind of responsibility or decisionmaking and play your \nown political power game for the future? If you are already aligned \nwith Iran, as many of those politicians are who are Shia, in the \nmajority, they have no motivation whatsoever to compromise.\n  You have to change the dynamics. You have to change the play on the \nground. You have to get them worried\n\n[[Page S11844]]\n\nand get them thinking about legitimate implications of what happens if \nwe do something. Right now, when the United States starts talking \nmilitarily about Iran, they are not particularly scared because they \nknow the situation with our troops. They read the newspapers. They hear \nthe debate in the Senate. They know how overstretched we are. I mean \nthis is not complicated. We don't have the leverage that we ought to \nhave to get them to do what they ought to be doing--if they are willing \nto do it at all--and put it to the test to find out if they are willing \nto do it at all because we are going to have 130,000 troops there no \nmatter what they do next summer. We have already told them that. The \nsame number of troops we had last year when America said staying the \ncourse was not good enough; we want a better strategy, our strategy is \nto go back to where we were when the country almost disintegrated a \nyear ago with 130,000 troops.\n  The other thing we know is that we are not going to put enough troops \nin there to secure every single community. So when you push in Baghdad \nor you push in Anbar, and then somebody goes over to Baqouba, or \nsomebody goes over to Diyala Province or one of the other provinces, \nthey have infinitely more capacity to move around.\n  I learned that lesson a long time ago, back in the war of the 1960s, \nin Vietnam. We learned what it was like to go into these villages where \nyou don't share the culture, the language, you don't look like the \npeople, the religion--any of it. You are carrying guns, and they think \nyou are occupying their land. It is tough. It is tough on our folks.\n  What are they doing? They are going out and finding IEDs the hard \nway. I hear folks talking about these battles and the enemy. The enemy? \nThe enemy are IEDs. Obviously the people who plant them, but they don't \nsee them very much. Most of the wounded are from IEDs. Most of the \nkilled are from IEDs. This is not a set piece battle such as we have \nseen in a lot of other wars we have fought. It is not even the same \nkind of insurgency battle we have seen in a lot of other wars we have \nfought. It is very different.\n  I don't think we have been as smart or as thoughtful and creative in \nthe kinds of strategies we need to change it--particularly when you \nhear the Iraq Study Group and our own national intelligence entities \nall come together saying the American footprint is part of the problem. \nThe large presence of American forces is attracting jihadists, \nattracting terrorists, creating the impression of occupation. That is \nwhat General Casey said and General Abizaid. That is what the Iraq \nStudy Group has said. Everybody has said that.\n  What have we done about it? We have increased the presence. We have \nincreased the footprint. We have lent even more credibility to the \nconcept, as General Jones said, that we are there for the long run \nbecause we have this massive footprint with great big bases and \nunbelievable amounts of equipment. A whole bunch of people think we are \nnot just there to help Iraq, we are there for the long run, we are \nthere because we want to be there for much larger purposes.\n  I think we have to do this differently. The open-ended, seemingly \nendless commitment has clearly done nothing to directly confront the \nproblem. What we need to do, the responsibility that each of our \ncolleagues has, is to look at these kinds of dynamics and examine them. \nIf the Shia really believe what they believe and the Sunni really \nbelieve what they believe--and you can talk to them and read history \nand make judgments about it--then the troops are not going to change \nwhat is necessary for them to try to make some decisions.\n  GEN Tony Zinni--for whom I have great respect, who is former CENTCOM \ncommander, he travels frequently over there and meets with an awful lot \nof people--some time ago talked to me about an idea that has appealed \nto me very much over the last years, which is the need to negotiate a \nnew security arrangement for the region itself; if we were to become \ninvolved in trying to engage these other countries in that arrangement, \nwhich can be leveraged by the notion that we are going to pull back, \nthat we are going to shift responsibility to the neighbors to begin to \nbear some of the strategic long-term requirements--with respect to \nIran, for instance; with respect to the protection of the Gulf States--\nSaudi interests, Jordanian interests, et cetera--remembering always \nthat those countries are Sunni. An awful lot of the money that is \nreaching the 20-percent Sunni population who are resisting today is \ncoming from those places. So our friends and our allies are even part \nof the problem right now because we are going it alone.\n  Our strategy, in my judgment, is that while Americans fight and die \nto give Iraqis breathing room, Iraqi politicians refuse to resolve the \npolitical issues that matter the most. There is no progress on the \nlynchpin issue of sharing oil revenues, no progress on the \ndebaathification law--despite the fact they tell us, on the oil law, \nthey are sharing some revenue. That doesn't satisfy Sunnis, if there is \nno law. Gee, you mean we are getting a few revenues today at the grace \nof the folks who want to give us the spoils or something? What happens \nwhen things start to get rough? Is it still going to be there? Is there \na law? Is there a requirement? Does anybody have to live up to \nanything? Will it be enforced? Who will enforce it?\n  All of those issues are outstanding until they resolve that kind of \ndifference, so it doesn't satisfy me, and certainly doesn't satisfy \nthem, for someone to come and say they are sharing some of the revenue \nor they are putting some money into these other areas. By any measure, \nuntil you deal with the provincial elections, the constitutional issue, \nthe federalism, the oil, and debaathification, you cannot begin, if you \ncan at all, in the current atmosphere, to reconcile these differences.\n  General Petraeus can come back next March and he can say, oh, we are \nmaking progress, but if there is no political progress, then what are \nour colleagues going to say and do next March? Ask for another 6 \nmonths? Say we have secured this area a little more and that area a \nlittle more, give us another little 6 months?\n  I think as long as you give the Iraqi politicians as long as they \nwant, they will take as long as they want. As long as we say we are \nthere for as long as it takes, they will take as long as they want. \nThat is exactly what they are doing today.\n  That is our policy. The policy of General Petraeus is basically a \npolicy for staying, it is not a policy for winning, absent the \npolitical reconciliation. No one has shown how you get that political \nreconciliation. If it was doable, why couldn't it have been done in the \nlast 7 months? Why couldn't it have been done in the last 4 years, when \nthere was less violence 3 years ago, and 4 years ago, than there is \ntoday? Why couldn't it have been done? Because the political will is \nnot there to do it.\n  We have changed tactics, not strategy. Yes, we have some gains. I am \nnot going to stand here and say there are not some tactical gains or \nthat our military hasn't done a good job. They have done a tremendous \njob under the toughest of circumstances and they have made some gains \nin those communities. But it is not producing what you need to change \nthe overall dynamic in Iraq, if it is changeable in the current \ncontext.\n  What I regret is all this talk will see us back here in March. They \nwill not bring peace or long-term stability to Iraq absent diplomacy. \nIf we come back here in March and we have resolved the political \ndifferences, it will be because they decided to resolve the political \ndifferences--which they could do at any other time or could have done \nanywhere in the last few days.\n  So rather than ``no surrender,'' I think the policy we have today is \n``no real way out.'' There is no real way to resolve the differences. \nIt is a wing and a prayer. It is a hope. Even Ambassador Crocker, for \nwhom I have great respect; I presided over his hearing for his \nnomination to be there; I admire his career--he is a Middle East \nspecialist, an Arabist, he has been there, speaks the language, \nunderstands it. But in the conversations I have had with him privately \nas well as what he said publicly, it is clear to me he cannot say, with \nany certainty at all, what is around the corner, and he specifically \nsaid none of us can predict what is going to happen in the current \ncontext. That is what we put ourselves\n\n[[Page S11845]]\n\ninto, absent the kind of diplomacy necessary to try to change those \ndynamics.\n\n  I think what we are seeing are the moves of the President, who has \ndecided to wait out his time in office and shift responsibility for \nthis disaster to the next President. He has as much as said that, that \nwe are going to have troops there for a long time, and the next \nPresident is going to have to resolve these differences.\n  I believe we have a bigger responsibility than that in the Senate. I \nbelieve that very deeply. When I was a young serviceman and in a war, I \nremember looking to Washington and wanting those folks who were in \npositions of responsibility to make the judgments that affected my life \non a day-to-day basis.\n  I remember being bitterly disappointed in the debates that went on as \npeople kept finding these same kinds of excuses, the same arguments \nwere made. I remember President Nixon actually stood up and said: I am \nnot going to be the first President to lose a war.\n  Our military has not lost this. Our military has won everything they \nengaged in on a personal basis. Nobody doubts the power or strength of \nthe American military. No one would doubt the power or strength of the \nAmerican military if they announced that, because the Iraqis are not \nmaking their decisions, we are not going to stay here and keep dying \nfor you, folks. I don't think that is losing. I think that is actually \na note of reality. It is the Iraqis who are losing. It is the Iraqi \npoliticians, led by Mr. Maliki, if they are led at all, who are \nunwilling to make the decisions. They are the ones losing this \nopportunity for democracy. They are the ones losing the opportunity for \npeace. They are the ones turning their backs on the opportunity for \nreconciliation--not us. It is not for us to reconcile. No brave troop \nin Iraq has the ability to create that reconciliation. You are not \ngoing to create that reconciliation at the end of a gun barrel. It \ndoesn't happen. It never has.\n  I think it was the Roman historian Tacitus who, with respect to \nCarthage, said: ``They made a desert and called it peace.''\n  That is what you can do with guns and with military might. But those \nwho have always thought the power of ideas and the pen is more powerful \nthan the sword right now believe we have a better ability here to be \nable to find a way through this.\n  I think we ought to be refocusing on what we are doing. It is not \nprecipitous. It is not a withdrawal sufficient to please a certain \nnumber of people. It is the beginning of the change of the footprint. \nIt is a clear statement that we are drawing down and you have to assume \na certain responsibility.\n  There is a complete contradiction, incidentally, in the arguments \nmade by the other side. I remember visiting General Petraeus when he \nwas training people. Two years ago, he said we will have 125,000, \n200,000-something next year. How long does it take to train people? We \nhave been training people for 4\\1/2\\ years. We certainly have been \ntraining them for at least 2 years in a highly focused manner--2\\1/2\\ \nor 3 years. How long does it take to take our recruits down to Parris \nIsland or out to the Great Lakes, from total civilian status to \ngraduation? Three or four months. Then they go to a specialty school \nand then, within a few months, they are ready to go and serve on the \nfrontlines. They always do it with great distinction.\n  These folks have been training and training and training. The problem \nis, it is not a lack of training, it is a lack of motivation. It is a \nlack of commitment and will. It manifests itself in the following way. \nIf you are a Shia, can you safely go into a Sunni neighborhood and \npolice? Can a Shia go tell a Sunni what to do? Will the Sunni listen \nand feel safe? Ask anybody in the country about that equation. That is \npart of the problem, a lack of historical understanding, a lack of \ncultural understanding, a remarkable kind of arrogance that came out of \ncorners in the Pentagon, led by Secretary Rumsfeld and Richard Perle \nand Doug Feith and these other folks, all of whom talked about parades \nand flowers and the easy welcome of our troops and welcomed as \nliberators and every decision was wrong, not to mention the arrogance \nof turning their backs on the plans that the State Department and \nSecretary Powell drew up for how you deal with postwar Iraq.\n  We are paying for that now. I think those who argue somehow these \nbuzzwords of retreat and surrender--it is almost pathetic, to be honest \nwith you. Because it is so divorced from the reality of what is being \ntalked about, about how you strengthen America and strengthen our \nposition and support the troops. The troops deserve a policy that is \nequal to the sacrifice they are being asked to make.\n  Let me go through a couple of principal arguments and then I will \nyield the floor. First of all, those who want more of the same failed \npolicy, this surrender talk, it seems to me--I think I mostly covered \nthat. I think I pretty much discussed the idea, but I want to emphasize \nsomething. Leaving the President the discretion to fight al-Qaida, to \nfinish the training and standing up of Iraqis, to protect American \nfacilities and forces and to do so over the course of a year--to set a \ntarget date for the achievement of that goal a year from now is \nanything but precipitous.\n  They cannot achieve these fundamental benchmarks of what they needed \nto do to show they are reconciling in that year; they are not going to \ndo it while we are there.\n  Secondly, it seems to me you have to remember what General Jones \nhimself said. I want to quote from his report. He said:\n\n       If our security gains are to be anything more than short-\n     lived, the single most important event that could immediately \n     and favorably affect Iraq's direction and security is \n     political reconciliation.\n\n  So General Jones is saying: If you want to have an impact on \nsecurity, you have to have political reconciliation. He is not saying \nthat the security is going to be given to you by the military; he is \nsaying it is the political reconciliation--nothing will have more \nsignificance with the security.\n\n       Sustained progress within the Iraq security forces depends \n     on such a political agreement.\n\n  That is precisely what we are trying to achieve.\n  Supporters of the escalation asked for more time to translate \nmilitary success into political progress. But if General Petraeus is \ncorrect, that sectarian violence began decreasing in January. I do not \nhave that chart here, but I absolutely know this because we asked him \ndirect questions about that. And he spoke to the fact. He acknowledged \nthat the better part of the violence reduction did, in fact, take place \nprior to the American forces becoming part of it. It is partly because \nof the dislocation that had taken place as a consequence of the militia \nand also the political decisions that were made individually in Anbar \nand elsewhere which preceded the vast majority of those forces \narriving.\n  Now, Prime Minister Maliki has been in office since May of 2006. But \nthe fact is, the Iraqi Government, as we have discussed, has simply \nbeen absent from any kind of adequate responsibility to meet what they \nthemselves said they would do.\n  Now, why a deadline? I guess it is kind of like anybody doing their \nhomework--we operate under deadlines here. Does anybody here believe we \nget the budget done without a deadline that we usually have? We usually \nhave drop-dead times. In fact, we even move the clocks. We have a \ncontinuing resolution that is short-lived, and then we come back and we \nlive under a certain sense of, you know, a responsibility factor there \nand all kinds of deadlines.\n  The fact is, deadlines have worked in Iraq already. There was a \ndeadline to have the transfer from the Provisional Authority from Paul \nBremer. In fact, Iraqis and a lot of other people said: Do not do this \nto us; we are not ready. But the Government, our Government, to its \ncredit, we insisted and said: No, this is what is going to happen. And \nit happened. Now, the decisions they made afterward were awful. But the \ntransfer took place; likewise, the elections; likewise, the \nConstitution. Each of them was accomplished with a deadline.\n  In fact, the President himself has already set a deadline, in some \nways, because he is saying: We are going to have X number of forces out \nby such and such a time--30,000. That is a deadline. He has told us \nwhen--by next spring. General Petraeus has set a\n\n[[Page S11846]]\n\ndeadline that he is going to come back by next March and he is going to \nsay something to us. So this idea that deadlines don't work or it is a \nlosing equation, I just do not agree with that. I think, like any human \nreaction, when a big country like the United States of America gets \nserious in putting some deadlines there, people can begin to respond \nand you change the dynamics that people are dealing with.\n  What is more, some people may not like to hear this, but clearly and \nobviously an administration would have the ability to come back in 4 \nmonths and say: Look at all of the progress we have just made because \nwe set the deadline, and we are making so much progress, but we can't \nget over the hump by the end of this period. Will you not give us a \nlittle longer? There is no one here, if that is a true measure of what \nis happening, who is not going to respond responsibly.\n  So, again, this is a phony debate about the impact of a deadline, \nwhat it means.\n  We can get together in a room, sensible people, and come up with a \nway to do this. But it has been made into a challenge to the \nPresident's authority, it has been made into a big political football \nwhere Republicans feel they have to go out and defend the President, \nand somehow everyone else thinks everybody else is after him, when what \nwe are really after is a sensible policy in Iraq in the face of 4\\1/2\\ \nyears of having not been given it time after time, even under the \nwithering criticisms of some Senators from the other side, such as \nSenator Hagel, Senator McCain, and others, who have called the shots as \nthey saw them over a number of years.\n  Third. Supporters of the escalation point to the consequences of \nfailure in Iraq. Well, I can remember how people used the sort of \ncataclysmic, dire end result as a legitimization of carrying on \nsomething that was going into oblivion. It was called Vietnam. We had \nthe Domino Theory, we had the Bloodbath, we had all kinds of arguments \nthrown out there about what it would be like if the United States \nultimately withdrew.\n  Ultimately, we withdrew. Ultimately, Henry Kissinger and Richard \nNixon negotiated a withdrawal, and they negotiated a withdrawal with \nsomething that was then called the ``decent interval''; 1973 we left, \nand in 1975 the place fell because the Government itself was so corrupt \nand so inept and so incapable they were not able to withstand what came \nat them. They did not have legitimacy, but they were given the \nopportunity to have it. What ultimately happened is precisely what \ncould have been avoided 4 or 5 years later. Half the names that are on \nthat Vietnam wall down the street were put on that wall from a time \nperiod after which our top leaders in the Defense Department and \nelsewhere knew the policy wasn't going to work, and they have since \neven written exactly that. That is craven, that so many lives were \nlost, 25,000 or so, more than half, in that period of time to pursue a \npolicy that people knew was ultimately what could have been achieved \neven earlier.\n  So when people talk about the dire consequences, we all understand \nIran is a threat. Well, let's go back to what I said earlier: Iran is \nmore of a threat today because we are less capable of confronting them \nand because we have not engaged in that kind of robust diplomacy that \nthe French, the Germans, and the British engaged in for almost 3 \nsuccessive years without us at all, because we had a policy of not \ntalking to anybody; just do as I say. The result is, you know, they \nthrow out these consequences, so we wind up staying there because we \nhave been there.\n  I have heard people say: Well, you know, we obviously need to honor \nthe lives of those we have lost. Yes, we do. I believe that is what we \nare trying to do. I think you honor the lives of those who have been \nlost there and those who have given their lives by making certain that \nwe are not wasteful going forward, that we are reasonable, that we are \nnot stupid going forward, that we do what is correct. But you do not \nlose lives to honor the lives you have lost. That does not honor them. \nAnd losing more lives and the fact that we have lost lives is not an \nexcuse for continuing the same policy.\n  Now they argue it is not the same policy; we have a new general, we \nhave a new strategy. But it is not a strategy; it is a tactic that has \nno relationship to the real strategy that has to be political and \ndiplomatic and much more creative and much more global in this case.\n  So we have lost sight of what is at stake here. I believe we are \nparalyzed in a sense because of it. You cannot leave because of this. \nOh, gosh, Iran is going to do this. In fact, the Senator from Alabama \ntalked a little while ago about how Iran will become involved in Iraq. \nIran is involved in Iraq. Iran has thousands of agents in Iraq. It has \npeople training people in Iraq. The Shiia in the south are aligned, \nparticularly in the Basra area. But the British, nevertheless, have \nredeployed to the airport, and they have left those factions to kind of \nduke it out against each other without any serious enough consequence \nthat we are rushing in to fill the breach. If it is okay for them, why \nis it not for us? If it is not okay for them, why did we let them do \nit, and why are we not responding?\n  These contradictions just sort of leap out at you. And the fact is \nthat Iran and al-Qaida are thrilled that we are bogged down in Iraq. \nEvery day that we are bogged down in Iraq, we are presenting al-Qaida \nwith targets. We are presenting al-Qaida with the image of American \nforces occupying a country, and they can run around and enlist more \njihadists. They have been doing it. You can just talk to anybody in the \nintelligence community about it.\n  This is a policy which makes America weaker. This is a policy which \nputs America at greatest risk. This is not a policy which advances \nAmerica's larger strategic interests in the region or elsewhere in the \nworld. That is a bad foreign policy when that is what is happening. A \npolicy that makes you weaker, not stronger, is not a policy I would \nwant to take out to the country. That is exactly what they are \npresenting us with. Americans are dying at greater levels now than in \n2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, for a policy they have already told us is \ngoing to end next summer. And the Iraqi politicians know it is going to \nend next summer. That is a deadline. So, evidently, it is okay for them \nto plot and plan for the end of the surge, but they are not going to be \nchanged in their planning for the end of American involvement. I do not \nget that. That is a complete contradiction.\n  Fourth. The President's allies warn that Iraq could become a failed \nstate. Well, guess what. According to Foreign Policy Magazine, Iraq is \nbecoming a failed state under the current strategy. In fact, it ranks \nsecond in the entire world on the Failed State Index behind only the \nSudan as the state most at risk for failure. That will only change when \nthe Iraqi Government steps up, not our troops. Our troops cannot run \nthe Government, and most of the Iraqis have said they do not want us \nthere. Incidentally, the new polls coming out of Iraq show that 50-\nplus--58 percent of the Sunnis think it is okay to go kill and hurt \nAmericans. Seventy percent of the Iraqis think America should be gone.\n  Our friends warn of a humanitarian catastrophe. But as the New York \nTimes reported earlier this month, many mixed neighborhoods in Baghdad \nand surrounding provinces in Iraq have already been ethnically \ncleansed. Two million people are internally displaced, 2 million people \nhave left the country as refugees. Baghdad, as I said earlier, which \nhad a population when we went there of 65 percent Sunni, now is a 75-\npercent Shiia majority city.\n  What we are supposedly staying in Iraq trying to prevent is happening \nright under our very noses, and General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker \ntold us that in their testimony. Ambassador Crocker specifically \nreferenced the movement of personnel and the ethnic cleansing and did \nnot say that our troops or the surge is capable of stopping it. So we \nare witnessing right now a very high level of sectarian violence. Over \n1,000 civilians are dying a month.\n  Across Iraq, the level of violence is higher than it was in 2004 and \n2005. The Washington Post reported on Monday that about 2 million \nIraqis are displaced in Iraq and 2.2 million to the neighboring \ncountries. Apparently, 60,000 Iraqis are evacuating their homes every \nmonth. And what I have been told in the visits when I have been there, \npeople have described to me the exodus of the middle class. You do not \nhave the middle class there now to try to help do some of the \nreconciliation and building that is necessary.\n\n[[Page S11847]]\n\n  I have also heard many people point to the legacy of Vietnam. But I \nhear the wrong conclusions being drawn about that legacy--somehow a \npresumption that given the great power conflict that we were caught in, \npeople seem to forget that one of the reasons we did not invade the \nnorth was not that we did not have the military ability or other \nthings; it was because China and Russia and the Cold War was raging at \nthe time, and those countries were aligned with Vietnam, North Vietnam \nthen, and many people saw a bigger, wider, more complicated, and \ndangerous conflict as a consequence. So it was not our withdrawal from \nVietnam. People need to remember this.\n  You know, we did a period of Vietnamization, we did a period of \ntransition, we negotiated the process, we left in 1973. It was not our \nwithdrawal that caused the instability in the region; it was the \nunderlying cause of the violence that had gone on for 10 years \npreceding it. It was the American bombing in Cambodia that many people \nremember that created the instability of that country and China which \ncreated problems with the Khmer Rouge and the ethnic Chinese that \ncreated many of the original boat people, the original exodus. It was a \ncivil war, a civil war that our military could not end. Many of the \nconditions that came about were the result of being there and what \nhappened in that dislocation.\n  Our troops cannot end the Iraqi civil war. Only, again, a political \naccommodation can achieve it, and that can only come through adequate \ndiplomacy and effort. We ought to be working over time on that.\n  The final thing I will point out is, supporters of the Bush \nescalation say we cannot abandon the central fight in the global war on \nterror. I have pointed out again and again, as we all do, it is OK to \nhave a good debate about issues. But somehow the world's greatest \ndeliberative body ought to find a way to accept what is fact and accept \nwhat is fiction and kind of put the fiction aside and deal with the \nfacts, instead of coming back speech after speech repeating the same \nfiction, which is what happens. The fact is, we have never suggested \npulling any punch or reducing the effort to go after al-Qaida. We give \nthe President complete and total discretion in this legislation to do \nwhat the President needs to do in order to prosecute the war on terror \nagainst al-Qaida. So to keep reasserting al-Qaida in a way that \nsuggests that Democrats somehow are forgetting about that is not \naccurate.\n  In fact, we have been the ones who consistently point out that al-\nQaida is reconstituted globally, that al-Qaida's principal leaders are \nin Pakistan and Afghanistan, that it is from Pakistan and Afghanistan \nthey have plotted and conducted the attacks they have conducted in \nrecent months and plotted the attack against our airlines most \nrecently, and that they communicate to the world network, not Iraq.\n  The reality is, we all intend to defeat al-Qaida. Al-Qaida will be \ndefeated. I am absolutely confident of that. I don't think a \nnihilistic, cynical, completely ideologically, and morally barren \neffort such as al-Qaida's has a chance in the long haul. What it can do \nis confuse people and attract converts in the absence of a legitimate \ncounter moral force, and that moral force can come from moderate Islam, \nand needs to, and it can come from the rest of the world.\n  I have heard this all through every visit I have made in every part \nof the region. I serve now as chairman of the Near East-South Asia \nSubcommittee. I make a point of trying to understand what is going on. \nThe fact is, Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and the current torture \npractices that we know are being engaged in, and the world knows, and \nthe new 4,500 Web sites of various jihadist groups exploit those \nthings. That is the war on ideas the President appropriately talked \nabout, that supposedly Karen Hughes was appointed to lead a great \neffort on. Nobody has seen her or knows what is happening with respect \nto that most significant effort.\n  I don't think this escalation or this current policy is protecting \nour homeland. I believe where there was previously no threat from al-\nQaida in a place called Iraq, there is now a threat, though not the \nlevel of threat or the kind of threat that is often described. The real \nthreat remains centered in Afghanistan and Pakistan and many other \nplaces, including Europe. It is growing in Europe. Unless we deal with \nthese larger implications, that challenge is going to become more \nsignificant as a consequence of this policy.\n  This is an opportunity for us to try to do what I know is very \ndifficult, because I understand the pressures that are put on \ncolleagues, many of whom have come to the floor and spoken eloquently \nin opposition to the war and in opposition to the strategy. But they \nsomehow won't translate those words into a vote. They won't go that \nextra step of actually confronting the President and changing the \npolicy. What General Petraeus has obviously succeeded in doing--and we \nunderstand it--is giving people a reason to say: Give us 6 more months. \nHe is obviously going to get that 6 more months, because the President \nhas the power to veto and the power to move his policy in these next \ndays. But I hope my colleagues will think about how history is going to \nmeasure what we do here and how their own responsibilities measure up \nto what this moment is about. I think the facts speak loudly and \nclearly for the imperative to have a policy that moves in a better \ndirection to protect our Nation. That is the bottom line. That is what \nis at stake, our national security and our ability to protect future \ngenerations and stand up and lead the world in a more effective way in \norder to eliminate al-Qaida and, in fact, open up a whole set of new \npossibilities with Islam and a host of countries that are currently \nsitting on the sidelines and standing apart from us because they \ndisagree with our policy and the way we are implementing it.\n  I hope our colleagues will take advantage of this opportunity, and I \nhope we will cease to have a debate on buzz words and slogans but \ninstead a debate on facts and do justice to the troops who, as I said, \ndeserve a policy that is equal to what they are doing on our behalf \nevery single day. We salute them.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today we saw the floor of the Senate \nhijacked for purely partisan political purposes at a time when we need \nthe U.S. Senate to instead come together for the purpose of protecting \nour national security and changing a policy in Iraq that is not \nworking.\n  What happened in the Senate today is partisan, political and \ndemeaning of this institution. The Republican minority is desperate to \ndistract the Senate and our country from the real issue at hand, which \nis a failed escalation and an administration policy in Iraq that is \nevery day costing American blood and treasure. The same Senators who \nhave gone along with the President's Iraq policy every step of the way, \nwho have expressed not a shred of outrage about nonexistent weapons of \nmass destruction, predictions of a ``cakewalk,'' ``mission \naccomplished,'' or ``an insurgency, its last throes'' will now say and \ndo anything to avoid talking about what is really happening in Iraq. \nThey would rather express outrage about a newspaper ad run by an \nindependent entity, than express outrage about a policy pursued by \ntheir party and their administration. And certainly they don't want to \naddress the outrage of more Americans dying for a policy we know is not \nworking.\n  The Senate did not need to spend hours today on this debate. Nine \ndays ago, the first time I was asked about the ad which the Senator \nfrom Texas loves to talk about, I said it was ``over the top'' and \n``inappropriate, period.'' I said that, as a veteran, I thought it was \nwrong to characterize any member of the military in the way General \nPetraeus was characterized in that advertisement. I have nothing but \nrespect for General Petraeus. I wasn't alone in that feeling. Senator \nReid spoke out. Senator Biden spoke out. There was no question about \nwhere Democrats stood. And we ratified that opinion in a broad \ncondemnation of that behavior--including the Petraeus ad--in the Boxer \namendment.\n  But I also asked that we all recognize that the emotion behind that \nad is an emotion shared by the American people: frustration--\nfrustration as we head into the 5th year of being told one thing about \nIraq and finding out another. That is why we should be having a real \ndebate and a real discussion about the policy in Iraq rather than \ntrying to score partisan points over the politics of Iraq. It is as \ninsulting as it is illuminating that in a week-long debate in which \neach side can offer just\n\n[[Page S11848]]\n\nfive amendments, the Republicans would waste one of their chances to \nchange a broken policy by choosing instead to embrace a political \nstunt.\n  We are where we are. I vehemently oppose the kind of political abuse \nof the Senate embodied in the Cornyn amendment, and I am saddened if \nnot surprised to see that so many of the Republicans who believe that \nwhat happened to General Petraeus was wrong, could not bring themselves \nto vote for the Boxer amendment which made clear that the assault on \nSenator Cleland's patriotism in 2002 was wrong, and that the lies \nbroadcast about my own military record in 2004 were also wrong. The \nvotes against the Boxer amendment--an amendment which makes clear our \ndisagreement with the ad which ran September 10--speak volumes about \nthe partisan motivations behind the Cornyn amendment, and the fact \nthat, apparently, many of our colleagues believe that attacking the \nintegrity of veterans and members of the military is fair game as long \nas they are Democrats. I would remind them that when you sign up for \nmilitary duty, no one asks whether you are a Democrat or Republican, \nliberal, or conservative.\n  Over the last years, I have defended veterans who have been under \nassault from any quarters, left or right. I spoke out in 2000 when John \nMcCain's integrity and military record was questioned by the Bush \ncampaign in South Carolina. I spoke out when Max Cleland's patriotism \nwas savaged by people who had never worn the uniform. I defended Jack \nMurtha when vicious partisans on the right called that decorated marine \na ``coward.'' I spoke out when the Bush administration questioned the \npatriotism of career military men and Generals throughout the war in \nIraq, whether it was General Shinseki, or many in uniform who spoke out \nagainst Secretary Rumsfeld. I don't reserve my defense of patriotism \nfor Democrats, I defend all who have worn the uniform, whether they \nagree with me or not. I wish I could say the same for those who brought \nforward the Cornyn amendment and voted against the Boxer amendment.\n  This was not a proud day in the Senate, or a high mark in our \npolitics; rather, it was hours lost and time wasted when the Senate \nshould have delivered what all the men and women of the armed forces \ntruly deserve: a policy equal to their sacrifice.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I opposed the amendments offered by \nSenators Cornyn and Boxer because they were a diversion from the real \nissue before us; namely, the future of our military involvement in \nIraq. I disagreed with the language used in all of the ads addressed in \nthese amendments, but we should not let those ads sidetrack the real \nwork of the Senate.

Mr. President, earlier today, the President announced \nhis intention to veto the extension of the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram bill. I believe such a veto would be a terrible mistake.\n  One of the very first bills I cosponsored when I first came to the \nSenate was legislation to create the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, or SCHIP as it has become known. It provides health care \ncoverage for children in families where the parents do not have \nsufficient income to purchase health insurance and are not getting \nhealth insurance in the workplace, and yet they make a bit too much \nmoney to qualify for coverage under the State's Medicaid program. So \nthese low-income children in working families have been falling through \nthe cracks. That is why this law has been so important.\n  I remember it well that Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, and Senator \nRockefeller all came up to me to enlist my support. I was very eager to \nsign on as one of the original cosponsors of this law because I knew it \ncould make such a positive difference. Indeed, it has.\n  Since 1997, the SCHIP program has contributed to a one-third decline \nin the rate of uninsured low-income children. Today, an estimated 6.6 \nmillion children, including more than 14,500 children living in Maine, \nreceive health care coverage through this program. Still, there is more \nwe could do.\n  While Maine ranks among the top four States in reducing the number of \nuninsured children, we still have more than 20,000 children in our \nState who lack coverage. Nationally, about 9 million children remain \nuninsured. That is why I was so pleased to hear the conferees appeared \nto be very near to an agreement that is modeled on the legislation that \npassed the Senate in August with strong bipartisan support, in fact, by \na vote of 68 to 31.\n  Our Senate bill increases funding for the SCHIP program by $35 \nmillion over the next 5 years, a level that is sufficient to maintain \ncoverage for all 6.6 million children currently enrolled, and it would \nalso allow the program to expand to cover an additional 3.3 million \nlow-income children. In Maine, this legislation would allow us to cover \nan additional 11,000 low-income children who are currently eligible for \nthe SCHIP program but not enrolled.\n  I urge the administration to take a second look at the Senate bill, \nthe bill that is the basis for the conference agreement. This \nlegislation has made a real difference in the lives of working families \nwith low-income children across this country. It is helping to ensure \nthese children grow up to be healthy adults. Surely, we can get this \ndone on a bipartisan basis before the program is scheduled to expire on \nSeptember 30.\n  I urge the President of the United States to reconsider his threat to \nveto this vital program, this highly successful program that has a \nproven track record of reducing the number of children who lack health \ninsurance. If the President does proceed to veto the bill, I will vote \nto override his veto. Surely, this bill has a track record that has \nmade a real difference to low-income children in working families. We \nsimply cannot allow this program to expire. The extension and expansion \nwe are proposing will enable us to more fully cover these children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11848-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11848-S11849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL GEORGE SHERMAN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on Wednesday, September 5, 2007, the State \nof Nevada and our Nation lost a true hero: Retired U.S. Army Air Corp \nLTC George Sherman., who served our Nation during World War II as a \nmember of the famed Tuskegee Airmen.\n  Like so many African-American soldiers during that time, Colonel \nSherman answered the call to fight for freedom and justice abroad, even \nwhen it was categorically denied at home. These men traveled and fought \nthousands of miles from their families--when every day, their mothers, \nfathers, sisters and brothers faced injustice at home.\n  While our Nation can never fully repay the debt to our veterans, in \nMarch of this year Congress officially thanked Colonel Sherman and his \nfellow Tuskegee Airmen for their service to our Nation. Colonel Sherman \njoined nearly 300 other Tuskegee Airmen in the Capitol Rotunda as \nthousands watched President Bush and leaders from the House and Senate \naward them the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  Colonel Sherman and the Tuskagee Airmen were in prestigious company \nin receiving the highest honor our Nation can bestow upon private \ncitizens. Other honorees include individuals such President Harry \nTruman, Jackie Robinson, Reverend Billy Graham, Rosa Parks, and Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr.\n  I was pleased to have the opportunity to watch Colonel Sherman and \nhis fellow Tuskegee Airmen proudly take their place among all American \nheroes. Yet in addition to their accomplishments as Tuskegee Airmen, \nColonel Sherman and many others continued to serve their country and \nlocal communities.\n  Colonel Sherman had a long record of service to Nevada. After 22 \nyears of military service, he made his home in Las Vegas. Colonel \nSherman was a tireless supporter of the Boy Scouts of America, where he \nearned the highest\n\n[[Page S11849]]\n\nhonor of the Silver Beaver Award. He was active in the Kappa Alpha Psi \nFraternity, which supports achievement in every field of human \nendeavor. Colonel Sherman also served on the board of directors of the \nNevada Black Chamber of Commerce. And he continued to inspire young \npeople to pursue opportunities in aviation though numerous speaking \nengagements across southern Nevada.\n  Again, Mr. President, we have lost a true hero. Our thoughts are with \nhis family and loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11849-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11849-S11850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTES TO RUTH MULAN CHU CHAO\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a woman whose \nlife, to a remarkable degree, traced the very arc of the American \ndream. Ruth Mulan Chu Chao returned home to the Lord on August 2, 2007, \nand today is the Seventh Seventh Day of her departure, an important day \nin Chinese tradition.\n  The story of her struggle to bring hope and opportunity to a family \nthat had verged on losing both is an inspiration to all who knew her. \nOn August 11, 2007, I had the honor of retelling my mother-in-law's \nlife story at a private celebration of life and thanksgiving service in \nNew York City that was attended by her many family, friends, admirers, \nand acquaintances.\n  It is my hope that by preserving my tribute, along with that of my \nwife, Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao, that the memory of this \nremarkable woman will live on not only for the benefit of those who \nknew her but for all who cherish the promise of America. May its \nplacement in the Congressional Record serve as a lasting tribute to the \nmillions of men and women who, like Ruth Mulan Chu Chao, struggled to \nsee that promise fulfilled. Ruth's story is the story of America. It \ndeserves to be heard.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my tribute and that of Secretary Elaine \nChao be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Tribute by Senator McConnell\n\n       Sophocles said that ``One must wait until the evening to \n     see how splendid the day has been.'' And we could say the \n     same thing about the modest woman we mourn today. Ruth Chao \n     put the lives of others ahead of her own for as long as \n     anyone could remember. And, in the end, we all knew that this \n     was the secret of her truly remarkable life.\n       As a young girl, she was torn from the beauty of her native \n     home by an invading army, then secretly returned at great \n     risk to herself to retrieve the family's belongings. As a \n     young wife and mother, she was separated from her husband for \n     three years, but consoled him with letters of encouragement, \n     optimism, and hope. And as a loving mother of six daughters, \n     she would diligently devote the rest of her years to them.\n       She had been at sea for more than a month in the summer of \n     1961 when she leaned over the rail toward the giant woman in \n     New York harbor, and prayed that her family would be safe in \n     this new and foreign place. There was no guarantee that the \n     journey would end well. But in the years to come, Ruth Chao \n     would quietly do all she could to ensure that her family \n     lived up to the promise of America.\n       The cultural divide was as wide as the ocean that brought \n     them here. One early shock came at the end of October, when a \n     group of children showed up at the front door with masks on \n     their faces. The neighbors knew it was Halloween. The Chao \n     family thought they were being robbed. Most of the cultural \n     difficulties were harder to bear. But they made it through. \n     They had their anchor. It was Ruth.\n       In time, the family would learn the language and the \n     culture. The daughters would go on to the best universities \n     in the country, and anyone who visited the house in Harrison \n     would learn the wisdom of the Chinese Proverb which says that \n     ``Those who plant melons grow melons; those who plant beans \n     produce beans.'' Ruth's devotion to her husband and her \n     daughters was complete and total. And it showed.\n       She was never more herself than when she fell ill. She said \n     that if someone in the family had to be sick, better that it \n     be her. She had fewer responsibilities than the others, she \n     said. It was an astonishing thing to hear. But it didn't \n     surprise anyone who knew her. From the shadow of the Purple \n     Mountain of Nanjing, to the bitterness of exile, to the \n     uncertainty of a new life in a strange place, to the \n     heartbreak of a long illness, she put herself last so that \n     others might be first.\n       The Scriptures that she loved tell us that ``Unless a grain \n     of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains itself \n     alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.'' Ruth Chao made \n     this promise her own. She left this life as she lived it, \n     giving of herself, even at the end, for others. And all of us \n     are grateful for the harvest that she reaped.\n\n                       Tribute by Secretary Chao\n\n       My father, Dr. James S. C. Chao; sisters: Jeanette, May, \n     Christine, Grace, Angela; the rest of our family, and I want \n     to thank you so much--especially those who have traveled so \n     far--for coming and helping us celebrate the life and legacy \n     of our beloved mother, Ruth Mulan Chu Chao.\n       My mother is a modest and humble person who never wanted to \n     trouble anyone. We did not notify many people formally but \n     the volume of condolence wishes have been so spontaneous, \n     heartfelt, and overwhelming. We are very touched.\n       Mother went home to the Lord a week ago last Thursday, \n     after a heroic seven-year battle with lymphoma. In fact, her \n     initial diagnosis came on the same day that the President \n     announced my nomination as the Secretary of Labor. Our mother \n     confronted this struggle as she did every challenge in her \n     life--with courage, selfless concern for others, and a \n     serenity that came from the belief that God had a purpose for \n     her in life.\n       She and my father are part of a generation that experienced \n     much suffering, but achieved great things. Mother and Father, \n     like so many Chinese in the 20th century, endured the terror \n     of foreign invasions, the chaos of domestic turmoil, and the \n     heartbreak of dislocations in their native land. Despite all \n     the terrible things they saw, they refused to be defeated by \n     them and remained positive and optimistic their entire life.\n       Mother's courage in the face of great suffering was the \n     product of a strong faith, rooted in a deep love for the \n     Lord, her husband and her family. It gave her the strength to \n     be a pioneer for women of her generation, and to leave a \n     legacy that extends far beyond her immediate family.\n       Mother was ahead of her time even as a young woman, when \n     she saw the promise of her future husband, James S. C. Chao, \n     long before others, and pledged her love and her life to him \n     unconditionally. Her American name, Ruth, which was given to \n     her by a missionary, is very appropriate because--as the \n     Biblical Ruth promised in Chapter 1:16--``whither thou goest, \n     I will go.''\n       For my father's part, her graceful bearing, dignity, \n     cultured upbringing and beauty ensured that his heart was \n     hers forever. As Proverbs 31:10-12 say, ``When one finds a \n     worthy wife, her value is far beyond pearls. Her husband, \n     entrusting his heart to her, has an unfailing prize. She \n     brings him good . . . all the days of her life.''\n       Mother's virtuous character was the foundation of our \n     family and all that we have been able to achieve. Her loving, \n     steady leadership at home alleviated all of Father's worries \n     and enabled him to travel far and wide to seek opportunities \n     to better life for the family. Mother was seven months \n     pregnant with my sister, May, when Father left to go to \n     America. During their three long years of separation, they \n     were faithful to one another, to God and to every promise \n     that they made.\n       Three years later, Mother risked everything, leaving her \n     family and all that was familiar behind to join him, taking \n     another great leap of faith. Moving to America may seem more \n     commonplace now, but back then it was a courageous and bold \n     step, especially because America was not nearly as ethnically \n     diverse as it is today. Mother was a pioneer who led the way \n     for those who came afterwards, and their contributions helped \n     our country grow in the diversity and strength that makes it \n     the envy of the world today.\n       Resettled in America, Mother paved the way for her \n     daughters' successes by nurturing us physically and imbuing \n     us with thinking and attitudes that were, again, ahead of \n     their time. Mother always believed that women could be just \n     as valued and accomplished as men. She also believed that the \n     most important adornments for a woman were virtue, intellect \n     and achievement. In fact, at the age of 51, she went back to \n     school to St. John's University to earn a master's degree in \n     Asian literature and history. She taught us to lead virtuous \n     lives by her own example of being virtuous in everything she \n     did and said. She is our model of dignity, propriety and \n     purity of heart.\n       Mother gave expression to her strong faith and love not \n     only through the example she set for us, but in giving \n     herself wholeheartedly to her church and to her community. \n     She touched the lives of many outside our family through her \n     volunteer work in the church and in the community, often done \n     quietly and without fanfare.\n       Mother's life spanned two worlds--Asia and America--and she \n     played a role in building bridges of understanding between \n     them. She never forgot where she came from, establishing \n     several charitable foundations with Father that are helping \n     young people in Asia and America access higher education and \n     opportunity. She has planted thousands of seeds throughout \n     her life that will blossom over time and produce many \n     improvements in our world in the future.\n       As Mother faced the final challenge of her life, she never \n     complained even though the ravages of the illness ensured \n     that she was never without pain. Her only thoughts and words \n     were always expressions of concern for others. When I would \n     accompany her in the hospital, she would look quizzically at \n     me and ask, ``Shouldn't you be at work? The people and the \n     country are depending on you.''\n       During her illness, my parents switched roles. Mother had \n     taken care of Father throughout her life. Now, he took care \n     of\n\n[[Page S11850]]\n\n     her, ferociously and protectively monitoring every detail of \n     her care at every stage. So much so that one of the doctors \n     joked that my father was practicing medicine without a \n     license. Throughout this difficult time, the devotion of my \n     parents to one another was like a shining beacon, drawing \n     everyone to them with its intensity and warmth.\n       Nearly half a century ago, Father came to America to \n     prepare a place for his young wife and their children. Now, \n     Mother has gone to prepare a place for him and for us--an \n     everlasting home with the Lord that will never end and where \n     every tear will be wiped away. We are consoled by the \n     knowledge that we will see Mother again with her usual smile, \n     healthy and strong.\n       Until then, Mother is with us every day in our hearts and \n     in our lives as an enduring inspiration, spurring us forward \n     to contribute to society and make a difference in this world.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11850-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy \nwith my friend the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Mr. Ken \nSalazar, who I have the pleasure of serving with as cochair of the \nSenate Democratic Hispanic Task Force.\n  As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, I would like to spend a \nmoment talking about the landmark 1947 discrimination case Mendez v. \nWestminster, which established the legal precedent on which Brown v. \nBoard of Education was based. It is an extremely important piece of our \ncivil rights history, but sadly, it is often overlooked. Senator \nSalazar and I would like to remedy that.\n  Let me illustrate the importance of this case. I want you to picture \ntwo students, both equally bright, eager to learn, and full of \npossibility. One student sits in a beautiful new school building \nsurrounded by the best books, a good heating system, and a clean \ncafeteria. The other sits in a dilapidated old shed with torn and \ntattered books that are far too old. The heat doesn't work because \nthere's no furnace, and the cafeteria doesn't exist. As you all know, \nthis was what occurred in towns throughout our country for far too long \nbefore Brown v. Board of Education ruled that separate was inherently \nunequal.\n  Sylvia Mendez, a victim of separate but equal before Brown v. Board \nof Education, was only 8 years old when she and her brothers were \nprohibited from attending a Whites-only school in Westminster, CA, in \nOrange County. Her father, along with five other Mexican-American \nfathers whose children were forced to attend subpar, segregated \nschools, challenged school segregation in the U.S. District Court in \nLos Angeles, claiming their children were victims of unconstitutional \ndiscrimination. This historic court battle ultimately ended school \nsegregation in California and set in motion the legal process that \nwould eventually end school segregation in America.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Like my colleague Senator Bob Menendez, I believe it is \ncritical to recognize the contributions that Sylvia Mendez and her \nfamily have made to the advancement of civil rights. The Mendez \nfamily's struggle for equality is a reminder to me that we must \ncontinue to fight for equal and quality education for all our children.\n  Sadly, many young Hispanic students today attend schools that are \nlacking in resources, equipment, and highly qualified teachers. \nNationally, Latinos are four times more likely to drop out of high \nschool than their White counterparts and only 1 in 10 Latinos has \nobtained a 4-year college degree. Reforms to our education system are \nclearly needed to address these disparities and continue the legacy of \nSylvia Menendez.\n  Education is a critical pathway to realizing the American dream. It \nis what allows every child to transcend the barriers of race, class, \nbackground, or disability to achieve their potential to be what they \nchoose in life. A wise historian once said that, ``Education is the \nmeans by which we exult our successes and remedy our failures and the \nprocess by which we transmit our civilization from one generation to \nthe next.''\n  We take this moment to recommit ourselves to uphold the legacy of \nSylvia Mendez and her brothers. This is what Hispanic Heritage Month is \nall about.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank Senator Ken Salazar for the work he does on the \nSenate Democratic Hispanic Task Force on behalf of Latinos. My \ncolleague understands, like I do, that we must not only celebrate the \naccomplishments of Latinos but turn to the future in to ensure that \nLatinos are protected by our laws and able to achieve the American \ndream. Sylvia Mendez, who has become a premier civil rights advocate \nand leader as a result of this case, is a clear example of what it \nmeans to achieve that dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11850-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING LOUISE SEIKEL\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nwhich I am honored to chair, oversees the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, the second largest Cabinet level department in the United \nStates. A person who works for Veterans Affairs is joined by roughly \n245,000 fellow employees, each of whom plays a role in fulfilling our \nNation's obligation to those who have served. In an organization of \nthat magnitude, there is a real risk of overlooking the importance of \nthe contributions made by individual VA employees. Today I want to \nrecognize one such employee, who celebrated her 50th year of working \nfor veterans this past Sunday.\n  Louise Seikel, a certified registered nurse anesthetist in Brooklyn, \nNY, has spent the last half century serving those who have served our \ncountry. To put this into perspective, I note that Louise has done this \nunder 10 U.S. Presidents, and had provided care to veterans for over \nthree decades before the first Secretary of Veterans' Affairs was \nappointed to the President's Cabinet. When she began, she and her \ncolleagues cared for wounded warriors who were born in the 19th \ncentury, and today she is part of the health administration caring for \nthose wounded in the conflicts of the 21st century.\n  Louise has served countless numbers of veterans, and I cannot put \ninto words the immeasurable impact she has made. What I can do, however \nunderstated it may be, is give her my heartfelt thanks. Louise has \nearned it.\n  In that spirit I say to Louise Seikel, on behalf of every life you \nhave touched and the grateful Nation you continue to serve, mahalo nui \nloa. Thank you so very much for your public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11850-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11850-S11851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN RECOGNITION OF JANET TURCOTTE\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize one of my \nconstituents, Janet Turcotte of Bowie, Maryland. I was fortunate to \nmeet Janet in March of this year when she visited my Washington office. \nShe came as part of C3, the Colorectal Cancer Coalition, a group whose \nmission is to eliminate suffering and death due to colorectal cancer.\n  Janet is a talented embroiderer, and for more than 20 years she has \nbeen decorating saddlecloths for the thoroughbreds at Maryland's \nPimlico Race Course. For the past 2 years, she has added the colorectal \ncancer ``Blue Star of Hope'' to the saddlecloths of the contenders for \nthe Preakness Stakes at Pimlico. Recognizing that the Preakness has \nmore than 17 million television viewers each year, Janet aims to use \nthis symbol to encourage early screening for colorectal cancer, and to \nsave lives. Janet graciously brought me one of those ``Blue Star'' \nsaddlecloths, which is now displayed in my personal office.\n  Janet Turcotte is far more than an advocate for colorectal health. \nShe is also a patient. First diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer \n4 years ago, she is currently battling her third recurrence of the \ndisease. Last week, Janet's doctors told her that she does not have \nmuch time left.\n  Janet's message to Congress and to all Americans is an urgent and \nimportant one. It is that early screening, diagnosis and treatment of \ncolon cancer can save lives. The American Cancer Society, whose members \nwill visit Capitol Hill soon, reports that in 2006, more than 150,000 \nnew cases of colon cancer were diagnosed and more than 50,000 Americans \ndied from the disease, including more than 1,000 Marylanders.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our appreciation to Janet \nTurcotte, a dedicated and courageous advocate for colorectal health, \nfor her\n\n[[Page S11851]]\n\nselfless efforts to promote a healthier America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11851-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING ELEANOR McGOVERN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to publicly honor and \nrecognize one of South Dakota's favorite daughters, Eleanor McGovern, \nwho died on January 25, 2007, at the age of 85. A memorial service is \nbeing held today for Eleanor, and I know my colleagues all join with me \nin expressing our sympathies to the McGovern family. While we do mourn \nher passing, we also celebrate her extraordinarily successful life \nworking to better the lives of the people of South Dakota and people \naround the world.\n  Born in Woonsocket, SD, in 1921, Eleanor grew up on a farm during the \nDust Bowl years of the 1930s. Her strong work ethic and her lifelong \nconcern and compassion for others were instilled in her by her \nchildhood experiences. When her mother died when she was 12 years old, \nEleanor and her twin sister, Ila, took over all household \nresponsibilities, helping their father raise their younger sister. \nEleanor attended high school in Woonsocket and met her future husband, \nformer Senator George McGovern, while attending Dakota Wesleyan \nUniversity. After graduation she worked as a legal secretary before \nmarrying Senator McGovern on October 31, 1943.\n  Throughout her life, Eleanor achieved many impressive \naccomplishments. She was a board member of Dakota Wesleyan University, \nthe Psychiatric Institute, the Child Study Association, the Erickson \nInstitute of Chicago, and Odyssey House of New York. Eleanor also \nvolunteered for the Child Development Center. She was named an \nOutstanding Citizen in 1975 by Dakota Wesleyan University and awarded \nan honorary doctorate in humane letters in 1997.\n  In addition to all these accomplishments she was a devoted mother of \nfive. Throughout the years, she provided a stable and loving home \nenvironment for her children and helped facilitate her husband's \nservice to the Nation. During Senator McGovern's Presidential campaign, \nhe described her as his most helpful critic and most trusted adviser.\n  Eleanor also authored her memoir, ``Uphill: A Personal Story,'' which \nwas published in 1973. Following the death of her daughter Terry in \n1994, she showed remarkable courage by speaking publicly about the \ntragedy of alcoholism and how it impacted her family. In addition, she \nhelped establish the McGovern Family Foundation for researching \nalcoholism.\n  Thoughout her life she worked tirelessly to improve the lives of \nothers, especially the lives of women and children; she published \narticles on child development while also traveling the Nation to \naddress the problems facing American families. There are few people who \nhave done as much to better the lives of the women and children of \nSouth Dakota.\n  Eleanor is survived by her husband Senator McGovern; 4 children--Ann \nMcGovern, Susan McGovern, Mary McGovern-McKinnon, and Steve McGovern--\n10 grandchildren; and 6 great-grandchildren.\n  It is with great honor that I speak of the accomplishments of Eleanor \nMcGovern and with great sadness that I mark her passing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11851-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING MONTCLAIR STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate \nMontclair State University, MSU, on its 100th anniversary. Over the \npast century, MSU has grown from its humble beginnings as the New \nJersey State Normal School with just 187 students into one of the \npremier educational institutions in the State of New Jersey.\n  Montclair State University began as a teacher's college and, to this \nday, continues to train the Nation's finest educators. However, the \nschool's curriculum has expanded to include a comprehensive range of \nfirst-class undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs. With over \n16,000 students and 465 full-time faculty members, MSU is currently the \nsecond-largest and fastest-growing university in New Jersey, and has a \ndiverse student body that reflects New Jersey's population.\n  Much of the University's success can be attributed to its steadfast \ndedication to outstanding faculty, exceptional teaching, and quality of \nscholarship. The university is led by a dedicated and talented team \nfocused on meeting the many needs of its students and the surrounding \ncommunity. MSU manages to provide the individual attention of a small \ncollege, while also offering a vast array of majors and concentrations.\n  Mr. President, the students and alumni of Montclair State University \nhave much to be proud of as they celebrate 100 years of academia. I \napplaud MSU for its many years of service, and I wish the university \ncontinued success in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11851-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE HONORABLE H. EMORY WIDENER, JR.\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I have a heavy heart. It is \nwith great regret that I share with the Senate that the Honorable H. \nEmory Widener, Jr.--one of our country's extraordinary jurists, an \nexceptional Virginian, and a good friend--has passed away. For 38 \nyears, he served our Nation and Virginia as a member of the Federal \njudiciary.\n  Our Nation has lost one of its finest jurists, someone who was \nuniversally admired for his dedication to the Constitution, to the laws \npassed by the Congress and subsequently enacted, and to the impartial \ntreatment of those who appeared before him.\n  Emory Widener started his career in public service by entering the \nNaval Academy in Annapolis. Responding to the call of duty, he served \nas an officer in the final year of World War II. He later served in the \nKorean war and received an honorable discharge in 1958. Following 2 \nyears in the Naval Reserves, he began law school at Washington and Lee \nUniversity, and upon graduation he returned to that region of Virginia \nwhich he loved so dearly, southwest Virginia, to enter private practice \nin Bristol.\n  In 1969, Emory Widener was nominated for a lifetime appointment to \nthe Federal court as a U.S. district judge for the Western District of \nVirginia and was promptly confirmed by the Senate. After an unusually \nbrief period of time, only 2 years, he became the chief judge of this \nFederal court. In 1972, he was nominated for a seat on the Fourth \nCircuit and again received an expedient confirmation by the Senate.\n  By his extraordinarily well written opinions, Judge Widener became a \nlegend on the Fourth Circuit. Judge Widener's exemplary judgment and \nintegrity were profound assets to this important court, and I always \nhave had a deep admiration and respect for this magnificent man and \njurist. He was a legal giant in Virginia, a legal giant in America's \nFederal courts, and his service as a jurist should be a model for \nothers.\n  Without question, southwest Virginia has lost one of its dearest \nfriends. Yet the region can everlastingly point with great pride and \nadmiration to the achievements of one of its greatest sons. He will be \nmissed not only in Abingdon, VA, where his kept his office, but also by \nhe fellow jurists, those who practiced before him, and throughout the \nCommonwealth and the Nation.\n  We all join in extending our deepest sympathies to his family and his \nfriends as they mourn his passing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11851-4", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11851-5", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11851-S11852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S11852]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11851-5", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11851-S11852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S11852]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11852-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \nORIGINALLY DECLARED ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2001, WITH RESPECT TO PERSONS WHO \n        COMMIT, THREATEN TO COMMIT, OR SUPPORT TERRORISM--PM 26\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to authorize Western States to make selections of \npublic land within their borders in lieu of receiving 5 percent of the \nproceeds of the sale of public land lying within said States as \nprovided by their respective enabling Acts; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Action Plan \nfor Public Land and Education Act of 2007. This bill would restore some \nbalance to the way education is funded in many of the western States, \nwhere a large proportion of public land is owned by the Government. \nThis bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Agriculture to grant a small portion of these Federal \nlands to the states so they can generate the much needed education \nrevenue.\n  I wonder how many of my colleagues know that 10 of the 12 States with \nthe largest pupil-per-teacher ratios are in the West? These 10 western \nStates also have the lowest growth in per-pupil expenditures. And these \nratios will only grow worse as growth in the West continues to out-pace \nthe rest of the country. In fact, three of the fastest growing counties \nare in Utah.\n  I would like to take a moment to discuss how the west has gotten into \nthis situation. Let us take a look at Utah's history, which began when \nin July of 1894, the State Enabling Act was approved. This act allowed \n``the People of Utah to form a Constitution and State Government, and \nto be admitted into the Union.''\n  However, Section 9 of the enabling act sets forth that ``five percent \nof the proceeds of the sales of public lands lying within said State, \nwhich shall be sold by the United States subsequent to the admission of \nsaid State into the Union . . . shall be paid to the said State, to be \nused as a permanent fund, the interest of which only shall be expended \nfor the support of the common schools within said State.''\n  The Federal Government never followed through on its promise. Our \nbill, the APPLE Act, S. 2072, would direct the Government to deliver on \nthat promise.\n  The Government's lack of follow-through on its promise is only \nexacerbated by the lack of a sales tax base in the west. Sales tax \nrevenue, as we all know is generated on private lands. On average, the \nFederal Government owns 52 percent of the land located in the 13 \nwestern States, while the remaining States average just 4 percent \nFederal land ownership. Federal ownership in Utah is about 65 percent, \nsecond only to Nevada.\n  The problem is that sales tax is not being collected on these Federal \nlands, and public education is funded largely through sales tax \nrevenues.\n  Some may say that the west's education funding deficit is due to a \nlack of commitment or effort by the States. This is not true.\n  The fact is that allocations to public education, by percentage, in \nthe West matches or exceeds the rest of the Nation. In fact, western \nStates pay on average 11.1 percent of their personal income to State \nand local taxes, whereas residents of the remaining States pay 10.9 \npercent.\n  I urge my colleagues to lend their support to addressing the west's \neducation funding shortfall by helping me to pass the Action Plan for \nPublic Land and Education Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2076. A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to require the \nPresident to\n\n[[Page S11857]]\n\ndesignate certain geographical areas as national renewable energy \nzones, and for other zones, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2076\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Renewable Energy and \n     Economic Development Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) electricity produced from renewable resources--\n       (A) helps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and other \n     air pollutants;\n       (B) enhances national energy security;\n       (C) conserves water and finite resources; and\n       (D) provides substantial economic benefits, including job \n     creation and technology development;\n       (2) the potential exists for a far greater percentage of \n     electricity generation in the United States to be achieved \n     through the use of renewable resources, as compared to the \n     percentage of electricity generation using renewable \n     resources in existence as of the date of enactment of this \n     Act;\n       (3) many of the best potential renewable energy resources \n     are located in rural areas far from population centers;\n       (4) the lack of adequate electric transmission capacity is \n     a primary obstacle to the development of electric generation \n     facilities fueled by renewable energy resources;\n       (5) the economies of many rural areas would substantially \n     benefit from the increased development of water-efficient \n     electric generation facilities fueled by renewable energy \n     resources;\n       (6) more efficient use of existing transmission capacity, \n     better integration of resources, and greater investments in \n     distributed generation and off-grid solutions may increase \n     the availability of transmission and distribution capacity \n     for adding renewable resources and help keep ratepayer costs \n     low;\n       (7) the Federal Government has not adequately invested in \n     or implemented an integrated approach to accelerating the \n     development, commercialization, and deployment of renewable \n     energy technologies and renewable electricity generation, \n     including through enhancing distributed generation or through \n     vehicle- and transportation-sector use; and\n       (8) it is in the national interest for the Federal \n     Government to implement policies that would enhance the \n     quantity of electric transmission capacity available to take \n     full advantage of the renewable energy resources available to \n     generate electricity, and to more fully integrate renewable \n     energy into the energy policies of the United States, and to \n     address the tremendous national security and global warming \n     challenges of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish a program to assure the safety of fresh \nproduce intended for human consumption, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, a year ago, there was a large-scale \noutbreak of food-borne illness caused by a virulent strain of E. coli \nin fresh bagged spinach. More than 200 people became ill, and three \ndied. Since then, U.S. consumers have been bombarded with news of \nrepeated cases of contaminated food--everything from peanut butter to \nseafood to pet food. Just this week, there was a recall of a Dole \nbagged salad product because of E. coli contamination.\n  We need to restore the public's confidence in American fresh produce \nand the agency that regulates it. To that end, I am introducing the \nFresh Produce Safe Act of 2007. My colleague Senator Kohl has joined me \nin co-sponsoring this legislation, and our aim is to create, for the \nfirst time, an effective national food safety framework for all fresh \nproduce.\n  Industry groups are acutely aware of the need to restore consumer \nconfidence. For instance, the California leafy green produce industry \nhas come up with a marketing agreement to certify the safety of its \nproducts. The Florida tomato industry has pushed the State to inspect \nand regulate its products. But this regional, patchwork approach is \nsimply not adequate. We need a national program to ensure the safety of \nall fresh produce all across the country.\n  Under the Fresh Produce Safety Act, FDA would have the authority to \nrequire produce companies to follow commonsense food safety guidelines. \nThose guidelines currently are only voluntary. Now, obviously, it would \nbe a waste of resources to require the same stringent controls for, \nsay, apples that we would require for leafy green produce. That is why \nthe bill requires FDA to establish national standards tailored to \nspecific types of produce and the particular risk factors arising from \nthe way each is grown and handled. The legislation also requires \nstepped-up inspections of operations that grow and process fresh \nproduce, such as spinach or lettuce.\n  Other key provisions of the bill include a surveillance system to \nidentify and stop the sources of fresh produce contamination, and a \nresearch program to better understand and prevent contamination of \nproduce. The legislation would also require FDA to write rules to \nensure that imported produce has been grown and processed under the \nsame standards that we will have in the United States.\n  The Fresh Produce Safety Act is timely for another reason. Eating \nfruits and vegetables promotes lower body weight, stronger bones, and \nlower risk of developing diet-related diseases such as diabetes. In \nrecent years, major efforts and investments have encouraged people to \neat these healthful foods. It can only turn people away from healthy \neating to have continuous instances of E. coli contamination and fresh \nproduce recalls.\n  The American people need to have confidence that their fruits and \nvegetables are produced and handled in a safe and wholesome manner. \nThat is exactly the goal of the Fresh Produce Safety Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 2080. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nensure that sewage treatment plants monitor for and report discharges \nof raw sewage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto protect health and safety by notifying the public when there are \npotentially harmful sewage overflows in our streams, rivers, and \ncoastal waters. This legislation, the Sewage Overflow Right-to-Know \nAct, would amend the Clean Water Act to require that owners and \noperators of publicly owned treatment works monitor their systems and \nnotify the public when there is a sewage overflow with the potential to \naffect public health.\n  The Clean Water Act is soon to celebrate its 35th anniversary, and \ndespite great gains we are still far from achieving the goal of \neliminating pollution discharges. EPA estimates that there are between \n23,000 and 75,000 sanitary sewer overflows each year. Those spills dump \nbetween 3 billion and 10 billion gallons of untreated sewage into our\n\n[[Page S11860]]\n\nrivers, lakes and coastal waters annually. In addition, combined sewer \noverflows spill 850 billion gallons of contaminated stormwater into our \nwaterways each year.\n  Increased investment in our wastewater infrastructure is sorely \nneeded to avoid having water quality return to what it was in the \n1970s. This is why I chaired a hearing of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee's Transportation Safety, Infrastructure Security and \nWater Quality Subcommittee yesterday on clean water funding, and I look \nforward to working to reauthorize the Clean Water State Revolving Fund \nthis Congress.\n  While we work toward closing the infrastructure funding gap and \nreducing sewage pollution, we must also keep citizens safe by informing \nthem when there are sewage overflows. The EPA estimates that up to 3.5 \nmillion people get sick each year from recreational contact with waters \ncontaminated by sanitary sewer overflows alone.\n  Currently, citizens are often needlessly unaware of sewage overflows. \nAlthough some individual utilities do an excellent job of public \nnotification, many do not provide any communication to the public. The \nClean Water Act does not require public notification under the National \nPollutant Discharge Elimination System for sanitary sewer overflows, \nand State requirements, where they exist, are extremely variable. This \nlegislation would remedy that situation by ensuring that publicly-owned \ntreatment works employ a monitoring system to alert the operators when \nthere is an overflow, and relaying that information to the public when \nthere is potential harm to the public's health. In cases where the \noverflow has the potential for imminent and substantial harm, public \nhealth authorities and other affected entities, such as local drinking \nwater treatment plants, must also be notified.\n  This legislation also requires annual reporting to EPA or the State \nwith a summary of all overflows and the plans in place to address the \noverflows. This will help provide a more comprehensive picture of \nsewage infrastructure problems, and increase public awareness of needed \nrepairs and upgrades.\n  Clean water and public health are priorities for New Jersey. Some \nsewer pipes in my State date back 150 years, and overflows are becoming \nmore common. In one event earlier this year, 150 million gallons of \nuntreated sewage mixed with stormwater spilled into the Hackensack \nRiver. The Sewage Overflow Right to Know Act establishes public \nnotification of health risks posed by sewage overflows to keep our \nresidents healthy while we continue to work to reduce sewage pollution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record immediately following my statement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 2082. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nCoordinated Environmental Public Health Network, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, I am proud to join with my \ncolleagues Senator Hatch and Senator Reid to introduce the Coordinated \nEnvironmental Public Health Network Act.\n  More than 40 years ago, in her seminal work Silent Spring, Rachel \nCarson noted that ``For the first time in the history of the world \nevery human being is now subjected to contact with dangerous chemicals \nfrom the moment of conception until death.''\n  Her words remain true today. Not only are we subjected to chemicals, \nbut we often don't have an understanding of the impact of these \nchemicals upon our health and the health of our children. I believe \nthat it is past time for us to begin making the investments in research \nand technology that will allow us to understand the impact of the \nenvironmental exposures we face every day.\n  We know that chronic diseases like asthma, heart and lung disease--\nthe chronic diseases that result in more than $750 billion in health \ncare costs every year--are caused by three factors: genetics, behavior, \nand the environment.\n  Since the publication of Silent Spring in 1962, we have come a long \nway in understanding two of those three factors. Through initiatives \nlike the Human Genome Project, we have been making incredible strides \nin our understanding of the science of genetics, so that we can better \nprevent and treat diseases. We have made strides in behavior change, \nwith initiatives like smoking cessation campaigns resulting in a \nreduction of some of these behavioral threats to our health.\n  But we need to make more progress in our understanding of how the \nenvironment impacts our health. Far too often, these are silent health \nhazards that manifest themselves in unexpected cancers or other \ndiseases. Yet we have no systematic way to collect and analyze the data \nthat will allow us to make the linkages between environmental hazards \nand chronic illness clusters in various communities.\n  Take, for example, central Harlem, where one out of every four \nchildren has asthma. Or Fallon, Nevada--a small town with about 8,000 \nresidents--where I attended an Environment and Public Works Committee \nhearing back in 2001 where we examined the high rates of leukemia among \nchildren in that community. There are examples like this from all over \nthe country--often from minority or low-income communities that bear a \ndisproportionate burden of environmental pollution--and we need to do \nmore to protect the health of Americans who are daily living with \nenvironmental hazards. But if we don't have information to identify \nareas of high disease incidence and understand what environmental \npollutants exist in those neighborhoods, we cannot adequately address \nthe risks posed to our health.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will help us to understand \nthose links. In establishing a coordinated environmental public health \nnetwork, we can better track chronic diseases like cancer, asthma, and \nautism. We can establish critical information sharing between the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and the Environmental \nProtection Agency, so that those agencies can pool the information that \ncan help researchers and the public identify and address risks. We can \nincrease our resources for biomonitoring, so that we can measure levels \nof exposure to chemicals. And we can improve our environmental public \nhealth capacity, so that we have professionals who are trained to \nengage in rapid response to environmental health risks across our \ncountry.\n  The Coordinated Environmental Public Health Tracking Network will \nallow us to make enormous gains in our understanding of environmental \nhealth, and give us the data necessary to make improvements for the \nhealth of our communities.\n  I would like to thank Senators Hatch and Reid for joining me to raise \nawareness about these issues, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to \nmove this bill forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter of \nsupport.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                               September 19, 2007.\n\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Clinton and Hatch: The undersigned \n     organizations join in supporting the Coordinated \n     Environmental Public Health Network Act of 2007. We are \n     pleased that your bill would require the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services to establish and operate a Coordinated \n     Environmental Public Health Network and operate and maintain \n     National Environmental Health Rapid Response Services.\n       Chronic diseases cause 70 percent of deaths in the U.S. and \n     are responsible for three-quarters of health care spending. \n     Yet, our public health system lacks the tools it needs to \n     gather sufficient information about these diseases. The air \n     that we breathe and the water that we drink can jeopardize \n     our health if contaminated with chemical, biological or other \n     hazards. It is critical that we have the ability to track the \n     relationship between environmental exposures and the \n     incidence and distribution of disease.\n       In Fiscal Year 2002, Congress provided the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with funding to develop \n     the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program to \n     coordinate local, state, and federal health agencies' \n     collection of critical data. CDC selected pilot programs as \n     testing grounds for the tracking program. Unfortunately, \n     despite important information\n\n[[Page S11861]]\n\n     gleaned from the pilot programs, due to limited funding, in \n     August 2006 CDC was able to award funding to only 16 states \n     and one city. This important program must be expanded to all \n     50 states.\n       The Network would provide valuable information that health \n     officials and communities could use to monitor where and when \n     chronic diseases occur and to assess their potential links to \n     environmental hazards. It would coordinate among existing \n     surveillance and data collection systems. The Rapid Response \n     Services would provide an important service by helping to \n     develop strategies and protocols for a coordinated rapid \n     response to higher than expected incidence of chronic \n     conditions and potential environmental exposures.\n       Your bill also recognizes the value of expanding the scope \n     and amount of biomonitoring data collected by the CDC and \n     State laboratories. Through biomonitoring techniques, CDC can \n     measure with great precision actual levels of chemicals in \n     people's bodies, investigate exposures, and study the causes \n     of diseases. Enhancing our biomonitoring capacity will help \n     expand our knowledge of chemical exposures in people and how \n     these chemicals affect their health.\n       Finally, your bill addresses another need of public health \n     infrastructure--assuring a well-trained public health \n     workforce--by developing centers of excellence, a scholarship \n     program and an applied epidemiology fellowship program. \n     Providing support and incentives to ensure the availability \n     of a well-trained and robust environmental and public \n     health workforce is a critical component of establishing a \n     well-equipped, modern public health system.\n       It is the Federal Government that must provide the national \n     leadership and resources to initiate the action required to \n     protect Americans from environmental hazards. The Coordinated \n     Environmental Public Health Network Act of 2007 is a \n     necessary step that will help provide potentially lifesaving \n     information and also improve our public health \n     infrastructure. We appreciate your leadership on this \n     important issue and look forward to working with you on this \n     and other important public health initiatives in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n         Trust for America's Health, Action Now, Adapted Physical \n           Activity Council, Alliance for Healthy Homes, American \n           Association on Intellectual and Developmental \n           Disabilities, American College of Occupational and \n           Environmental Medicine, American College of Preventive \n           Medicine, American Lung Association, American Public \n           Health Association, Association of Public Health \n           Laboratories, Breast Cancer Action, Breast Cancer Fund, \n           California Safe Schools, Catholic Healthcare West, \n           Center for Science in the Public Interest, Clean Water \n           Action Midwest Office, Coalition for Clean Air, \n           Commonweal, Council of State and Territorial \n           Epidemiologists, Environmental Defense, Environmental \n           Health Network, Families Against Cancer and Toxics, \n           Healthy Building Network, Healthy Homes Collaborative, \n           Healthy Schools Network--Washington, DC, Institute for \n           Agriculture and Trade Policy, Institute for Children's \n           Environmental Health, Institute of Neurotoxicology & \n           Neurological Disorders, March of Dimes Foundation, \n           Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, MOMS \n           (Making Our Milk Safe), National Association for Public \n           Health Statistics and Information Systems, National \n           Association of County and City Health Officials, \n           National Association of Health Data Organization, \n           National Disease Clusters Alliance, National Research \n           Center for Women & Families, Olympic Environmental \n           Council, Oregon Environmental Council, Pesticide Action \n           Network North America, Physicians for Social \n           Responsibility, PTAirWatchers.org, Research Institute \n           for Independent Living, Sciencecorps, Tulane Center for \n           Applied Environmental Public Health, Tulane School of \n           Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Women's Voices for \n           the Earth.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator \nClinton and Senator Reid, in introducing today the Coordinated \nEnvironmental Health Network Act.\n  In modern society, we often take for granted the advances in public \nhealth measures made during the last century. Initiatives like drinking \nwater protections and food safety programs have helped to counterattack \ninfectious disease and add up to 25 years to the average human life \nexpectancy.\n  Yet America today is faced by new public health challenges along with \nrecurrence of chronic and infectious diseases. Chronic diseases account \nfor approximately 70 percent of all deaths every year, most of which \nare preventable. These diseases also cause major limitations in daily \nliving for about 25 million Americans and contribute more than $750 \nmillion to annual health care costs.\n  As an example of a new health threat, the West Nile virus had never \nbefore been detected in this hemisphere before the 2000 outbreak in New \nYork. In 2007 alone, 1,982 human cases have been reported in almost \nevery State and the District of Columbia.\n  Food-borne illnesses are estimated to cause 5,000 deaths a year; and \nasthma, a chronic condition, is the number one reason children miss \nschool and is also expected to affect 29 million Americans within the \nnext decade--more than twice the current number of people with asthma.\n  We know that the environment plays an important role in health and \nhuman development; but we do not know to what extent. Scientific \nresearchers have linked specific diseases and health effects to certain \nenvironmental causes--for instance, infected mosquito bites and the \nWest Nile virus, or asbestos and lung cancer--but many other links \nremain unproven, such as those between aluminum and Alzheimer's \ndisease, or exposure to disinfectant byproducts and bladder cancer.\n  The bottom line is that, if we are going to prevent disease, \nresearchers need more complete information about environmental factors, \ntheir effect on people, and the resulting health outcomes.\n  The environmental exposure, biomonitoring, and incidence of chronic \nand infectious diseases data that do exist are not readily accessible \nby all the appropriate systems. Although the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, CDC, has begun efforts in this area through its \nNational Environmental Public Health Tracking Program--in which my home \nState of Utah is a participant--currently, no network exists to track \nenvironmental health data full-scale at the national level. \nFurthermore, at the state and local levels, environmental quality \nprograms and classic public health programs are almost always based in \ndifferent agencies.\n\n  This disconnection among environmental health projects at local, \nstate, and Federal levels jeopardizes our protection against \nenvironmental health threats. The threat of terrorist attacks with \nbiological or chemical weapons has most certainly become a major public \nhealth concern; but it is important to keep in mind that weaknesses in \nthe environmental public health infrastructure have led to large-scale \nvector-, water-, and food-borne outbreaks of infectious disease.\n  In the 1998 Institute of Medicine, IOM, Report ``The Future of Public \nHealth'', and the Pew Environmental Health Commission report \n``America's Environmental Health Gap: Why the Country Needs a \nNationwide Health Tracking Network'', this fragmentation is clearly \noutlined as contributing to disjointed policy development, imbalanced \nservice delivery and a generally weakened public health effort.\n  The IOM report recommended that state and local health agencies \nstrengthen their capacities for identification, understanding and \ncontrol of environmental problems as health hazards.\n  The Pew Commission report concluded that the environmental health gap \nresults from the lack of basic information that could document possible \nlinks between environmental hazards and chronic disease, as well as \ninformation that our communities and health professionals need to \nreduce and prevent such health problems. In response to this problem, \nthe Pew Commission proposed a nationwide health tracking network.\n  Thirteen top public health groups, including the American Cancer \nSociety, American Lung Association, and American Public Health \nAssociation endorsed the Pew report. This endorsement makes clear the \nmessage that the complexity of today's environmental public health \nproblems requires coordinated responses from multiple agencies and \norganizations.\n  The scientific community has also been asking for the ability to \nbridge this environmental health gap. In a 2004 Environmental Health \nPerspectives article, a consortium of public health researchers wrote:\n\n       The ``building blocks'' of knowledge provided by a \n     nationwide environmental public health tracking network will \n     enable scientists to answer many of the troubling questions \n     we are asking today about what is making us sick. The result \n     will be new prevention strategies aimed at reducing and \n     ultimately preventing many of the chronic diseases and \n     disabling conditions that afflict millions of Americans.\n\n\n[[Page S11862]]\n\n\n  The common theme from these reports, and the message received from \ntop public health organizations and researchers, is that there is a \npressing need to establish environmental public health leadership at \nthe Federal level.\n  This legislation will help provide that leadership by establishing a \nCoordinated Environmental Public Health Network. It will make available \nthe infrastructure by which local, state, and Federal agencies can \nshare environmental public health information.\n  This bill is designed to build upon the recommendations from the \nscientific and public health communities, as well as the program that \nthe CDC has already begun to carry out.\n  The Coordinated Environmental Health Network will connect state \nsystems that are tracking chronic diseases, environmental exposures, \nand other risk factors so that the causes of priority chronic diseases \ncan be identified, addressed, and ultimately prevented. Public health \nofficials, scientific researchers, and the general public will have the \ninformation they need to fight against chronic disease.\n  The Coordinated Environmental Health Network Act will provide states \nwith grants to help develop the infrastructure they need in order to \nparticipate in the Nationwide Network.\n  In order to educate the public and provide the information needed to \nfight chronic disease, this bill calls for a National Environmental \nHealth Report that will provide annual findings of the Nationwide \nHealth Tracking Network.\n  This bill also aims to expand our environmental health infrastructure \nthrough the establishment and operation of regional biomonitoring labs, \nEnvironmental Health Centers of Excellence, applied epidemiology \nfellowships, and the John. H. Chafee Environmental Health Scholarship \nProgram.\n  A survey of registered voters conducted for the Pew Environmental \nHealth Commission indicated that most Americans say that taking a \nnational approach to tracking environmental health should be a priority \nof government at all levels.\n  Without comprehensive environmental health tracking, policymakers and \npublic health practitioners lack information that is critical to \nestablishing sound environmental health priorities. In addition, the \npublic is indirectly denied its right to know about environmental \nhazards, exposure levels and health outcomes in their communities--\ninformation they want and have every reason to expect.\n  Our country has one of the best health care systems in the world. \nDoctors are now successfully treating illnesses that were once \nconsidered debilitating or even terminal because we have made great \ninvestments in researching cures and finding treatments. It is time to \nmake the same investment in preventing people from becoming sick in the \nfirst place. This bill is an important step forward in making that \ninvestment in the health of America, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11862-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 323--RECOGNIZING KIKKOMAN FOODS, INC., FOR ITS 50 \n                YEARS OF OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Feingold) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF SENATE ON IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) General David Petraeus, commander of the Multi-National \n     Force Iraq, stated in testimony before a joint session of the \n     Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 10, \n     2007, that ``[i]t is increasingly apparent to both coalition \n     and Iraqi leaders that Iran, through the use of the Iranian \n     Republican Guard Corps Qods Force, seeks to turn the Shi'a \n     militia extremists into a Hezbollah-like force to serve its \n     interests and fight a proxy war against the Iraqi state and \n     coalition forces in Iraq''.\n       (2) Ambassador Ryan Crocker, United States Ambassador to \n     Iraq, stated in testimony before a joint session of the \n     Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 10, \n     2007, that ``Iran plays a harmful role in Iraq. While \n     claiming to support Iraq in its transition, Iran has actively \n     undermined it by providing lethal capabilities to the enemies \n     of the Iraqi state''.\n       (3) The most recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, \n     published in August 2007, states that ``Iran has been \n     intensifying aspects of its lethal support for select groups \n     of Iraqi Shia militants, particularly the JAM [Jaysh al-\n     Mahdi], since at least the beginning of 2006. Explosively \n     formed penetrator (EFP) attacks have risen dramatically''.\n       (4) The Report of the Independent Commission on the \n     Security Forces of Iraq, released on September 6, 2007, \n     states that ``[t]he Commission concludes that the evidence of \n     Iran's increasing activism in the southeastern part of the \n     country, including Basra and Diyala provinces, is compelling \n     . . . It is an accepted fact that most of the sophisticated \n     weapons being used to `defeat' our armor protection comes \n     across the border from Iran with relative impunity''.\n       (5) General (Ret.) James Jones, chairman of the Independent \n     Commission on the Security Forces of Iraq, stated in \n     testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate on September 6, 2007, that ``[w]e judge that the \n     goings-on across the Iranian border in particular are of \n     extreme severity and have the potential of at least delaying \n     our efforts inside the country. Many of the arms and weapons \n     that kill and maim our soldiers are coming from across the \n     Iranian border''.\n       (6) General Petraeus said of Iranian support for extremist \n     activity in Iraq on April 26, 2007, that ``[w]e know that it \n     goes as high as [Brig. Gen. Qassem] Suleimani, who is the \n     head of the Qods Force . . . We believe that he works \n     directly for the supreme leader of the country''.\n       (7) Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, the president of Iran, stated on \n     August 28, 2007, with respect to the United States presence \n     in Iraq, that ``[t]he political power of the occupiers is \n     collapsing rapidly. Soon we will see a huge power vacuum in \n     the region. Of course we are prepared to fill the gap''.\n       (8) Ambassador Crocker testified to Congress, with respect \n     to President Ahmedinejad's statement, on September 11, 2007, \n     that ``[t]he Iranian involvement in Iraq--its support for \n     extremist militias, training, connections to Lebanese \n     Hezbollah, provision of munitions that are used against our \n     force as well as the Iraqis--are all, in my view, a pretty \n     clear demonstration that Ahmedinejad means what he says, and \n     is already trying to implement it to the best of his \n     ability''.\n       (9) General Petraeus stated on September 12, 2007, with \n     respect to evidence of the complicity of Iran in the murder \n     of members of the Armed Forces of the United States in Iraq, \n     that ``[t]e evidence is very, very clear. We captured it when \n     we captured Qais Khazali, the Lebanese Hezbollah deputy \n     commander, and others, and it's in black and white . . . We \n     interrogated these individuals. We have on tape . . . Qais \n     Khazali himself. When asked, could you have done what you \n     have done without Iranian support, he literally throws up his \n     hands and laughs and says, of course not . . . So they told \n     us about the amounts of money that they have received. They \n     told us about the training that they received. They told us \n     about the ammunition and sophisticated weaponry and all of \n     that that they received''.\n       (10) General Petraeus further stated on September 14, 2007, \n     that ``[w]hat we have got is evidence. This is not \n     intelligence. This is evidence, off computers that we \n     captured, documents and so forth . . . In one case, a 22-page \n     document that lays out the planning, reconnaissance, \n     rehearsal, conduct, and aftermath of the operation conducted \n     that resulted in the death of five of our soldiers in Karbala \n     back in January''.\n       (11) The Department of Defense report to Congress entitled \n     ``Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq'' and released on \n     September 18, 2007, consistent with section 9010 of Public \n     Law 109-289, states that ``[t]here has been no decrease in \n     Iranian training and funding of illegal Shi'a militias in \n     Iraq that attack Iraqi and Coalition forces and civilians . . \n     . Tehran's support for these groups is one of the greatest \n     impediments to progress on reconciliation''.\n       (12) The Department of Defense report further states, with \n     respect to Iranian support for Shi'a extremist groups in \n     Iraq, that ``[m]ost of the explosives and ammunition used by \n     these groups are provided by the Iranian Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force . . . For the period of \n     June through the end of August, [explosively formed \n     penetrator] events are projected to rise by 39 percent over \n     the period of March through May''.\n       (13) Since May 2007, Ambassador Crocker has held three \n     rounds of talks in Baghdad on Iraq security with \n     representatives of the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran.\n       (14) Ambassador Crocker testified before Congress on \n     September 10, 2007, with respect to these talks, stating that \n     ``I laid out the concerns we had over Iranian activity that \n     was damaging to Iraq's security, but found no readiness on \n     Iranians' side at all to engage seriously on these issues. \n     The impression I came with after a couple rounds is that the \n     Iranians were interested simply in the appearance of \n     discussions, of being seen to be at the table with the U.S. \n     as an arbiter of Iraq's present and future, rather than \n     actually doing serious business . . . Right now, I haven't \n     seen any sign of earnest or seriousness on the Iranian \n     side''.\n       (15) Ambassador Crocker testified before Congress on \n     September 11, 2007, stating that ``[w]e have seen nothing on \n     the ground that would suggest that the Iranians are altering \n     what they're doing in support of extremist elements that are \n     going after our forces as well as the Iraqis''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) that the manner in which the United States transitions \n     and structures its military presence in Iraq will have \n     critical long-term consequences for the future of the Persian \n     Gulf and the Middle East, in particular with regard to the \n     capability of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     to pose a threat to the security of the region, the prospects \n     for democracy for the people of the region, and the health of \n     the global economy;\n       (2) that it is a vital national interest of the United \n     States to prevent the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran from turning Shi'a militia extremists in Iraq into a \n     Hezbollah-like force that could serve its interests inside \n     Iraq, including by overwhelming, subverting, or co-opting \n     institutions of the legitimate Government of Iraq;\n       (3) that it should be the policy of the United States to \n     combat, contain, and roll back the violent activities and \n     destabilizing influence inside Iraq of the Government of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran, its foreign facilitators such as \n     Lebanese Hezbollah, and its indigenous Iraqi proxies;\n       (4) to support the prudent and calibrated use of all \n     instruments of United States national power in Iraq, \n     including diplomatic, economic, intelligence, and military \n     instruments, in support of the policy described in\n\n[[Page S11866]]\n\n     paragraph (3) with respect to the Government of the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran and its proxies;\n       (5) that the United States should designate the Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist \n     organization under section 219 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act and place the Islamic Revolutionary Guards \n     Corps on the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists, \n     as established under the International Emergency Economic \n     Powers Act and initiated under Executive Order 13224; and\n       (6) that the Department of the Treasury should act with all \n     possible expediency to complete the listing of those entities \n     targeted under United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n     1737 and 1747 adopted unanimously on December 23, 2006 and \n     March 24, 2007, respectively.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2949.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NAMING THE NEXT AIRCRAFT \n                   CARRIER AS U.S.S. AMERICA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the history of the United States, three Navy vessels \n     have been named U.S.S. America.\n       (2) On November 9, 1776, the Continental Congress \n     authorized the construction of three 74-gun ships of the \n     line. One of the men-of-war, the first ship named America, \n     was laid down in May 1777 in the shipyard of John Langdon on \n     Rising Castle (now Badger) Island in the Piscataqua River \n     between Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Kittery, Maine.\n       (3) On June 26, 1781, Congress selected then-Captain John \n     Paul Jones as the first commanding officer of the America. \n     However, Congress decided on September 4, 1782, to present \n     the ship to King Louis XVI of France to replace the French \n     ship of the line Magnifique which had run aground and been \n     destroyed on August 11, 1782, while attempting to enter \n     Boston harbor. The ship transfer symbolized the appreciation \n     of the United States for France's service to and sacrifices \n     on behalf of the cause of the American patriots.\n       (4) The second America was originally the German civilian \n     passenger transport Amerika, which was launched on April 20, \n     1905, at Belfast, Ireland, by the noted shipbuilding firm of \n     Harland and Wolff, Ltd. Built for the Hamburg-America Line, \n     the steamer entered transatlantic service in the autumn of \n     1905 when she departed Hamburg, Germany, on October 11, 1905, \n     bound for the United States.\n       (5) The largest ship of her kind in the world, and easily \n     one of the most luxurious passenger vessels to sail the seas, \n     from 1905 to 1914, the Amerika plied the North Atlantic trade \n     routes touching at Cherbourg, France, while steaming between \n     Hamburg and New York, New York.\n       (6) During the summer of 1914, events in the Balkans \n     triggered a conflict that soon spread through Europe, pitting \n     nations against nations in the First World War. The eruption \n     of fighting caught Amerika at Boston, where she was preparing \n     to sail for home. Although due to leave port on August 1, \n     1914, the Amerika stayed at Boston lest she fall prey to the \n     warships of the Royal Navy and remained there for almost \n     three years during the period of United States neutrality.\n       (7) Meanwhile, the loss of life caused by German submarine \n     operations turned opinion in the United States against the \n     Central Powers and on February 1, 1917, the United States \n     declared war. The Amerika remained inactive until seized by \n     the United States Shipping Board (USSB), on July 25, 1917. \n     The Amerika was earmarked by the Navy for service in the \n     Cruiser-Transport Force as a troop transport, given the \n     identification number 3006, and placed in commission on \n     August 6, 1917.\n       (8) Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels promulgated \n     General Order No. 320, changing the names of several ex-\n     German ships on September 1, 1917. The Amerika became the \n     America and went on to conduct multiple voyages transporting \n     troops and supplies to and from Word War I operations in \n     Europe. The completion of these trials proved to be a \n     milestone in the reconditioning of former German ships, for \n     the America was the last to be readied for service in the \n     United States Navy.\n       (9) On September 26, 1919, the America was decommissioned \n     in Hoboken, New Jersey, and transferred to the War \n     Department. The ship went on to serve as USAT America, and \n     was later renamed, possibly to avoid confusion with the liner \n     America, as the Edmund B. Alexander, in keeping with the Army \n     policy of naming its oceangoing transports for famous general \n     officers. This name honored Edmund Brooke Alexander from the \n     War with Mexico.\n       (10) The ship operated briefly between New Orleans, \n     Louisiana, and the Panama Canal Zone and became a troop \n     transport in World War II. The ship was sold to the Bethlehem \n     Steel Co., of Baltimore, Maryland, on January 16, 1957, and \n     was broken up a short time later.\n       (11) The third America was the aircraft carrier designated \n     CV-66 laid down on January 1, 1961 at Newport News, Virginia, \n     by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Corporation. \n     She was launched on February 1, 1964, and commissioned at the \n     Norfolk Naval Shipyard on January 23, 1965.\n       (12) In the late 1960s, the carrier America conducted \n     multiple Mediterranean deployments during such events as \n     political crises in Greece and the Suez and countless \n     encounters with Soviet navy vessels and assisted with the \n     rescue and treatment of wounded from the incident involving \n     the Liberty (AGTR-5).\n       (13) On May 30, 1968, the carrier America arrived at Yankee \n     Station in the South China Sea, and the next morning, the \n     first aircraft since commissioning to leave her deck in anger \n     were launched against the enemy. The America served through \n     four line periods, consisting of 112 days on Yankee Station \n     off the Vietnam coast.\n       (14) On a subsequent deployment in 1970, the carrier \n     America completed 100 days on Yankee Station. Through five \n     line periods, the carrier conducted 10,600 aircraft sorties, \n     completed 10,804 carrier landings, expended 11,190 tons of \n     ordnance, moved 425,996 pounds of cargo, handled 6,890 \n     packages and transferred 469,027 pounds of mail. This was \n     accomplished without a single combat loss and only one major \n     landing accident with, fortunately, no fatalities.\n       (15) On June 2, 1972, three days before the carrier America \n     was to sail again on deployment, the Chief of Naval \n     Operations visited the ship and explained the reason why her \n     orders had been changed to send her to the Gulf of Tonkin \n     instead of the Mediterranean. On October 6, 1972, bombs from \n     the planes of the America dropped the Thanh Hoa Bridge, a \n     major objective since the bombing of the North had begun \n     years before. The America received five battle stars for her \n     overall service in the Vietnam War.\n       (16) The carrier America logged her 100,000th landing on \n     August 29, 1973. On May 6, 1981, the America was the first \n     United States Navy carrier to steam through the Suez Canal \n     since the U.S.S. Intrepid (CVA-11) made the passage shortly \n     before the Arab-Israeli ``Six-Day War'' of 1967. The America \n     was also the first supercarrier to transit the canal since it \n     had been modified to permit passage of supertankers.\n       (17) On January 7, 1986, President Ronald Reagan ordered \n     all American citizens out of Libya, and broke off all \n     remaining ties between the United States and Libya. At the \n     same time, President Reagan directed the dispatch of a second \n     carrier battle group to the Mediterranean, and directed the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff to look into military operations \n     against Libya.\n       (18) On April 5, 1986, two days after a bomb killed four \n     Americans along with others onboard a Trans World Airways \n     (TWA) flight en route from Rome, Italy, to Athens, Greece, \n     another bomb exploded in the La Belle Discoteque in West \n     Berlin, Germany, killing two members of the United States \n     Armed Forces and a Turkish civilian. Another 222 people were \n     wounded in the bombing, 78 Americans among them. Operation \n     Eldorado Canyon commenced early on the afternoon of April 14, \n     1986, and the carrier America, operating off the Libyan \n     coast, launched six A-6 Intruder strike aircraft and six A-7E \n     Corsair II aircraft in strike support.\n       (19) Following Operation Desert Storm, the carrier America \n     returned to the United States amid a heroes' welcome. The \n     America participated in Operation Welcome Home and Fleet Week \n     '91 in New York, New York, from June 6, 1991, through June \n     11, 1991, taking part in the largest victory parade since \n     World War II. After an abbreviated in-port period and \n     compressed work-ups, the America deployed to the North \n     Atlantic for two months in support of North Star '91, then \n     departed on December 2, 1991, for the Mediterranean and \n     Arabian Gulf once again, her eighteenth major deployment. The \n     America also became the first carrier to earn an \n     unprecedented third campaign star on the Southwest Asia \n     Service Medal.\n       (20) The carrier America departed Norfolk, Virginia, on \n     August 28, 1995, for a routine 6-month deployment to the \n     Mediterranean and to the Indian Ocean. This was the 20th and \n     final deployment in the 30-year history of the America as the \n     carrier participated in Operations Deny Flight and Deliberate \n     Force from September 9, 1995, to September 30, 1995.\n       (21) America returned to the pier in Norfolk, Virginia, \n     ending her Mediterranean Sea deployment on February 24, 1996. \n     After more than three decades of proud and historic naval \n     service, the America was decommissioned at Norfolk Naval \n     Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia on August 9, 1996.\n       (22) Stricken from the Navy List on the day of her \n     decommissioning, the carrier America was originally planned \n     to be scrapped. However, the carrier was sunk in the Atlantic \n     Ocean, approximately 300 miles off the Virginia coast, on May \n     14, 2005, following a series of tests consisting of \n     underwater and surface simulated attacks on the ship.\n       (23) In a letter to a coalition of veterans and former \n     crewmembers of the America who offered to make the carrier a \n     museum, the Vice Chief of Naval Operations explained that \n     ``America will make one final and vital contribution to our \n     national defense, this time as a live-fire test and \n     evaluation platform. America's legacy will serve as a \n     footprint in the design of future carriers -- ships that will \n     protect the sons, daughters, grandchildren and great-\n     grandchildren of America veterans''.\n\n[[Page S11869]]\n\n       (b) Naming of Next Aircraft Carrier.--It is the sense of \n     the Congress that the next nuclear-powered aircraft carrier \n     of the Navy be named U.S.S. America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2953.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FEDERALISM IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Iraq continues to experience a self-sustaining cycle of \n     sectarian violence.\n       (2) The ongoing sectarian violence presents a threat to \n     regional and world peace, and the long-term security \n     interests of the United States are best served by an Iraq \n     that is stable, not a haven for terrorists, and not a threat \n     to its neighbors.\n       (3) Iraqis must reach a comprehensive and sustainable \n     political settlement in order to achieve stability, and the \n     failure of the Iraqis to reach such a settlement is a primary \n     cause of increasing violence in Iraq.\n       (4) The Key Judgments of the January 2007 National \n     Intelligence Estimate entitled ``Prospects for Iraq's \n     Stability: A Challenging Road Ahead'' state, ``A number of \n     identifiable developments could help to reverse the negative \n     trends driving Iraq's current trajectory. They include: \n     Broader Sunni acceptance of the current political structure \n     and federalism to begin to reduce one of the major sources of \n     Iraq's instability . . . Significant concessions by Shia and \n     Kurds to create space for Sunni acceptance of federalism''.\n       (5) Article One of the Constitution of Iraq declares Iraq \n     to be a ``single, independent federal state''.\n       (6) Section Five of the Constitution of Iraq declares that \n     the ``federal system in the Republic of Iraq is made up of a \n     decentralized capital, regions, and governorates, and local \n     administrations'' and enumerates the expansive powers of \n     regions and the limited powers of the central government and \n     establishes the mechanisms for the creation of new federal \n     regions.\n       (7) The federal system created by the Constitution of Iraq \n     would give Iraqis local control over their police and certain \n     laws, including those related to employment, education, \n     religion, and marriage.\n       (8) The Constitution of Iraq recognizes the administrative \n     role of the Kurdistan Regional Government in 3 northern Iraqi \n     provinces, known also as the Kurdistan Region.\n       (9) The Kurdistan region, recognized by the Constitution of \n     Iraq, is largely stable and peaceful.\n       (10) The Iraqi Parliament approved a federalism law on \n     October 11th, 2006, which establishes procedures for the \n     creation of new federal regions and will go into effect 18 \n     months after approval.\n       (11) Iraqis recognize Baghdad as the capital of Iraq, and \n     the Constitution of Iraq stipulates that Baghdad may not \n     merge with any federal region.\n       (12) Despite their differences, Iraq's sectarian and ethnic \n     groups support the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq.\n       (13) Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated on \n     November 27, 2006, ``The crisis is political, and the ones \n     who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting of \n     innocents are the politicians''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should actively support a political \n     settlement among Iraq's major factions based upon the \n     provisions of the Constitution of Iraq that create a federal \n     system of government and allow for the creation of federal \n     regions;\n       (2) the active support referred to in paragraph (1) should \n     include--\n       (A) calling on the international community, including \n     countries with troops in Iraq, the permanent 5 members of the \n     United Nations Security Council, members of the Gulf \n     Cooperation Council, and Iraq's neighbors--\n       (i) to support an Iraqi political settlement based on \n     federalism;\n       (ii) to acknowledge the sovereignty and territorial \n     integrity of Iraq; and\n       (iii) to fulfill commitments for the urgent delivery of \n     significant assistance and debt relief to Iraq, especially \n     those made by the member states of the Gulf Cooperation \n     Council;\n       (B) further calling on Iraq's neighbors to pledge not to \n     intervene in or destabilize Iraq and to agree to related \n     verification mechanisms; and\n       (C) convening a conference for Iraqis to reach an agreement \n     on a comprehensive political settlement based on the creation \n     of federal regions within a united Iraq;\n       (3) the United States should urge the Government of Iraq to \n     quickly agree upon and implement a law providing for the \n     equitable distribution of oil revenues, which is a critical \n     component of a comprehensive political settlement based upon \n     federalism; and\n       (4) the steps described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) \n     could lead to an Iraq that is stable, not a haven for \n     terrorists, and not a threat to its neighbors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2998.

SPECIAL INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR AFGHANISTAN \n                   RECONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A democratic, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan is \n     vital to the national security of the United States and to \n     combating international terrorism.\n       (2) Since the fall of the Taliban, the United States has \n     provided Afghanistan with over $20,000,000,000 in \n     reconstruction and security assistance. However, repeated and \n     documented incidents of waste, fraud, and abuse in the \n     utilization of these funds have undermined reconstruction \n     efforts.\n       (3) There is a stronger need for vigorous oversight of \n     spending by the United States on reconstruction programs and \n     projects in Afghanistan.\n\n[[Page S11908]]\n\n       (4) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and \n     departmental Inspectors General provide valuable information \n     on such activities.\n       (5) The congressional oversight process requires more \n     timely reporting of reconstruction activities in Afghanistan \n     that encompasses the efforts of the Department of State, the \n     Department of Defense, and the United States Agency for \n     International Development and highlights specific acts of \n     waste, fraud, and abuse.\n       (6) One example of such successful reporting is provided by \n     the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction \n     (SIGIR), which has met this objective in the case of Iraq.\n       (7) The establishment of a Special Inspector General for \n     Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) position using SIGIR as a \n     model will help achieve this objective in Afghanistan. This \n     position will help Congress and the American people to better \n     understand the challenges facing United States programs and \n     projects in that crucial country.\n       (8) It is a priority for Congress to establish a Special \n     Inspector General for Afghanistan position with similar \n     responsibilities and duties as the Special Inspector General \n     for Iraq Reconstruction.

SENSE OF SENATE ON IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) General David Petraeus, commander of the Multi-National \n     Force Iraq, stated in testimony before a joint session of the \n     Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 10, \n     2007, that ``[i]t is increasingly apparent to both coalition \n     and Iraqi leaders that Iran, through the use of the Iranian \n     Republican Guard Corps Qods Force, seeks to turn the Shi'a \n     militia extremists into a Hezbollah-like force to serve its \n     interests and fight a proxy war against the Iraqi state and \n     coalition forces in Iraq''.\n       (2) Ambassador Ryan Crocker, United States Ambassador to \n     Iraq, stated in testimony before a joint session of the \n     Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 10, \n     2007, that ``Iran plays a harmful role in Iraq. While \n     claiming to support Iraq in its transition, Iran has actively \n     undermined it by providing lethal capabilities to the enemies \n     of the Iraqi state''.\n       (3) The most recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, \n     published in August 2007, states that ``Iran has been \n     intensifying aspects of its lethal support for select groups \n     of Iraqi Shia militants, particularly the JAM [Jaysh al-\n     Mahdi], since at least the beginning of 2006. Explosively \n     formed penetrator (EFP) attacks have risen dramatically''.\n       (4) The Report of the Independent Commission on the \n     Security Forces of Iraq, released on September 6, 2007, \n     states that ``[t]he Commission concludes that the evidence of \n     Iran's increasing activism in the southeastern part of the \n     country, including Basra and Diyala provinces, is compelling. \n     . . . It is an accepted fact that most of the sophisticated \n     weapons being used to `defeat' our armor protection comes \n     across the border from Iran with relative impunity''.\n       (5) General (Ret.) James Jones, chairman of the Independent \n     Commission on the Security Forces of Iraq, stated in \n     testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate on September 6, 2007, that ``[w]e judge that the \n     goings-on across the Iranian border in particular are of \n     extreme severity and have the potential of at least delaying \n     our efforts inside the country. Many of the arms and weapons \n     that kill and maim our soldiers are coming from across the \n     Iranian border''.\n       (6) General Petraeus said of Iranian support for extremist \n     activity in Iraq on April 26, 2007, that ``[w]e know that it \n     goes as high as [Brig. Gen. Qassem] Suleimani, who is the \n     head of the Qods Force. . . . We believe that he works \n     directly for the supreme leader of the country''.\n       (7) Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, the president of Iran, stated on \n     August 28, 2007, with respect to the United States presence \n     in Iraq, that ``[t]he political power of the occupiers is \n     collapsing rapidly. Soon we will see a huge power vacuum in \n     the region. Of course we are prepared to fill the gap''.\n       (8) Ambassador Crocker testified to Congress, with respect \n     to President Ahmedinejad's statement, on September 11, 2007, \n     that ``[t]he Iranian involvement in Iraq--its support for \n     extremist militias, training, connections to Lebanese \n     Hezbollah, provision of munitions that are used against our \n     force as well as the Iraqis--are all, in my view, a pretty \n     clear demonstration that Ahmedinejad means what he says, and \n     is already trying to implement it to the best of his \n     ability''.\n       (9) General Petraeus stated on September 12, 2007, with \n     respect to evidence of the complicity of Iran in the murder \n     of members of the Armed Forces of the United States in Iraq, \n     that ``[t]e evidence is very, very clear. We captured it when \n     we captured Qais Khazali, the Lebanese Hezbollah deputy \n     commander, and others, and it's in black and white. . . . We \n     interrogated these individuals. We have on tape. . . . Qais \n     Khazali himself. When asked, could you have done what you \n     have done without Iranian support, he literally throws up his \n     hands and laughs and says, of course not. . . . So they told \n     us about the amounts of money that they have received. They \n     told us about the training that they received. They told us \n     about the ammunition and sophisticated weaponry and all of \n     that that they received''.\n       (10) General Petraeus further stated on September 14, 2007, \n     that ``[w]hat we have got is evidence. This is not \n     intelligence. This is evidence, off computers that we \n     captured, documents and so forth. . . . In one case, a 22-\n     page document that lays out the planning, reconnaissance, \n     rehearsal, conduct, and aftermath of the operation conducted \n     that resulted in the death of five of our soldiers in Karbala \n     back in January''.\n       (11) The Department of Defense report to Congress entitled \n     ``Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq'' and released on \n     September 18, 2007, consistent with section 9010 of Public \n     Law 109-289, states that ``[t]here has been no decrease in \n     Iranian training and funding of illegal Shi'a militias in \n     Iraq that attack Iraqi and Coalition forces and civilians. . \n     . Tehran's support for these groups is one of the greatest \n     impediments to progress on reconciliation''.\n       (12) The Department of Defense report further states, with \n     respect to Iranian support for Shi'a extremist groups in \n     Iraq, that ``[m]ost of the explosives and ammunition used by \n     these groups are provided by the Iranian Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force. . . For the period of \n     June through the end of August, [explosively formed \n     penetrator] events are projected to rise by 39 percent over \n     the period of March through May''.\n       (13) Since May 2007, Ambassador Crocker has held three \n     rounds of talks in Baghdad on Iraq security with \n     representatives of the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran.\n       (14) Ambassador Crocker testified before Congress on \n     September 10, 2007, with respect to these talks, stating that \n     ``I laid out the concerns we had over Iranian activity that \n     was damaging to Iraq's security, but found no readiness on \n     Iranians' side at all to engage seriously on these issues. \n     The impression I came with after a couple rounds is that the \n     Iranians were interested simply in the appearance of \n     discussions, of being seen to be at the table with the U.S. \n     as an arbiter of Iraq's present and future, rather than \n     actually doing serious business . . . Right now, I haven't \n     seen any sign of earnest or seriousness on the Iranian \n     side''.\n       (15) Ambassador Crocker testified before Congress on \n     September 11, 2007, stating that ``[w]e have seen nothing on \n     the ground that would suggest that the Iranians are altering \n     what they're doing in support of extremist elements that are \n     going after our forces as well as the Iraqis''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) that the manner in which the United States transitions \n     and structures its military presence in Iraq will have \n     critical long-term consequences for the future of the Persian \n     Gulf and the Middle East, in particular with regard to the \n     capability of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     to pose a threat to the security of the region, the prospects \n     for democracy for the people of the region, and the health of \n     the global economy;\n       (2) that it is a vital national interest of the United \n     States to prevent the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran from turning Shi'a militia extremists in Iraq into a \n     Hezbollah-like force that could serve its interests inside \n     Iraq, including by overwhelming, subverting, or co-opting \n     institutions of the legitimate Government of Iraq;\n       (3) that it should be the policy of the United States to \n     combat, contain, and roll back the violent activities and \n     destabilizing influence inside Iraq of the Government of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran, its foreign facilitators such as \n     Lebanese Hezbollah, and its indigenous Iraqi proxies;\n       (4) to support the prudent and calibrated use of all \n     instruments of United States national power in Iraq, \n     including diplomatic, economic, intelligence, and military \n     instruments, in support of the policy described in paragraph \n     (3) with respect to the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran and its proxies;\n       (5) that the United States should designate the Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist \n     organization under section 219 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act and place the Islamic Revolutionary Guards \n     Corps on the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists, \n     as established under the International Emergency Economic \n     Powers Act and initiated under Executive Order 13224; and\n       (6) that the Department of the Treasury should act with all \n     possible expediency to complete the listing of those entities \n     targeted under United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n     1737 and 1747 adopted unanimously on December 23, 2006 and \n     March 24, 2007, respectively.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3018.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize September 2007 \nas National Life Insurance Awareness Month.\n  I speak from personal experience when I say that you should never \ntake for granted that you will always wake up tomorrow in the same \ncondition you are in today. We can never be sure when our time will \ncome, and it is always best to be prepared for the unexpected. An \nimportant part of preparedness is financial readiness, and that is why \nNational Life Insurance Awareness Month is needed.\n  There are 68 million Americans either with no life insurance or who \nare underinsured. It is concerning that there is such a large segment \nof the adult population in this country without proper financial \nplanning tools. In a time of loss, a life insurance policy can mean the \ndifference between having to sell the family home, pulling the kids out \nof college, or even, in some cases, having enough money to put food on \nthe table. I want to commend the National Association of Insurance and \nFinancial Advisors and the Life Insurance Foundation for Education as \nwell as more than 100 insurance companies for their effort to raise \nconsumer awareness of the important role that life insurance products \ncan play in helping families plan their financial futures.\n  I am also pleased that so many of our local financial advisors and \nfinancial institutions are already actively involved in helping South \nDakotans increase savings and plan financial contingencies for \nunexpected events. By designating September 2007 as ``Life Insurance \nAwareness Month,'' I hope that the increased national attention on this \nissue will further encourage people across America to achieve financial \nsecurity for themselves and their loved ones.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. I believe this matter is an important one. We have \ntroops in the field who are executing the policies we have asked them \nto execute. We don't need to be using buzz words; we need to be talking \nabout truth and facts and trying to make the right decisions for our \ncountry, and for the world for that matter.\n  I detect fundamentally in the Senator's comments and from quite a \nnumber of others that they believe, as the Senator said, ``there is no \nreal way out,'' and, in effect, we have a doomed\n\n[[Page S11915]]\n\npolicy that will not be successful. Therefore, we should withdraw now. \nIf that is the fact, I would agree we should withdraw now. So that is \nwhy I think we need to analyze this very point.\n  Last fall, a lot of people were worried about what was happening in \nIraq. I certainly was. I visited Iraq in October. I visited Al Anbar. \nIt was a very troubling report we received from the marines. It caused \nme great concern. Remarkably, Al Anbar region has shown, almost \novernight, tremendous progress.\n  But let's go to the facts. The Congress asked General Jimmy Jones and \nhis commission in May to independently evaluate Iraq when we did the \nfunding for the surge. General Jimmy Jones's report dealt with the \nfundamentals we are facing. I asked him did he believe it was \nrealistically possible that we could be successful in Iraq. And he \nsaid: Yes, sir. I asked him did a single member of his 20-member \ncommission believe that we were doomed to failure in Iraq, and he \nlooked around and asked his commission members, and none of them said \nthat was their view. They all believed we had a realistic chance of \nsuccess. I asked General Petraeus did he believe we had a realistic \nchance of success in Iraq, and he said, yes.\n  So I guess what I would say is, some say we do not. I would say the \npeople--the generals who are leading the effort there--say we have a \nrealistic chance of success. The independent commission we sent over \nthere of 20 members unanimously believes we do. So I think we should \nbase our opinion on the best information we have. As for me, I have to \naccept that.\n  I also factor into that rather dramatic improvements in the reduction \nof violence in Iraq, where within Baghdad we have seen a 70-percent \nreduction of civilian deaths and a 55-percent reduction of civilian \ndeaths across the country of Iraq. That is very significant. It is a \nproduct of many different things. It is a product of the new strategy \nas well as the new troops we sent there.\n  So I have to say to my friends and colleagues in the Senate: Yes, \nthis is a tough vote. Yes, we need to worry and agonize and think \ncarefully about the challenges we are now facing, and we need to make \nrational decisions. Based on the information I have and the committee \nhearings I have attended in Armed Services, my 6 visits to Iraq, I \nthink we should not precipitously withdraw. Well, they say, this is not \na precipitous withdrawal, it is a deadline, and that is going to make \nthe Iraqis do better. But it is not a deadline; it is a precipitous \nwithdrawal. I mean I just have to tell you, let's deal with facts.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment says the Secretary of Defense shall commence \nthe reduction of the number of U.S. forces in Iraq not later than 90 \ndays after the enactment of this act. And then it says: The Secretary \nof Defense shall complete the transition of the U.S. forces to a \nlimited presence and missions by not later than 9 months after the \nenactment of this date. So this is basically a 9-month mandated \nwithdrawal in Iraq, whether it creates instability and problems in \nplaces and puts our soldiers at greater risk or not. Unrelated to the \nfacts on the ground, it is an absolute, mandated withdrawal.\n  Now, if we were doomed to failure, maybe this is what we ought to do, \nbut I don't believe we are doomed to failure. I believe, as Senator \nLieberman said, there are a number of things that can cause us to feel \nbetter, and General Petraeus has certainly infused our effort with more \nleadership and effectiveness and purpose. His tactics utilizing \ncounterinsurgency principles seem to have made some real progress.\n  For example, he told us he is embedding his soldiers with the local \npeople and the local forces to an extraordinary degree, compared to \nwhat we have done before. As a matter of fact, I asked him about that. \nI said: What are you doing differently? He seemed to, I have to say, \nappreciate the question because he had been asked so many other things. \nBut he is doing things differently, and he explained some of the things \nhe is doing. We are embedding our soldiers with their soldiers. They \nare living with them. They are in the neighborhoods. As a result, we \nare receiving more information, and the number of caches of weapons \nthat have been seized so far this year put us on a pace to double the \nnumber of weapons and munitions seizures that we have achieved this \nyear, doubling the previous rate. He said in his mind that may have \nsomething to do with the fact that attacks have been down and the \nnumber of IED attacks have dropped 37 percent. He didn't overpromise or \ndeclare that. He said it might have something to do with that, that we \nare obtaining twice as many caches of weapons and seizing those as a \ndirect result of more and better information from the people of Iraq.\n  So I would also join my colleague, Senator McCain, who certainly \nknows something about war firsthand, in concluding that the limited \npresence mandated in this amendment, the Reed-Levin amendment, that \nsays that the mission of our forces that are left in Iraq can only be \nfor the following purposes: No. 1, protecting U.S. and coalition \npersonnel and infrastructure--base security, defending our bases--No. \n2, training, equipping, and providing logistic support to the Iraqi \nsecurity forces; and No. 3, engaging in targeted--this is a legal \nmandate--targeted counterterrorism operations against al-Qaida, al-\nQaida-affiliated groups, and other international terrorist \norganizations. That is all they can do. As Senator McCain said, asking \nthis question: Are they going to wear T-shirts that say: I am an al-\nQaida, I am a Shia, or a Sunni terrorist; I am a Baathist warrior, and \nwe can only shoot at those--use force against those who wear the al-\nQaida T-shirts? This is not a practical, realistic directive to the \nU.S. military. We are not capable of deciding how to deploy the forces \nwe have there. We are just not capable. This is a bunch of \npoliticians--that is all we are--doing our best effort to serve the \npeople. We don't have to be bound--I certainly agree--by a report from \na general or the President.\n\n  We can act if we choose to act. But we need to ask ourselves, are we \ngoing to dismiss the testimony of our top generals and the independent \nJones commission about the progress that is being made and the \nrealistic chance of success that exists? In fact, I think it may be a \nrealistic fact that one reason Osama bin Laden is all over the \ntelevision apparently in the last few days is because he is getting \nworried. The Sunni support area of Al Anbar in Iraq has turned against \nhim and his people, and they are fighting against him and have \ndevastated much of their capability in the Al Anbar region--a direct \nchange from what I was told last October when that was not occurring. \nWe are working with local police, local mayors, local tribal leaders, \nand that is yielding progress to a degree we have not seen before in \nIraq. It appears to be a model that can lead us more successfully than \ntrying to meet with a bunch of politicians in downtown Baghdad and \ntrying to reach an accord that is going to affect something in Fallujah \nor Samarra or Mosul. Washington, DC, can't affect Alabama or Nebraska \nvery well.\n  But this country is not capable of issuing orders that can impact \nsuccessfully the daily lives in these provinces and small towns. That \nis a product of the new nature of that Government and the lack of \nmaturity it has. So we are using different tactics that seem to be \nworking.\n  Well, we have said our military is being damaged and our morale is \nbad and we have real problems there. Certainly, we have had a \ntremendous amount of our military personnel there, and they have \nperformed with the greatest professionalism. They are well trained, \nwell disciplined, well equipped, they know how to use the equipment \nwith which they have trained, and they are performing in a magnificent \nway. They are at risk every day and they are doing their jobs \neffectively.\n  For example, a few days ago, a group came to visit my office from \nAlabama. They were called Veterans for Freedom. It was made up of \nAlabama Army National Guardsmen and Army Reservists. I had the honor of \nbeing an Army Reservist for 10 years. I never served in combat, but I \nam honored to have been one of them. These are citizen soldiers. They \nrecently returned from being mobilized in Iraq. These soldiers were all \nsenior noncommissioned officers. They had demobilized and were back at \ntheir civilian jobs. They asked for a couple days off to visit the \noffices of Alabama's congressional delegation. They\n\n[[Page S11916]]\n\nhad several messages for me. The first message was: We have to win this \nbattle.\n  The group truly believes the contribution their unit had made in the \nwar effort was measurable and positive. One of the guardsmen had been \nwounded in an IED attack early in the deployment. Thankfully, he was \nnot seriously wounded and he returned to duty. He noted that by the end \nof the deployment, IEDs were no longer a threat in his area of \noperation. The message was simply their service had made a difference.\n  Another message to me was: We cannot afford to lose this fight by \nsimply giving up. I didn't make up that phrase--that a precipitous \nwithdrawal is equivalent to giving up. That is what four veterans of \nIraq told me they perceived we were considering doing. They urged us \nnot to do it. Certainly, Iraq cannot be another United States in a \nshort time, they told us. But it can become self-governing and self-\nsufficient.\n  The group further stated it may be necessary for us to modify our \nobjectives in this fight, but please don't quit. The senior NCOs \nfinished by telling us they had at least one child, or spouse, on \nactive duty or serving as a reservist or Guard member. This was a \ntestimony--a form of saying to me they and their families believed in \nwhat they were doing, even if it meant they have to go back to Iraq \nagain. After making this statement, they were quite polite. They \nthanked my team for the time they had with us and the few minutes they \nhad to be heard. They came all the way up here to share that.\n  I say that because I am not hearing the kind of talk from the people \nwho are in Iraq serving our country now that I am hearing from the \npoliticians in Congress. I am not hearing that.\n  What about Jeff Emanuel, a former special operations veteran of Iraqi \nFreedom? He wrote an article in the Washington Times recently. He \ntalked about the situation we find ourselves in today. The title of the \narticle is: ``Iraqis show courage. Can Congress do the same?''\n  My colleague from Massachusetts, I think, was a bit too dismissive of \nthe challenges faced by the Iraqi military police and the Iraqi \nleaders. They have a very difficult challenge, I admit that. I \ncertainly admit that. I think this Nation cannot pour resources into \nIraq if we reach the decision it cannot be successful. We will have to \nextricate ourselves no matter what.\n  But I have to tell you I don't see it that way right now. This is \nwhat Mr. Emanuel said:\n\n        . . . Iraqis in many locations have shown amazing courage, \n     not only by providing an ever-increasing amount of \n     information on insurgent activity to coalition forces, but \n     also by working to rebuild what the insurgents have \n     destroyed, as well as by putting their lives on the line to \n     drive terrorists out of their own villages. They do this \n     despite the fact that they do not know whether they will wake \n     up the next day to find that the coalition--currently their \n     best source of protection--has succumbed to the calls from \n     home (which are heard here by civilians and terrorists alike) \n     to leave Iraq, and has abandoned them.\n\n  So they are hearing the talk here. It creates instability and \nuncertainty for those who want to stand with us and help them to \nprevail and create a good and decent government in Iraq, if they think \nwe may flee the country the next day. Mr. Emanuel says:\n\n       In April and May of this year, and again from the beginning \n     of August through the present, I have been embedded [him \n     personally] in some of the most kinetic combat zones in Iraq, \n     observing General Petraeus's strategy from the ground level \n     in several different locations, and have seen clear evidence \n     of the strategy's effects on the situation there.\n       I have personally observed clinics in which coalition \n     medics and doctors provided villagers with a level of care \n     that has long been unheard of in the country.\n\n  He goes on to say this is still a broken and unstable country. That I \ndo not doubt. Yet progress is inarguably being made, he said. He goes \non to note this:\n\n       A successful counterinsurgency is one thing, with a \n     timeline which is measured not in months, but in years. \n     However, to wage a successful counterinsurgency and then to \n     build a stable, autonomous and secure state, which we can \n     leave behind without risking its imminent collapse, is \n     another matter altogether.\n\n  He went on to note we must not break faith with those who have stood \nwith us and made their commitment.\n  We all are concerned about the situation in Iraq. The people I talk \nto--the military people I talk to see us as having a realistic \npossibility of helping to establish a decent government in Iraq--maybe \nnot the kind of democracy we would like to have seen but something that \ncan work, be a bulwark against an aggressive Iran and be a bulwark in a \nhostile base against al-Qaida and the terrorists there, who could be an \nally to the United States. We have allies in the region. We have a base \nin Qatar, Bahrain, and we have strong allies in Kuwait and other places \nin the Middle East. We continue to have those and we will continue to \ndo so. But there is a danger, without a doubt, about an expansive Iran \nand its leadership who seem to be disconnected from reality in many \ndifferent ways. Iran's President Ahmadi-Nejad declared a few days ago \nthat U.S. political influence was collapsing rapidly and said Tehran \nwas ready to help fill the power vacuum. He said:\n\n       Soon, we will see a huge power vacuum in the region. Of \n     course, we are prepared to fill that gap.\n\n  That is from the Philadelphia Inquirer of August 29. So the \nconsequences of what we are doing are serious.\n  Let me address one more time a rapid precipitous withdrawal and what \nit means as it is contained in the Levin-Reed amendment. Imagine you \nare a military commander and you have 160,000 troops in Iraq. You are \ntold you have 9 months to withdraw everything but a token force to \ntrain Iraqis and to protect your own bases and to chase individual al-\nQaida members and those associated with them. We are talking about more \nthan a brigade of 5,500 troops a month having to be pulled out. When \nyou have an area of responsibility that has been assigned to a military \nbrigade and you draw those down, then somebody has to assume the \nresponsibility for that territory. How do you do that? That takes time, \nplanning, and care. You can get in a withdrawal or a situation that \ncosts lives and will completely destabilize any progress that has been \nmade. The military commanders have told us it cannot be done. You \ncannot draw down more than a brigade a month. That is a too fast pace. \nRemember, it is a brigade that has an area of responsibility of \ninterfacing with American and coalition forces all around it, plus it \ninterfaces with local police, mayors, and tribal leaders, plus it \ninterfaces with the Iraqi Army and Iraqi police.\n  All of that is part of the responsibility and the relationship that \nhas built up. To precipitously pull out in 9 months all these forces \nand draw them back to only a few bases and give them a limited \nresponsibility, is a huge, reckless idea that can only result in chaos, \nconfusion and unnecessary death and will destabilize Iraq, destabilize \nthe region perhaps, and cost more lives.\n  Why don't we listen to what our fabulous general, General Petraeus, \nhas said? He said: I understand we need to draw down these troops. I \nplan to draw down troops in Iraq. That is certainly my goal.\n  I will say what I have said many times. The surge was a bitter pill \nfor me. I had certainly hoped that in 2006 we would be drawing down \ntroops, not having to increase troop levels. But that is what we voted \nto do in this Congress by an 80-to-14 vote. We funded that surge, and \nnow we are getting a report on it.\n  He said: I have had success by reducing violence in Baghdad and in \nthe country. I am not going to replace a Marine unit that will be \ndeparting within a few weeks. That will reduce the numbers. I will \nbring a brigade home before Christmas and that will be another 5,000-\nplus personnel. I will continue to draw down next year according to my \nplan through the summer, and I believe I can achieve a 30,000 troop \nreduction by next summer.\n  He said: In March, I will report to the Congress again, and I will \ntell you what further reductions we can achieve, and I hope to be able \nto announce further reductions.\n  That is the kind of withdrawal that is consistent with our ultimate \ngoal, to create a stable and decent Iraq in which the Iraqi Army and \nthe Iraqi police can assume more and more responsibility.\n\n[[Page S11917]]\n\n  To me, the stakes are so high, the challenges and threats so great \nthat we ought not be driven by polling data. We ought to ask ourselves: \nWhat is right for America? What is right for our soldiers? If they are \npulled out and this country falls because we acted recklessly, there \nare going to be more morale problems than we can imagine in the United \nStates military. There are going to be some angry people. They are \ngoing to be very disappointed in the Congress. They put their necks on \nthe line because we asked them to. They lost friends and have wounded \nfriends in this conflict, and then we up and jump away and undermine \nall that effort. It is not going to be pleasant, either.\n  I say to my colleagues, I understand the purpose of this amendment. \nIt wants reduction in forces. It wants to see us less engaged in the \nactual military operations in Iraq. We want to see more of that done by \nthe Iraqi Army, the Iraqi police, and that is what General Petraeus \nwants. He has a plan to achieve that goal. This is a general who has \nwritten a manual for the Department of Defense on how to defeat an \ninsurgency, a counterinsurgency manual. Let's give him that \nopportunity. He is making progress so far. Let's do our duty and watch.\n  We are not bound by everything General Petraeus says. We are not \nbound by everything President Bush says. Yes, we are an independent \nbody. We have individual responsibilities to make up our own minds. But \nif we do this, let's do it right. Let's don't be flip-flopping around. \nThat is not worthy of a great nation. We cannot send troops in one day \nand jerk them out the next. Let's follow through in this difficult \nperiod and see if we can achieve that realistic chance of success that \nall 20 members of the Jones commission reported they believe is \npossible and as General Petraeus has told us he believes is possible. I \nbelieve it is the right thing for America to reject the Levin-Reed \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/20/senate-section/article/S11917-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:15 A.M.
