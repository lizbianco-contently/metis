The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after my \nremarks, the senior Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, be allowed to \nspeak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, housing is on the minds of so many Ohioans \nthese days, as it is on people's minds across the country. My State has \nthe unfortunate distinction of leading the Nation in the percentage of \nproperty in foreclosure.\n  Every day, 200 Ohio families lose their homes--200 families every \nsingle day. The strides we have made as a Nation in increasing home \nownership in the last few years will be reversed if we don't act.\n  The foreclosure crisis is having a tremendous impact on all of Ohio. \nNo city, no region has been spared. The past few years have seen an \nexplosion of predatory lending. The State of Ohio was slow to respond, \nwhile the Federal Government--regulators and Congress and the \nPresident--have been even slower to respond. Today, we pay the price.\n  As late as this summer, President Bush and Secretary Paulson--the \nBush administration--indicated the problem was largely contained and it \nwould\n\n[[Page S1394]]\n\nplay itself out. So long as the problem was largely contained to Ohio, \nMichigan, Indiana, Illinois, and the Presiding Officer's State of West \nVirginia, the situation was nothing to worry about. But once the \nproblem spread from Main Street, Cleveland, or Main Street, Dayton, to \nWall Street, the administration suddenly became a bit concerned. Not \noverly concerned, mind you. For while it changed its tone a bit, its \nwords have not been accompanied by much action. The budget submitted by \nPresident Bush shows, for example, no signs of a housing crisis. \nCongress appropriated $180 million for housing counseling last \nSeptember at the urging of Senator Schumer, Senator Casey of \nPennsylvania, and me, from the Banking Committee, but the President \nproposes only about one-third of that for the year ahead and criticizes \nthe Reid proposal for continuing that funding.\n\n  As cities see their crime rates go up and their property tax bases \nshrink and more and more homes and families vandalized, with copper and \naluminum being stripped from these homes, the President proposes to cut \nthe community development block grant by more than 20 percent.\n  I appreciate Secretary Paulson's efforts to get voluntary action by \nlenders and servicers. That is a good thing, but it is not nearly \nenough. We have seen a rate of mortgage modifications rise from a \nmeasly 1 percent to a meager 3 percent. And I have to say, I am not \nconfident how much progress even those numbers represent.\n  My office just heard from a struggling homeowner in Ohio whose lender \noffered to reduce her interest rate from 11 percent to 10 percent. But \nafter penalties and late fees were added to the principal, her monthly \npayment barely budged.\n  Earlier this week, a couple from Lyndhurst, OH, joined Senators \nKlobuchar, Schumer, Durbin, and me in Washington to tell their story. \nJohn and Vicki Glicken went through a rough patch when John lost his \njob, but he found a new one, and they are doing their best to make \ntheir payments and stay in their home. They have done everything as \ncitizens and as homeowners that we would ask, but doing so is going to \nbe impossible for them so long as they are stuck with a loan that costs \nmore and more every 6 months.\n  These families, and millions like them across America, need our help. \nInstead, they are facing foreclosure on one side and a filibuster on \nthe other. That is unconscionable.\n  The legislation we are being prevented from considering, with the \nvote yesterday, when our efforts were blocked, would help hundreds of \nthousands of families like the Glickens. It would help the tens of \nthousands of communities from Ironton, across the river from West \nVirginia, to Steubenville, to Cleveland, to Dayton.\n  I applaud Majority Leader Reid for trying to act on the legislation \nthat would provide vital help to communities and families across the \ncountry. Under this bill, which I am proud to cosponsor, housing \nagencies would have access to lower cost financing; businesses that are \nstruggling would get a boost; cities would be helped by an infusion of \ncommunity development funds, big cities and smaller cities alike; and \nfamilies would be able to restructure their debts and get back on their \nfeet.\n  The administration has made a lot of voluntary efforts to date, and \nto be sure, every bit helps. But the rate freeze will help only a very \nsmall sliver of people, of borrowers, and banks just aren't being \nresponsive enough. They say they have no interest in foreclosing on \nhomes, and that is perhaps true, but they do not seem to have the \ncapacity to work out loans with people who could afford to make \npayments on a reasonable loan long term. I know lenders want to avoid \nbecoming real estate owners, but they do not have the ability to deal \nwith problems their lax underwriting standards have created, and they \nare obviously not in the business of rebuilding the communities this \ncrisis has threatened.\n  That is why I think Senator Harry Reid's legislation is so important. \nIf we can spend $3 billion a week on the war in Iraq, we can find room \nin our budget to spend $4 billion a year to help communities across \nAmerica get back on their feet. There are billions, tens of billions of \ndollars to rebuild Iraq. Yet President Bush says no to $4 billion to \nrebuild our cities.\n  The administration has argued this constitutes a bailout for lenders \nand speculators. In Ohio, we are going to meet these people in the \ncourthouse, all right, but I assure my colleagues it won't be to record \nthe title on some sweetheart deal. Anybody who tries to make the \nargument that cities, both large and small alike, will use community \ndevelopment funds to bail out lenders and speculators has no clue what \nis going on in communities such as Springfield and Zanesville and \nChillicothe.\n  As we try to rebuild our communities, we must do everything we can to \nkeep families in their homes. If lenders and their servicers can't keep \nup with the flood of foreclosures they are facing, it is essential we \npermit the bankruptcy courts to serve as a backdrop; otherwise, the \nproblem only gets worse.\n  Consider this, Mr. President: One of the ratings agencies is now \npredicting a 50-percent default rate for subprime loans made in the \nfourth quarter of 2006--a 50-percent default rate for securitized \nsubprime loans. That is not lending, that is putting a bet on black at \nthe roulette table with somebody else's home. What happens when that \nbet goes bad? A family is put out on the street, a neighborhood is \nhurt, and a town has one more magnet for trouble.\n  The banks have trouble too. Nationwide, banks are recovering only \nabout 60 cents on the dollar for what they are owed when a home goes \ninto foreclosure. In Ohio, that number is only 35 cents, by one \nestimate. When lenders recover only 35 cents on the dollar on a \nforeclosure in my State, I don't think they have anything to fear from \nan alternative process that may result in avoiding foreclosure. Judges \nwould only step in when voluntary efforts have failed and when a family \nis on the ropes.\n  That is why the Reid bill's proposal to permit the modification of \nthe mortgages on primary residences makes so much sense. We know \nservicers can't keep up with the flood of bad loans, so we need a \nbackstop for the 600,000 or so families that may well end up in \nbankruptcy. Allowing bankruptcy judges to modify a loan on a primary \nresidence, just as they can do today on a loan for a vacation home or a \nboat or a family farm or a small business, will not just keep a family \nin a home, it will keep the bank from a 65-percent loss on that \nproperty.\n  Two years ago, there were a lot of slick promises made about how \nthese loans could be refinanced. Today, we know that is just not the \ncase. So we need to act, and we need to act soon so that 2 years from \nnow we can focus again on expanding home ownership under reasonable \nterms rather than trying to stop the bleeding.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me commend the Senator from Ohio for his \nvery thoughtful and very persuasive remarks about a crisis that is \ngripping almost every family in this country. We are in an \nextraordinarily daunting moment in our history, and I was disappointed, \nto say the least, when our colleagues on the Republican side blocked \nconsideration of the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. Every \nhousehold in this country is beginning to recognize the specter of \ndecreasing house prices, and for many it is not just a looming \npotential, it is a reality, and it is forcing them to consider very \ndifficult choices in their own family lives.\n  We have had a situation over the last 8 years in which the income of \nworking families has been stagnant, and in contrast, prices for items \nthat are essential, such as energy and food and health care, have gone \nup dramatically. Families across this country have been squeezed by \nflat incomes and rising prices. But there was one point of hope and \nconfidence, a foundation, at least, for their hopes going forward, and \nthat was the value of their home because it was appreciating. Now that \nhas reversed dramatically, and there are estimates that if nothing is \ndone, if the administration continues to block efforts through their \ncolleagues here in the Senate and the House, we could lose somewhere up \nto 30 percent of the value of homes throughout the United\n\n[[Page S1395]]\n\nStates, from their peak several years ago to the trough that is \nanticipated. That would mean the loss of $4 to $6 trillion in household \nwealth--a staggering figure. It is a figure that, from a macroeconomic \nstandpoint, would have huge ramifications.\n  But let us step down to the actual effects on a family. What does it \nmean? Well, it means your senior in high school who was planning on \ngoing to a prestigious college is not going there. They are going to \nfind an alternative, maybe a State school or another school, because \nyou were going to pay for that, partially, by taking some money out of \nyour house, which was worth so much. If you didn't have adequate health \ncare, that was the reassurance you had, that if there was a major \nhealth care crisis in your family--a child or your spouse--that at \nleast you could go in and quickly get some money. Now that has \nevaporated. If you are a retiree or about to retire, your plan was \npretty simple: You had a home you were going to sell and you were going \nto use the profits to help you fund your retirement.\n  This housing crisis is affecting working families across the country. \nThey are now discovering, around the kitchen table, that their plans \nare being frustrated. We have to do something.\n  Yesterday, when this Senate failed to at least consider moving to \nlegislation like this, I think it is a telling indication of the \ndetachment from the reality of American lives that the administration \nand some of their colleagues here have.\n  Today, in my home State of Rhode Island, an added complexity, \nunemployment, is beginning to creep up. And ``creep'' is probably too \nmild a word. It is 5.67 percent, the worst record of unemployment we \nhave had since the mid-1990s. That is another blow to the working \nfamilies in this country.\n  So we must act. One other startling statistic to me is today it has \nbeen estimated that 10 percent of the households in America are upside \ndown, not physically but financially. Ten percent of the homes, the \nmortgage is greater than the value of the home because of declining \nhome prices.\n  Now, what does that mean? Well, not only have you lost your nest egg, \nin many cases you now are in a situation of being tempted to just walk \naway from the home. Why are you making expensive mortgage payments at \ngreat sacrifice when the home is not worth it?\n  These are real problems people across the country are facing. It is \nno longer a localized problem. It is no longer a certain section of the \ncountry is having a bad time, but the rest of the country is doing \nwell. Nationwide, for the first time since the Great Depression, we \nhave seen housing prices decline. That is a phenomenon that has to be \ndealt with. Ignoring it or suggesting that we are indifferent to that, \nas I think one can assume from the action of yesterday, is, I think, \nnot only wrong, it is bad policy. It also is bad policy because the \nsooner we take proactive action, the more effective we will be in \nlessening the consequence of this crisis on working Americans.\n  We are going to act eventually. This is not going to go away. The \nstaggering numbers that Senator Brown pointed to, the estimates that \nthere are so many more interest rate resets and so many more people \nwill be overwhelmed by these alternative mortgages, these subprime \nmortgages, that is not fiction; that is the projection of the financial \nanalysts. It is going to happen.\n  We have to move now. If we move now, we move deliberately. We cannot \neliminate some of the pain, but we can certainly lessen it. We also \nhave to recognize, too, that we can only help those who are prepared to \ncarry and shoulder the mortgage going forward. But I think if we act, \nif we act properly, we cannot only make progress, but we can respond to \nwhat is becoming an overwhelming cry for relief for American families \nacross this country.\n  In Rhode Island, for example, we have seen mortgage delinquencies \nincrease from 6,100 in the third quarter of 2005, to 10,300. Again, \nRhode Island is the smallest State in the Union. We have 1 million \npeople. So these numbers, when you project them to Ohio, are much \nlarger. But in my State, we are, unfortunately, seeing unprecedented \nforeclosures.\n  According to the Joint Economic Committee, the number of subprime \nforeclosures in Rhode Island will total 5,800 between the third quarter \nof 2007 and 2009. We are seeing an acceleration and, in fact, we have \nthe dubious distinction of having the highest foreclosure rate in New \nEngland. There are other parts of the country that are worse, but we \nhave that unfortunate distinction.\n  We are going to see the cost of these foreclosures in Rhode Island \nrise to an estimated level of $670 million from the end of 2007 to \n2009. Those are huge figures from a small State like mine. In fact, \nforecasters are estimating that the foreclosure cost could total nearly \n$104 billion nationwide. But one of the things about these numbers that \nthe numbers are growing--I have been looking closely at this crisis \nsince last April when I was chairman of the Subcommittee on Securities \nand Insurance. We had a subcommittee hearing on securitization of \nsubprime mortgages and the experts estimated that the subprime crisis \nwas going to result in $19 billion in losses worldwide; that it was \nover because the mortgages were no longer being issued; that we were in \na situation that would be almost self-correcting if we just let the \nmarkets work their will.\n  Well, that $19 billion in terms of losses to financial institutions \nis now being estimated to be as high as $600 billion worldwide, and the \nlosses keep growing and growing and growing.\n  Again, I think another strong rationale for immediate action, not \nsimply letting the market take its course, is we are seeing not only a \ndeterioration in the financing mechanisms in the mortgage market, but \nthis liquidity crisis is spreading over to other financing mechanisms. \nWe have seen financing mechanisms for municipal bonds, for example, \nliterally shutting down. There was a technique where municipalities and \nhospitals would, on a weekly basis, reset the rate for their bonds in \nan auction. The auctions have failed. The Port Authority of New York \njust a few weeks ago went from an interest rate of 4 percent to 20 \npercent, the default rate.\n  I have talked to a hospital in my State. I asked them, among many \nother issues, what is happening with respect to their financing. Their \nrates are shooting up because their option securities are not working \nany longer.\n  This credit crisis, this liquidity crisis, is spreading from \nmortgages to car loans to securitization of credit card receipts to \nmunicipal securities, and it is slowing down the economy.\n  Now, the President does not think we are going into a recession. But, \nfrankly, most everybody else does think we are going into recession. \nAnd we have to act, not only to directly respond to this housing \ncrisis, but also to pull this country back as quickly as we can from \nthis pending recession.\n\n  I think one of the most important lines of approach to dealing with \nthis problem is bolstering the housing market. That was one of the \nmajor engines that moved our economy for so many years. If we let it \ndeteriorate, if we just shrug our shoulders and say, eventually, it \nwill come back, we not only will see a very poor housing market, we \nwill see a recession. And it will be more severe and more consequential \nthan it ought to be.\n  Now, the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates dramatically. We, \nvery quickly, in a bipartisan fashion, passed a $168 billion stimulus \npackage that will help. But I do not think it is going to be sufficient \nunless we make significant efforts to deal with the housing problems \nthat are affecting all Americans today.\n  The administration proposed a Hope Now Plan, a voluntary effort to \ndeal with foreclosure problems. And, again, as Senator Brown pointed \nout today, to date 3 percent of potential foreclosures have been \navoided through this voluntary effort. This is not an effective way to \ndeal with the huge problems that threaten the economic well-being of \nthis country and all of the families of America. This administration is \ngreat on slogans but poor on strategy and execution. Just a week after \nI was talking to the Under Secretary of the Treasury about the Hope Now \nProgram, I said: Well, do you have a plan B? This does not seem to be \nworking.\n  ``No, this will work. We will have the metrics in a few weeks.'' Then \nthe administration announced another program. I think it is called the \nLifeline\n\n[[Page S1396]]\n\nProgram. Well, we need something more than slogans. We are going to \nneed something more than hopeful wishes that everyone will get along \nand coordinate together. We need definite help for the homeowners in \nour communities.\n  Embedded in the legislation that Senator Reid proposed was that \nspecific kind of help: foreclosure counseling funding, CDBG monies for \ncommunities to deal more comprehensively with the problems caused by \nforeclosures, because one of the consequences of foreclosure is it is \nnot just the individual's home, statistical analysis over many years \npoints out very clearly that the surrounding homes lose value when \nthere is a foreclosure on the block. And if those homes are on the \ntipping point, guess what. They will tip into foreclosure. I do not \nthink I have to tell anyone in this Chamber, because we have seen it \nbefore, that once you have this growing sort of malaise in the \ncommunity, it spreads block by block by block by block until you have a \ncommunity-wide problem of not only foreclosures but of despair.\n  I am taking, I think unfortunately, an example from Senator Brown's \nState. But I read a few weeks ago about a community in the Midwest, \neither Ohio or Pennsylvania, and it was an old ethnic community. In \nfact, I think the nickname for the community was Slavic Town. There, \nthe foreclosures have been so extensive that literally gangs are going \nin and ripping off the vinyl siding, the plumbing. They are taking out \nthe copper piping because it has been abandoned, this forlorn \ncommunity, in the heartland of this great country.\n  A tragic case was a retired gentleman who was trying to protect his \nproperty which he had worked for all of his life. He was killed by some \nof these marauding gangs. That is here in America. We are just going to \nsit back and say: Well, the market will adjust someday. No, I think we \nhave to do much more.\n  Unfortunately, because of the policies of this administration, we are \nnot as well positioned to do what we have to do. Yesterday Chairman \nBernanke was before the Banking Committee. In response to a question by \nSenator Dodd, he said: Frankly, we are in a worse position today than 8 \nyears ago to deal with this crisis, the housing crisis. Falling \nproductivity, falling value of the dollar--yesterday, the dollar hit a \nnew low against the Euro, and I think today against other currencies. \nSurging oil prices--yesterday the price of oil went to $102 a barrel, \nwhich is translated automatically at the gas pump into higher gasoline \nprices, higher heating oil prices.\n  These are huge, huge, huge problems. Because of decisions made by \nthis administration, we do not have surpluses we had 8 years ago. We \nare committed to a conflict in Iraq which costs $190 billion a year. \nAnd even with a change in policy, there will be, unfortunately, not a \ndramatic shift in spending in the next several months because it takes \ntime to disengage and to change policies.\n  So we are seeing economic vulnerabilities because of, I think, the \npolicies of this administration. We have forfeited the strength we had \n8 years ago to deal with these issues. We understand, too, from looking \nacross the globe at other countries that if you do not move promptly \nand aggressively and deal with problems like this, they do not go away, \nthey get worse.\n  In the 1980s, we had a S crisis. It took about 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years \nfor, first, the Reagan administration, then the George Herbert Walker \nBush administration to deal with it. In those 2\\1/2\\ years, experts on \neither side of the aisle pointed out that the cost of remediation went \nup and up and up. I fear that is the same situation we are going to \nhave today unless we deal promptly and immediately with this housing \nsituation.\n  Again, I think the vote yesterday to stop consideration of \nlegislation to help deal with this crisis was very short-sighted and \nunfortunate. Now, as I said before, the legislation we would have \nconsidered, the Foreclosure Prevention Act, of which I am a proud \ncosponsor, deals with, in a very pragmatic way, many of the features of \nthe housing crisis that are of immediate concern: the $200 million \nforeclosure counseling, and part of that has to be not only setting up \nthe counseling but also outreach. We have to do more of that.\n\n  It also allows State housing finance agencies to increase their \nbonds, raise capital to buy mortgages to essentially take out the \ncurrent mortgage holders, renegotiate the terms with the borrower, and \nput them in a mortgage plan they can live with and afford. In fact, the \nPresident has called for that, but he is objecting to its inclusion, I \npresume, in this legislation. Then there is a change in the Bankruptcy \nCode, which has been carefully tailored so as not to roil the financial \nmarkets. It would allow a very limited category of individuals who have \nthese subprime mortgages to go into bankruptcy court and allow the \nbankruptcy judge to set up a new payment plan. The first criterion he \nor she would have to look at is the fact that these individuals do, in \nfact, qualify for bankruptcy protections, that if there is a \nrestructuring of their mortgage loan, they can carry out the terms of \nthat loan.\n  This is not only giving people a chance who don't have the \nwherewithal to take up that opportunity. There is also language in the \nbill that sets the lowest rate charged as the prime rate, plus a \npremium for risk. So this does not allow a bankruptcy judge to take an \n11-percent mortgage and make it a 1-percent mortgage or a zero-percent \nmortgage. There is a very narrowly tailored exception. As my colleague, \nSenator Brown, pointed out, you can do that with a second home. You \ncould do that with a farm, if you are in bankruptcy. I don't see why, \nin this particular crisis, we cannot extend that same protection to \nhomeowners who have subprime mortgages and need immediate help. I think \nit would accelerate efforts to not only help these individuals in \nbankruptcy, but it would send a strong message to the financial \ncommunity that unless they get engaged with working out these \nforeclosures and mortgages, there is the alternative of bankruptcy \ncourt which, if they think it is so onerous, then they should be even \nmore incentivized to work with borrowers to ensure foreclosure doesn't \ntake place and new mortgage terms are negotiated.\n  An additional element in this legislation is language I suggested as \na way to prevent a reoccurrence in the future of this type of mortgage \nproblem by giving the borrowers, in a timely way before they close on \nthe loan, specific information that is essential. The most specific \ninformation is the maximum payment they would pay under the terms of \nthe mortgage. There is a lot of discussion about people who were \nwinking at each other across the table, can't afford the mortgage, but \n``I will take it if you give it to me.'' Many people honestly walked \nin, sat down, and thought they were getting a mortgage of 5 or 6 \npercent with a payment on a monthly basis of perhaps $1,500 or $2,000. \nTough to afford, but it was within their budget. But lo and behold, \nyears later or months later, that initial teaser rate became much \nhigher. That maximum payment should be disclosed. A borrower should be \nable to look at the piece of paper and say: At some point in this \nmortgage, I will have to be paying $2,500 a month. That is the type of \ninformation people need to know. Frankly, many would say: I can't \nafford that.\n  There is a suggestion I have heard so often in the debate that we \nwould be rewarding families and homeowners who were trying to take \nadvantage of a good deal with these subprime mortgages. The impression \nI have, from talking to people in Rhode Island, is that for many \nfamilies, going back 2 or 3 years, they found themselves saddled with \nextraordinary credit card debt at interest rates that could be as high \nas 15 to 18 percent. Why? If you have a health care problem, where do \nyou go? The first response is to put it on the credit card. If you have \nto go to an emergency room and you don't have health care insurance, if \nyou have an unexpected expenditure, the first thing you do is to put it \non the credit card. So many families were stuck with a huge credit card \nbill.\n  Somebody walks in and literally sells them a bill of goods by saying: \nYou have 18 percent interest rates. I can put you in a mortgage for 2 \nyears at 9 percent. Of course, it goes up a little later. The little \nlater was not dwelled upon. So for many families, this was not an \nirresponsible, irrational act.\n\n[[Page S1397]]\n\nThey were buying time, in other words. They were hoping this would be a \nbridge to a better future, that they would get a raise at the job so \nthey wouldn't have to depend on their credit cards and, when the reset \ncame up, they would be able to refinance. Little did they know that \nmany of these subprime mortgages were constructed so there was a \nprepayment penalty exactly at the time the reset took place. So as you \ntried to get out of it, you discovered you would be paying a huge \npenalty.\n  The point I wish to make is we have families who now, for the last \nalmost decade, have been struggling. They have exhausted all their \noptions. The last option was their home. Now that option seems to be \nevaporating in terms of financial strain and support. What we have to \ndo is respond. I believe that is the nature of Government, to respond \nto the genuine concerns, the genuine expectations of the people we \nserve. I defy anyone in this Chamber to go back to their States and \ntalk not just to low-income families but to every family and say: \nShouldn't we be doing something dramatic, challenging, visionary, and \ndoing it immediately with respect to housing? The answer would be an \noverwhelming yes. We should listen to the people of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to follow on the comments offered \nby Senator Reed of Rhode Island. This issue of the subprime mortgage \nscandal is a big one. It is affecting not just people who are losing \ntheir homes this week or next month; it is affecting all home values \neverywhere. We had this unbelievable bubble exist with respect to home \nvalues, but the collapse has been precipitous and has hurt a lot of \npeople. It is a circumstance where people have discovered the mortgage \ninterest rate they had not understood fully has been reset, they now \nhave mortgage payments they can't possibly make, and they are \ndiscovering their home is gone. There is foreclosure on the mortgage.\n  I wished to talk a little about what has caused all of this. This has \nbeen a trail of greed. When you look at the wreckage of this scandal, \nyou see two trails--a trail of greed and a trail of tears. A trail of \ngreed by some mortgage brokers, not all, some mortgage banks, not all, \na good many hedge funds, not all, and speculators. They were all making \na lot of money. This was great while the party continued. Then all of a \nsudden it was discovered that none of this made much sense.\n  Let me describe what was happening and why it didn't make sense. Zoom \nCredit. You get up in the morning, brush your teeth and shave and you \nhave a television set there and watch television in the morning and see \nthe advertisements. Here is one, a company called Zoom Credit:\n\n       Credit approval is just seconds away. Get on the fast track \n     at Zoom Credit.\n\n  At the speed of light, they will approve you for a car loan, a home \nloan, and a credit card. Even if your credit is in the tank, Zoom \nCredit is like money in the bank. It doesn't matter if you are not \ncreditworthy. Come to us, we want to give you a loan.\n  Millenia Mortgage Corporation:\n\n       Twelve months, no mortgage payment. That's right. We will \n     give you the money to make your first 12 months. And if you \n     call in the next 7 days, we pay it for you. Our loan program \n     may reduce your current monthly payment by as much as 50 \n     percent and allow you no payments for the first 12 months.\n\n  What they are not saying is that is all reset at the back end of the \nloan, which means the homeowner will pay a lot more for that mortgage.\n  Countrywide is the biggest mortgage company. By the way, Mr. Mozilo, \nman of the year, was honored by everybody, made a lot of money, made a \nbig old mortgage company bigger. Here is what they say:\n\n       Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \n     mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? \n     Then call us.\n\n  That is the kind of business they are soliciting.\n  Mr. Mozilo did real well, $142 million or so for himself. They all \ndid well. Here is what they did. They put these mortgages out and in \nsome cases they cold called people on the phone. People were in an \nexisting home with an existing mortgage. They said: What are you paying \nfor your mortgage payment? We have a new instrument we wanted to put \nyou in at a 2-percent interest rate. Don't tell them there is an escrow \npayment, just tell them what the 2 percent payment will be. And don't \ntell them that 2 percent is going to reset, or quintuple in a couple \nyears and they will not be able to pay it. We want to put you in a new \nmortgage.\n  So a whole lot of unsuspecting folks went into these new mortgages. \nIt all seemed too good to be true, and it was. But in the meantime, \neverybody was making money. There is the old story about in the old \ndays when they were making sausage, they would take meat and sawdust \nand pack them together in the sausage, packing sawdust into sausage. \nThat is what they did. They put out these subprime loans and the \nsubprime loans were kind of attractive because, even as they were \nputting people into these new instruments, the brokers were making a \nfortune. I read that if they could make a $1 million jumbo subprime, \nthey could get as much as a $25,000 payment up front for the broker. \nThat is the broker's fee. So then the mortgage company now has a \nmortgage that is going to reset at a very high interest rate, and so \nthen they package this up. They slice it and dice it with other \nmortgages. They package it up similar to sausage. And when they cut it \nup, they call it securitizing it and they start selling it. They can \nportray a much higher yield for this piece of sausage because they have \nthese subprime mortgages in there, but nobody knows exactly how much is \nsubprime and how much is real.\n  Then they sell it to the hedge funds. The hedge fund thinks this is \ngreat. They are not making hundreds of millions of dollars. The top \nguys are making more than $1 billion in a year. They say: What we want \nto do is buy some of these securitized instruments. So they do.\n  So the broker makes a lot of money. The mortgage company makes a lot \nof money. The hedge fund makes a lot of money. There are some people \nwho are buying homes as flippers. They and the brokers were in cahoots. \nThey also were greedy. The notion was, buy this home, get a 2-percent \nmortgage, you can flip it in 2 years because that housing bubble is \ngoing up. You will do nothing but make money. Then you had speculators, \nhedge funds, mortgage banks, and brokers.\n  All of a sudden the whole thing wrecked, collapsed. Why? Because it \nnever made any sense. It was a house of cards. You can't be putting a \nlot of mortgages out there to people who can't afford them, people who \ncan't abide by the terms.\n  I have described three companies, including the largest company, that \nsaid: You have bad credit? Come to us.\n  I have also, in the Commerce Committee at a hearing, heard testimony \nabout how the brokers' pitch went to borrowers out there who were in a \nhome with a good mortgage, and they persuaded them, I think through \nterms that were never fully disclosed to the homeowner, to get a new \nmortgage, a new subprime mortgage. Then when it resets all of a sudden, \nthis family is done. They can't possibly afford to stay in that home.\n  Here is what the carnage is. This is FedEx Stadium. This is the \nlargest football stadium in the NFL. It holds about 90,000 people, \nslightly more. Last month in January, we had foreclosures in this \ncountry in 1 month that meant about 20,000 more than are seated in this \nstadium are out of a home, in 1 month. In the next 2 years, it is \nestimated there will be 60 of these stadiums full of people who will \nhave lost their home. Think of that.\n  Now, there is a new credo here in this Chamber, apparently, this \nweek. It is not even new, I guess. It is well practiced. It is by the \nminority: Don't just do something, sit there.\n  This is an urgent problem, and all week long we have seen the \nminority decide, in two clotures motions, they would insist on 30 hours \npostcloture.\n\n[[Page S1398]]\n\nWhat did that mean? That meant that starting Tuesday, midday, when I \nwas on the floor with the Indian Health Care Improvement Act--the last \nthing we did this week was to pass the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct on Tuesday--and then the minority insisted on two 30-hour periods, \ntaking us to Friday, so that nothing could get done to try to address \nthis housing issue, to try to address a very serious issue.\n  By the way, this is not just affecting the people I have described. \nIt is not just affecting the people who would sit in that stadium--\n120,000 people who are out of a home as of January. It affects every \nother home and every other homeowner. The folks around that home--in \nthe neighborhood, in the community--their home values are impacted by \nhomes that are now vacant whose upkeep is not guaranteed. There are a \nwhole lot of folks who are affected by this, and this country's economy \nis affected by it in a very dramatic way.\n  I know the President yesterday said he was surprised when a reporter \ntalked about projections of $4-a-gallon gasoline. A reporter said: Mr. \nPresident, there are projections of $3.50 or $4-a-gallon gasoline. What \ndo you think about that? The President said: Well, I have not heard of \nthose.\n  We have a lot of problems in this country. Gasoline and oil prices \nare one; the subprime mortgage scandal another; unbelievable \nspeculation, for example, in the energy markets. Let me describe, for a \nmoment, that issue.\n  We are doing two things right now that are unbelievably inept and \nhurt every American. One, the Department of Energy--at a time when oil \nis $102 a barrel, and the price of gasoline is bouncing up, and there \nare some people thinking about getting a loan to fill their car with \ngas--the Department of Energy is sticking oil underground. We have a \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. It is 97 percent full.\n  The Department of Energy is taking oil coming off the Gulf of \nMexico--royalty-in-kind payments to the Federal Government--and instead \nof putting that oil in the supply to put downward pressure on oil and \ngas, 50,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil a day right now are going \nunderground into our domes to be saved. That is unbelievably inept, in \nmy judgment. Why on Earth, when oil is $100 a barrel, would you take \noil that belongs to the American people and put it underground? And \nthey are going to go from 50,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil a day to \n125,000 barrels of oil per day in the second half of this year.\n  I have a piece of legislation to try to shut this down. I am going to \ndo everything I can to stop it. Oil that is coming into the Federal \nGovernment ought to be in the supply pipeline to put downward pressure \non oil and gas. It is that simple. I do not understand why the American \nconsumer is being burned at the stake here with gas prices and the \nDepartment of Energy is carrying the wood. What are they thinking \nabout?\n  Now, there is another thing that is happening that, in my judgment, \nneeds a full investigation by this Government. Oil is $100 a barrel, \ngas is $3, $3.50 a gallon, going, perhaps, to $4 a gallon. Who knows? \nWe have had testimony before the Senate Energy Committee by experts who \nsay there is not one bit of justification for oil being more than $55 \nor $60 a barrel. The supply/demand fundamentals in no way justify \ncurrent prices of oil.\n  Here is what is happening. Hedge funds are neck deep in the futures \nmarket for oil, speculating on oil futures. Investment banks are neck \ndeep in the oil futures market. In fact, for the first time, some \ninvestment banks are actually buying oil storage.\n  Now, why would an investment bank want oil storage? Buy oil, take it \noff the market and store it because when prices increase you sell it \nand you make money. There is a carnival of greed, in my judgement, in \nthe oil futures. This is an unbelievable amount of speculation. Nobody \nis paying much attention to it. It is not very sexy. I know of very \nlittle reporting on it, even.\n  But you have two things happening to the American consumers in this \narea of gas prices and the cost of energy that are just unbelievable. \nOne is, we are sticking oil underground when we should not be, to take \noil out of the supply. That is the Federal Government doing that. No. \n2, we have unregulated hedge funds--and most hedge fund activity, as \nyou know, is not subject to regulation--and an unbelievable amount of \nspeculation by hedge funds, investment banks, and others in oil futures \nhas driven this price well beyond the justification of the price of \noil, given the supply-and-demand relationship. That is something we \nhave to deal with. That comes on top of and at the same time we see the \nwreckage that comes from this housing scandal--the subprime loan \nscandal.\n  As I said before, some are content to sit around here and thumb their \nsuspenders and act important and look important and wear their blue \nsuits but do nothing. Is that why one gets elected? Is that why one \naspires to public service: to do nothing in a time of urgency?\n  I think this economy faces great peril for a lot of reasons. We have \na trade deficit that is the highest in history. Two billion dollars a \nday we import more than we export. We have a budget deficit that is way \nout of control, way off track.\n  The President says: Well, my budget deficit that I propose is $425 \nbillion for this coming year. No, it is not. He has asked to borrow \n$700 billion for this coming year--$700 billion. Now, you put that $700 \nbillion with a $700 billion trade deficit and you are talking about \nborrowing, in 1 year, almost $1.4 trillion--10 percent of the value of \nour economy.\n  It is unbelievable to me. This country is off track and we have to \nfix it. One portion of it is energy. One portion is trade policy. One \nportion is fiscal policy. Today I was talking about a subprime loan \nscandal that is affecting housing, and housing is an engine in this \ncountry. Housing is a very important economic engine.\n  That is why we want to pass a stimulus package dealing with housing \nto try to at least catch and at least deal with--in a responsible, \nappropriate way; not rewarding speculators, but trying to help \nhomeowners--we want to do that in a way that will begin to shore up and \nprovide some foundation to an economy that is in trouble.\n  Mr. President, I have said what I have come to say. I think there is \na lot to do. It is very important for the Senate to take action. I hope \nnext week will be a better week than this week. We do not need delays. \nWe do not need stalling. What we need is action. We need bipartisan \naction working on pieces of legislation that will improve this \ncountry's economy and reach out to those folks in the trail of tears, \nin the wreckage of the subprime loan scandal, to say to them: We want \nto see if we can find a way to help you keep your home. Home ownership \nis a very important part of American life. The housing industry itself \nis a very important engine of opportunity for this county's economy. My \nhope is we can do something important in the next week that will \naddress both of these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand I have up to a half hour to \nspeak at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator can speak as long as he \nwishes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I spoke about the work we have done, and the \nchallenges we still face, with regard to energy policy. I return to the \nfloor today to complete my remarks.\n  I concluded yesterday by putting a pricetag on our dependence on \nimported oil. Experts estimate that foreign oil will cost us $400 \nbillion just this year. This expense will impact our economy in a \nnumber of ways, including our trade balance. In December 2007, imported \ncrude oil accounted for 61 percent of the national trade deficit, or an \nall-time high of $36 billion. The trade deficit, propelled by high oil \nprices, has factored into the decline of the dollar.\n  Yesterday, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke testified that the cost of \nenergy is being passed through and reflected in the increase in prices \nof core consumer goods and services. Other experts believe that \nincreasing energy prices and lower economic growth could lead to a \nreturn of ``stagflation.''\n  Our dependence on foreign oil also has a negative impact on job \ncreation in America. The National Defense\n\n[[Page S1399]]\n\nCouncil Foundation concluded that imported oil deprives the U.S. \neconomy of more than 2.2 million jobs per year. Choosing to import oil \nto meet our energy needs exports more than our money--it also exports \njobs. Choosing to produce energy here at home would keep those jobs \nwithin our borders, and help countless Americans earn a good living.\n  The National Defense Council Foundation also identified several more \n``hidden costs'' of oil imports, including oil-related defense \nexpenditures, lost economic activity, reduced domestic investment, lost \nGovernment revenues, and the cost of periodic supply disruptions. \nTogether, these total $825 billion per year, nearly four times the \namount that America spent directly on acquisition of foreign oil in \n2005.\n  The money we export for oil flows directly into the economies of \nforeign nations around the world. Oil-producing nations spend these \nrevenues on national defense, education, health care, social programs, \ninfrastructure, financial instruments, and to bolster their own energy \nsecurity. As these nations use American dollars to pay for investments \nin their own futures, we are forced to spend money we do not have, and \nforgo our own priorities.\n  The fact that many of the major oil-exporting nations are \nundemocratic only makes matters worse. We import much of our oil from \nCanada and Mexico. Unfortunately, beyond North America, most of our oil \ncomes from countries such as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Iraq, \nand Algeria. Worldwide, the top oil exporting nations also include \nRussia and Iran.\n  Many regimes in oil-rich nations are unstable and unfriendly. Anti-\nAmericanism is prevalent throughout the Middle East. The same Saudi \nlands that are used to produce 10 million barrels of oil per day also \nprovide a staging ground for the advancement of radical Islam. While \nthe State Department has listed Iran as a sponsor of terrorism since \n1984, oil revenues allow that regime to weather heightened sanctions.\n  Our reliance on foreign oil continues at our own peril. We pay huge \nsums for oil, but even this premium cannot guarantee the availability \nof supplies. A recent study identified 24 significant oil supply \ndisruptions between 1950 and 2003. These lasted an average of 6 months, \nand reduced the world's supply of oil by up to 12 percent. Recent \nevents around the world reveal that our supply of oil is still \nincredibly vulnerable to disruption.\n  In Nigeria, conflict over oil wealth reduced that nation's daily \noutput by 25 percent last year. Dozens of workers have been kidnapped \nthere, nearly leading Shell to suspend all of its operations in the \nNiger Delta region. In Iraq, more than 460 attacks on oil pipelines, \nfacilities, and personnel have occurred in the past 4 years.\n  Not all supply disruptions will be caused by natural events or \nmanmade strife, because much of the world's oil is controlled by \nirrational, often unpredictable leaders. Venezuelan President Hugo \nChavez recently threatened to stop sending his country's oil to America \nbecause of a British court ruling. The simple truth is this: in a world \nwithout spare production capacity, every major production loss, no \nmatter where it occurs, can boost oil prices--and even short-term \nincreases heighten the long-term costs to our Nation.\n  Many foreign leaders are using oil as a diplomatic weapon, and \nestablishing diplomatic ties with growing energy consumers. Such \nrelationships legitimize the regimes in power and allow them to secure \nregional influence. We have seen the Putin regime use its vast \nresources as leverage throughout Eastern Europe. But perhaps the best \nexample of this type of petro-influence can be seen in Venezuela. The \nChavez regime peddled influence by distributing nearly $5 million in \nfinancial assistance per day last year to nations throughout Latin \nAmerica. Venezuela also used revenue from its oil sales to subsidize \nbus tickets for Londoners and home heating oil for Americans.\n  Nearly all of us, and nearly all of our constituents, can agree that \nAmerica's dependence on foreign oil must end. Before I discuss some \nsolutions to the problems I have outlined, I will provide historical \ncontext for them.\n  Attempting to bolster America's energy security is not new to \nWashington. In 1973, my first year in Congress, President Nixon gave a \nmajor address on energy. He proposed a very aggressive initiative, \ncalled `Project Independence', stating:\n\n       Let us set as our national goal, in the spirit of Apollo \n     with the determination of the Manhattan Project, that by the \n     end of this decade we will have developed the potential to \n     meet our own energy needs without depending on any foreign \n     energy sources.\n\n  At the time of that speech, net imports accounted for approximately \n28 percent of U.S. crude oil demand. Thirty-five years later, imports \naccount for more than 60 percent. Imports have grown because the gap \nbetween domestic supply and demand has been allowed to widen--\nconsumption has steadily increased over the years, while production \ndwindled.\n  In 2005, the United States consumed 21 million barrels of crude oil \nper day, but that same year, domestic production hit a 50-year low. The \nresult established a record for oil imports--13.7 million barrels per \nday--but not a ceiling on them. According to the EIA, oil usage will \nrise 30 percent by 2030, even as alternative sources of energy account \nfor a much greater percentage of our energy supply.\n  These estimates show that, while our goals have been admirable and \nambitious, we are heading in the wrong direction. As consumption rises, \nand domestic production falls, oil imports continue to increase and our \nhand is weakened diplomatically, militarily, and economically. As we \ndebate catch phrases like ``energy independence,'' ``energy security,'' \nand ``energy freedom''--we miss the point. And that is, we must \nimmediately adopt policies to reverse the course we have been on since \nbefore 1973, and the course that our best experts estimate will \ncontinue beyond 2030.\n  Part of the problem is created by the talking points originating in \nWashington. Although the goal of ``Project Independence'' was never \nmet, the same rhetoric is still used to define the challenges we face. \nInvoking the Apollo missions and the Manhattan Project ignores the hard \ntruth that an effective long-term energy policy will not be a race to \nthe finish line. As President Nixon asserted, we will need the spirit \nand determination of past endeavors. We will need our brightest minds \nand best science. But this time, we do not seek a one-time goal--to \nland the first man on the Moon, or to develop the first atom bomb. \nInstead, we seek a fundamental shift in how our Nation powers its \neconomy. The widening delta between domestic production and consumption \nwill continue to swell unless we change course.\n  Throughout this debate, we must be straight about these challenges. \nWe must be honest with the American people and honest with ourselves. \nGiven our growing energy needs, and our reliance on foreign oil, we \nshould not promise energy independence within a term of office. In the \nabsence of scientific breakthroughs, the strengthening of our energy \nsecurity that we seek will take substantial time and effort to achieve. \nBut we can begin to move in that direction today.\n  There are no easy solutions or quick fixes to our energy challenges. \nAs we debate these issues, we should not propose to overhaul the \ntraditional energy industries without also addressing the likely \nimpacts that such actions will have. And we should not seek to \ntransition away from traditional sources of energy until new \ntechnologies are affordable, available, and acceptable to the public.\n  Those of us in Congress share a common goal--to reduce our dependence \non foreign oil--but there are deep divisions over how to achieve it. As \na result, the Congressional Record is filled with legislation that \nundermines our ability to move toward this goal. These measures were \ndrafted with good intentions. However, good intentions are not enough, \nespecially when they are not matched with the wisdom and experience \nnecessary to achieve these goals we seek. This Congress is in danger of \nfailing in this regard.\n  Last year, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill in the \nplace of several individual bills. As time dwindled, attention was \ndiverted away from damaging provisions that were inserted in that bill \nand passed with little notice and no debate. Among these provisions was \na moratorium on oil shale regulations, which could delay the \ncommercialization of one of America's\n\n[[Page S1400]]\n\nmost promising resources. Our Nation holds 62 percent of the world's \noil shale deposits. This equals nearly five times the proven \nconventional oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. Just imagine the \npossibilities if we unleash American ingenuity to access these \nresources.\n  Another provision in that bill imposed new fees for domestic oil and \ngas permits, which will increase the cost of business and ultimately \nheighten the cost of energy for American consumers. As we have seen our \ndomestic production level off over the past several years, it is \nirresponsible to adopt policies that accelerate this trend. Yesterday, \nthe House Democrats chose the unwise path of raising taxes on our \ndomestic energy producers by $18 billion. Additionally, some in the \nmajority seek to make it more difficult for our military to purchase \nunconventional fuels from our allies in Canada. On top of that, some in \nthe majority still seek to undo lease agreements that American \ncompanies have to produce energy in the Gulf of Mexico. This makes no \nsense.\n  These backward policies prevent us from building on the success of \nrecent energy bills. Legislative efforts to open a small section of the \nArctic Coastal Plain have now been thwarted for over 25 years. Much of \nour Outer Continental Shelf also remains closed for energy leasing. \nCombined, these areas contain more than 100 billion barrels of oil and \n450 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n  Using old fears about energy production, and ignoring new concerns \nabout energy prices, policymakers are locking up our energy potential. \nIt is clear that this approach has failed, and that we need to find a \nnew way to reach smart consensus on energy policy.\n  For too long, the debate on energy has been dominated by extreme \nideologies. Discourse has deviated into an ``either/or'' approach, \nwhere participants are accused of being beholden to either ``big oil'' \nor ``environmental extremism.'' In an almost equally divided Senate, \nand at a time when party control is split between the legislative and \nexecutive branches, there is no better time to bridge this divide.\n  We must take action on an aggressive agenda of both new and old \nenergy ideas. Some of these proposals have been labeled as Republican \nideas, and others have been labeled as Democratic ideas. We must \nrecognize that reasonable policies to reduce our dependence on foreign \noil are American ideas, not partisan agendas. We must affirm that these \npolicies are worth pursuing, because additional steps can and should be \ntaken to reduce the amount of energy this nation imports.\n  A strong energy policy will rely upon three types of initiatives: \nthose that increase the responsible production of domestic energy; \nthose that accelerate the research, development, and deployment of \nrenewable and alternative sources of energy; and those that \nsignificantly enhance our Nation's ability to conserve energy. There is \nbroad agreement that two of these three areas are critical to America's \nenergy security. I see them outlined in the measures introduced in \nCongress, and they are built upon in the energy proposals of those \nrunning for President.\n   In modern politics, most people would be satisfied with two out of \nthree. But when we miss a critical piece of the puzzle--the one that \nmatters most in the near-term, and would have the greatest immediate \nimpact--then we can safely say, as I do now, that our efforts will fall \nshort of the goal.\n   I speak, of course, of the continuing disagreements over domestic \nproduction. We must, without delay, produce more energy at home. \nAmerican energy, produced by our workers, must be used to power our \nhomes, businesses, and vehicles.\n   Increasing domestic production will not be a stand-alone solution. \nBut with proven reserves of more than 21 billion barrels of oil, and \nundiscovered reserves of more than 100 billion barrels, it is simply \nunacceptable that America fail to meet a greater share of our own needs \nwith domestic energy resources.\n   The good news is that we have the resources, the technology, and the \nsupport of most Americans. The bad news is that so far we have been \nunable to muster the political will--we cannot even build consensus to \ninventory these areas and gain an accurate assessment of our Nation's \nenergy reserves. To have a fair and informed debate, we must know the \nextent of our resources. And then we must tap them with the ingenuity, \nskill, and technology at our disposal.\n   We must listen to the people of Alaska and open the Arctic Coastal \nPlain to responsible leasing for the exploration and production of oil \nand natural gas. ANWR is an emotional subject for many folks, so let's \nstick to the facts. First, to the critics who say that oil from ANWR \nwill take 10 years to come on-line--you are probably right. But to use \nthis as an argument against development is like refusing to save for \nyour retirement because you are not retiring next year. It will take \ntime and patience to develop the resources of Alaska's North Slope. \nFrom experience, we know that starting this process a decade ago would \nhave ensured greater domestic oil production when we needed it most.\n   In 1995, Congress did pass legislation to open a small portion of \nthe Coastal Plain to oil and gas leasing. But President Clinton vetoed \nthe legislation, and more than a decade later, an estimated 10.4 \nbillion barrels of oil continue to sit under our own soil. The week of \nthat veto, the average price of crude oil was $19 per barrel. This \nweek, the price has risen to about $102 per barrel. I would say that \nconditions have changed enough to warrant a fresh debate on this topic.\n   Congress must also open more of the Outer Continental Shelf, as we \ndid in the Gulf of Mexico in 2006. Last year, an amendment that would \nhave allowed leasing off the coast of Virginia was defeated on a near \nparty-line vote. That vote was a step in the wrong direction. Offshore \nAmerica holds tremendous energy potential, and it is essential that the \nAmerican energy industry have greater access to explore and produce in \nthis area.\n   Continuing to restrict the OCS will sacrifice billions of dollars \nthat could be used to develop our Nation's future energy supplies. \nOpening it would augment our supply of traditional fuels--and dollars \nthat now go overseas to acquire oil could remain within our own economy \nand could be used to develop alternative sources of energy. The \nconventional fuels of the 20th century can be used to pioneer those of \nthe 21st century, but we must first find the courage to put ourselves \non such a forward-looking and pragmatic path.\n   Equally important to increased domestic production will be measures \nto expedite the on-shore permitting process. A good example of why is \nAlaska's natural gas pipeline. Permitting and activities related to \npermitting that project may add more than 5 years to its timeline. This \nis just one example, but it is representative of an increasingly \nburdensome process. Permitting must be streamlined, not only to prevent \nenergy producers from investing abroad, but also for the sake of \ngrowing our energy production.\n   As I have indicated, our Nation has a great quantity of oil locked \nup off of our coasts, beneath our permafrost, and within our shale. \nThese areas can provide a stable supply of energy as we transition to \nalternative fuels. But oil is not the only resource that can be \ndeveloped at home and depended upon to meet our energy needs. We are \nalso fortunate to have vast reserves of coal: some 270 billion \nrecoverable tons, which would last for 240 years at the current rate of \nconsumption. That coal can be turned into fuels that help meet our \ntransportation, manufacturing, and electric power needs.\n   Because of the emissions that result when coal is converted to \nenergy, we will need cleaner methods to ensure the protection of our \nenvironment. To me, this is an opportunity. Our Nation has a proud \nheritage of innovation, and there is no reason to believe this strong \nrecord will not continue in the future. As our most abundant and \naffordable fossil resource, we cannot simply cross coal off the list. \nAny serious effort to strengthen our energy security must include coal.\n   One of our best prospects is to advance the development of coal-to-\nliquid fuels. As an alternative to oil, coal-to-liquid fuels have many \nmerits: it will reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, \nparticulate matter, and other pollutants when compared to conventional \nfuels. Coal-to-liquid fuels have been commercially demonstrated in \nother countries, can be moved through existing pipelines, and can be\n\n[[Page S1401]]\n\nused in existing vehicles. Commercialization of this resource will \ncreate investment in rural communities, thousands of good-paying jobs, \nand cheaper energy for American consumers. Despite this potential, two \namendments to advance this type of fuel were defeated on party-line \nvotes in the most recent energy debate.\n   Future generations of automobiles will be powered by the advanced \nbattery. The Government must redouble its efforts to ensure the \nresearch, development, and deployment of these technologies. Reliable \nand rechargeable batteries will be critical to the success of hybrid \nvehicles, which hold tremendous promise for reducing the amount of oil \nconsumed in the transportation sector.\n   The policies I speak of are just a few of the options available to \nus. We should also increase the number of flex-fuel vehicles on the \nroad, and the number of stations that offer blended fuels. We should \noffer incentives to existing refineries, and encourage the expedited \nconstruction of new ones, to reduce the amount of gasoline we import. \nWe continue to lament that while our refinery capacity has improved at \nexisting sites, we have not built a new refinery in 30 years. We must \nrethink our policies to match the modern challenge we face. Again, \nthese are just a sampling of the policy options available to the \nCongress as we seek to chart a more responsible path forward.\n   As a member of the Senate Energy Committee for nearly 30 years, and \nits chair or ranking member for much of the past decade, I obviously \nhave strong views on the energy policies that will best serve our \nNation. But I also recognize that we must work together to find common \nground. We did this in the past on energy policy, and we can do it \nagain.\n   The costs of our dependence on foreign oil are enormous and \nincreasing. The consequences of removing money from our economy, and \nsending it to often-volatile oil-producing nations, are becoming clear. \nFew positives will ever be drawn from this arrangement.\n   When we import oil, we export our jobs and we export our wealth. We \nstrengthen regimes that are intent on undermining our interests, \nopposed to the spread of democracy, and unwilling to extend some of the \nmost basic freedoms to their own people. When we import oil, we \nthreaten our national security and our economic strength. As we look \nahead, we must remember that for today and the foreseeable future, we \nneed oil. We should put our American energy resources to use.\n   This is my final year in the U.S. Senate. It is a privilege and an \nhonor to serve the people of New Mexico and this country. But it is not \njust the end of my time in the Senate that approaches; the time to \nreduce our growing dependence on foreign oil is also upon us.\n   It is my sincere hope that we will use this year and the future to \nwork together on policies that will move us toward our energy security \ngoals. This will require us to set aside our differences and make \ndifficult decisions. It will require us to come to the table with open \nminds and positive intentions. In an era defined by its bitter \npartisanship, this will not be easy. But given the stakes--our national \nsecurity, our economic strength, and our standing in the world--that is \nexactly what we must do.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about some very \npositive things that the Republicans in the Senate hope to do to help \nthose people who are caught in a real crisis. We have the HOME Act that \nmy colleague from New Mexico has discussed, and I want to discuss some \nspecific housing proposals that we believe will help people who are \ncaught in the tremendous crisis of the subprime meltdown and the \neconomic conditions it imposes on them.\n  Too many families in my State of Missouri and across the Nation, \nincluding in West Virginia, the State of the Presiding Officer, are \nfeeling the pain of the housing crisis, and they need our help now.\n  There are 57,000 people in Missouri who are delinquent on their \nmortgages, with 20 percent of Missouri subprime borrowers behind on \ntheir payments. These families, like many across America, can least \nafford higher housing costs as they are being hit with heating bills, \nhigher health care costs, and more pain at the gas pump.\n  I am proud to gather with my Republican colleagues to introduce the \nHome Ownership, Manufacturing and Economic Growth Act, or HOME Act, of \n2008.\n  The housing relief provisions of the Republican HOME Act will provide \nhelp for folks such as Willie Clay of Kansas City, MO, caught up in \nthis subprime mortgage mess. Willie is a former Vietnam war paratrooper \nwho lives mainly on Government disability checks. Willie was recently \nhighlighted in a Kansas City Star article entitled ``American Dreams \nBuilt on a Shaky Foundation of Subprime Loans.''\n  Willie Clay lives in the Kansas City neighborhood of Ruskin Heights, \na modest community of hard-working families and tidy ranch homes, a \nplace where folks of modest means can share in the American dream by \nowning their own home.\n  In 2004, Willie refinanced his mortgage for a total of $101,000. As \nyou can see from the size of the loan, Willie was not a rich man. He \nwas like so many other Americans--just looking for a little bit of \nmoney to pay off medical bills, his car loan, and some credit card \nbills.\n  Willie took out a subprime loan with an adjustable rate. It started \nout at a fixed 8.2 percent. He had no problem making his payments. But \nthen, last October, the fixed rate interest ended and the new \nadjustable rate reset at 11.2 percent. It is set to rise again in March \nto 12.2 percent, and even higher in the coming months.\n  Willie told the Kansas City Star:\n\n       If the rate goes up again, I can't afford it.\n\n  Willie and his wife Ina will have to give up their home and move to \nan apartment. Willie now admits that he never fully understood how an \nadjustable rate worked when he agreed to the new loan. ``I didn't have \nthe education to understand it,'' Willie said. ``And they didn't \nexplain it to me. I thought if the interest [rate] went down, the \npayment went down. If the interest rate went up, your payment stayed \nthe same.''\n  Willie was also trapped with a $2,500 prepayment penalty, committing \nhim to the loan for at least 3 years. Willie is not alone. His entire \nneighborhood is suffering through this crisis. There are more than 500 \nforeclosures in his ZIP Code alone. On Willie's block, there are \nalready several empty houses.\n  This is wreaking havoc on the neighborhood, its property values, even \nits basic fabric, as families struggle to make ends meet.\n  That is why I believe so strongly that we need to help folks such as \nWillie Clay and families across the Nation. The Kansas City Star \nsuggested that we require tougher disclosure requirements so that \nborrowers have no question about the terms of the deal. They believe \nhome buyers should encounter crystal clear disclosure forms, stating \nthe loan amount, interest rate, whether the rate will reset under \ncertain conditions, and any prepayment penalty.\n  We heard the needs of Willie Clay and thousands of families like his \nacross America. We heard the suggestions of the Kansas City Star and \nmany others with ideas on how to fix this mess, and we propose taking \naction. This institution must take action.\n  First, the Republican HOME Act will help families like Willie's \nsuffering now with $10 billion to refinance distressed subprime \nmortgages. Our proposal would authorize State housing finance agencies \nto issue $10 billion in tax-exempt bonds and use the proceeds to help \nhomeowners refinance subprime mortgages.\n  Second, in order to help families avoid foreclosure and help them \nkeep their homes, Republicans will expedite the delivery of $180 \nmillion approved by Congress in December to provide counseling and help \nfor families in distress. I was proud to cosponsor that in the \nappropriations bill with my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd.\n  As I announced earlier this week, the first block of these funds has \njust gone out, and we will ensure that remaining funds are delivered as \nquickly as possible.\n  Third, Republicans support helping neighborhoods like Willie's by \nproviding $15,000 tax credits to purchase over the next year a home in \nor approaching foreclosure. Senator Isakson of Georgia will talk more \nabout that.\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\nWe support the so-called net operating loss carryback provision to help \nfirms that suffered operating losses lower their tax burdens.\n  Last, Republicans support protecting families who are applying for \nnew loans. People deserve to know and understand what they are signing \nbefore they sign it. Anyone who ever bought a house and confronted the \nstack of small-type paperwork written in legalese knows what I mean. I \nused to be a lawyer, and I have been presented with those stacks of \ndocuments. They are so overwhelming that, unless you have a half day to \nspend, you are never going to read them. Even as a lawyer, I will tell \nyou they are not the easiest things to understand.\n  Our proposal will require a plain English explanation of key loan \nconditions. Borrowers will see in big type any teaser or introductory \nrate, their payment, and when it expires. They need to know they are \nagreeing to an adjustable rate and what that rate will be and how much \na new payment will be. I doubt that Willie Clay was ever told his \nmortgage rate could go up over 12 percent. That is unconscionable. I \ndon't think they ought to be allowed to raise adjustable rates beyond \nwhat they disclose in the initial disclosures to the borrowers. They \nneed to be notified of any prepayment penalty, and they will be \nreminded there is no guarantee they can refinance their loan before the \nintroductory rate expires. These are the very things Willie and \nthousands of borrowers did not understand when they agreed to their \nloans. Hopefully, this will protect future families who want to share \nin the American dream.\n\n  In contrast to the Democrats' plan, Republicans will avoid making \nhome ownership more expensive, especially for low-income families \nthrough harmful bankruptcy changes that increase the cost of borrowing \nor encourage costly litigation.\n  If my colleagues on the other side succeed in using bankruptcy to \nwrite down all the mortgages and essentially destroy the basic terms of \nthe contract, guess what will happen. What will happen is that nobody \nwill get a loan at a reasonable rate anymore. Any rates that are \noffered to homeowners will have to have a risk premium built in, \nprobably 1.5 percent or more. Each quarter of a percent will mean \n500,000 families cannot get a loan. So that would mean that if this \nproposal coming from the other side is implemented, some 6.5 million, \nat least, families will be denied the opportunity to get a home loan \nbecause of the risk built in by a congressionally mandated cram-down of \nthe interest rate terms, breaking the terms of the contracts which have \nbeen signed.\n  Republicans will also oppose plowing billions of dollars into big \nGovernment programs that do not help our neediest families now. We will \noppose adding more dollars to programs that are still flush with funds \nthey were given in December. We want a responsible, effective, and \nfiscally conservative package that can be adopted without wreaking \nhavoc on our economy, without destroying our budget, yet helping the \npeople who most need help.\n  Right now, we are threatened by the position of the majority leader \nof being shut out from offering any amendments. We want to move \nforward. We want to move forward on a responsible plan that allows the \nRepublicans to decide what amendments they will offer. We are not going \nto be told by the majority leader that he is the one who decides what \namendments we offer. Where has that ever worked in this Senate, telling \na block of Senators, minority Senators, 49 of us, that we cannot offer \nan amendment unless we get the approval of the majority leader? There \nis a body on the other side of the Capitol that may be able to do that, \nbut the strength of this body is we do not get crammed down on the \namendments we can offer.\n  I have talked with a number of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, and they agree that our proposals make sense. We just want to \nhave votes on the proposals we think are effective, fiscally \nconservative, and will not endanger the homeowners whom we seek to \nhelp.\n  If we can work together--and I believe there is plenty of opportunity \nfor a bipartisan compromise--on housing proposals we will help families \nlike Willie Clay's and neighborhoods such as Ruskin Heights in Kansas \nCity to get through this crisis. I urge my colleagues to support the \nhome proposals we will be offering when we are given an opportunity to \noffer those amendments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article to which I referred from the Kansas City Star.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Kansas City Star, Dec. 30, 2007]\n\n     American Dreams Built on a Shaky Foundation of Subprime Loans\n\n                             By Paul Wenske\n\n       Willie Clay remembers the day a loan broker showed up and \n     sold him on consolidating his debts by refinancing his south \n     Kansas City home.\n       The former Vietnam War paratrooper, who lives mainly on \n     government disability checks, jumped at the chance to pay off \n     medical, car and credit-card bills. That was in 2004.\n       Now he realizes it was ``a big mistake.'' In October, his \n     8.2 percent interest rate on the new $101,000 home loan shot \n     to 11.2 percent. It is set to rise to 12.2 percent in March--\n     and higher yet in subsequent months.\n       ``If the rate goes up again, I can't afford it,'' said \n     Clay, who lives in a tidy ranch home in Ruskin Heights with \n     his wife, Ina. ``We'll have to move to an apartment.''\n       Welcome to subprime hell, where interest rates are going \n     through the roof and the bottom is falling out of home \n     values.\n       The ZIP code in which Clay lives has had more than 500 \n     foreclosures--one of the highest rates in the city, according \n     to RealtyTrac, a national firm that tracks foreclosures. On \n     his block, many neighbors' homes are empty. Clay worries his \n     may be next.\n       Clay, who thought his adjustable rate could go down but \n     would never go up, is another victim of the subprime \n     implosion. He and millions of other low- to moderate-income \n     Americans bought or refinanced homes with creative terms that \n     began with lower ``teaser'' interest rates designed to rise \n     after several years.\n       At the time, it seemed like a good deal. Home values were \n     soaring. Lenders seemed to have barrels of money to lend--\n     even to borrowers with less-than-perfect credit--stoking the \n     American dream of homeownership and fueling the torrid \n     housing market from 2004 to 2006.\n       But housing prices cooled in late 2006, just as adjustable \n     rates started to creep upward. Now many loans are going bad \n     as families find they can't afford their monthly payments and \n     can't get refinanced by lenders who have tightened credit.\n       Foreclosures are at record highs, with Kansas City's \n     foreclosures up 80 percent just since last year.\n       Thousands of Americans could lose their homes when at least \n     2 million subprime-loan interest rates are set to rise again \n     this spring. President Bush recently announced a plan to \n     freeze the rates on as many as 1.2 million of those loans. \n     Some experts estimate the eventual cost to the economy will \n     be more than $223 billion.\n       For many, the help comes too late.\n       In metropolitan Kansas City, more than 34,290 adjustable-\n     rate loans are ready to reset, putting more homes at risk, \n     according to an analysis of mortgage data by the Center for \n     Responsible Lending.\n       ``What this foretells is foreclosures will get worse before \n     getting better,'' said Kelly Edmiston, a senior economist at \n     the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who has crunched the \n     numbers. ``We haven't really seen the peak yet.''\n\n\n                            what went wrong?\n\n       Blame is easy to spread around for the subprime mess, said \n     William M. Dana Jr., the president and CEO of Central Bank of \n     Kansas City and the immediate past chairman of the Missouri \n     Bankers Association.\n       Dana cited lax underwriting standards, borrowers who didn't \n     understand the terms of their loans, and regulators who \n     weren't paying enough attention.\n       Consumer advocates, however, said borrowers with little \n     experience in home buying got caught up in a frenzy, fed \n     mainly by nontraditional lending institutions and thinly \n     regulated brokers who were more intent on making fat \n     commissions than making quality loans. Big national banks \n     also dove into the market with subprime subsidiaries.\n       ``You had an army of salespeople who were hired to go door \n     to door and sell these things very aggressively,'' said \n     Michael Duffy, the managing attorney of Legal Aid of Western \n     Missouri, who noted that subprime loans are more complex than \n     conventional loans, yet borrowers often received less loan-\n     disclosure information.\n       Elma Warrick, the executive director of the Kansas City \n     Home Ownership Center for HomeFree-USA, said: ``People were \n     just happy to be told they could get a home. Quite frankly, \n     they didn't know what questions to ask.''\n       Clay acknowledged that he never fully understood how an \n     adjustable rate worked when a Wells Fargo Financial broker \n     sold him on the deal.\n       ``I didn't have the education to understand it,'' Clay \n     said. ``And they didn't explain it to me. I thought if the \n     interest went down, your\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\n     payment went down. If the interest rate went up, your payment \n     stayed the same.''\n       What's more, Clay's loan included thousands of dollars in \n     added charges and carried a $2,500 prepayment penalty, which \n     tied him to the debt for at least three years.\n       Steve Carlson, a spokesman for Wells Fargo Financial, a \n     division of Wells Fargo & Co., said that while he could not \n     comment specifically on Clay's case, the company does not \n     make home loans ``unless we believe the customer has the \n     ability to repay the loan.'' Carlson said the bank works with \n     customers to avoid foreclosure and find options ``based on \n     the customer's financial ability to repay the debt.''\n       Adjustable-rate loans aren't new, but they had been used \n     primarily by borrowers with good credit who didn't intend to \n     hold on to a house long, because they planned to sell it or \n     move.\n       In recent years, a new breed of lenders and brokers saw a \n     way to use the subprime market to keep home sales revved up.\n       Lenders targeted urban neighborhoods where new borrowers \n     were itching for the chance to buy. Because those \n     neighborhoods usually had lower average credit scores, often \n     reflecting riskier credit, lenders felt justified to charge \n     more. And they did.\n       Nearly 28 percent of the home-purchase loans made in \n     Jackson County from 2004 to 2006 were subprime, federal \n     mortgage records show. That compares with less than 10 \n     percent in more affluent Johnson County.\n       Teaser rates made the loans appear affordable. ``These \n     loans wouldn't have been made without the teaser rate,'' \n     Edmiston said.\n       From 2003 to 2004, adjustable-rate mortgages nearly \n     doubled--growing to more than 50 percent of all originations \n     in Kansas City, according to Federal Reserve data.\n       Loan offers became increasingly creative, offering no money \n     down or interest-only payments that began low, but \n     skyrocketed nearly 200 percent in a few years. TV ads induced \n     consumers to borrow against 125 percent of the value of their \n     home--a recipe for disaster for most cash-strapped borrowers.\n       Subprime sales even took off in middle-income tracts, \n     according to a study of Kansas City's 5th Congressional \n     District by Compliance Technologies, a Washington firm that \n     provides lending intelligence services to financial \n     institutions.\n       Critics say that raises questions about whether some \n     borrowers were steered to subprime loans when they might have \n     qualified for cheaper conventional loans.\n       While most mainstream banks in Kansas City resisted the \n     subprime stampede, newer lenders rushed in. More than 98 \n     percent of the loans that H Block's Option One Mortgage \n     Corp. made in Kansas City from 2004 to 2006 were subprime, \n     federal loan figures show. More than 97 percent of NovaStar \n     Mortgage's loans were subprime in that time.\n       In contrast, only a small percentage of loans sold by \n     established local banks were subprime. None of the nearly \n     1,000 metro loans that Kansas City mortgage banker James B. \n     Nutter & Co. made was subprime.\n       Ironically, Clay bought his Ruskin Heights home in 2000 \n     with a conventional 30-year loan from Nutter & Co. It was for \n     $76,000 with a fixed 6.5 percent interest rate.\n       Company president James Nutter Jr. questioned why Clay was \n     directed into a costlier subprime loan when he refinanced his \n     house in 2004. Nutter said that Clay--even with more debt--\n     probably would have qualified for a cheaper conventional loan \n     from his company or another local lender.\n       ``Especially with him being a veteran,'' Nutter said, \n     noting that some brokers appeared to steer lower-income \n     borrowers into subprime loans ``to make more money.''\n\n\n                         wall street connection\n\n       Soaring subprime profits quickly attracted Wall Street \n     investors.\n       As fast as brokers sold more teaser-rate loans, they \n     quickly bundled them into packages and sold them like \n     securities to investors, who pumped even more money into the \n     subprime market.\n       The Compliance Technologies study showed that more than \n     half of the subprime loans made in Kansas City's 5th District \n     were securitized and sold off to investors.\n       ``Originators were making loans based on quantity rather \n     than quality,'' said Kurt Eggert, a law professor at Chapman \n     University in Orange, Calif., who served on the Federal \n     Reserve's consumer advisory counsel. ``They made loans even \n     when they didn't make sense from an underwriting \n     standpoint.''\n       Mark Duda, a research affiliate at Harvard University's \n     Joint Center for Housing Studies, said that because brokers \n     were so intent to quickly sell off loans to investors, they \n     had little incentive to make sure the loans were suitable for \n     borrowers.\n       ``They were setting people up to fail,'' Duda said.\n       By sheer numbers, more whites got subprime loans--but as a \n     percentage, blacks were more likely to be steered into \n     subprime loans and usually paid more for them.\n       An analysis by The Kansas City Starof home-purchase loans \n     from 2004 to 2006 in the metro area showed that blacks were \n     placed in subprime loans nearly 50 percent of the time and \n     Hispanics about 32 percent of the time. Whites, however, got \n     subprime loans only 16 percent of the time.\n       These findings are supported by Compliance Technologies' \n     analysis. Examining a larger pool of both home-purchase and \n     refinance loans in the 5th District, the firm found that last \n     year blacks were placed in subprime home-purchase or \n     refinance loans nearly 66 percent of the time.\n       That compared with 41 percent for Hispanics and 29 percent \n     for whites.\n       Blacks also were consistently charged an interest rate that \n     was at least a half a percentage point higher, said Maurice \n     Jourdain-Earl, the managing director of Compliance \n     Technologies--meaning, ``all things being equal, their \n     monthly mortgage payments are going to be higher.''\n       U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat who represents the \n     5th District, contends that brokers knew some minorities were \n     less sophisticated about buying homes.\n       ``This was designed to ensnare Latinos and African-\n     Americans,'' said Cleaver, a member of the House Financial \n     Services Committee. ``These brokers get their money on the \n     front end. So they don't care. They're gone.''\n\n\n                           subprime implosion\n\n       As adjustable interest rates climbed, many subprime \n     borrowers could not make their payments. In some cases, \n     homeowners and real-estate investors also had tapped all the \n     equity from their homes. As prices fell, they owed more than \n     their homes were worth.\n       When the new homeowners couldn't sell or refinance their \n     homes, they often walked away from them. As the inventory of \n     unsold houses grew, prices plummeted even more.\n       In 2004 and 2005, homes nationally were appreciating, on \n     average, more than 12 percent a year, according to Federal \n     Reserve data. By 2007, they were losing about 1.5 percent in \n     value each year. Kansas City homes went from appreciating an \n     average of 4.5 percent a year to dipping nearly 1 percent in \n     value.\n       Wall Street investors now are left holding worthless real-\n     estate securities. Subprime lenders are stuck with billions \n     of dollars in bad loans, which they have had to write off. \n     Many are going broke.\n       ``It's like any Ponzi scheme,'' said Duffy of Legal Aid. \n     ``Artificially high values drive more investments, that drive \n     more artificially high values, that drive more investments, \n     until the values get unrealistically high and the whole \n     scheme collapses. That's what you see now.''\n       Ruben Flores, a Johnson County real-estate investor, worked \n     as a loan officer in NovaStar's loss-mitigation office in May \n     when things started collapsing.\n       ``It was like triage,'' he recalled.\n       Flores said that loan officers--each handling portfolios of \n     200 or more borrowers--worked 70 to 80 hours a week trying to \n     salvage as many souring loans as possible.\n       But the losses have left once-high-flying NovaStar \n     struggling to stay out of bankruptcy. Option One has \n     shuttered its business and plans to write off $125 million in \n     bad loans. Wells Fargo and other big national banks have cut \n     back or stopped making new subprime loans.\n       Meanwhile, Congress is grappling with ways to help \n     homeowners clean up the mess and make sure it doesn't happen \n     again--including tougher regulations and penalties.\n       The good news is that tighter underwriting standards are \n     being restored. The bad news is that foreclosures probably \n     will continue to haunt neighborhoods such as Clay's for at \n     least another year.\n       Foreclosures, however, ripple throughout communities, \n     lowering home values, decreasing tax revenues, and inviting \n     blight and crime. So even if you didn't have a subprime loan, \n     you probably will feel their pain in 2008.\n       ``Subprime problems have become everyone's problem,'' said \n     Martin Eakes, the chief executive officer of the Center for \n     Responsible Lending.\n       A look at where subprime loans and foreclosures are most \n     prevalent in the KC metro area.\n\n\n                        WHAT'S A SUBPRIME LOAN?\n\n       Subprime loans are generally defined as those given to \n     borrowers with weak or damaged credit. Lenders charge higher \n     interest rates because the loans are seen as riskier.\n\n\n                 METHODOLOGY FOR THE DATA ANALYSIS/MAPS\n\n       The home-loan data used for this analysis comes from the \n     Home Mortgage Disclosure Act database, which is compiled by \n     the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. The \n     data include millions of records from all home-loan \n     applications, but for the purposes of this study, much of the \n     information was not considered. The only records that were \n     analyzed were for loans in Kansas or Missouri that were used \n     to purchase a one- to four-family home, which means homes \n     that were not apartment buildings. Refinancing loans, home-\n     improvement loans and loans not secured by a first lien were \n     not considered. Only records from 2004 through 2006 were \n     analyzed because prior to 2004 the Federal Financial \n     Institution Examination Council did not have an indicator for \n     subprime loans. A subprime loan is any loan with an interest \n     rate 3 or more percentage points higher than the Federal \n     Treasury yield on securities, according to the Federal \n     Financial Institutions Examination Council. The home-mortgage \n     data were joined to the map based on census tract numbers and \n     state and county identifiers. The maps accompanying this \n     story were assembled using census tract shape files obtained \n     from the Missouri Spatial Data Information Service and the \n     Kansas Geospatial Community Commons.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1404]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, in listening to my friend from Missouri \nwho just spoke, I was surprised that this is all being debated now in \nthe context of the fact that yesterday our Republican colleagues \nstopped us from proceeding to the very measure everyone is now talking \nabout and wanting to make changes and improvements to. There are ideas \nmy friend from Missouri talked about that I think are worthy of \ndiscussion and debate. Some we may very well support.\n  The reality is that we are here today because colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle stopped us from even proceeding to have a debate. So \nit seems to me it is a little disingenuous to say we want to be doing \nall these measures--and we agree there is an incredible sense of \nurgency about what is happening now to families--yet, at the same time, \nrather than proceeding to the bill and offering amendments, such as an \namendment to remove a provision if there is concern on bankruptcy on \nwhich I happen to disagree--I think it is very difficult to explain to \npeople why their vacation home, which I hope to have some day in \nbeautiful northern Michigan, would be covered by bankruptcy provisions, \nbut my home, my primary residence where my children grew up, where I \nraised my family, would not be protected. So I do not understand that \ndifference. That is a debate worth having. If our colleagues had \nallowed us to go to the bill, we could have had that discussion, we \ncould have had that debate about whether that provision should be in \nthe bill.\n  I come to the floor today to urge colleagues--and Senator Reid has \nrenewed his motion to go to the bill--we cannot begin to deal with an \nissue which colleagues are saying on both sides of the aisle is \nincredibly important, which has a great sense of urgency to it, if we \nare not allowed to go to the bill.\n  This reminds me of time after time in the Senate where we as a \nmajority have brought forward urgent issues that affect American \nfamilies and American communities and asked that they be considered, \nthat we have an opportunity to debate and take action, and we have been \nblocked time and time again--in fact, a record 72 times now, which is \nmore than the 2-year average of any Senate 2-year session. We now have \n72 times that our Republican colleagues have blocked us from being able \nto proceed to do the American people's business on issues that are \nincredibly important.\n  I welcome colleagues to come to the floor next week, to support \nSenator Reid's motion to go to the debate, and to look at a variety of \nideas that need to be addressed on this critical issue.\n  We all know that for a majority of Americans--Mr. President, I know \nin West Virginia as in Michigan--when folks want to get into the middle \nclass, the first thing they do is go out and buy a home, to have that \nequity in a home, to be able to save equity in their home--no more \nrenting; they are going to buy a house. I know in Michigan that is step \n1 for people who are working very hard to get that home for their \nfamily, to be able to save for the future. That is the primary way that \npeople, in fact, in this country do save for their future: build up \nthat equity so they can use it to offset the cost of college for their \nchildren, to save for retirement, to use it in a medical emergency, \nwhich is happening way too often now in our country.\n  Equity in the home, knowing that you can invest and have your home, \nis a basic part of what we all call the American dream in this country, \nand that is in great jeopardy right now for too many families.\n  Mr. President, 87,000 people went into foreclosure in this last year \njust in Michigan, and we have one of the highest foreclosure rates in \nthe country right now. That has happened for a variety of reasons. We \ntalk a lot about the financial mortgage arrangements, ARMs--adjustable \nrate mortgages--that are coming due and interest rates going up. That \nis certainly part of it. We also have another piece that is very true \nin Michigan and my guess is around the country that relates to \npredatory lending practices.\n  I have a very large number of great Michiganians who are African \nAmerican or from other minority communities who could be in a prime-\nrate mortgage right now but were sold a subprime mortgage. They were \nput into a much more fragile situation with less accountability.\n  We know of situations where senior citizens have been followed home \nfrom church in Detroit, forming relationships with our seniors where \nthey have been talked into totally refinancing their home. They paid \nfor their house, had no mortgage payment, but were told that if they \nwanted to refinance, they could get that new furnace they needed, they \ncould fix the roof, or they could pay for those medical bills, and they \nwere placed in a situation through predatory practices that has now \njeopardized their ability to even have their home.\n  Then we have another factor which I believe is the largest factor \ngoing on right now, which is the underlying fundamentals in the economy \nand the fact that too many people are losing their jobs or seeing their \nincomes go down. Certainly, for us in Michigan, it is different than \nthese ARMs resetting. For us, it is about the fact that families are \nlosing their jobs. Families are going from a middle-income job of $25 \nan hour to $14 an hour and trying to figure out how they are going to \npay the bills and keep a roof over the heads of their family.\n  I happen to believe the best stimulus is a good-paying job, and that \nis something also of great urgency on which we need to be spending our \ntime. I am very proud of the fact that as we move forward in the next 2 \nweeks in the discussion of our values and priorities through the budget \nfor next year, they will be laser focused on jobs and what we can do to \nhelp people keep and get the American dream by working hard and having \na job and creating opportunities for themselves and their families.\n  We have in front of us the opportunity to do something immediately to \nhelp people. We have a bill that includes a number of provisions. Some \nof them the President talked about in his State of the Union Address. \nThat is a good idea; we incorporated it.\n  We are talking about adding to the number of preforeclosure \ncounseling offices. We have heard from lenders, we have heard from \nfamilies and communities that the most important thing is to help \npeople before they lose their house, before they are 90 days behind, \nwhen someone thinks they might be having a problem, or they know in 6 \nmonths they are going to be faced with this situation of their payments \ngoing up--start now and work with lenders.\n  We also know that most people--not most but many--do not answer the \nphone when the lender calls. They are worried about what is going to \nhappen and do not think they have any way out, so they just wait. By \nhelping people with counseling, we can stop a lot of this on the front \nend and help people refinance. For people trying to do that, it is \ntougher now because we have this complicated situation going on where \nthey go to a lender, they get their mortgage, and that loan is then \nsold, and they don't know who owns it. So who do you talk to when you \nare trying to figure out how to make some accommodation to refinance? \nSo, having counselors will help.\n\n  We put money in the budget this year because it was a priority for \nour majority, adding $200 million to help people on the front end, so \nthey could work their way out of this. That is very important. Also, we \nallow State housing agencies to issue $10 billion more in refinancing \nbonds so State and local communities can help refinance homes. That is \nincredibly important, and something that has been widely supported on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  We also have said that community development block grant money should \nbe able to be used to purchase and rehab foreclosed properties, again, \nto help communities. We have to stop this. We have to stop this where \nit is. I think we can help create some certainty in the markets by \nhelping families right now and creating also some confidence in the \nmarkets going forward. That can be done by using the CDBG dollars for \ncommunities to refinance and help families stay in their homes.\n  Also, in a balanced approach, we have addressed what is happening on \nthe\n\n[[Page S1405]]\n\nbusiness side for home builders. We agreed to include in our original \npackage in the Senate--with the help of our distinguished Presiding \nOfficer on the Finance Committee, one of our top leaders on the Finance \nCommittee--a tax issue, net operating loss, to allow home builders to \ngo back a couple of years to a better time and address some of their \nissues so there is not the pressure to sell their inventory, the unsold \nhomes at the moment, and allow them a little breathing time. We have \nincluded that in this provision as well to support the industry itself. \nThis is a very balanced package that took the input of the leadership \non the Banking Committee and the Finance Committee which looked at \nproposals that were bipartisan--by the President, by a number of \npeople--that had brought forward something that will help. We don't \npretend it is a magic bullet. I wish there were one; I don't think \nthere is. But it is a very reasonable approach that has been put \nforward.\n  So here we are. We have this situation where colleagues now on the \nother side of the aisle, the leader on the other side of the aisle, \ncomes forward with a package and says, this is what we want to do; we \nneed to be able to pass these measures. Yet he has blocked us from even \ngetting to the housing issue, to the bill itself. He has blocked us \nfrom getting there.\n  I have to say, this reminds me of one other issue that is very \nrelated, and certainly is critical for me in Michigan, that has also \nbeen blocked time and time again, and which was a part of our original \nstimulus package we did in the Senate, of which I am very proud. I \nthink it was a very good proposal, and I was proud of the work we did. \nIn that proposal, we did something else that is very important right \nnow for middle-class workers and families. We extended unemployment \ncompensation benefits for families. It is viewed as one of the top two \nways to stimulate the economy.\n  If you are unemployed, you are going to take every dollar that comes \nin the door to pay the mortgage, to keep the lights on, the heat on, \npay for food, and do the things you need to do for your family. We know \nit is stimulative. We also know, from a moral standpoint, it is the \nright thing to do to help families. That has been blocked as well. I \nsee them related because we now have people who have been unemployed \nfor longer periods of time than they ever wanted to be and who are in \nthese situations. Maybe to keep going they did a home equity loan, and \nnow that is not working and they find themselves in a situation of \nforeclosure. One of the ways we can help on housing is to give people \nsome stability in their income.\n  I heard colleagues, when we debated this on the other side of the \naisle, saying, well, it is encouraging people not to work. I would love \nto have the President or the Secretary of the Treasury or colleagues \ncome, if they have not talked to folks in their own State, to Michigan \nand talk to folks who want desperately to work, and are working at very \nminimal wage jobs right now to try to keep going.\n  Nationally, we know there are 7.7 million unemployed people today who \nare competing for 4 million jobs, which is why I say the best long-term \nstimulus is a good-paying job. I am glad our budget is going to focus \non jobs, but the reality is we want to help stabilize families right \nnow because there are hundreds of thousands of people--millions, \nactually--in a situation where extending unemployment benefits for 13 \nweeks, and an additional 13 weeks for high unemployment areas, is \nexactly what needs to happen. I hope we are going to address that as \npart of what we are doing here as well.\n  In 2002, there was an extension of unemployment benefits, and the \nnational unemployment rate is roughly the same right now. It was 5 \npercent then, and it is nationally 4.9 now. We hear from the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics and from Goldman Sachs that by the beginning of next \nyear the national rate is going to be 6\\1/2\\ percent--6\\1/2\\ percent \nnationally. I am in a unique situation because I will take that. Our \nrate right now is 7.6 percent in Michigan, so I would take 6\\1/2\\ \npercent. The reality is we are seeing a dramatic rise in unemployment, \nand more and more families are going to find themselves in a situation \nof not being able to pay the mortgage, not being able to do what they \nneed to do for their families.\n  I think this is a fundamental issue for families--for middle-class \nfamilies. We are talking about people who work and who find themselves \nin a situation, because of a multitude of issues--where the job is not \nthere anymore--where they need help to continue to keep their family \ntogether, and keeping their house is incredibly important. I have \n72,000 people in Michigan who are scheduled to lose their unemployment \nbenefits by June. I have over 10,000 people a month who are losing \ntheir unemployment benefits, and we don't have the jobs for them. This \nis incredibly serious.\n  So I am, one more time, asking my Republican colleagues not to block \nthat when it comes to the floor. It is a very important part of the \neconomic picture for people, and it is time for us to get about the \nbusiness of fixing the economy, of supporting efforts that are going on \nin the economy for businesses, for individuals, for families, and for \ncommunities. There is a great sense of urgency that we need to have, \nbecause that is what families feel every single day. I am hopeful that \nwhen Senator Reid brings the next motion in front of us to be able to \ngo to a bill to deal with housing, colleagues will have that same sense \nof urgency and join us in being able to do that.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If the Senator would withhold her \nrequest.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will withhold my request for the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey may \nproceed.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nMichigan for her attribution, and I rise this morning to echo some of \nthe comments of my colleague and others who have lamented what the \nSenate did yesterday.\n  We have a situation across the landscape of this country in which our \neconomy is headed onto the shoals of a recession, with some economists \nbelieving that we are there already, and the very essence of that \nrecession, which hurts American families in real terms, stems from the \nhousing crisis that exists in this country. Instead of having responded \nto the storm clouds of the crisis that were on the horizon a year ago--\nin the Banking Committee, of which I am privileged to be a member, I \nsaid we are going to face a tsunami of foreclosures--the administration \nsaid, oh, no, no, no, that is an overexaggeration. Well, unfortunately, \nwe haven't even seen the crest of that tsunami.\n  The reality is that as the administration hit the snooze button then, \ninstead of responding to the oncoming crisis and limiting its scope, \nyesterday our colleagues on the other side of the aisle did exactly the \nsame thing, opposing the majority leader's opportunity to make sure we \naddress the housing crisis that exists in this country in a way that \nnot only saves American families from having the American dream become \nan American nightmare, but also, at the same time, in dealing with the \nvery core underpinnings of where this economy is headed--in a negative \ndirection--and turning it around. That is what yesterday's vote was all \nabout.\n  Everyone except President Bush and some of his colleagues seems to \nunderstand that we are in some very serious economic situations. I saw \nthe President's press conference yesterday. Even as gas prices in some \nparts of the country are already at $3.60 a gallon, when he was told \nwhat it was going to do when it hits $4 a gallon, he said: What $4 a \ngallon?\n  Well, I guess if you never have to pay for gas, you are totally \ndisconnected from the realities of average Americans. But, yes, that is \nwhere we are headed. He doesn't seem to understand we have a serious \neconomic situation.\n  But let us get real. It isn't largely those of us in this body who \nunderstand what is going on, it is the American people, across the \nlandscape of this country, who are feeling the effects of this downturn \nfirsthand. They are the ones receiving foreclosure notices; they are \nthe ones struggling to balance their checkbooks; and they are the ones \nreaching out to Congress for help.\n  Yesterday the majority leader tried to bring up a bill to help those \nstruggling in this economic downturn, and\n\n[[Page S1406]]\n\nyesterday Republican Members of this Chamber blocked that bill, in \nessence blocking help for those American homeowners who are on the \nverge of losing their home. The Foreclosure Prevention Act gets to the \nheart of our economic crisis--that is, the housing market.\n  As I and others on the Banking Committee have said, the downward \nspiral of the housing market is the reason we are facing such a \ndifficult economy. We cannot think we will get the Nation back on track \nwithout legislation to address the weaknesses in the housing market. \nThe bill that Republicans blocked would have done one major thing: Keep \nfamilies in their homes.\n  Beyond the economy, this goes to the very heart of our families' \nability to grow and prosper. Home. Home is where we are brought from \nthe hospital when we are born. It is home we come to. Home is where we \nare nurtured as we grow. Home is where we get to celebrate, most of the \ntime, our birthdays. Home is where, in fact, we also share moments of \nsorrow. Home is where we often take care of a sick or dying loved one. \nHome is the very essence of the American dream.\n  Beyond what it means to us and our families in the context of the \ndevelopment of our lives, home is also the single foundation of the \nindividual American's economic ability to prosper. It is the single \nbiggest asset most Americans will have in their lifetime. It is the \nasset they will use very often to borrow in order to educate their \nchild and send them to college. It is the asset they may draw upon if \nthey have a significant illness. It is the asset they will rely upon as \nthey grow older and seek retirement.\n  When it means so much to us as a society, both in the personal \ncontext of what home is and the values that surround it mean, and when \nit means so much to us individually and collectively as communities and \nas a nation in terms of our economy, it is unthinkable that we could \nnot get progress on a bill that saves the very essence of that American \ndream.\n  Yet that is what happened yesterday in the Senate. The bill that was \nup provides funding for counseling in order to reach and help families \nat risk of losing their homes. Many American families are sitting \naround the kitchen table looking through their mortgage bills and their \nfinances and those bank notices. Many of them have turned to their \ncredit cards to float their personal debt.\n  They are lost. They do not know where to turn. And these counselors \nwho were part of the bill could help offer them real solutions and \noptions to help in averting a foreclosure. Does not that make sense? It \ndoes to me. That is what the bill allows.\n  The bill also provided funding to allow communities with high \nforeclosure rates to access an existing program, community development \nblock grants. With these funds communities can purchase foreclosed \nproperties for rehabilitation, rent, or resale.\n  There are some who have said in this debate: Well, you know, those \nborrowers, they are responsible for making their own decisions; it has \nnothing to do with me. Well, for every foreclosed property in a \nneighborhood, those who have their properties adjacent to or nearby \nwithin that neighborhood have a decrease in value. Having a series of \nforeclosed properties, as we have seen in some parts of the Nation, \nhaving communities abandoned does not benefit anyone. It decreases \nsurrounding home values; it attracts crime and vandalism.\n  The bottom line is that foreclosures destabilize neighborhoods.\n  The funds in this bill, which the Republicans have not allowed to \nmove forward, allow communities to stop the spiral before it starts. \nDoes that not make sense?\n  The bill's most controversial piece--there are many others, many \nothers that I think were pretty universal; that is, that should have \nbeen supported. But its most controversial piece put in by my friend, \nSenator Durbin, his bankruptcy provision would, in essence, change the \nbankruptcy law to give judges the discretion to modify loan terms for a \nprimary residence, in essence, where you call home.\n  Right now the law allows for modifying those loan terms for vacation \nhomes, something that is not your primary residence. So you can have a \nvacation home, a time share; you can have any other second home under \nexisting law. If you have some financial trouble, you can actually get \nthe bankruptcy judge to modify those terms. But when it comes to your \ncore home, your principal residence, the place where you nurture and \ngrow your family, oh, no, you cannot do that.\n  Does it make sense that we have greater value for a vacation or \nsecondary home and less value for the primary residence of American \nfamilies? That would be the equivalent of something along the line of: \nYou can get a modification on Camp David, but you could not get any \nmodification at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Now, of course, in this particular case, that example does create so \nvividly for people what we are talking about. In either case, the \nPresident does not have to pay a mortgage on either of those properties \nbecause they are owned by the American people. But my point is here is \nthe primary residence, you cannot get any help. The secondary \nresidence, you can get help. It does not make any sense. The thing is, \nmost Americans do not have a Camp David, and they are asking for help \nto save their house on Main Street. This makes sense.\n  Now, the majority leader and Senator Durbin and others worked out a \ncompromise to make sure this provision that was in the bill was even \nmore narrowly tailored. More narrowly tailored? How so? Under their \ncompromise, the only families who could request a court-ordered change \nto their mortgage are families who would otherwise lose their homes to \nforeclosure.\n  But that was not even all. It went on. It went beyond that and it \nsaid: Only those families who can pass a strict means test, their \nability to pay in bankruptcy, and therefore can prove they cannot \nafford their current mortgage are eligible. That was not it. They went \nbeyond that. They said: Only families who are currently struggling with \nwhat type of mortgage? Any mortgage? No. Only nontraditional and \nsubprime loans, the very essence of the types of mortgages that have \ncreated the crisis in America that were spun out there in a way, \nattracting people into mortgages without the appropriate credit \ncounseling, that they should have never been attracted into anyhow.\n  So the universe was further limited, further limited. And \nfurthermore, to give the lenders some additional guarantees, if the \nfamilies, after the bankruptcy judge made some decision to make an \naccommodation in that loan, if they sell their home after that mortgage \nmodification, any increase in the home value would go back to whom? To \nthe lender. So lenders would have a chance to recoup the loss in that \nhome value.\n  Now, let me say, there is going to come a point in time that lenders \nunderstand that as values continue to go down and down and down, when \nthey foreclose on a piece of property, they are not even going to get \nthat which they, in fact, loaned against.\n  Is it not far better to be able to sustain a family in their home and \nto help that value reestablish itself over time and grow and be able to \nmake the lender more whole than to put that family out on the street? \nLenders will come to that conclusion at some point.\n  So these provisions, each time more and more and more narrower, so we \nwere talking only of a universe of those people who were being hurt, \nhad no financial ability to pay the mortgages that they should have \nnever gotten into, that was offered by the industry to lure them in, \nlower interest rates, and then reject afterwards, and with the ability \nto recoup any value going back to the lender, all conditions that do \nnot exist on a secondary residence.\n  None of the things I talked about are part of the law as it relates \nto a secondary residence; they are all about only this limited prime \nuniverse, and, of course, anyone who got a conventional mortgage, \nanyone who did not get a subprime mortgage or a nontraditional \nmortgage, they were totally, under the existing law, going to continue \nto be under the existing law. So we had a narrow universe.\n  This provision that was in the bill blocked by Republicans was not \nadded to harm the banking industry, was not added to hurt mortgage \nbrokers, it was added to help homeowners save their home. This \nprovision is only one of the ways we can help a significant number\n\n[[Page S1407]]\n\nof homeowners without costing the taxpayers a dime.\n  It would help more than 600,000 families in bad loans keep their \nhomes across the landscape of the country. It would help over 14,000 \nfamilies in my home State of New Jersey avoid foreclosure. That would \nbe a savings of almost $5 million in home values. But if we do not do \nanything, if we sit back, we risk losing much more. In New Jersey over \nthe next 2 years, we expect more than 57,000 homes to be lost to \nforeclosure. That means 57,000 families who will have to hand over \ntheir keys to their home, 57,000 families who will be forced to say \ngoodbye to the place where they were nurtured and comforted, the place \nthey lived with the good and bad, the place they came home to every \nnight, the place they call home.\n\n  In the words of families who know what it feels like to lose a home, \nthey will feel like they will have lost everything. But this is not \neven about those homeowners. Foreclosed properties have a ripple effect \non surrounding homes and the community at large.\n  In New Jersey, these 57,000 foreclosed homes could cost a $10,000 \ndecrease in the home prices of over 2 million surrounding homes. And, \noverall, that loss would be about $19.6 billion in home values. That is \njust in my home State.\n  The fact is, no one is immune from the ripple effect of this housing \ncrisis. The potential loss to families and communities in New Jersey \nand across the Nation is far too great for us to sit this one out. I, \npersonally, cannot stand by while Members of the Chamber play games \nwith my home State and with the American dream of millions of people \nacross the landscape of this country.\n  Collectively, we have much too much to lose. I do not know if other \nMembers of this Chamber do not watch the news, or they do not get the \nsame memos, but foreclosures are going to happen nationwide if we do \nnot do something. Analysts anticipate that 2 million American families \nwill lose their homes over the next 2 years, and 40 million of their \nneighbors will see their home values decline due to projected \nforeclosures.\n  When those neighbors see their home values decline as a result, their \nability to borrow against their home for their kid's college education, \nto have the buffer in case of a major illness in their family or \nthemselves, their ability to do all those things will be affected.\n  It is not time to play games and use delay tactics. The more we \ndelay, the more homes we risk losing. Approximately 20,000 families \nlose their homes every week. Every week, 20,000 families see the \nAmerican dream slip away. These families are struggling. They are \ntrying to pay their mortgages, but they cannot. Most of them cannot \nsell or refinance. Many of them have found, in fact, the value of their \nproperties is less than the mortgage amount. They need other options, \nand they are looking to the Federal Government and those who lured \nthem, the lenders, as the first place for help.\n  The fact is that help simply is not there. Loan servicers could \nmodify the loans themselves. They do not have to wait for a bankruptcy \njudge, would not have to wait for the Congress to act. Under existing \nlaws, the loan officers could modify loans to make them more affordable \nand simply are not doing so in sufficient numbers.\n  A report by Moody's found that loan servicers have only modified 3.5 \npercent of mortgages that increased to higher rates. These are \nopportunities to keep people in their home, and instead of dealing with \nthe higher rates, maybe adjust those rates in a way where they would \nstill get a borrower who can continue to pay, wait for the value of \nthat home to build up. But they would not make as much as in the loan \nthey lured these individuals into. A report by the Center for \nResponsible Lending estimates that the administration's plan that has \nbeen put out there as the solution to this problem, to streamline \nmodifications, is only going to help about 3 percent of homeowners, 3 \npercent.\n  As a member of the Banking Committee, I asked the Secretary of the \nTreasury, Secretary Paulson, when he was before us about 2 weeks ago, \nand yesterday Chairman Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve: \nAre we willing to say 97 percent of the projected 2 million homes that \nare going to be lost in America, that is a market correction?\n  Are we willing to accept that 97 percent of those 2 million homes \nthat will go in foreclosure, that is acceptable as a societal value? \nYou hear a lot about family values here. Well, I do not know of any \ngreater family value than the place we call home and a place to call \nhome.\n  Are we willing to say we will, in our overall economy, accept a 97-\npercent foreclosure rate as it relates to the nature of our economy and \nwhere it is headed, an economy that is stagnant in terms of growth but \nrising in terms of consumer costs, on gas--notwithstanding the \nPresident's lack of knowledge of it--on energy costs as a whole, on \nrising food prices, and lowering home values? Are we willing to say \nthat?\n  Are we willing to say to 97 percent of 2 million families: Well, that \nis a market correction. Yet we heard the rush to get the Federal \nReserve to respond to Wall Street and the concerns of shareholders. How \nabout homeowners? How about homeowners? That is simply not good enough.\n\n  Thousands of New Jersey families have already gone into foreclosure. \nTens of thousands more are behind on their mortgage payments. How many \nmore are we going to watch have their American dream turn into the \nAmerican nightmare so many are facing. Let me put a face on these \nstatistics: Charmain Perryman, a resident of Nunellen, NJ, she came \nhome last fall to an eviction notice taped to her front door. Perryman, \nlike so many others, had an adjustable rate mortgage that had reset not \nonce but twice, rising from 7.5 percent to 11 percent. She was on the \nverge of losing her home. Luckily her story has a happy ending. A \ncommunity development organization, similar to those we want to help \nthrough community development block grant opportunities, is buying her \nhome from the bank and working out a payment schedule so she will be \nable to stay in her home and make responsible payments.\n  But there are too many families across the landscape of New Jersey \nand the country that are not realizing that opportunity. That \nforeclosure notice taped to their door will soon be replaced by a \npadlock on their door.\n  The Foreclosure Prevention Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor, \noffers real solutions for the American family, neighborhoods, and the \nentire economy. It would help stop the bleeding in the foreclosure \ncrisis.\n  I ask Members in the Chamber to think about these families when, \nhopefully, they have an opportunity to vote again. What happened \nyesterday was embarrassing. I know some camouflage is being offered \nthat, well, we were not going to be allowed to offer certain types of \namendments. The reality is, as the majority leader made clear, all \nrelevant amendments would be allowed. Families who are struggling, at \nthe end of their rope, 20,000 families a week losing their homes, don't \nwant to hear about some amendments that ultimately had nothing to do \nwith the very essence of the housing crisis as the reason they are \ngetting put out of their homes. All we are saying is, come to the \ntable. Offer relevant amendments. Let's have a real discussion about \nhow to help families avoid foreclosure. With 20,000 families losing \ntheir homes every week, 10 million on the near horizon; with an economy \nthat is bleeding dramatically and that could go, if we do not stem the \nhemorrhaging, into a deep recession that would have long-term \nconsequences for us as a Nation, both as individuals, families, \ncommunities, and collectively, it is not something with which we can \nafford to play procedural games.\n  I look forward to next week having a new opportunity, fresher minds' \nreflection, and an understanding of the grave consequences before us, \nand an opportunity to rescue--not to do a Government bailout but to \nrescue--the opportunity of the American dream being snatched away by \nthe American nightmare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                         Damage From Hurricanes\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I want to follow up on the remarks of \nmy colleague from New Jersey who has been an extraordinary leader in so\n\n[[Page S1408]]\n\nmany ways, particularly on the housing issue. I thank him and associate \nmyself with many of his remarks.\n  I rise to speak about the housing situation and to try to bring some \ncomparisons between the difficulties around the country and, in some \nplaces, downright despair because of the foreclosure situation and \npending bankruptcies. I also want to remind my colleagues that there is \nstill a tremendous need on the Gulf Coast relative to the housing \ncrisis and ask my colleagues not to lose sight of the difficulties that \nwe are still having in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida.\n  I know it is 2008. The storms of Katrina and Rita and Wilma are long \ngone in some people's memories but not in ours. These storms in many \nways were just like yesterday, not just the hurricanes but the levees \nthat broke and caused unmitigated disaster and despair.\n  I thought it would be helpful to first examine communities with the \nhighest foreclosure rates, and with the Senator from Michigan in the \nchair, the first area I want to speak about is in Michigan--Detroit, \nLivonia, and Dearborn, which I am sure she is familiar with--which \nhappens to be the metropolitan area that has the highest percentage of \nforeclosures. This chart shows you the top 10 communities in the Nation \nand the numbers of homeowners facing bankruptcy or foreclosure. The \nnumber of homes is both striking and startling. If you think about \nforeclosure, the damage is not just done to the family losing their \nhome or the individual but to the neighborhood as a whole. If it is so \nconcentrated, as it seems to be in some particular counties, it has \ndramatic economic effects on the whole community. That is why \nDemocrats--and I know some on the other side are sensitive to this--are \ntrying to fashion a package that recognizes that while we don't want to \nbail out improper behavior, we most certainly don't want to bail out \nillegal behavior, we absolutely need a housing bill that recognizes \nthat foreclosure does not just involve a single family, but it impacts \nan entire community, particularly in Michigan where some of this is \nprobably associated with the downturn in manufacturing jobs. People are \nnot only losing their jobs but losing their homes.\n  While the causes of our loss were very different, it wasn't due to an \neconomic downturn. It wasn't really due to subprime lending practices. \nOur problems were due to the levees collapsing when they should have \nheld and the ensuing floods that wiped out hundreds of thousands of \nhomes, which I will get to in a minute. But for purposes of my brief \nremarks this morning, these are the top 10 areas facing foreclosure \nproblems in the United States, in Michigan, California, and Nevada.\n  You have heard people say this crisis is limited to places within \nabout seven States. But for comparison, I would like to show the \ncounties and parishes in the Gulf Coast that have the highest rates of \nhousing loss due to the floods. This is an extraordinary comparison. If \nI could ask the staff to hold up the other chart next to this one so \npeople may see.\n  We are talking about the mortgage crisis, 4.9 percent in Michigan and \n4.9 percent in Stockton, CA. Next to it is the actual numbers. So \n41,273 households in the Detroit area are in some part of the \nforeclosure process; down in Miami, FL, 2.7 percent. That doesn't sound \nlike a big percentage, but it is 25,000 families. That is a lot of \nfamilies.\n  But let me show you on the Gulf Coast what has happened to us over \nthe last 2 years. In St. Bernard Parish--this is major and severe \ndamage. This is the percentage of homes that were unlivable, \n78.4 percent; in Cameron Parish, which is a small parish in the \nSouthwest, 71.8 percent; in Hancock County, MS, 69.8 percent; in \nPlaquemines Parish, LA, 57.5 percent; Orleans Parish, 55.9 percent; \nHarrison County, MS, 34 percent; Jackson County, MS, 34 percent; St. \nTammany Parish, 25 percent; Jefferson Parish, 19 percent; and Vermilion \nParish, 13 percent. There are no other percentages like this anywhere \nin the country.\n\n  My point is that while I am glad address the foreclosure crisis for \nthe country and am proud to help other regions--and I most certainly \nunderstand the disaster associated with foreclosures, particularly if \nthey are not really of your making. You took out the right kind of \nloan, you put your money down, but you lost your job or your child got \ninto an accident, and because you don't have health insurance, you have \nto file for bankruptcy, and people are taking your home. And that is \nthe last thing people should be doing. We should be helping pay medical \nbills and getting people jobs and not taking their homes. I am not here \nto bail out reckless behavior. But I most certainly think Congress \nshould step up and help middle-class families struggling to keep their \nhomes. But for comparison's sake, I want people to get their eyes on \nwhat we are still going through on the Gulf Coast.\n  We have parishes where 78 percent of the homes are unlivable and \npeople are struggling to keep these homes. What the Federal Government \nhas done has been substantial, but it is not adequate and not enough. \nWhile we have sent Community Development Block Grant funding down to \nmany of these families, some of them still haven't seen a penny. Some \nof them had to deduct their insurance from that. We still don't have \ntax relief for individuals who took a casualty loss deduction and are \nnow being taxed on their Community Development Block Grants. So people, \nin addition to not receiving their full complement, not getting their \nfull insurance money, are now being pushed to a higher tax bracket \nbecause this Congress has failed yet to give them tax relief that they \ndesperately need.\n  So as we put this housing relief package together for the Nation, \nlet's think about what can be done in Mississippi, Florida, Texas, and \nLouisiana, where, in some places, 50 percent of families or more have \nlost their homes. Some people are back. Some people are struggling. But \nyou might have a neighborhood, let's say, in St. Bernard--I was there \nlast week--where there is one home that is fixed and inhabited. Every \nother home on that block is vacant. Think about that. This person is \nhappy to be back in their house. But when you ask them what was the \nvalue of that house before the storm, it used to be $450,000. Today \nthat is a very interesting question. What is the value of a three-\nbedroom brick home on a block where every other home is empty? That is \nhow badly people want to live in their neighborhoods and communities. \nThese are not communities necessarily below sea level. Some of these \nplaces I describe are above sea level.\n  If the Senate continues to consider the Foreclosure Prevention Act, I \nhave some specific suggestions as to how we can make the bill more \nrelevant for families struggling on the Gulf Coast. First, we need tax \nrelief for Road Home grant recipients. We need it for the people who \nhave lost their homes. We also need to craft the legislation so that \nfamilies can use the bonds allocated in the bill to purchase or \nrefinance a home that was destroyed in the 2005 hurricanes. Also, the \nCommunity Development Block grant funding formula in the legislation \nshould account for communities that have lost significant numbers of \nhomes in the 2005 hurricanes. Finally, the bill provides a unique \nopportunity for us to increase home ownership in hurricane-impacted \nareas.\n  I wish the Presiding Officer the best in helping one of her \ncommunities. But please don't forget us. I don't have Alabama numbers, \nbut the hurricane did hit Alabama. We do have those numbers on another \nchart. But for those of us on the Gulf Coast, this is critical. And, \nyes, another hurricane season is starting this spring. Let's get some \nhelp to these people and fashion a bill that we can pass that will \nbring real relief to American homeowners everywhere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank my colleague for raising some \nof those issues. Our area was hardest hit in one area I visited not \nlong ago, and just now we are seeing houses come back. It has been sad. \nI think that it has taken this long to move, going on 3 years, and you \nwonder why we couldn't make that happen earlier. A lot of money has \nbeen spent on interim housing and other things, that had it been spent \nin a way that goes directly to housing, to building new housing in safe \nareas and raised up so we wouldn't have a risk in the future, we would\n\n[[Page S1409]]\n\nhave been a lot better off. I know it is hard because I have been there \nand I have seen how hard it is to move the process in a faster way. I \nhope in the future we will learn to do it better.\n\n  I thank my colleague for raising it.\n\n\n                                 Budget\n\n  Madam President, all of us realize our country faces a fiscal crisis. \nUnless we take action, we are going to see dramatic damage to our \neconomy in the years to come. With the retirement of the baby boomers, \nour current spending levels on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid \nin particular are simply unsustainable.\n  Absent reform, the Social Security trust fund is expected to be \nexhausted by 2041, the Medicare Part A trust fund will be exhausted in \n2019--only 11 years from now--and the cost of these Federal programs \nwill actually exceed the current budget. The resulting deficits will be \nso large that many predict the Government will not be able to borrow \nits way out of the problem. So we do need to take some steps now.\n  Some may think these grim predictions, these projections are not \naccurate. Maybe things are not as bad as some are projecting. But I do \nnot think anybody can doubt we are moving to a period of time when our \nability to fund the entitlement programs, plus our general \nexpenditures, will be beyond our capacity--really beyond our capacity. \nIt becomes more difficult each year we delay in getting there.\n  Next week we will be marking up, in the Budget Committee, this year's \nbudget. I have served on the Budget Committee for a number of years. \nLast year, we had a budget, and it was a bit discouraging. We have had \ndiscouraging budgets for some years, frankly.\n  I want to make some remarks to clarify what I think is a problem. \nSome would say it is partisan, but I think we might as well talk about \nit because, prior to the last election, our Democratic colleagues \nvigorously attacked the Republicans for not fixing our fiscal \nsituation. They said: You are in the majority. There was, in truth, \nmuch merit to those criticisms. I do not think the Republican majority \ndid a very good job, and people were not happy about it. It was a \nfactor in the last election.\n  In fact, in the last election, 2006, when my Democratic colleagues \nwere promising to do better--and they achieved a majority in both \nHouses of Congress--the polling data showed the Democratic Members of \nCongress were believed to be better able than Republicans to confront \nthis deficit problem we were facing. So it was a factor, I think, in \nthe last election.\n  I note that over the last several years substantial progress was made \nabout the deficit. We do not need to be too negative here. The deficit \nfell from $413 billion in 2004 to $162 billion last year. That is more \nthan half--well more than half--that we reduced it. I, frankly, was \nvery hopeful that if we could continue to contain the growth in \nspending we would see that deficit continue to fall.\n  But two things have happened that, frankly, make this a difficult \nyear. First, the Congress voted for a $170 billion stimulus package to \nsend everybody checks and other things--$170 billion. Last year, our \ndeficit was just $162 billion. This year we added on top of all of our \nspending another $170 billion.\n  Since we were already in deficit, where did we get the money to pay \nthe $170 billion? Nobody disputes it: Every single dollar of the $170 \nbillion proposed is paid for by more debt. It is borrowed. It is going \nto be a debt we will carry and our grandchildren will carry, frankly. \nAnd we will pay interest on it. So this year's budget is going to look \nbad, and it is going to be difficult because we have another $170 \nbillion, and that is more than the deficit of all of last year.\n  Secondly, we still have very considerable expenses related to the war \non terrorism. That hurts. But that was included in last year's deficit.\n  The next thing--that is troubling for us all--is the economic \nslowdown. We tax the American people pretty heavily--frankly, more than \nI like to see them taxed. We tax upper income people with even higher \nmarginal tax rates than we tax lower income people.\n  When the economy is doing well--and somebody should do a better study \nabout this, I think, than has been done to date--when the economy is \ndoing well, upper income people tend to do very well. So their \nbusiness--maybe they own 10 or 12 of this or that outlets in some city. \nThe economy is booming. The CEO, the owner, makes $300,000 a year, and \nhe pays that 35-percent marginal income tax rate to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Now, if the economy slows down, instead of making $300,000, he makes \n$100,000. It looks like a lot of money, but it certainly will not \nbenefit the U.S. Treasury nearly as much because the marginal rate on \n$100,000 will be lower than 35 percent. And he will only be paying on \n$100,000.\n  So I say, we have created a tax system that has tied itself to a \ngrowing economy, and we are not in a growing economy this year. It \nlooks like the economy is going to slow down, and it is troubling. So \nwe cannot project the same level of revenue to the U.S. Government that \nwe had the last several years, which had been surging. It was 13 \npercent, 11 percent, 10 percent the last 3 years in growth. So we are \nfacing a difficult issue.\n  My Democratic colleagues, during this past election, promised to cut \nspending and do better than those who had been in power. My very fine \ncolleague Senator Conrad--who I think, if he had more support among his \nmajority colleagues, would be able to do more than he is doing--said \nthese things last year. This is the chairman of the Budget Committee:\n\n       So for those of us who are concerned about spending, sign \n     me up.\n\n  On ``60 Minutes'':\n\n       We need to be tough on spending.\n       I think most of it is going to have to be on the spending \n     side of the equation, given the magnitude of the baby boom \n     generation.\n       I think we should sharply inhibit the growth of spending.\n\n  Well, those were some promises that were made last year. They have \nalso promised and made a big to-do about the tax gap.\n  Now, the debate over the tax gap was simply this: Well, we don't want \nto promote in our first budget--last year, that was the first \nDemocratic budget--a tax increase, so what we will do is we will use \nthe same current tax rates, and what we will do is collect more and get \nthose people who are cheating. We had reports from the IRS that said \nthat was not going to work. We had experienced Senators, such as \nSenator Grassley, former chairman of the Finance Committee, who said: \nThat is not going to work. Senator Gregg, former chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, and now ranking Republican on that committee, said: It is \nnot going to work.\n  Oh, but they used that argument. When the budget was passed, this \nextra income they projected would be received into the Treasury as a \nresult of enhanced enforcement by the IRS, that that was going to help \nthem, allow them to spend more money and not increase the debt. OK. \nThat was the debate we had last year when we passed a budget: a \ncommitment they would raise more money by collecting from those who are \nnot paying as much as they are supposed to pay. It did not happen. I \nwill talk about that in a minute.\n  But I want to say this: A budget is a defining document for a \npolitical party. It is organized 51-49 with a Democratic majority here. \nWe passed a Budget Act a number of years ago--because we could not pass \nbudgets because of filibusters--to eliminate the filibusters during \nbudget debates. You can pass a budget with a majority vote. So the \nmajority party, as the Republicans could do in the past, was able to \npass a budget without support from the other party. Anybody who is in a \nmajority in the Senate ought to be able to pass a budget. It also is a \ndocument that says something about the priorities and the direction \nthat the majority wants to see the country go: how they are going to \nget there. It is a very important, defining document.\n  Senator Gregg, last year, was very eloquent. He is such an \nexperienced and wise Senator, who watches this carefully. He has \nstudied these issues carefully. He predicted their budget was not going \nto add up last year when we passed that budget. But they insisted that \nit would work, as it was passed, and history now can tell us what \nhappened. Looking back, it is clear--even in a period of good economic \ngrowth last year--the promises that were made were not kept. They told \nus they would cut the existing spending or reduce the\n\n[[Page S1410]]\n\nrate of increase in spending. Yet last year the majority attempted to \nadd $23 billion to President Bush's discretionary spending request, \nwhich already reflected a $60 billion increase.\n  So President Bush's budget had a $60 billion increase in \ndiscretionary spending. This excludes Social Security, Medicare, and \nthe military--or the war supplementals. It excludes those entitlement \nprograms. He proposed $60 billion in increases. Our colleagues passed a \nbudget in the Senate that was a $23 billion increase above that.\n  Contrary to cutting spending, I would suggest my colleagues did not \nfulfill their promises, but actually proposed a budget that increased \nspending 50 percent more almost--40 percent-plus more than President \nBush proposed. Over a 5-year period, that budget would have hiked \nnondefense discretionary spending by $205 billion. But we did have \nsomewhat of a battle last year, and as the great omnibus bill came \nthrough at the end of the year--that monstrosity--President Bush \nthreatened a veto, and he forced a cut in spending. Republicans in the \nCongress backed him up on that veto threat, and that was achieved at \nthe end.\n  It appeared that we had a spending program that was more akin to \nPresident Bush's $60 billion increase than to an $83 billion increase \nas proposed by my Democratic colleagues. But it wasn't all that good, \nfrankly, because, as has been the case for decades, there are other \noptions to get around the budget--gimmicks and devices. By abusing the \nemergency spending designation last year, the majority party was able \nto spend an additional $24 billion anyway, by calling it an emergency.\n  If we have a budget and we agree to commit to that budget and \nlegislation is proposed that goes above that budget, it is subject to a \npoint of order, and you have to have 60 votes at least before you can \nspend it. But if you can get enough votes, if you can get 60 votes, you \ncan just declare something an emergency, and you can put the money in \nthe emergency spending with 60 votes, and it doesn't count against the \nbudget because you have declared it an emergency. So that is on top of \nthe deficit budget we have.\n  Also, there were great promises that any new spending programs would \nbe offset. This is the pay-go rule. How do you offset a new spending \nprogram? You can cut spending somewhere else or you can increase taxes. \nThat is the only way to do it under pay-go. But our colleagues have \noften--this pay-go rule that had been so much ballyhooed here by our \ncolleagues--they either ignored it or gimmicked the pay-go rules last \nyear. Such gimmickry resulted in $143 billion in deficit spending.\n  For example, let's look at the SCHIP reauthorization. I hope my \ncolleagues will just think about this. I take no pleasure in this. I \nhave seen Republicans do this too. But this is really a blatant \nexample. The bill we passed last year increased funding for SCHIP, the \ninsurance for children, increased spending over 5 years by $35 billion. \nBut in fiscal year 2013, that spending level was decreased by 85 \npercent. Now, I ask my colleagues: Why? Why would we dramatically \nincrease funding for the SCHIP program and then in an outyear--2013--\nslash it by 85 percent? The reason is they score the cost of it over 5 \nyears. So for 4 years we would have a dramatic increase, and in the \nfifth year they make a dramatic 85-percent reduction. The question is, \nWhy was that done? So it would fit within the score, the 5-year score. \nBut what is really going to happen? Does anybody in this Senate think \nthat in 2013 we are going to cut the children's insurance program by 85 \npercent? Of course not. This is a gimmick. It was a gimmick to make it \nfit within the budget, to appear not to be in violation of the pay-go \nrule when, in fact, we know we couldn't possibly reduce that program by \n85 percent.\n  Not only does the pay-go rule fail to control spending, it will put \nus on an almost guaranteed path to large tax increases. Under the \nDemocratic budget that passed last year, any existing tax cut, any \nexisting lower tax rate that expires sometime in the future would be \nallowed to expire--for our colleagues, to continue those current levels \nof taxes, to continue them at a lower rate is considered a tax cut. So \nto extend the dividend cuts, extend the capital gains cuts, extend the \nlower rates for lower income workers, it amounts to, under their \ndefinition, a tax cut. It takes 60 votes under this pay-go rule to pass \na tax cut. President Clinton said he opposes these tax cuts that \nPresident Bush passed, and I think that represents the majority view of \nmy colleagues, so we are looking at a period of time that we could see \nadditional increases in taxes, and to keep them at the current rate, \nthey will score it as a tax cut. We will either pay for it under this \ndefinition by reducing spending or increasing taxes somewhere else. We \nare not going to reduce spending because we have already seen the \nmajority party has proposed a budget that spends more than President \nBush proposed, and he proposed an increase in spending.\n  It is sort of a perverse little deal. Under this pay-go rule, my \ncolleagues assume that spending will go up each year, so that doesn't \nhave to be offset. It goes up at a certain rate, but they say if you \nextend the current tax rates, that is a tax cut. It provides an \nincentive and an advancement of spending and a detriment to tax \nreductions.\n  Now, with regard to the tax gap, it would be pretty humorous, \nfrankly, if it weren't so serious. Their proposals on this tax gap, \nthis idea that they are going to raise more taxes by having the IRS \nincrease collections, was one of the wildest political chimeras this \nSenate has seen in quite a number of years. As I have indicated, senior \nSenators such as Senator Grassley and Senator Gregg pointed out how it \nwas not going to work, and they cited the IRS and other things that \nshowed it, but we passed it anyway. We scored the budget on the \nassumption the money would come in. It was going to raise $300 billion \nover 5 years, just in enhanced collections. So we assumed we were going \nto enhance tax collections by $300 billion over the next 5 years last \nyear when we passed this Democratic budget. But we see now, from the \nbest estimates we have for the effort of closing the tax gap, it is not \ngoing to raise $300 billion, it will raise $200 million over 5 years, \n$40 million a year--hardly enough to impact the overall deficit \nsituation we are in at all. The House has recently passed legislation \nthat actually is going to widen the tax gap, unfortunately.\n  Our colleagues promised to enact middle-class tax relief, but that \nhas not been done. There has been no action to extend the marriage \npenalty relief we have today, the $1,000-per-child tax credit we have, \nthe 10-percent tax break credit--the 10-percent tax bracket for low-\nincome workers, or any kind of estate tax reform. So we have had that \ntalk, but we haven't passed it, and we are heading to the point where \nwe are going to have a pay-go problem to even extend these current \nrates, and they are going to score that as a tax cut and demand to know \nwhere we are going to get the money from. The capital gains reduction \nthat virtually every economist agrees results in increased revenues to \nthe Government from capital gains taxes will expire in 2010. The 10-\npercent tax bracket--the low 10-percent tax bracket that didn't \npreviously exist but was created as a result of President Bush's tax \ncuts would expire, and it would go back to 15 percent for lower income \nindividuals. Setting a dividend rate at 15 percent will end; it will go \nback to the marginal rate for many people of over 30 percent. Does \nanybody think that is going to help the stock market to increase--\ndouble--the rate for dividend taxes you have to pay? So the best scores \nwe have are that we are heading toward a $900 billion tax increase that \nwill impact directly--and everybody indirectly--116 million taxpayers.\n\n  What about entitlements? The majority party talked about doing \nsomething about entitlements. I think Senator Conrad truly believes we \nshould do something about it. He has worked hard at it, but he has \nnever gotten the support on his side of the aisle to ever make a dent \nin it. We have to think about entitlement spending.\n  At this point in time, entitlement spending--Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid--exceeds half of our budget, half of what we spend. \nThat number is growing. Some have it up to 100 percent of the current \nbudget level in a number of decades unless something were to change. At \nleast President Bush consistently has offered programs to improve and \ncontain the growth in\n\n[[Page S1411]]\n\nthese programs. He talked about Social Security reform, and the door \nwas slammed shut. My colleagues wouldn't even discuss it. He has talked \nabout Medicare and Medicaid. Nobody would talk about that last year. It \nwas absolutely not a part of last year's budget.\n  So I think this is irresponsible. If we are heading on a glidepath \nthat takes us to trillions and trillions of dollars in debt, driven \noverwhelmingly by the 6, 7, 8 percent increases annually in Medicare \nand Medicaid, why can't we begin to reduce that growth rate and bring \nit more close to the inflation rate of 2, 3 percent, maybe 4 percent, 5 \npercent increases each year?\n  Finally, I thought one of the most effective critiques of the \nRepublican majority leadership in 2006 and the years before was we \nweren't passing our appropriations bills on time. They had too much \npork in them. Stuff was put in them in the dead of night, and we didn't \nhave a chance to read it and do anything about it. That was the valid \ncriticism of the Republican majority.\n  What happened this past year after our colleagues won the majority, \nclaiming they were going to do better? Did they do better? Well, we \nhave 12 appropriations bills each year. We should enact each one of \nthem individually. They should be brought up on the floor one-by-one. \nThere should be an opportunity to offer amendments, and they should be \nvoted up or down, right? No, that is not the way it goes. This past \nyear, we had the largest omnibus bill in 20 years. The majority sent \nus, near Christmas, a 1,600-page omnibus package that combined into one \nbill 11 of the 12 appropriations bills, and then it hit this floor; \nthere was no time to read it. We didn't know what kind of pork or \npolicy had been added to it. We were challenged to vote for it or not. \nIt was $555 billion. That is worse than we have had in terms of an \nomnibus package in 20 years.\n  Frankly, the majority leader, Senator Reid, has indicated that he may \nnot even bring up the appropriations bills or we may have another great \nomnibus bill this year, but after the election. Well, the election is \nin November. The fiscal year starts October 1. It is our responsibility \nto have the appropriations bills passed before the beginning of the \nfiscal year, October 1.\n  It is as if he is throwing in the towel before we even get there. \nFrankly, as an aside, I truly believe we would do much better if we \nwent to a 2-year budget and 2-year appropriations, as over half of the \nStates have. That would help us in this process because this happens \nevery year, and it is getting worse, it seems, every year.\n  We will soon have the new budget resolution. It will hit the \ncommittee next week. I am a member of the committee. It was a failed \nand unhealthy budget last year that was moved forward by our Democratic \ncolleagues. I am afraid this one will not be much better.\n  I noticed that the Democratic Presidential candidates are offering a \nlot of new proposals. Senator Obama, who now leads, has offered 158 of \nthem that would cost at least $312 billion in new annual spending, or \n$1.4 trillion over 5 years, as we tend to score those things. That \ndoesn't include all of his proposals that are out there.\n  Madam President, I will conclude by telling the American people and \nmy colleagues that next week we will begin a defining process. Next \nweek, the majority party will offer a budget. Because of the budget \nrules, with 51 votes, they will be able to pass this budget. So because \nthe Democratic majority has 51 votes, they can pass the budget they \nwant. But we need to examine it because it will tell us and America \nwhat their priorities are, what their commitment is, how willing they \nare to sacrifice and make sure we have fiscal responsibility in this \ncountry.\n  Based on last year's budget, I am afraid it is not going to be any \nbetter. Based on the fact that Senator Reid says he doesn't expect we \nwill finish the appropriations process until after the November \nelections, I don't sense any commitment to do better than the \nRepublicans did when they had the majority. Certainly, this year, their \nperformance was worse. This past year, it was worse, and it doesn't \nlook as if it will be better in the future.\n  I thank the Chair for this opportunity to share my concerns. I hope \nwe can be frank about these matters because the majority party knows it \nhas a very serious responsibility when it submits a budget. We knew it \nwhen we had the majority. I sat on the Budget Committee. Senator Conrad \nand his colleagues know they have that responsibility. They also know \nthey have the votes to pass this. Therefore, there can be no excuses. \nThere is nowhere to hide. Are you going to do anything about \nentitlements? Are you going to guarantee tax cuts? Are you going to \nsubmit a budget that projects lower spending or one that is filled with \ngimmicks to hide even more spending increases? It is a big deal. We \nwill be talking about this for some weeks. I hope our colleagues will \nfocus on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n                     FISA Modernization Legislation\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, during a debate about strategy on how to \ndefeat al-Qaida, goal No. 1 should be figuring out their plans. What \nare their tactics and targets? How do we do this? We use our \ntechnological advantages to get this information. That is what the FISA \nmodernization bill allows us to do.\n  The Congress has been working on FISA modernization since April \n2007--over 300 days ago. But I guess 300 days is not enough time for a \nbill of this magnitude, right? But wait, the Constitution of the United \nStates has written in only about 115 days, and that included travel \ntime on horseback for the Founding Fathers. So the entire Constitution \nof the United States was written in one-third of the time we have spent \non FISA modernization.\n  Congress has plenty of time and has had plenty of time to debate this \nissue. Given that the executive strategy in this instance is paramount, \nthe next President's decision, whoever that may be, will be critical. \nLike many people, I have watched many of the Presidential debates. One \nthing amazes me: Out of at least 32 debates and forums, the candidates \nhave yet to receive one question on FISA, the most important piece of \nlegislation certainly in the last number of years and certainly in this \nCongress. There has not been not one question on the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act and what we are trying to do here. So we \nare continuing to talk about the most important bill in the entire \n110th Congress, which is apparently not important enough to come up \nduring over 50 hours of discussion with our next Commander in Chief.\n  I did hear an interesting comment during the most recent debate. A \ndecision to utilize military strikes to kill al-Qaida in Pakistan was \nseemingly supported. That is the irony of this situation. It is OK if \nwe kill terrorists overseas with missiles, but we cannot listen to the \nphone calls of new terrorists without demonstrating ``probable \ncause.'' We have to ask what probable cause is and why it exists at \nall. That will tell us to whom it belongs. Probable cause is a check on \nGovernment power rooted in the due process guaranteed by the \nConstitution. Who may claim such due process protection under the \nConstitution of the United States? U.S. citizens, not foreign citizens \noverseas.\n\n  We are constantly hearing from the leadership in Congress about the \nneed to ``bring people together.'' Yet, at every turn, they seem to be \nwilling to set aside bipartisanship in favor of the preferred \npolicies--in favor of preferred policies of extreme political \norganizations. If Democrats really want to change the tone in \nWashington, they are going to have to, at some point, say no to the \nmore radical elements of their base.\n  With the current stalemate on FISA modernization legislation, we have \nseen both political parties blaming each other for the delay. We have \nheard notions that we are not in danger due to the lapse of the Protect \nAmerica Act. While our opinions on this issue will remain in bitter \ndisagreement, the solution to these problems is quite easy. In fact, it \nshould take about 15 minutes to solve this problem. Here is the answer, \nand it is just four words: Let the House vote. That is it. It doesn't \ntake a genius to come up with a solution. All of the disputes will go \naway, and the bipartisan majority of the House will approve the bill if \ngiven a chance to do so. Is this a novel concept? The House of \nRepresentatives has been voting on bills since 1789--over 219 years \nago. Will we ever be in a situation as complicated as this again, where \nthe solution to every problem is allowing our elected officials to \nvote?\n\n[[Page S1412]]\n\n  Back on December 17, on this very floor, I asked one of my Democratic \ncolleagues if he agreed with me that should the FISA bill pass, it \nwould be one of the best examples of bipartisanship in the whole 110th \nCongress and maybe in the history of this body. He agreed with this \nnotion. Months later, this worthy goal came to fruition in the Senate.\n  As we all know, the Senate approved a FISA modernization bill by a \nbipartisan supermajority vote, a veto-proof margin. Senators from both \nsides of the aisle engaged in lengthy and informative debate and came \ntogether to pass a bill that met the goals of modernizing FISA.\n  This rare demonstration of unity came to a crashing halt on February \n14. Rather than allow a bipartisan majority of the House to vote on and \npass this bill, the House leadership refused to allow a vote on this \nbill. The House spent its last legislative day, before their weeklong \nrecess period, debating and voting on a contempt resolution to further \na partisan fishing expedition that has led to no credible evidence of \nwrongdoing. House Democrats had been sitting on these resolutions since \nJuly, for over 201 days. Yet they determined that they were so \nimportant that they superseded the needs of our intelligence community \nand the needs of protecting the American public.\n  So a bipartisan majority of the House was ready and eager to vote on \nthis bill and was prohibited from voting on this bill. While numerous \nlawmakers stated they would stay in Washington--including me--for as \nlong as it took to get this bill passed, the leadership from the House \nforced them to go on vacation. So they were prohibited from voting on a \nbipartisan bill to protect our country but were mandated to take a \nrecess period.\n  You want to stay and vote on this bill? Too bad. We would rather you \ntake some time off. Go back to your districts and take a break. Don't \nworry about our intelligence community. They have all the tools they \nneed. That is what the House Members heard. These Representatives did \nnot need to be patronized; they needed to be given a chance to vote.\n  The Attorney General, the chief law enforcement official of the \nUnited States, and the Director of National Intelligence, the person \nwho is responsible for our intelligence in this country, say that the \nlapse of the Protect America Act caused us to miss information. These \nofficials have more institutional knowledge on this topic than anyone \nin either body, and they dispute the notions that ``the intelligence \ncommunity has everything it needs.'' With all due respect to all of us \nwho serve as politicians, I am going to trust in the expertise of the \nAttorney General and DNI over the assurances of politicians in an \nelection year.\n  So why doesn't the House leadership allow a vote on this bill? Could \nit be because they know it will pass, which it would? But we cannot \nhave that. Heaven forbid, democracy would be free to run its course.\n  So rather than vote on this bill, we are hearing that the House \nleadership wants to conference this bill. Conferences are about \nresolving disagreements between the Chambers. But remember, a \nbipartisan majority from both Chambers has no disagreements on this \nbill. There are no disagreements to resolve between the majority of the \nSenate and the House. So a conference is entirely inappropriate in this \nsituation.\n  I have also heard an argument that the House needs more time to \nreview the immunity provision--the immunity that would protect these \ncompanies that patriotically cooperated with us in collecting the \ninformation that protected American citizens, which are now being sued \nin 40 different lawsuits for hundreds of billions of dollars. I want to \nmake sure everybody is perfectly aware that the immunity provision has \nbeen publicly available and unaltered for 133 days. It has not been \nhidden. It has been available to everybody in Congress. It has been \navailable to the world on the Web site of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. It only takes about 3 minutes to read it. It should not take \n133 days to analyze it, while putting our American public at risk.\n  I am also amazed at the false descriptions floating around about the \nterrorist surveillance program, TSP, which is the program the President \ndescribed on December 17, 2005, during a radio address. We have all \nheard the terms: the warrantless wiretapping, domestic spying, or \neavesdropping bill. The list goes on. Let's look at what the President \nactually said during his radio address on December 17, 2005:\n\n       In the weeks following the terrorist attacks on our Nation, \n     I authorized the National Security Agency, consistent with \n     U.S. law and the Constitution, to intercept the international \n     communications of people with known links to al-Qaida and \n     related terrorist organizations. Before we intercept these \n     communications, the Government must have information that \n     establishes a clear link to these terrorist networks.\n\n  I don't see anything in this statement about domestic spying. I \nthought the definition of the word domestic was pretty clear. If the \nprogram intercepted communications in which at least one party was \noverseas, not to mention a member of al-Qaida, then it seems fairly \nobvious that the calls were not domestic.\n  Look at this chart. Is this such a hard concept to grasp? The last \ntime I flew overseas, I didn't fly on a domestic flight, I flew on an \ninternational flight. And there is a big difference between domestic \ncalls and international calls. My last phone bill showed a big \ndifference between the price of the two. Is it a domestic call when a \nforeign terrorist calls someone in our country or someone in our \ncountry involved in terrorism calls a terrorist in a foreign country?\n  ``Domestic spying'' may sound catchy and mysterious, but it is a \ncompletely inaccurate way to describe the terrorist surveillance \nprogram or the FISA modernization bill. Why don't we describe them as \nwe should: international spying. Isn't that a more accurate \ndescription? I guess accurate descriptions take a back seat to terms \nwhich incite fear and distrust in our Government.\n  What about ``warrantless wiretapping,'' doesn't this sound like a bad \nthing? Perhaps we should read the fourth amendment to the Constitution. \nNotice that not all searches require a warrant. Every member of the \npublic who is up in the galleries watching us today went through a \nwarrantless search to get into this building. Every time an American \ncomes into the United States at the border, they go through a highly \nintrusive warrantless search. Every time an American gets on a plane, \nthey go through a warrantless search. Every time an American goes to \nsee a rally or speech from the President of the United States, thus \nexercising their first amendment rights, they go through a warrantless \nsearch. And there is good reason for it.\n  Remember, foreign citizens overseas receive no protection from the \nfourth amendment. So ``warrantless wiretapping'' in this instance is \nperfectly constitutional. In addition, look at what the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court, the highest court to look into this \nissue, previously said. This is 310 F3rd 717, FISA Court of Review in \n2002. It is called In re: Sealed Case:\n\n       The Truong court, as did all the other courts to have \n     decided the issue, held that the President did have inherent \n     authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign \n     intelligence information. . . .We take for granted that the \n     President does have that authority and, assuming that is so, \n     FISA could not encroach on the President's constitutional \n     power.\n\n  That is one of the few formal cases out of the FISA Court.\n  Given the staggering amount of misinformation in the public, how many \npeople have incorrectly stated that the Government can listen to all of \ntheir phone calls, read all of their e-mails, spy on American families \noverseas, even spy on our own military members overseas? How many of \nthese false representations have been made by my colleagues and by \nothers?\n  These accusations are completely false and are meant to incite fear \nof nonpolitical intelligence analysts who serve regardless of whom the \nPresident is. Isn't that the real fear mongering? Terrorists killed \n3,000 Americans on September 11 and killed hundreds of other people in \nMadrid, London, Bali, and Kenya. They have sworn to kill more. They \nhave said that ``the streets of America shall run red with blood, \ncasualties will be too many to count, and the next wave of attacks may \ncome at any moment.''\n  These terrorists recently called for the President of the United \nStates to\n\n[[Page S1413]]\n\nbe ``received not with roses and applause, but with bombs and booby \ntraps'' during a recent Presidential trip overseas. So they wish death \non all Americans and they threaten the assassination of the President \nof the United States. Yet if we acknowledge their threats, if we try to \nprepare for these attacks, we are accused of the politics of fear. But \nthere is no problem when numerous individuals completely misrepresent \nhow our Government protects our country. Nobody is calling these \ntactics ``fear mongering,'' so is it perfectly acceptable to question \nthe integrity of thousands of Americans who have taken an oath to \ndefend the Constitution of the United States and who have dedicated \ntheir lives to preventing our great Nation from suffering these \nterrorist attacks?\n  I am sorry to break it to people, but our intelligence analysts have \nmore important things to do than look at someone's eBay transactions \nand listen to phone calls from the Jones family on their family \nvacation in Italy. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by these conspiracy \ntheories, given the vocal lunacy expounded by those who think the \nSeptember 11 attacks were an ``inside job.''\n  The FISA modernization bill should be the best example of how \nmeaningful legislation becomes enacted. This bill passed by a veto-\nproof majority in the Senate. It came out of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, on which I serve, 13 to 2. It was \nbipartisan. It is supported by the intelligence community, and it has \nthe support of the executive branch. Isn't this about as good as it \ngets? When a bill has support from all these elements, there is no \nexcuse for it being held up.\n  The House leadership has indicated it intends to unveil a \n``compromise'' FISA bill. Apparently, House Democrats are using an \nunconventional definition of the word ``compromise.'' What would they \ncall the Senate bill? We went through months of hearings in the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence asking about pros and cons, asked \nthousand of questions, met with the top people in all fields, were read \ninto the program, went out to the National Security Agency to look at \nthese programs. What do they call the Senate bill?\n  No one, not the administration or anyone in the Senate, got \neverything they wanted with the Senate bill. It is a compromise. Is it \neverything I want? No. Are there things in there I wish we did not put \nin there? Yes. But it is a compromise, and I voted for it.\n  All sides had to make concessions before a final solution was reached \n13 to 2 in the committee and it was bipartisan, 68 to 29 in the \nSenate--bipartisan. That is precisely what the compromise is all about. \nI simply do not follow the logic of rejecting a bipartisan result, \nwhich is what we already have, in favor of a more partisan solution and \ncalling it a ``compromise.'' I can only assume that when House \nDemocrats say ``compromise,'' they mean something else--capitulation.\n  I don't intend to capitulate on this issue. I hope the \nRepresentatives in the House who share my view will weigh in with the \nHouse leadership and other Democrats who have been holding this up to \nthe detriment of the citizens of the United States of America. I have \nbeen to this floor countless times to discuss FISA modernization, and I \nwill continue to do so. I will continue to fight for this cause because \nit is the right thing to do and especially since so many in both \nparties have come together to support the Senate bill and would support \nit in the House if the chance was given.\n  Madam President, we are still in the month of February. We should be \ndoing our work here in the Senate. We should be working toward \nlegitimate, bipartisan agreements on the issues that matter most to \nAmericans.\n  That is what our constituents sent us here to do. Of course, in an \nelection year, particularly a Presidential election year, we \nunfortunately slide into a silly season where very little gets done.\n  Instead of listening to each other and trying to come up with \ncommonsense solutions, there is a temptation to use the Senate as an \narena to make one's opponents look bad.\n  Usually the flowers of that silly season do not bloom until the \nsummer. We are still in the month of February! We need to be getting \nthe work of the American people done. We are in a time of legitimate \neconomic distress.\n  There are very different ideas about how to deal with this economic \nslowdown. There is nothing wrong with this difference of opinion. The \nmajority seems to think that the principal way to deal with an economic \nchallenge is to spend money. To be clearer, they think that the answer \nis to spend taxpayer money. And make no mistake, if there is not enough \ntaxpayer money to go around, the solution to an economic slowdown for \nthe majority is to raise taxes. Conservatives have a slightly different \nunderstanding of what it takes to get the economy running again.\n  When the companies that Americans work for are loathe to invest, it \nhurts employees. When they don't invest, these companies do not create \njobs. And when the economy is weak, it makes it more difficult for an \nentrepreneurial American to take the risks necessary and obtain the \ncredit to start new businesses that will employ the people in his \ncommunity.\n  So conservatives think we should do more to encourage business \ninvestment and capital formation. Both sides want to do what they can \nto get the economy humming. And both sides think there are different \nways to accomplish this. Sounds like an opportunity for compromise to \nme!\n  But I think that some of my colleagues are more interested in an \nissue than a solution. We should not elevate politics above solutions. \nCongress needs to come together. Conservatives believe that their \npolicies will work effectively to help the economy and the families \nthat depend on good jobs and economic growth. We are not asking much.\n  We are simply asking that our ideas be taken seriously. And we should \nbe. Even in the most liberal of States, Members of this body have many \nconservative constituents. Is it really too much to ask that those \nideas be given an opportunity for debate on the Senate floor? It \nshouldn't be.\n  I am not sure, however, that the majority is interested in that \ndebate. Twice this week, Senate minority voted to proceed to bills \noffered by the majority leader and my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator \nFeingold. Yet after voting to proceed to those bills, we were accused \nof blocking debate on the bills we helped to bring to the floor. That \nreally is a classic.\n  The majority casts 21 votes against proceeding to a bill the majority \nleader himself wanted to proceed to debate. The minority casts the \nvotes to allow that debate. And then the minority stands accused of \ndelay.\n  A similar pattern has occurred with this housing bill. The majority \nrushed a bill to the floor. They bypassed the relevant committees. They \nbypassed the regular order.\n  In their haste, they made a small mistake with the legislation. Well, \nmaybe it was not that small. The majority intended to spend $2 billion \non counseling for distressed homeowners. They accidentally made this a \n$200 billion program; $200 billion.\n  I understand that this is a mistake. But it is a mistake born of a \ncavalier approach to legislating. We could have had a consensus bill.\n  Instead, the majority never consulted with the minority as this bill \nwas being put together. In our view, we have a much better plan. It \nincludes titles that would address taxes, capital markets, housing, and \ntort reform. We would keep taxes low.\n  We would extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, preventing a looming tax \nhike, and making sure that working families do not get socked with \nthousands of dollars in extra taxes when these tax cuts expire in 2010.\n  We would increase the value of homes and prevent an unfair tax on \ntheir sale. We would help to keep jobs at home by encouraging job \ncreation.\n  We would help prevent foreclosures by providing credit stability.\n  We would maintain the value and security of neighborhoods by \nencouraging the speedy sale and renovation of foreclosed homes.\n  And we would protect small businesses from the threat of excessive \nand frivolous lawsuits.\n  And let me tell you, when I talk to businesses, businesses that are \nsubject to incessant litigation, tort reform is at the top of the list \nof things we have to do. It hurts companies large and small, and we \nneed to do something about it.\n\n[[Page S1414]]\n\n  I think if we had been invited to the table to discuss this bill, had \nbeen a party to the negotiation, or even been allowed to offer \namendments, we could have worked something out on this bill.\n  We could have found common ground. I know that is what the American \npeople want. We have been hearing a lot about common ground these days.\n  Whenever I turn on the television, I hear someone telling us about \nthe need to change our ways in Washington. I hear about the need to \nbring people together. Well, we certainly have our opportunities.\n  But I feel that they are being missed. We do not have to be consumed \nby partisanship. In 2005 and 2006, Congress accomplished a number of \nserious policy reforms. We passed bankruptcy reform, class action \nreform, energy and highway bills, CAFTA and other trade bills, and the \nmost significant reforms of pension laws in 30 years.\n  And those bills only became law because of debate, negotiation, and \ncompromise. Through amendments, the regular order, and serious debate, \nthe Senate was able to pass consensus legislation. And today? It is not \nquite the same.\n  Take it or leave it is not the stuff of statesmanship. It is the \nstuff of the sandlot. Leadership demands a willingness to listen to \nboth sides. It requires compromise and openness to other ideas. The \nAmerican people have made their position clear. They are tired of \nbusiness as usual.\n  In the coming months, I hope to work with the majority on the issues \nof importance to the American people. The last week has not been very \npromising. Nonetheless, my hope is that Congress will be able to \naccomplish important reforms for the American people even in this \nelection year.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I have spoken twice on energy, once \ntoday and once yesterday.\n  I have come to add a few more thoughts to my previous remarks on \nenergy. I spoke yesterday of the recent Energy bills that Congress has \npassed, and the growing costs of our dependence on foreign oil. This \nmorning, I urged my colleagues to reach agreement on a comprehensive \nenergy policy that uses our own resources to meet our energy needs.\n  Of all the issues we have to consider in this Congress, some may \nwonder why I have focused on energy three times in the past 2 days. The \nanswer is simple: it is February 29. Oil is going for nearly $102 per \nbarrel, and gas prices are up 20 cents in the past 2 weeks alone. The \nstart of the summer driving season is still 3 months away, but \nconsumers are already being squeezed by near-record energy prices. More \nthan that, this should be a story we talk about in both good and bad \ntimes, because our dependence is growing great and it is not matched by \nour policy.\n  We must rethink our policies to match the modern challenges we face. \nAs I have indicated, our Nation has a great quantity of oil locked up \noff of our coasts, beneath our permafrost, and within our shale. These \nareas can provide a stable supply of energy as we transition to \nalternative fuels. But oil is not the only resource that can be \ndeveloped at home and depended upon to meet our energy needs. We are \nalso fortunate to have vast reserves of coal: some 270 billion \nrecoverable tons, which would last for 240 years at the current rate of \nconsumption. That coal can be turned into fuels that help meet our \ntransportation, manufacturing, and electric power needs.\n  Because of the emissions that result when coal is converted to \nenergy, we will need cleaner methods to ensure the protection of our \nenvironment. To me, this is an opportunity. Our Nation has a proud \nheritage of innovation, and there is no reason to believe this strong \nrecord will not continue in the future. As our most abundant and \naffordable fossil resource, we cannot simply cross coal off the list. \nAny serious effort to strengthen our energy security must include coal.\n  One of our best prospects is to advance the development of coal-to-\nliquid fuels. As an alternative to oil, coal-to-liquid fuels have many \nmerits: it will reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, \nparticulate matter, and other pollutants when compared to conventional \nfuels. Coal-to-liquid fuels have been commercially demonstrated in \nother countries, can be moved through existing pipelines, and can be \nused in existing vehicles. Commercialization of this resource will \ncreate investment in rural communities, thousands of good-paying jobs, \nand cheaper energy for American consumers. Despite this potential, two \namendments to advance this type of fuel were defeated on party-line \nvotes in the most recent energy debate.\n  Future generations of automobiles will be powered by the advanced \nbattery. The Government must redouble its efforts to ensure the \nresearch, development, and deployment of these technologies. Reliable \nand rechargeable batteries will be critical to the success of hybrid \nvehicles, which hold tremendous promise for reducing the amount of oil \nconsumed in the transportation sector.\n  The policies I have spoken of these past 2 days are just a few of the \noptions available to us. We should also increase the number of flex-\nfuel vehicles on the road, and the number of stations that offer \nblended fuels. We should offer incentives to existing refineries, and \nencourage the expedited construction of new ones, to reduce the amount \nof gasoline we import. We continue to lament that while our refinery \ncapacity has improved at existing sites, we have not built a new \nrefinery in 30 years. Again, these are just a sampling of the policy \noptions available to the Congress as we seek to chart a more \nresponsible path forward.\n  As a member of the Senate Energy Committee for nearly 30 years, and \nits chair or ranking member for much of the past decade, I obviously \nhave strong views on the energy policies that will best serve our \nNation. But I also recognize that we must work together to find common \nground. We did this in the past on energy policy, and we can do it \nagain.\n  The costs of our dependence on foreign oil are enormous and \nincreasing. The consequences of removing money from our economy, and \nsending it to often-volatile oil-producing nations, are becoming clear. \nFew positives will ever be drawn from this arrangement.\n  When we import oil, we export our jobs and we export our wealth. We \nstrengthen regimes that are intent on undermining our interests, \nopposed to the spread of democracy, and unwilling to extend some of the \nmost basic freedoms to their own people. When we import oil, we \nthreaten our national security and our economic strength. As we look \nahead, we must remember that for today and the foreseeable future, we \nneed oil. We should put our American energy resources to use.\n  This is my final year in the Senate. It is a privilege and an honor \nto serve the people of New Mexico and this country. But it is not just \nthe end of my time in the Senate that approaches; the time to reduce \nour growing dependence on foreign oil is also upon us.\n  It is my sincere hope that we will use this year and the future to \nwork together on policies that will move us toward our energy security \ngoals. This will require us to set aside our differences and make \ndifficult decisions. It will require us to come to the table with open \nminds and positive intentions. In an era defined by its bitter \npartisanship, this will not be easy. But given the stakesour \nnational security, our economic strength, and our standing in the \nworldthat is exactly what we must do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before my distinguished friend leaves the \nfloor, let me say publicly what I have said privately to my friend, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New Mexico. He has been a great \nSenator. He and I have worked together on issues that only we know \nabout because of the sensitive nature of what we did, dealing with the \nnuclear stockpile we have.\n\n[[Page S1415]]\n\n  As the chairman and ranking member of the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee on Appropriations, we worked for years as chairman, as \nranking member, however the majority in the Senate was, and I think we \nhave done a good job so that our nuclear stockpile is safe and \nreliable. I hope those who follow us recognize how sensitive and \nimportant this is.\n  We also worked on other issues with our great national laboratories, \ntwo of which are located in New Mexico. I think the Senator and I have \ndone some good work to protect basic science which so much of it comes \nfrom these laboratories, and, of course, Livermore in California. We \nhave done some of the great experimental work at the Nevada test site.\n  I personally look forward to working with this wonderful Senator for \nthe next 10 months, but also we will miss him a lot. I hope we are able \nto pick up another vote, and we will have one soon, on allowing this \ncountry to go to more alternative energy. We missed by one the ability \nto do that. There was some concern about what some of the offsets were.\n  So I hope my friend, with all the persuasive powers he has among my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, will work to see what we can \ndo to come up with that vote. Even though I am not a big fan of coal, I \nunderstand the long-time work this man has done in trying to develop \nsome other way of lessening our dependence on foreign oil.\n  In short, I express my friendship and appreciation to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico. I look forward to the next 10 months and hopefully in \nthe next few weeks of working something out so we can get long-term tax \ncredits for renewable energy which will work in New Mexico and Nevada.\n  We have great natural resources which are not being used because of \nthe inability of the financial world to invest because they need the \nincentives for long-term tax credits to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before we leave, Madam President, I say to the \ndistinguished majority leader that I appreciate his kind, generous \nremarks.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I would say this: They were not generous \nenough. This man deserves far more than that. I hope someday, in the \nnext few months, someone asks me in detail, because there should be a \nhistorical account of this man's service in the Senate. I want to tell \nthem things that only he and I know that should be known to the public. \nHe is a real dedicated public servant.\n  Anyway, that is enough of that, but there will be more I will say \nabout Senator Domenici at a later time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I also want to make a comment \nregarding something the leader said when he was discussing my speech he \nheard.\n  I want to say to the Senator, you caught the end of 2 days of \nspeaking on energy, and you heard: coal. I want you to know I had \nspoken of many other sources of energy before that. But I thought in \nrecapping what we own, you must include coal in that. That is why you \nheard it there, not to give it special emphasis beyond which it is \nentitled.\n  Mr. REID. I would briefly say, Madam President, I, with Senator \nDomenici, have been involved in producing huge amounts of money for \nresearch into clean coal.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. REID. I think we should continue that research. Right now I am \ntotally unsatisfied as to where we are with clean coal technology. But \nwe should spend more money because we have great resources, and maybe \nsomeday we can work it out so it will work.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                                  FISA\n\n  Mr. REID. Democrats and Republicans are united in our resolve to \nfight terrorism. Democrats, no less than Republicans, want to provide \nour intelligence professionals with the tools they need while \nprotecting the privacy of law-abiding Americans.\n  Both the House and the Senate have passed bills to strengthen the \n1978 FISA law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The House \npassed its bill in November. We passed our bill a couple of weeks ago.\n  Since Senate passage, the chairmen of the Senate and House Judiciary \nand Intelligence Committees have been working very hard to resolve \ndifferences between the two bills. Democratic staff have been meeting \nand exchanging ideas and proposed language. But, I am sorry to say, the \nRepublicans have instructed their staffs not to participate in those \nnegotiations. Yesterday, the President held yet another of his \nincreasingly belligerent news conferences demanding the House of \nRepresentatives pass the Senate's FISA bill. He does not want to \nnegotiate, he does want any negotiation between the House and the \nSenate. He has decreed such. He simply wants the House to bend to his \nwill and pass the bill he prefers without changing a single word.\n  The President said there is a majority in the House that will pass \nthe Senate bill. That may or may not be true. But what we do know for a \nfact is there was a majority in the House for the bill they passed last \nNovember. That is why we need negotiations. We would much prefer it be \nnegotiated on a bipartisan basis, not just being done with Democrats.\n  A new FISA law that passed with broad bipartisan support of both \nHouses would be good. A new FISA law that passed with broad bipartisan \nsupport in both Houses would provide greater certainty to the \nintelligence community and make us a stronger nation.\n  There are some hopeful signs that we can do this. It may be possible. \nYesterday, House and Senate Members finally from both sides of the \naisle had a productive meeting with the general counsel to the Director \nof National Intelligence.\n  I urge President Bush to engage in a more constructive manner in this \neffort to pass a new FISA bill to allow and encourage bipartisan \nnegotiations. As we move forward, there is no reason not to extend the \nPATRIOT Act to ensure there are no gaps in our intelligence-gathering \ncapabilities.\n  Even Admiral McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence, has \ntestified that such an extension would be valuable. But the President \nthreatens to veto an extension and my Republican colleagues continue \ninexplicably to oppose it. The President asked us to extend it. He is \nthe reason we have not extended it. I urge the President to withdraw \nhis opposition.\n  I will now ask unanimous consent to take up and pass S. 2664, a bill \nthat would extend the PATRIOT Act for 30 days, and make the extension \neffective as of February 15 to ensure there are no adverse legal \nconsequences from the President's decision to let the law expire.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2664\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 583, S. 2664, which is a 30-day extension of the \nProtect America Act; further, that the bill be read a third time and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table and there be \nno intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, while Democrats and Republicans joined \nlast month to pass the economic stimulus package, we agreed that it was \nan important first step in addressing our country's economic challenge, \nbut we agreed it was only a first step, that we must do more to help \nAmerica.\n  All Americans are struggling. We must do more to help Americans \nstruggling to make ends meet. Yesterday Democrats tried to take that \nnext step. We brought to the floor a genuine effort to help families \nand neighborhoods weather the growing housing crisis. But Republicans \nin the Senate blocked our legislation to help struggling American \nfamilies, as they have done time and again on other important \nlegislation.\n  Why did they choose obstruction over American families at risk to \nlose their homes? Senator Alexander, my friend from Tennessee, and a \nfew others, said here on the floor that all Republicans wanted was an \nopportunity to offer amendments.\n  Anyone following this debate would know my Republican colleague was \ngiven some very bad information or that his or their staffs watched \nnone of the floor debate on this issue.\n\n[[Page S1416]]\n\n  I have said numerous times, both publicly and privately, that both \nsides want to offer amendments; that is, Democrats and Republicans, and \nboth sides should have that opportunity. I have said that privately to \nthe Republican leader, and publicly here on the floor, and in many \npress events.\n  I told, in fact, Senator McConnell more than a week ago that we \nintended to allow both Democrats and Republicans to offer amendments. I \nhave made that commitment on this issue several times on the floor. My \nwords are available for anyone to review in the Congressional Record.\n  There is only one reason why Republicans were not able to offer \namendments. They refused to let us move procedurally to the legislative \nposture where amendments could be offered. We have here before us the \nRepublican filibuster chart. You will note that we keep changing the \nnumbers because they keep coming; 72 Republican filibusters, 72.\n  Last year, in less than 1 year, the Republican minority broke all \nrecords for a 2-year Congress in the number of filibusters. And we have \nanother on the housing stimulus package.\n  The Republicans' decision to deny the ability to even take up this \nbill deprived both sides of the opportunities to offer a single \namendment. As I said yesterday, why would you stop us from going to the \nbill? I have said: You can offer amendments. Then, if you do not like \nwhat happens, you still have 49; it only takes 41 of you to stop us \nfrom doing anything.\n  Why would you stop us? They are stopping us because they want to slow \nthings down. That is the whole purpose. They do not want this minority \nto allow us to do something. I guess the direction is coming directly \nfrom Bush and Cheney.\n  My colleagues can talk all they want about amendments, but the record \nbetrays the rhetoric. Yesterday's Republican press conference was \nbefore that vote. The Republicans held a press conference saying what \nit is that should be done with the housing problems.\n  Now, listen to this: As reported in the New York Times and other \nplaces, here is their solution, according to a public press conference \nthey held before the vote yesterday to stop us from going forward.\n  Here is what they want to do: tort reform. That is going to really \nhelp the housing crisis, tort reform. The other thing they want to do \nis lower taxes. That is so Bush-Cheney that we look and we find that is \nwhy we are in the trouble we are today. When the President took office, \nthere was a surplus over the next 10 years of $7 trillion. That is \ngone. As indicated by Nobel Prize winning economist Stiglitz yesterday, \nthe war has and will cost us $3 trillion.\n  Instead of standing on the side of struggling families and at-risk \nhomeowners, Republicans in the Senate once again chose the side of Bush \nand Cheney, big banks, and big business. Republicans want us to \ncontinue to help those who contributed to the foreclosure debacle in \nthe first place. Yesterday's prevention of us going forward to \nlegislate was a victory for the people who are causing all the trouble \nto begin with. Who were the losers? Middle-class Americans, people \ntrying to stay in their homes. The Republican alternative housing plan \nis almost laughable.\n  The Presiding Officer is a lawyer. She has been to court a few times \nto prosecute people, knows what is going on on the civil side. Their \nsolution to the housing crisis is tort reform? How can they say that \nwith a straight face?\n  That is not me. Read about it. It is in today's press. And more tax \ncuts. Neither has anything to do with the housing crisis. The \nRepublican housing plan consists of tired programs from a dusty Bush-\nCheney playbook. Tort reform and Bush tax policy, neither have anything \nto do with housing. The housing plan Democrats proposed offers real \nsolutions to the crisis that families and neighborhoods are facing all \nacross the country.\n  Today I had another conversation with the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, one of the more senior Members of this body. I said: Senator \nDodd, if your counterpart, Dick Shelby, wants to work out anything on \nthis housing stimulus crisis, let's work it out. If there are \namendments they want to offer, let's take a look at the amendments. My \npeople want to offer amendments. They want to offer amendments. Let's \noffer some amendments. But tort reform? Cutting taxes?\n  The housing plan Democrats propose offers real solutions to the \ncrisis families and neighborhoods are facing all across America--\nMissouri, Nevada, New Mexico, all over. Our plan helps families keep \ntheir homes by increasing preforeclosure counseling funds. Our plan \nexpands refinancing opportunities for homeowners stuck in bad loans. \nOur program provides funds to help the highest need communities \npurchase and rehabilitate foreclosed properties. This is a proposal the \nPresident talked about in his State of the Union message and on which \nhe is now blocking us. We tried to get this in our previous stimulus \npackage, something the President talked about in his State of the Union \nAddress. No. I guess from the speech back to the White House someone \ntalked him out of it.\n  Our legislation helps families avoid foreclosure in the future by \nimproving loan disclosures and transparency during the original loan \nand refinancing process. Jack Reed of Rhode Island sponsored that \nprovision. Our legislation amends the Bankruptcy Code to allow home \nloans on primary residences to be modified, only in certain \ncircumstances with very strict guidelines.\n  If the Republicans and the President don't like that provision, offer \nan amendment to take it out. I have said that publicly. If you don't \nlike it, offer an amendment to take it out. Maybe you will get some \nDemocrats to join with you. I think that is a pretty good bet. But, no.\n  So I say to my Republican colleagues who talk about their desire to \nhelp, talk is so cheap. The American public deserves better than tort \nreform and extending Bush economic policies to handle the foreclosure \ncrisis now facing our country. Republicans have been able to hold on to \nthe status quo and block us from moving America forward because of our \nrazor-thin majority. For 10 months last year, it was 50 to 49 because \nTim Johnson was sick. He is back. He is at 100 percent. So the majority \nnow is 51 to 49. But that is still pretty narrow. The Republicans have \nbeen doing everything they can to maintain the status quo.\n  In addition to blocking our housing plan, we have had 71 other things \nthat they have blocked. Tax incentives for alternative energy, \nsomething as simple as allowing Medicare to negotiate for lower priced \ndrugs, they stopped us from doing that. A better economic stimulus \nbill, for example, to provide for the extension of unemployment \nbenefits, they stopped us on that. And time after time, they have \nstopped us from moving forward on changing what is going on in Iraq. A \nrazor-thin majority has allowed Republicans to block legislation with \nlittle effort because, remember, we need 60 to get anything done.\n  But I say to my Republican friends through the Chair to my friend, \none of the more senior Members of the Senate, my friend from New \nMexico, enjoy it while you can. The American people are seeing what is \ngoing on. They are seeing how you are maintaining the status quo. Enjoy \nit while you can because our majority, come November, is going to grow. \nSo continue to block because it is not going to be there forever. It is \nnot going to be there very long. Neighborhoods and families struggling \nmightily through the housing crisis can't wait until then.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to join us and reconsider, support a \nhousing plan that actually addresses housing--not tort reform, not \nlowering taxes--and eases the suffering of millions of American \nfamilies.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my friend is always looking out for me, \nand there is other work I have to do. I can't do it unless he is here, \nso I appreciate that very much.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have to stay here until it is done.\n  Mr. REID. He has to stay here until it is done. It will be real \nquick.\n\n[[Page S1417]]\n\n  I withdraw the pending motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HAYES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to honor a man well \nrespected throughout south central Kentucky, Gerald W. Hayes. Mr. Hayes \nhas faithfully served citizens in parts of south central Kentucky \nthrough his commitment to the Warren Rural Electric Cooperative \nCooperation, RECC, and its members for 40 years.\n  Hayes was born in humble circumstances in Simpson County under the \nroof of his grandmother's farmhouse. After 4 years in Butler County, \nthe Hayes family settled in Richardsville, located in Warren County. \nMr. Hayes attended Richardsville Elementary School and later, \nRichardsville High School, where he played point guard on the \nbasketball team.\n  As a promising young man, Mr. Hayes married his childhood sweetheart, \nKaren Smith, in December 1966. Two years later, on May 6, 1968, Mr. \nHayes began his work for Warren RECC.\n  He entered as a chainman and quickly exceeded expectations, being \npromoted to groundman in the same year. By 1969, Mr. Hayes had worked \nhis way up to apprentice lineman and acquired the nickname ``Squirrel'' \nfor his prodigious ability to climb poles. Mr. Hayes' physical talents \nwere not the only thing that went noticed at Warren RECC. His \nrelentless hard work and dedication earned him a promotion to line \nfrontman just 1 year later.\n  From here, Mr. Hayes continued to impress. His tenacity and loyalty \nled to his eventual promotion as successor to Wilmuth Deweese in 1990 \nas district manager of the Warren RECC Leitchfield office. In 2000, \nGerald accepted the position of president and CEO of Warren RECC, \ntaking on the responsibility of leading a company he had already \ncommitted to for 32 years.\n  The Warren RECC mission statement claims ``safety, integrity, value, \nand innovation'' as their guiding principles. Mr. Hayes has worked \nrelentlessly to see that these values are upheld and not forgotten. On \nMay 6, 2008, Gerald will honorably retire from his position as CEO, 40 \nyears to the day he began work as a chainman. Mr. Hayes's wife Karen, \ntheir four children Laura, Leah, Lisa and Landon, and their seven \ngrandchildren have proudly supported him throughout his career, and are \nthe foremost reason Mr. Hayes has been able to achieve so much.\n  Warren RECC has been providing quality electrical service to south \ncentral Kentucky residents for 70 years thanks to Mr. Hayes' constant \nand faithful service. He is a truly outstanding Kentuckian, and I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Gerald W. Hayes for his 40 \nyears of outstanding and loyal service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/29/senate-section/article/S1417-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PEACE CORPS WEEK\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, on March 1, 2008, the Peace Corps \ncelebrates its 47th year of operation. I congratulate all past and \npresent volunteers and staff members on 47 years of international \nservice and I welcome many more years to come.\n  Since 1961, the Peace Corps has served as a creative and productive \noutlet for U.S. citizens to spread some of the very best of our \nsociety--our desire to help those less fortunate than ourselves--around \nthe world. The year 2007 was no exception.\n  I am proud to recognize that the spirit of that movement is still \nstrong in America's youth, and our young at heart. Last year witnessed \nthe highest number of volunteers since 1970, with 8, 079 volunteers \nserving in 74 countries as of September 30th.\n  The Peace Corps is expanding in breadth as well as numbers, with a \nnew program opening in Cambodia. Also in 2007, Ethiopia welcomed the \nPeace Corps back after 8 years, making it the 10th nation that is also \na focus country for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to \nhost volunteers. In fiscal year 2007, over 1 million people affected by \nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic were assisted by Peace Corps volunteers and their \nactivities.\n  Constantly rotating their personnel, the Peace Corps is well \naccustomed to adapting to and taking advantage of new ideas, thinking, \nand technology. In the coming year PeaceWiki will launch, allowing \nvolunteers to share experiences and information with each other. They \nare even creating an online ``role-play'' game to teach middle \nschoolchildren about international service.\n  Many people mistakenly believe the Peace Corps is only about helping \nthose distantly removed from our daily life here in America. This could \nnot be further from the truth. Peace Corps volunteers return with a \nsense of accomplishment and the skill sets to that are often \ndesperately needed or in short supply here in the United States. \nVolunteers have had to learn approximately 250 different languages and \ndialects, not to mention how to handle different cultures with \ndexterity and ease. Twenty-two percent of all current volunteers serve \nin predominantly Muslim countries.\n  Returned volunteers' paths after service are as varied as their \ntours.

Madam President, this Chamber has recently been consumed \nby discussion of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obviously, we don't \nall agree on this issue. But there are a few things that I think we can \nagree on.\n  We can agree that the brave men and women serving their country \noverseas and at home are doing a superb job. We can agree that we have \nthe finest fighting force the world has ever known. And we can agree \nthat our veterans deserve benefits for the sacrifices they make and the \nrisks they take while serving their country.\n  For nearly 65 years, one of those benefits has been affordable access \nto a college education when they return from war. Commonly called the \nGI bill, this benefit is widely recognized as one of the best pieces of \nlegislation ever passed by Congress. Unfortunately, for many Oregonian \ncitizen soldiers this benefit has remained just out of reach.\n  Oregon has no large active duty military bases, and most Oregonians \nwho serve their country do so in the National Guard or Reserves. They \nstay trained and ready, and when our nation needs them they fight \nbravely. But when the fighting is over, they return to their \ncommunities and their jobs. And, all too often, their sacrifice is not \nrewarded the way it is for members of the active duty force.\n  An active duty soldiers can collect GI bill benefits even after they \nleave the military. However, if a member of the Oregon National Guard \nwants to attend Portland State University after fighting in Iraq for a \nyear, he or she must\n\n[[Page S1418]]\n\nstay in the Guard, risking another deployment, to collect his or her \nbenefits.\n  I believe that as a matter of basic fairness, soldiers that share the \nsame foxhole for the same length of time should get the same benefit. \nSome people say ``That's too logical for government.'' But fortunately, \nSenators Webb and Warner recognizing this basic inequity have written a \nbill to correct this problem, and generally modernize the GI bill.\n  I firmly believe education should be both available and affordable to \nall service men and women, and it for this reason that I am proud to \nstand today in support of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance \nAct.\n  Many servicemembers who volunteered to join the armed forces after \nSeptember 11, 2001, did so with the full knowledge that they would very \nlikely be called to serve in harm's way. Over 600,000 members of the \nNation's Guard and Reserve have been called to active duty. Since our \nnation came under attack, more than half of the Oregon National Guard \nhas deployed overseas. Oregon's deployment rate has ranked among the \nhighest per capita in the Nation. The National Guard has done much more \nthan they have historically been called upon to do, and at great \nsacrifice. This bill honors all who have served on active duty on or \nafter September 11, 2001, by expanding the educational benefits \nprovided under current law.\n  The cost of higher education has increased dramatically in recent \nyears. Over the past 5 years, the average cost of tuition has increased \n35 percent. Room and board costs have also risen on average over 35 \npercent. Many of our servicemembers have put their educational plans on \nhold while at war, and the rising cost of education has outpaced their \nability to pay. This has put them at a competitive disadvantage in a \nnation that has called them to service. This bill would put them back \non equal footing. Servicemembers, including activated Guard and Reserve \nmembers, who have served on active duty for at least 3 months would be \nentitled to benefits under this bill.\n  As with previous GI bills, this bill would secure tuition payments, a \nmonthly stipend to assist with living expenses, and a stipend for books \nand required educational expenses. This bill would go a step further, \nhowever. Instead of recognizing an activated reservist's longest \nconsecutive active service, this bill would recognize cumulative active \nservice. This is a crucial distinction that recognizes the way we \nemploy our forces today. Payments and stipends would be scaled up to \n100 percent. The benefits would be protected if a servicemember is \ndeployed or transferred. It would contribute to licensure and \ncertification testing and to some college-level correspondence courses. \nFinally, this bill would establish a new program in which colleges or \nuniversities may voluntarily agree to make up or reduce the difference \nbetween tuition costs and what the new benefits would provide. Under \nthis program, the benefit would match a school's additional \ncontribution dollar for dollar, up to 50 percent of the tuition \ndifference.\n  This bill would not just recognize and reward our service men and \nwomen for their sacrifices. It would create a meaningful retention and \nrecruiting tool for our active, Guard and Reserve forces, and it would \nprovide an investment in the future of our Nation by encouraging and \ncontributing to the kinds of education and training that lead to good \njobs, good pay, and economic stability. I am proud to cosponsor the \nPost-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act and encourage its \nimmediate passage so we can begin to repay the debt we owe to those who \nstand guard and defend our liberty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/29/senate-section/article/S1418-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   REMEMBERING W. LAIRD STABLER, JR.\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, today I wish to remember the \nHonorable W. Laird Stabler, Jr., a devoted public servant and a \ngentleman in the truest sense of the word. It is clear from the ways in \nwhich Delawareans from all political persuasions and all walks of life \nhave mourned his death this week that all that knew him understand this \npart. He was a decent man, a man who viewed public service as a duty \nand a trust.\n  I first met Laird in 1969, when he was the house majority Leader in \nDover and I was a young public defender. Despite only having served for \n3 years, he had already gained a reputation as a fair and thoughtful \nman. In 1970, when I first sought public office as a county councilman, \nthe people of Delaware recognized Laird's sterling character and \nintegrity by entrusting him with the office of attorney general. He \nlater served as U.S. attorney for the State of Delaware and, for 20 \nyears, as Delaware's Republican National Committeeman. It seems \nincredible today that a man who in Delaware was literally synonymous \nwith the Republican Party endeared himself to a generation of \nDemocrats.\n  No matter where he was in his career, or whom he was representing, \nevery decision Laird made was guided by his two most redeeming \nqualities: honor and integrity. As the British songwriter, Charles \nDibdin, wrote: ``If honour gives greatness, [he] was great as a king.''\n  Laird's exceptional sense for others earned him the respect of nearly \neveryone he knew, from U.S. Presidents to his neighbors. His fierce \ndevotion to his Scottish ancestry and his unending sense of humor were \nlegendary.\n  Laird was that rare breed of politician who could lead with very few \nwords. For all his commitment and knowledge, Laird led with a calm and \nsteady hand. The universal outpouring of mourning expressed by \nDelawareans from every corner of the State is a testimony to his quiet \ndignity and nobility.\n  As Shakespeare wrote in ``Hamlet:'' ``He was a man, take him for all \nin all, I shall not look upon his like again.''\n  Knowing Laird Stabler, I am certain he did not judge his life based \nupon how others viewed him or even his great contributions to the state \nand country. I believe Laird would prefer to be judged based on those \nhe loved most and those who loved him--his family. For me, it was hard \nto tell where Laird ended and where Peggy, his beautiful wife, began. \nAt least from my perspective, they seemed to be a matched pair in terms \nof effortless grace, genuine empathy and devotion to one another. They \nproduced a family that is a genuine reflection of their collective \nvirtues. I know Laird III the best, and he is every bit his family. \nTheir daughter Margaretta and son Ramsay are a genuine reflection of \ntheir parents' decency.\n  As a Delawarean and a Democrat, I feel privileged today to pay \ntribute to a Delawarean and a Republican whose life reflected what all \nof us strive to achieve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/29/senate-section/article/S1418-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1418-S1419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OIL PRICES\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, in April 2004, when American \nconsumers were paying $1.78 per gallon at the pump, I warned that \nenergy experts were ``predicting that the price of gas may rise to \n$2.50 or $3.00 per gallon.'' The administration did nothing. Last \nOctober, when American consumers were paying $2.87 per gallon at the \npump, I warned that ``oil may be on its way to over $100 a barrel.'' \nThe administration did nothing.\n  This week, oil reached a record $102 a barrel, and gas prices \naveraged $3.13 a gallon. How much will families in Vermont and across \nAmerica have to pay to heat their homes in this long winter and drive \nto work before the President takes action? At a news conference \nyesterday, the President was not even aware that some are predicting \nthat gas prices will hit $3.50 or even $4 a gallon by the spring.\n  Two facts are painfully clear: Gasoline prices have more than doubled \nsince the President took office, and the President has no plan to \nprotect consumers and our economy.\n  I have said this before, and I say it again today: The principal \ncause of the relentless increase in oil prices is not a natural supply \nissue, but market manipulation by the Organization of Petroleum \nExporting Countries, OPEC, an international cartel that limits the \nsupply of oil to keep fuel prices high. In January, the President's \nbest attempt to increase the supply of oil was to tell Saudi King \nAbdullah that ``paying more for gasoline hurts some American \nfamilies.'' Indeed it does, and I am pleased the administration \nacknowledges the effects of rising gas\n\n[[Page S1419]]\n\nprices on Americans. But Saudi Arabia is a founding member of OPEC, \nwhich has every incentive to limit output and keep prices artificially \nhigh. The futility of going to an OPEC member and pleading for it to \nraise output is obvious; the President's request that it increase \nsupply is simply bewildering.\n  OPEC is scheduled to meet next week to consider output levels. If \nsuch a meeting took place in almost any other context, the participants \nwould likely be arrested for an illegal conspiracy in restraint of \ntrade. Yet the President stood in front of the King of the largest \nparticipant in the oil cartel and asked for relief, instead of \ndemanding an end to this illegal activity.\n  If the administration truly acknowledges the impact artificially high \noil prices have on our Nation, it should join with me, Senator Kohl, \nand the 68 other Senators and 345 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives who have voted for NOPEC legislation, which would hold \naccountable certain oil-producing nations for their collusive behavior \nthat has artificially reduced the supply and inflated the price of \nfuel.\n  Instead of pleading for help, the next time the President of the \nUnited States meets with members of a cartel, the President should \nexplain that entities engaging in anticompetitive conduct that harms \nAmerican consumers can expect investigation and prosecution.\n  We cannot claim to be energy independent while we permit foreign \ngovernments to manipulate oil prices in an anticompetitive manner. It \nis wrong to let members of OPEC off the hook just because their \nanticompetitive practices come with the seal of approval of national \ngovernments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/29/senate-section/article/S1419-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 12.

DIRECTING THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO \n                   CONVENE A PUBLIC HEARING ON THE IMPACT OF \n                   EXCESSIVE LITIGATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) companies listed on United States securities exchanges \n     face the potential of extraordinary litigation costs that \n     companies listed abroad do not;\n       (2) securities class action settlements in the United \n     States for 2006 totaled $10,600,000,000 (not counting the \n     Enron-related settlements of approximately $7,100,000,000), \n     reflecting an increase of--\n       (A) 255 percent from 2004;\n       (B) more than 500 percent from 2000 (not including the \n     $3,100,000,000 Cendant settlement); and\n       (C) an astonishing 7,000 percent from 1995;\n       (3) while many such claims are legitimate, the sheer number \n     of cases and the staggering settlement amounts illustrate the \n     growing impact of the tort system on the United States \n     economy; and\n       (4) by contrast, such private shareholder class action \n     suits do not exist in the United Kingdom and other European \n     Union countries.\n       (b) Public Hearing.--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Chairman of the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission (in this section referred to as the \n     ``Commission'') shall convene a public hearing on the impact \n     of excessive litigation on the competitiveness of companies \n     listed on United States securities exchanges.\n\n     SEC. 203.

DIRECTING THE COMMISSION TO DEFINE ``SMALLER PUBLIC \n                   COMPANY'' TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY TO ISSUERS.\n\n       (a) Rule Revision Required.--Not later than 90 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission, pursuant \n     to its authority to amend rules of the Public Company \n     Accounting Oversight Board under section 107 of the Sarbanes-\n     Oxley Act of 2002, shall revise Auditing Standard No. 5 of \n     the Oversight Board, as in effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act, to include a definition of the term ``smaller \n     public company''.\n       (b) Definition of Smaller Public Company.--For purposes of \n     the rule revision required under subsection (a), the term \n     ``smaller public company'' shall mean an issuer for which an \n     annual report is required by section 13(a) or 15(d) of the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m, 78o(d)) \n     that--\n       (1) has a total market capitalization at the beginning of \n     the relevant reporting period of less than $700,000,000; and\n       (2) has total revenues for that reporting period of less \n     than $250,000,000.\n\n     SEC. 205. MUTUAL RECOGNITION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) there is an ongoing and pressing need to update the \n     United States financial regulatory structure to address the \n     increasingly global nature of the financial marketplace;\n       (2) existing regulations on cross-border activities are \n     outdated, and predate the revolution in communications \n     technology and the accompanying transformations in global \n     markets;\n       (3) existing regulations on cross-border activities are \n     complex, inefficient, not flexible enough to meet modern \n     market needs, and have the effect of chilling innovation and \n     imposing significant and unnecessary burdens on United States \n     investors;\n       (4) the Commission has delayed the timetable for Commission \n     action on key elements of reexamining and developing new \n     approaches to cross-border regulation, including much needed \n     reform to Commission rule 240.15a-6 of title 17, Code of \n     Federal Regulations, as in effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and potential recognition of foreign regulatory \n     regimes; and\n       (5) such delay postpones the regulatory changes needed to \n     eliminate unnecessary inefficiencies from international \n     financial transactions, and poses an increasingly significant \n     risk to the effective modernization and competitiveness of \n     United States capital markets.\n       (b) Modernization of Cross-Border Rules Applicable to \n     Brokers and Dealers.--\n       (1) In general.--The Commission shall, by rule, exempt any \n     foreign broker or dealer from the registration requirements \n     of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and any other \n     regulation applicable to registered or unregistered brokers \n     or dealers, to the extent that the foreign broker or dealer \n     effects transactions in securities with or for, or induces or \n     attempts to induce the purchase or sale of any security by--\n       (A) a qualified investor, as defined in section 3(a)(54) of \n     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;\n       (B) an investor that is a resident outside of the United \n     States; and\n       (C) any person described in Commission rule 240.15a-6(a)(4) \n     of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Definition of foreign broker or dealer.--As used in \n     this section, the term ``Foreign broker or dealer'' has the \n     same meaning as in section 240.15a-6(b)(3) of title 17, Code \n     of Federal Regulations, as in effect on the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (3) Regulatory authority.--The Commission may, upon a \n     finding that such action is necessary to protect United \n     States investors and consistent with this section, require a \n     foreign broker or dealer and its associated persons--\n       (A) to file documentation to establish that the foreign \n     broker or dealer and its associated persons are not subject \n     to statutory disqualification;\n       (B) to consent to service of process for any civil action \n     brought by or proceeding before the Commission or a self-\n     regulatory organization; and\n       (C) to agree to provide any information or documents that \n     the Commission reasonably requests, relating to effecting \n     transactions in securities with or for, or inducing or \n     attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any security by \n     persons described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of \n     paragraph (1), subject to limitations recognizing potential \n     conflicts with applicable foreign laws or regulations.\n       (4) Limitation on state action.--No State or political \n     subdivision thereof, or any self-regulatory organization, may \n     impose any registration, licensing, qualification, or other \n     legal requirement applicable to a foreign broker or dealer or \n     associated person thereof that is exempt from Commission \n     registration and regulation pursuant to this subsection, \n     except that the State or political subdivision thereof, or \n     such self-regulatory organization, may require the foreign \n     broker or dealer to provide copies of any documents filed \n     with the Commission, as described in this subsection.\n       (5) Timing of regulations.--Final regulations to carry out \n     this subsection shall be issued by the Commission, and such \n     regulations shall become effective, not later than 180 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Mutual Recognition Rules.--\n       (1) In general.--The Commission shall issue regulations \n     designed to provide for a framework for mutual recognition of \n     foreign regulatory regimes, so that foreign brokers, dealers, \n     and exchanges shall be regulated based on regulation in their \n     home country, and shall not be subject to duplicative \n     regulatory requirements, except to the extent that the \n     Commission finds necessary to protect United States \n     investors.\n       (2) Implementation.--The Commission shall adopt regulations \n     that provide an expeditious and transparent implementation \n     mechanism for this section, based on objective qualification \n     criteria and fixed timelines, that is designed to enable \n     foreign brokers, dealers, and exchanges to operate in the \n     United States and abroad based on regulation in their home \n     country.\n       (3) Limitation.--The regulations required by this \n     subsection--\n       (A) shall not require individualized review and approval \n     process for foreign brokers, dealers, and exchanges to be \n     eligible to rely on regulation in their home country, but \n     shall permit such brokers, dealers, and exchanges to make a \n     supplemental showing, on an individual exemptive basis, to \n     demonstrate their qualifications to do business with relevant \n     classes of investors; and\n       (B) may not create regulatory distinctions that limit \n     trading of portfolios containing both United States and non-\n     United States securities or impose other requirements that \n     are inconsistent with the business objectives of investors.\n       (4) Timing.--The Commission shall issue proposed \n     regulations to carry out this subsection not later than 90 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, and shall make \n     such regulations effective reasonably promptly thereafter.\n       (5) Exemption authority.--The Commission may, by rule, \n     provide for such exemptions to the provisions of this \n     subsection as the Commission determines appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 206. SUPPORTING THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION \n                   REFORM EFFORTS TO SPEED THE PROCESS OF \n                   RULEMAKING FOR SELF REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) United States capital markets are evolving quickly, and \n     United States equity exchanges face increasing competition, \n     both domestically and internationally;\n       (2) the Commission has recognized this transformation in \n     the competitive landscape and announced a project to redesign \n     the rule approval process for exchanges to make it more \n     efficient;\n       (3) rather than approving rule filings by self regulatory \n     organizations within the 35-day period prescribed under the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Commission has routinely \n     requested that exchanges agree to extend deadlines while \n     rules are weighed and considered within the agency, \n     potentially resulting in years before exchange rule filings \n     are finally approved;\n       (4) this antiquated and overly rigid regulatory model does \n     not recognize the new realities of international competition \n     among exchanges or new competition from innovative products \n     that compete with traditional asset classes; and\n       (5) competitors to United States equity exchanges operate \n     under different regulatory regimes, which can allow such \n     competitors to adapt to rapidly changing business \n     environments while United States exchanges are frozen in rule \n     approval process review by the Commission for months or \n     years.\n       (b) Rulemaking.--The Commission shall promulgate rules \n     under section 19 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to \n     speed the process of rulemaking to enable self-regulatory \n     organizations to respond to competitive inequities and better \n     meet customer needs. Such rules and other actions should be \n     completed not later than 180 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, and should predate or be coterminous with any \n     foreign exchange mutual recognition regime established under \n     this Act.\n\n     SEC. 207.

A bill to require the issuance of medals to recognize the \ndedication and valor of Native American code talkers; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing now will \naward a Congressional Commemorative Medal to Code Talkers of the \nChoctaw, Comanche, and other tribes in recognition of their service \nduring World Wars I and II. For five years I have worked to honor these \nheroes since first introducing the ``Code Talkers Recognition Act'' in \nMarch of 2003. Last year's measure gained passage in the Senate with 79 \ncosponsors and I look forward to the bill's success this session of \nCongress as well. Native American Code Talkers deserve nothing less.\n  Code Talkers from the Choctaw, Comanche and other tribes are true \nAmerican heroes whose accomplishments have too long been forgotten. \nThis legislation finally recognizes and honors a group of people who \nmade a real difference in the fight for freedom during World Wars I and \nII. Their service on the front lines helped propel the allied forces to \nvictory and saved countless lives in the process.\n  I look forward to working in coordination with Congressman Dan Boren \nin the House of Representatives and all of my colleagues in the U.S. \nSenate to ensure passage of this legislation and finally pass long-\noverdue recognition of Native American Code Talkers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2681\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Code Talkers Recognition Act \n     of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to require the issuance of \n     medals to express the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the service of Native American code talkers to the \n     United States deserves immediate recognition for dedication \n     and valor; and\n       (2) honoring Native American code talkers is long overdue.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) when the United States entered World War I, Native \n     Americans were not accorded the status of citizens of the \n     United States;\n       (2) without regard to that lack of citizenship, members of \n     Indian tribes and nations enlisted in the Armed Forces to \n     fight on behalf of the United States;\n       (3) the first reported use of Native American code talkers \n     was on October 17, 1918;\n       (4)(A) during World War I, Choctaw code talkers were the \n     first code talkers who played a role in United States \n     military operations by transmitting vital communications that \n     helped defeat German forces in Europe;\n       (B) because the language used by the Choctaw code talkers \n     in the transmission of information was not based on a \n     European language or on a mathematical progression, the \n     Germans were unable to understand any of the transmissions;\n       (C) this was the first time in modern warfare that such a \n     transmission of messages in a native language was used for \n     the purpose of confusing an enemy;\n       (5) on December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, \n     Hawaii, and Congress declared war the following day;\n       (6)(A) the Federal Government called on the Comanche Nation \n     to support the military effort during World War II by \n     recruiting and enlisting Comanche men to serve in the Army to \n     develop a secret code based on the Comanche language;\n       (B) the Army recruited approximately 50 Native Americans \n     for special native language communication assignments; and\n       (C) the Marines recruited several hundred Navajos for duty \n     in the Pacific region;\n       (7)(A) during World War II, the United States employed \n     Native American code talkers who developed secret means of \n     communication based on native languages and were critical to \n     winning the war; and\n       (B) to the frustration of the enemies of the United States, \n     the code developed by the Native American code talkers proved \n     to be unbreakable and was used extensively throughout the \n     European theater;\n       (8) in 2001, Congress and President Bush honored Navajo \n     code talkers with congressional gold medals for the \n     contributions of the code talkers to the United States Armed \n     Forces as radio operators during World War II;\n       (9) soldiers from the Assiniboine, Cherokee, Cheyenne, \n     Chippewa/Oneida, Choctaw, Comanche, Cree, Crow, Hopi, Kiowa, \n     Menominee, Meskwaki, Mississauga, Muscogee, Osage, Pawnee, \n     Sac and Fox, Seminole, and Sioux (Lakota and Dakota) Indian \n     tribes and nations also served as code talkers during World \n     War II;\n       (10) the heroic and dramatic contributions of Native \n     American code talkers were instrumental in driving back Axis \n     forces across the Pacific during World War II; and\n       (11) Congress should provide to all Native American code \n     talkers the recognition the code talkers deserve for the \n     contributions of the code talkers to United States victories \n     in World War I and World War II.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Buckley, Jr. was born on November 24, \n     1925, in New York City, the 6th of 10 children in a devoutly \n     Catholic family;\n       Whereas William Buckley studied at the University of Mexico \n     before serving his country in the Army and then later \n     graduating with a B.A. with honors (in political science, \n     economics, and history) from Yale University in 1950;\n       Whereas William Buckley worked briefly for the Central \n     Intelligence Agency;\n       Whereas, at the young age of 25, William Buckley published \n     his first popular book entitled ``God and Man at Yale'';\n       Whereas William Buckley has since gone on to write more \n     than 55 books and edit 5 more, which include ``Let Us Talk of \n     Many Things: the Collected Speeches'', the novel ``Elvis in \n     the Morning'', and his literary autobiography, ``Miles Gone \n     By'';\n       Whereas he has written more than 4,500,000 words across \n     over 5,600 biweekly newspaper columns, ``On the Right'';\n       Whereas William Buckley founded the popular and influential \n     National Review magazine in 1955, a respected journal of \n     conservative thought and opinion;\n       Whereas William Buckley wrote in the first issue of \n     National Review that in founding the magazine, it ``stands \n     athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no one is \n     inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so \n     urge it'';\n       Whereas William Buckley served as editor of National Review \n     for 35 years from its founding in 1955 until his announced \n     retirement in 1990 and as editor-at-large until his death on \n     February 27, 2008;\n       Whereas, in 1965, William Buckley ran for Mayor of New York \n     City and received 13.4 percent of the vote on the \n     Conservative Party ticket;\n       Whereas William Buckley was host of the Emmy-award winning \n     and long-running ``Firing Line'', a weekly television debate \n     program with such notable guests as Barry Goldwater, Margaret \n     Thatcher, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush;\n       Whereas the New York Times noted that ``Mr. Buckley's \n     greatest achievement was making conservatism--not just \n     electoral Republicanism, but conservatism as a system of \n     ideas--respectable in liberal post-World War II America. He \n     mobilized the young enthusiasts who helped nominate Barry \n     Goldwater in 1964, and saw his dreams fulfilled when Reagan \n     and the Bushes captured the Oval Office'';\n       Whereas as well-known columnist George Will once said, \n     ``before there was Ronald Reagan there was Barry Goldwater, \n     before there was Goldwater there was National Review, and \n     before there was National Review there was William F. \n     Buckley'';\n       Whereas William Buckley received the Presidential Medal of \n     Freedom in 1991;\n       Whereas William Buckley has received numerous other diverse \n     awards, including Best Columnist of the Year, 1967, \n     Television Emmy for Outstanding Achievement, 1969, the \n     American Book Award for Best Mystery (paperback) for \n     ``Stained Glass'', 1980; the Lowell Thomas Travel Journalism \n     Award, 1989, the Adam Smith Award, Hillsdale College, 1996, \n     and the Heritage Foundation's Clare Booth Luce Award, 1999;\n       Whereas William Buckley spent over 56 years married to the \n     former Patricia Alden Austin Taylor, a devoted homemaker, \n     mother, wife, and philanthropist, before her passing in April \n     2007;\n       Whereas William Buckley passed away on February 27, 2008, \n     and is survived by his son, Christopher, of Washington, D.C., \n     his sisters Priscilla L. Buckley, of Sharon, Connecticut, \n     Patricia Buckley Bozell, of Washington, D.C., and Carol \n     Buckley, of Columbia, South Carolina, his brothers James L., \n     of Sharon, and F. Reid, of Camden, South Carolina, a \n     granddaughter, and a grandson;\n       Whereas William Buckley is recognized as a towering \n     intellect, a man who, in the words of Ronald Reagan, ``gave \n     the world something different,'' and, most of all, a true \n     gentleman who encountered everything he did with grace, \n     dignity, optimism, and good humor: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the life of William F. Buckley, Jr. for his \n     lifetime commitment to balanced journalism, his devotion to \n     the free exchange of ideas, his gentlemanly and well-\n     respected contributions to political discourse, and his \n     extraordinary positive impact on world history;\n       (2) mourns the loss of William F. Buckley, Jr. and \n     expresses its condolences to his family, his friends, and his \n     colleagues; and\n       (3) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of \n     William F. Buckley, Jr.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I think we are all going to miss Mr. \nBuckley. We have all watched him on TV. He has used words which were \nnot developed in Searchlight, NV, but he had a great knowledge of the \nEnglish language. He was always such a gentleman, even though many of \nthe things he said were not in keeping with some of the things I \nbelieve in. We will all miss him. I think of the many tributes written \nfor him--for example, in today's newspaper there was a wonderful piece \nwritten by George Will about William Buckley. So I am happy that we \nhave this resolution honoring his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/29/senate-section/article/S1435-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMEMBERING HARRIETT WOODS AS A PIONEER IN WOMEN'S POLITICS\n\n  Mr. REID.
