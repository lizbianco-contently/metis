Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to a period of morning business for up to 1 hour, \nwith Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n   Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, 232 years ago the Declaration of \nIndependence established that humans have the right to self-government \nbecause of their unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of \nhappiness. Preserving these principles requires the same wisdom, \ncourage and spirit of sacrifice that characterized many 18th century \nAmericans.\n  ``What will our children say,'' wrote Boston attorney Josiah Quincy \nII in 1768, ``When they read the history of these times, should they \nfind we tamely gave away, without one noble struggle, the most \ninvaluable of earthly blessings? . . . let us . . . swear we will die, \nif we cannot live freemen!''\n  Indeed, the Americans chose to fight nobly and courageously. After \nthe British surrender at the Battle of Saratoga, Lord Chatham, a member \nof the British House of Lords, concluded, ``I know that the conquest of \nEnglish America is an impossibility. You cannot, I venture to say it, \nyou cannot conquer America . . .''\n  These principles to which the representatives of the 13 colonies \npledged their lives, their resources, and their honor still apply to \nour Nation today.\n  It was on this day, July 8, 1776, that the Declaration of \nIndependence was first read publicly, having been unanimously adopted \nby the Congress only 4 days before.\n  So, today, I am pleased to join with my colleague Senator Lieberman \nin starting a new, bipartisan tradition in the U.S. Senate. We will \nread the Declaration of Independence again.\n  During the next hour, we will also hear from important leaders in our \nNation's history who saw these principles of liberty, equality, and \njustice as timeless.\n  Patrick Henry urges us to consider the consequences of weakly \nsubmitting to a tyrannical authority in the hopes of obtaining peace, \nrather than persisting in the fight to secure our freedom. In his \nfamous speech at the Touro Synagogue, George Washington establishes the \nimportance of religious freedom for the Nation.\n  A few days before his inauguration, Abraham Lincoln makes an \nimpromptu speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where he argues \nthat the principles of the Declaration are incompatible with slavery. \nFinally, in his last letter, Thomas Jefferson reflects on the \nsignificance of the Declaration and its timeless value.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lieberman and myself may enter \ninto a colloquy on the reading of the Declaration of Independence and \nthat following our colloquy, Senators Whitehouse, Murkowski, Webb, \nMartinez, and Lieberman be, in that order, speakers for the remainer of \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. ``When in the Course of human events, it becomes \nnecessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have \nconnected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the \nearth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and \nof Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of \nmankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them \nto the separation.''\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all \nmen are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \ncertain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the \npursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are \ninstituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of \nthe governed.--That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive \nof these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it; \nand to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such \nprinciples and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall \nseem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, \nindeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be \nchanged for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience \nhath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are \nsufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which \nthey are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, \npursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a design to reduce them \nunder absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw \noff such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future \nsecurity.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and \nsuch is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former \nSystems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain \nis a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct \nobject the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To \nprove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.''\n  Mr. COBURN. ``He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome \nand necessary for the public good.\n  ``He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and \npressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his \nAssent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly \nneglected to attend to them.\n  ``He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large \ndistricts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of \nRepresentation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and \nformidable to tyrants only.''\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. ``He has called together legislative bodies at places \nunusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public \nRecords, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with \nhis measures.\n  ``He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing \nwith manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n  ``He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause \nothers to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of \nAnnihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; \nthe State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of \ninvasion from without, and convulsions within.''\n  Mr. COBURN. ``He has endeavored to prevent the population of these \nStates; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of \nForeigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration \nhither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n  ``He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his \nAssent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n  ``He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of \ntheir offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.''\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. ``He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent \nhither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their \nsubstance.\n  ``He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without \nthe Consent of our legislatures.\n  ``He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior \nto the Civil power.\n  ``He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign \nto our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent \nto their acts of pretended legislation:''\n  Mr. COBURN. ``For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n  ``For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any \nmurders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n  ``For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:''\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. ``For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n  ``For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n  ``For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\n  ``For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring \nProvince, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging \nits Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument \nfor introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:''\n\n[[Page S6373]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. ``For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most \nvaluable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n  ``For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves \ninvested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.''\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. ``He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us \nout of his Protection and waging War against us.\n  ``He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and \ndestroyed the Lives of our people.\n  ``He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries \nto complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun \nwith circumstances of Cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the \nmost barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized \nnation.\n  ``He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high \nSeas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of \ntheir friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n  ``He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has \nendeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless \nIndian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished \ndestruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.''\n  Mr. COBURN. ``In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned \nfor Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been \nanswered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus \nmarked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler \nof a free People.''\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. ``Nor have We been wanting in attention to our British \nbrethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their \nlegislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have \nreminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement \nhere. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we \nhave conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these \nusurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and \ncorrespondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of \nconsanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which \ndenounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of \nmankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.----''\n  Mr. COBURN. ``We, therefore, the representatives of the United States \nof America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme \nJudge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the \nName, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly \npublish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought \nto be free and independent States; that they are Absolved from all \nAllegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection \nbetween them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally \ndissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full \nPower to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish \nCommerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States \nmay of right do.--And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm \nreliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to \neach other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my home State of Rhode Island has the \ndistinction of being home to the oldest Jewish house of worship in the \nUnited States, the Touro Synagogue in historic Newport. This synagogue \nwas founded in 1763. Today, the synagogue stands as a handsome \nlandmark, designed by the famous colonial architect Peter Harris, a \nreminder of historic days past for a community that this year, 2008, \nwill celebrate the 350th anniversary of the first Jewish settlement in \nRhode Island and a living expression today of our Jewish community's \nfaith.\n  But during the infancy of our young Nation, Touro Synagogue played a \nmajor political role in defining what religious freedom would come to \nmean to Americans.\n  In 1790, the congregation at Touro Synagogue wrote to President \nGeorge Washington, then in only his second year in office, when he \nvisited Newport on a political tour to rally support for an American \nbill of rights. The warden of the synagogue, Moses Seixas, sought \nWashington's assurance that religious freedom would be guaranteed to \nJews throughout the country.\n  In those first tumultuous years of our Republic, there was much \nuncertainty as to the guaranteed rights of individuals. Our Declaration \nof Independence had declared certain unalienable rights to be self-\nevident, but our Constitution did not yet include our Bill of Rights. \nThere was no guarantee of an American's right to freely exercise his or \nher religion as we have today in the first amendment.\n  President Washington's public letter to the Touro congregation, \ncoming from a political leader whose word was gold, left no doubt that \nthe United States Government would defend the religious freedoms of all \npeople, including those whose beliefs were different from the common \nones, and it assured that this Government would have no part in \nstifling the beliefs of any who chose to worship as their conscience \nand traditions directed.\n  It was, at the time, a revolutionary promise from a revolutionary \nman, and I am pleased to read the full text of this historic \ncorrespondence.\n\n       To the President of the United States of America.\n       Sir: Permit the children of the Stock of Abraham to \n     approach you with the most cordial affection and esteem for \n     your person and merits, and to join with our fellow citizens \n     in welcoming you to NewPort.\n       With pleasure we reflect on those days, those days of \n     difficulty and danger, when the God of Israel, who delivered \n     David from the peril of the sword, shielded your head in the \n     day of battle: and we rejoice to think, that the same Spirit, \n     who rested in the Bosom of the greatly beloved Daniel, \n     enabling him to preside over the Provinces of the Babylonish \n     Empire, rests and ever will rest, upon you, enabling you to \n     discharge the arduous duties of Chief Magistrate in these \n     States.\n\n  This was before the Civil War, so it was ``these States'' and not the \n``United States.''\n\n       Deprived as we heretofore have been of the invaluable \n     rights of free Citizens, we now with a deep sense of \n     gratitude to the Almighty disposer of all events behold a \n     Government, erected by the Majesty of the People, a \n     Government, which to bigotry gives no sanction, to \n     persecution no assistance--\n\n  You will see in Washington's reply that the wily fox knew a good \nphrase when he saw one.\n\n     --but generously affording to all Liberty of conscience, and \n     immunities of Citizenship: deeming every one, of whatever \n     Nation, tongue, or language equal parts of the great \n     governmental Machine: This so ample and extensive Federal \n     Union whose basics is Philanthropy, Mutual confidence and \n     Public Virtue, we cannot but acknowledge to be the work of \n     the Great God, who ruleth in the Armies of Heaven, and among \n     the Inhabitants of the Earth, doing whatever seemeth him \n     good.\n       For all these Blessings of civil and religious liberty \n     which we enjoy under an equal benign administration, we \n     desire to send up our thanks to the Ancient of Days, the \n     great preserver of Men, beseeching him, that the Angel who \n     conducted our forefathers through the wilderness into the \n     promised Land, may graciously conduct you through all the \n     difficulties and dangers of this mortal life: And, when, like \n     Joshua full of days and full of honour; you are gathered to \n     your Fathers, may you be admitted into the Heavenly Paradise \n     to partake of the water of life, and the tree of immortality.\n       Done and Signed by order of the Hebrew Congregation in \n     NewPort, Rhode Island August 17th 1790. Moses Seixas, Warden.\n\n  And then came the President's reply.\n\n       To the Hebrew Congregation in Newport Rhode Island.\n       Gentlemen,\n       While I receive, with much satisfaction, your Address \n     replete with expressions of affection and esteem; I rejoice \n     in the opportunity of assuring you, that I shall always \n     retain a grateful remembrance of the cordial welcome I \n     experienced in my visit to Newport, from all classes of \n     Citizens.\n       The reflection on the days of difficulty and danger which \n     are past is rendered the more sweet, from a consciousness \n     that they are succeeded by days of uncommon prosperity and \n     security. If we have wisdom to make the best use of the \n     advantages with which we are now favored, we cannot fail, \n     under the just administration of a good Government, to become \n     a great and happy people.\n       The Citizens of the United States have a right to applaud \n     themselves for having given to mankind examples of an \n     enlarged and liberal policy: a policy worthy of imitation. \n     All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of \n     citizenship. It is now no more\n\n[[Page S6374]]\n\n     that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence \n     of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of \n     their inherent natural rights. For happily the Government of \n     the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to \n     persecution no assistance requires only that they who live \n     under its protection should demean themselves as good \n     citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual \n     support.\n       It would be inconsistent with the frankness of my character \n     not to avow that I am pleased with your favorable opinion of \n     my Administration, and fervent wishes for my felicity. May \n     the children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, \n     continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other \n     Inhabitants: while every one shall sit in safety understood \n     his own vine and figtree, and there shall be none to make him \n     afraid. May the father of all mercies scatter light and not \n     darkness in our paths, and make us all in our several \n     vocations useful here, and in his own due time and way \n     everlastingly happy.\n       G. Washington.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Rhode Island, \nSenator Whitehouse, for that magnificent exchange of correspondence \nbetween the Hebrew congregation of Newport, RI, and President \nWashington.\n  May I say that Senator Whitehouse, in his own bearing and substance, \nlives out the promise of religious freedom that our first President \ngave to all Americans.\n  Perhaps I should say I say that as one of the descendants of the \nStock of Abraham who is privileged to be a Member of the Senate today. \nI thank Senator Whitehouse. I thank Senator Coburn.\n  I am going to take the liberty, if I may, to speak for a few minutes \nwhile we are waiting for either Senator Murkowski, Senators Webb or \nMartinez, who are going to read documents before I conclude.\n  But I particularly want to give a statement of appreciation to our \ncolleague, Senator Cornyn of Texas, whose idea this was. He came to me \nand said: Why do we not try to establish a new Senate tradition, where \nevery year, either on July 8, which, as Senator Coburn indicated, was \nthe first public reading of the Declaration, or the day closest to July \n4 when the Senate is in session, we read the Declaration, this \nmagnificent statement of America's founding principles, purpose, \ndestiny, and other patriotic documents of the moment to remind us what \nwe are about as a Nation, and in some sense, to refresh our sense of \nnational purpose and to build on the celebrations that are part of July \n4.\n  We all love the fireworks, we all love the time to be with our \nfamily, we love the parades and, of course, we are struck now, as we \nare at war, in the expressions of gratitude toward those who have put \non the uniform of the United States of America to defend our freedom \nand our security.\n  But this all goes back to the beginning, to the extraordinary \nfounding of this country by an extraordinary group of human beings. The \ntruth is we do not celebrate enough that America, unique among Nations, \nwas not defined from the beginning by its borders, by its geography, if \nyou will, but by its ideology, by its values, as the founding \ngeneration of Americans expressed magnificently in the first official \ndocuments.\n  Those words of the Declaration about the self-evident truth that all \nof us are created equal and endowed not by Jefferson, the great \nAmerican who wrote the Declaration, not by the philosophers of the \nenlightenment but by our Creator, with these unalienable rights to \nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that paragraph, and then \nit says, in order to secure those rights, the Government is formed; in \nother words, to secure the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness, I always like to say America is a faith-based initiative \nfounded on those endowments from our Creator. Building this magnificent \narchitecture of freedom stated in the poetry of the founding generation \nof Americans has probably had more effect, has definitely had more \neffect on more people and more political activity in the 200-plus years \nsince 1776 than any other single document. Of course, other documents \nstating other ``isms'' have come along, Nazism, Communism, Islamism, \nbut the Declaration of Independence, Americanism, has prevailed.\n  The other thing that struck me as I read the Declaration was the \nanger and the passion we sometimes forget our founding generation had \ntoward Great Britain and the King for all the tyrannical usurpations of \ntheir freedom that were the cause of the Declaration.\n  Finally, the document is a magnificently aspirational document. It \nstates noble goals. But let us all be honest, at this moment on this \nfloor, particularly at the moment in 1776, where the Declaration of \nIndependence was signed and issued, America was nowhere near realizing \nthe glorious values stated, of equality, of life and the pursuit of \nlife and happiness. People of color had no rights. They were not even \ncounted equal with White people. Women had effectively no rights. I was \nforced, by the validity of the document, to read a terribly bigoted and \noffensive reference to Native Americans. But that is the story of \nAmerica. The Declaration gave us our purpose. It gave us our destiny. \nIt put us on a journey. Succeeding generations of Americans have come \ncloser to realizing the aspirations stated in that document. Of course, \nthe work goes on in our time as it has for every previous generation of \nAmericans.\n  I appreciate very much that Senator Webb has come to the Chamber. I \nam pleased to yield to him for a reading of Thomas Jefferson's last \nletter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to participate in this \nremembrance today.\n  For more than 200 years, the American experiment in self-government \nhas been a witness to all nations about the power of ``the people.'' \nThe Declaration of Independence establishes a fundamental principle \nthat a government exists, not because some humans have a hereditary \nright to dominate others, but because the people themselves have \nconsented to be governed by others.\n  In 1826, the Mayor of Washington, Roger Weightman, invited Thomas \nJefferson to attend the 50th anniversary of the Declaration. In his \nletter of reply, dated June 26, Jefferson reiterates one last time, his \nbelief in the principles of the Declaration. Thomas Jefferson died a \nweek later, on the Fourth of July.\n  In that letter, Thomas Jefferson stated:\n\n       I should, indeed, with peculiar delight, have met and \n     exchanged there congratulations personally with the small \n     band, the remnant of that host of worthies, who joined with \n     us on that day, in the bold and doubtful election we were to \n     make for our country, between submission or the sword; and to \n     have enjoyed with them the consolatory fact, that our fellow \n     citizens, after half a century of experience and prosperity, \n     continue to approve the choice we made.\n       May it be to the world, what I believe it will be (to some \n     parts sooner, to others later, but finally to all), the \n     signal of arousing men to burst the chains under which \n     monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind \n     themselves, and to assume the blessings and security of self-\n     government.\n       That form which we have substituted, restores the free \n     right to the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of \n     opinion. All eyes are opened, or opening, to the rights of \n     man.\n       The general spread of the light of science has already laid \n     open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of \n     mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a \n     favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them \n     legitimately, by the grace of God.\n       These are grounds of hope for others. For ourselves, let \n     the annual return of this day forever refresh our \n     recollections of these rights, and an undiminished devotion \n     to them.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nVirginia for a characteristically purposive and eloquent reading of a \ngreat document. I thank him for carrying the torch of Jefferson, along \nwith that other great Virginian, Senator John Warner, in our time in \nthe Senate.\n  While we await, hopefully soon, Senators Murkowski and Martinez, I \nthought I would go on and perhaps read the final document that I was \ngoing to read at the end. Before I do so, I thank Senator Cornyn of \nTexas whose idea this was, hoping this might form the basis of not only \nthe Senate celebrating the documents but, of course, more than that, \nthe values, the principles, the destiny, the American destiny captured \nin them and in the glorious words of our founding generation, but that \nwe might, in doing so, perhaps carry out or begin a national civics \nlesson in all that we have to be\n\n[[Page S6375]]\n\ngrateful for as Americans, as each succeeding generation of Americans \nhas not only taken on the responsibility to try to move the country \ncloser to the aspirations that are expressed in these founding \ndocuments but, of course, each succeeding generation has benefited from \nthe promise of equality stated in these documents. I thank Senator \nCornyn.\n  I wish to now thank the people working for him. Senators have good \nideas occasionally, but it is the staff who makes sure we implement \nthem. I wish to particularly thank Nicole Gustafson, of his staff, and \nMichelle Chin and also Clarine Nardi Riddle, who is my chief of staff, \nwho has worked on this on behalf of my office.\n  I have always been struck by the extent to which the founding \ngeneration of Americans was powerfully religious. In fact, they came to \nthis country, most of them, to escape religious persecution. So it is \nno surprise that the original documents, as you can hear, of our \ncountry, as we read this morning, are full of references to God, the \nAlmighty, nature's God, a whole series of descriptions. That is why, I \nsaid earlier and I say with pride and gratitude, America is a faith-\nbased institution. That is why it always seems to me that anyone who \ntries to separate America and religion is doing something unnatural. \nThe remarkable balance the Founders established was of a nation \npremised on faith in God, whose purpose was, as a government, to secure \nthe rights each of us have as an endowment from our Creator and yet to \ndo that in a way that, as the Declaration, as the Constitution, as the \nmagnificent letter from our first President, George Washington, to the \nHebrew congregation of Newport, RI, makes clear, respects everybody's \nright to believe in whatever they wish to believe in.\n  It struck me once, reading the Declaration, when we say that the \nright to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is an endowment of \nour Creator, that one of the rights our Founders recognized is the \nright not just to believe in the Creator as one who chooses but, in \nfact, not to believe in our Creator and to equally enjoy the \nprotections and rights that come to all Americans. It is perhaps \nbecause the Declaration of Independence is a faith-based document that \nit has had such universal application and effect across the world, \ninspiring generation after generation of people throughout the world, \nin every continent of the world, to essentially pick up the torch, to \naccept the destiny, to revolt against tyranny and despotism, to fight \nin the same revolutionary spirit that comes through the Declaration of \nIndependence that we read a few moments ago for the freedom of their \nown people.\n  Of course, if you say, as our Founders did and as we believe, that \nthe rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that are the \npremise of the Declaration of Independence were the endowment of our \nCreator, surely our Creator, who created heaven and the Earth and all \nwho live on it, did not intend for those rights to life, liberty, and \nthe pursuit of happiness to be the exclusive possession of Americans. \nThis is the most universal declaration of human rights. It still guides \nour foreign policy because it is what we are all about--freedom and the \nextension of freedom.\n  I do wish to say it has inspired enormous numbers of people \nthroughout the world to fight, as our founding generation fought, for \nfreedom.\n  The document I wish to read now, chosen by staff but a fascinating \none, I must say--I had never seen it before--speaks to the profound \nfaith of the founding generation, their knowledge of the Bible. In \nfact, I suppose it was at the Constitutional Congress, there was a \ndebate about the symbol of the United States of America. And before the \nsymbol that we have now was chosen, a few of the Founders suggested--\nargued, in fact--that it be a portrayal of the children of Israel \ncrossing the sea divided by God's will because they felt they were, as \nsome of them said, establishing here a new Jerusalem.\n  The letter I wish to read was written by John Quincy Adams, one of \nthe great members of the founding generation, eloquent, a fighter for \nfreedom. He delivered an address to the New York Historical Society, \ncelebrating the 50th anniversary of George Washington's inauguration.\n  In that address, he urges the people to embrace the fundamental \nprinciples that motivated the founding generation, of which he was a \npart, and to make them a part of daily living. He premised it all on \nhis own belief in the Bible. So let me read it to you now:\n\n       When the children of Israel, after forty years of \n     wanderings in the wilderness, were about to enter the \n     promised land, their leader Moses, who was not permitted to \n     cross the Jordan with them, just before his removal from \n     among them, commanded that when the Lord their God should \n     have brought them into the land, they should put the curse \n     upon Mount Ebal, and the blessing upon Mount Gerizim.\n       The injunction was faithfully fulfilled by his successor \n     Joshua. Immediately after they had taken possession of the \n     land, Joshua built an altar to the Lord, of whole stones, \n     upon Mount Ebal. And there he wrote, upon the stones, a copy \n     of the law of Moses, which he had written in the presence of \n     the children of Israel: and all Israel and their elders and \n     officers, and their judges, stood on the two sides of the ark \n     of the covenant, borne by the priests and Levites, six tribes \n     over against Mount Gerizim, and six over against Mount Ebal. \n     And he read all the words of the law, the blessings and \n     cursings, according to all that was written in the book of \n     the law.\n\n  Now John Quincy Adams brings it home from the Bible to America when \nhe says:\n\n       Fellow-citizens, the ark of your covenant is the \n     Declaration of Independence. Your Mount Ebal, is the \n     confederacy of separate state sovereignties, and your Mount \n     Gerizim is the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       In that scene of tremendous and awful solemnity, narrated \n     in the Holy Scriptures, there is not a curse pronounced \n     against the people, upon Mount Ebal, not a blessing promised \n     them upon Mount Gerizim, which your posterity may not suffer \n     or enjoy, from your and their adherence to, or departure \n     from, the principles of the Declaration of Independence, \n     practically interwoven in the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n\n  So Adams brings it right from the Bible to America, to the \nDeclaration and the Constitution. Then he says, in conclusion:\n\n       Lay up these principles, then in your hearts, and in your \n     souls--\n\n  And then quoting from the Bible, or picking the metaphor up, he \nsays--\n\n     bind them for signs upon your hands, that they may be as \n     frontlets between your eyes--teach them to your children--\n\n  He is speaking now of the Declaration of Independence and the \nConstitution--\n\n     speaking of them when sitting in your houses, when walking by \n     the way, when lying down and when rising up--write them upon \n     the doorplates of your houses, and upon your gates--cling to \n     them as to the issues of life--adhere to them as to the cords \n     of your eternal salvation.\n       So may your children's children at the next return of this \n     day of jubilee--\n\n  Remember, it was 50 years after Washington's inaugural--\n\n     after a full century of experience under your national \n     Constitution--\n\n  Today, we are now into our third century of experience--\n\n     celebrate it again in the full enjoyment of all the blessings \n     recognized by you in the commemoration of this day, and of \n     all the blessings promised to the children of Israel upon \n     Mount Gerizim, as the reward of obedience to the law of God.\n\n  A remarkable statement of the enduring bases of our great national \ndocuments that guide us to this very day.\n  I am very grateful to see our friend and colleague from Alaska, \nSenator Murkowski, in the Chamber, and I will yield now to her for the \nAbraham Lincoln Independence Hall speech regarding slavery.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am honored this morning to join with my colleagues to observe the \nanniversary of the Declaration of Independence and to participate by \nreading some of the documents that had underscored the principles of \nthat great declaration.\n  Near the end of President-elect Abraham Lincoln's inaugural journey \nfrom Springfield, IL, to Washington, DC, he stopped in the city of \nPhiladelphia. It was the occasion of George Washington's birthday.\n  Lincoln gave an impromptu speech at Independence Hall on February 22, \n1861, and it was a speech that demonstrated his deep commitment to the \nprinciples of the Declaration of Independence. It was a commitment that \nwould be tested in the years to come and for which he, too, gave his \nlife.\n  So with that little introduction, I wish to read this impromptu \naddress\n\n[[Page S6376]]\n\ndelivered by Abraham Lincoln. He stated:\n\n       I am filled with deep emotion at finding myself standing \n     here, in this place, where were collected together the \n     wisdom, the patriotism, the devotion to principle, from which \n     sprang the institutions under which we live. You have kindly \n     suggested to me that in my hands is the task of restoring \n     peace to the present distracted condition of the country. I \n     can say in return, sir, that all the political sentiments I \n     entertain have been drawn, so far as I have been able to draw \n     them, from the sentiments which originated and were given to \n     the world from this hall.\n       I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring \n     from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of \n     Independence. I have often pondered over the dangers which \n     were incurred by the men who assembled here, and framed and \n     adopted that Declaration of Independence. I have pondered \n     over the toils that were endured by the officers and soldiers \n     of the army who achieved that Independence.\n       I have often inquired of myself what great principle or \n     idea it was that kept this Confederacy so long together. It \n     was not the mere matter of the separation of the Colonies \n     from the motherland; but that sentiment in the Declaration of \n     Independence which gave liberty, not alone to the people of \n     this country, but, I hope, to the world, for all future time. \n     It was that which gave promise that in due time the weight \n     would be lifted from the shoulders of all men. This is the \n     sentiment embodied in that Declaration of Independence.\n       Now, my friends, can this country be saved upon that basis? \n     If it can, I will consider myself one of the happiest men in \n     the world if I can help to save it. If it can't be saved upon \n     that principle, it will be truly awful. But, if this country \n     cannot be saved without giving up that principle--I was about \n     to say I would rather be assassinated on this spot than to \n     surrender it.\n       Now, in my view of the present aspect of affairs, there is \n     no need of bloodshed and war. There is no necessity for it. I \n     am not in favor of such a course, and I may say in advance, \n     there will be no bloodshed unless it be forced upon the \n     Government. The Government will not use force unless force is \n     used against it.\n       My friends, this is a wholly unprepared speech. I did not \n     expect to be called upon to say a word when I came here--I \n     supposed I was merely to do something towards raising a flag. \n     I may, therefore, have said something indiscreet, but I have \n     said nothing but what I am willing to live by, and, in the \n     pleasure of Almighty God, die by.\n\n  Mr. President, those were the words--the very eloquent words--given \nby President-elect Abraham Lincoln at Independence Hall on February 22, \n1861--again, words that were impromptu, words that were inspired by his \ndeep commitment, truly, to the principles embodied in our Declaration \nof Independence.\n  It is most fitting that as a Senate, as a body, we recognize those \nprinciples; that we again read those speeches from those great leaders \nfrom so many years ago, those leaders who have shaped our Nation to be \nthe great Nation it is.\n  With that, I again thank the Senators who have given us the \nopportunity to read these profound words again and to share them with \ncitizens across this great Nation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murkowski for that \nmoving reading of the statement by President Lincoln and for all she \ndoes in our time to carry on those principles.\n  It struck me--I said earlier the Declaration was an aspirational \ndocument and positing the self-evident truth that all of us are created \nequal, having this endowment from our Creator to the rights of life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness--the great promise of equality of \nopportunity--that it was not realized at the time, July 4, 1776, when \nit was written.\n  One of the groups I mentioned--women--had essentially no equal rights \nat that time. The story of America is the story of trying to, over \ntime, reach the aspirations of the founding generation.\n  It was only into the last century, as you well know, I say to my \nfriend from Alaska, that women got the right to vote, and only more \nrecently that women began to be elected to the Senate in some numbers. \nSo the work goes on. Obviously, you were elected because of your \nqualities as a person, not because of your gender.\n  But I note both the progress that has been made and the progress that \nyet has to be made to realize the fullest range of the goals of the \nFounders.\n  Senator Martinez, the final Member to speak, is on his way. I will \nfill in a little bit.\n  I say to the Senator, your reading of Lincoln inspires me to recall \nthat I recently read a book--I forget the name of the book, but I \nremember the author, William Lee Miller. I remember it well because he \nwas a teacher of mine at Yale, who has now been teaching for many years \nat the University of Virginia. He wrote a book recently on Lincoln, and \nin it he analyzes Lincoln's first inaugural address.\n  I thought he made a powerful point that reminded me of the extent to \nwhich Lincoln in that first inaugural address talked about the oath of \noffice he was taking and how it transformed him. In other words, he \nsaid when he raised his hand--the right hand--and put the other hand on \nthe Bible and said he was now pledging to protect, preserve, and defend \nthe Constitution, it transformed him as a person. Yes, he was still \nAbraham Lincoln, American citizen, but he was now the President, with a \nsolemn and sacred obligation to protect, preserve, and defend the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  That was a powerful insight, and one I think all of us--as thrilled \nas I remember I was, and I am sure every Member of the Senate was when \nwe walked to the well of the Senate the first time, and every time \nsince, on the day we were sworn in as Senators, to feel transformed by \nthe oath we take, which puts the interests of the Constitution and our \nNation first above personal interests, above party interests.\n  In this particularly partisan chapter of American political history, \nit is worth remembering that the oath we took, as Lincoln's first \ninaugural instructs us, was not to protect and defend and preserve \nourselves or our parties but to protect, preserve, and defend the \nConstitution of the United States, and, of course, the United States \nitself most of all.\n  I am grateful to see my friend from Florida in the Chamber and now \nyield to Senator Martinez for the reading of Patrick Henry's speech.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut and \nvery much appreciate his contribution this morning.\n  I am incredibly honored to have the opportunity to talk about Patrick \nHenry and the words he expressed at such a vital time for our Nation. \nAs the Senator from Connecticut knows, I am an immigrant to this land. \nI am one who has been the beneficiary of the fruits of liberty that \nwere obtained by others, and I am incredibly grateful for those \nopportunities to live in freedom that I have been afforded by this \ngreat Nation. So the Fourth of July always ranks as a very special day \non my calendar.\n  The words of Patrick Henry have to do with a people who felt \noppression, as I did in my youth. It is, at that time in someone's \nlife, a little difficult to determine whether it is better to resist or \nreconcile, whether we move in the direction of conflict or in the \ndirection of peace.\n  It was in that kind of a moment that Americans in the years preceding \n1776 found themselves. So on March 23, 1775, at a meeting of delegates \nat St. John's Church in Richmond, Patrick Henry made the case for \naction.\n  There is a picture of the inside of the church which was taken from \nPatrick Henry's pew. Here are some excerpts from that famous speech.\n  It reads:\n\n       Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the \n     illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a \n     painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren 'til she \n     transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men, \n     engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? . . .\n        . . . We have done everything that could be done to avert \n     the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have \n     remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated \n     ourselves before the throne, and have implored its \n     interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry \n     and Parliament.\n       Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrations have \n     produced additional violence and insult; our supplications \n     have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with \n     contempt, from the foot of the throne!\n       In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope \n     of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for \n     hope.\n       If we wish to be free--if we mean to preserve inviolate \n     those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long \n     contending--\n\n[[Page S6377]]\n\n     if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which \n     we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged \n     ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our \n     contest shall be obtained--we must fight! I repeat, sir, we \n     must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of hosts is all \n     that is left us!\n       They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so \n     formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger?\n       Will it be next week, or the next year? Will it be when we \n     are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be \n     stationed in every house?\n       Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? \n     Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying \n     supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of \n     hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? . \n     . .\n        . . . The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of \n     liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are \n     invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us.\n       Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There \n     is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and \n     who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The \n     battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the \n     vigilant, the active, the brave . . .\n        . . . It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. \n     Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace--but there is no peace.\n       The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from \n     the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding \n     arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we \n     here idle?\n       What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is \n     life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the \n     price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know \n     not what course others may take; but as for me, give me \n     liberty or give me death!\n\n  Those are the words of Patrick Henry, which I feel terribly \ninadequate delivering myself, but I am so honored to have this \nincredible opportunity, and the words ring so true today.\n  As we know how history unfolded, he was so correct about the fact \nthat it was a time for action and that there would be an almighty who \nwould stand on the side of freedom and on the side of liberty, which is \nstill true today. I know the Senator from Connecticut would share that \nview with me.\n  I so much appreciate this wonderful opportunity, and I yield back to \nthe Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Martinez for that \nwonderful reading and for all that his person speaks to. He said he was \nan immigrant to this country, born in Cuba. The truth is, we are all \nimmigrants, the founding generation. We are all immigrants. The \noriginal Americans were Native Americans. I think some of us whose \nfamilies have been here a while may forget all of that.\n  The country in its founding documents posited these magnificent ideas \nbased on faith, the endowment of our Creator, but then this openness \nand equality. The Senator from Florida, in his lifetime, his fresh \nmemory, reminds us all how we have to be grateful for each succeeding \ngeneration as an obligation to accept the responsibility and, if you \nwill, the destiny that is included in these documents--the Declaration \nand the Constitution--but we are also beneficiaries of those. \nCertainly, I have been in my life, and the Senator from Florida has \nbeen in his life.\n  It is great to have somebody such as the Senator from Florida, by \nvirtue of his own ability and hard work being a Senator, to be here and \nto read Patrick Henry's inspiring words. That is really what America is \nabout.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. It is very special.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am honored that Senator Warner has \ncome to the floor. He is a great Virginian in the tradition of \nJefferson, and I wish to call on him because I believe he would like to \nadd just a few words here at the end of this hour of celebration of our \nindependence.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see our distinguished colleague from \nMissouri on the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I apologize to my friend from Virginia, but \nwe were going to start the FISA debate at 11. I understand there is a \nrequest to extend. I would like to lock in a time when we can \naccommodate those Senators wishing to speak but establish a firm time \nwhen Senator Rockefeller and I may begin the discussion of FISA.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am going to speak for maybe 4 minutes. \nMy distinguished colleague from Connecticut, who is too humble to say \nso, perhaps, deserves credit for what is going on this morning, \ntogether with Senator Cornyn. We are about to wind up in less than 15 \nminutes. I would think that at 11:15 we would be ready to go on the \nbill, and I wish to join the Senator from Missouri on this bill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if I may, I am going to finish up in a \nmoment with just a minute because I have had plenty of time to speak, \nso we will be there before 11:15.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, are there other requests of people wishing \nto speak?\n  Mr. WARNER. No.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. No.\n  Mr. WARNER. So I would put it in the form of a unanimous consent \nrequest that we be allowed to continue at this point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/08/senate-section/article/S6377-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6377-S6378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think Senators Cornyn and Durbin wish to \nspeak. So after the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from \nConnecticut finish speaking, if we could--I would suggest that we give \nthem the remaining time on morning business until 11:30. I ask \nunanimous consent to establish morning business until 11:30.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am very heart warmed that this concept \nis giving us the opportunity to talk about these magnificent documents. \nI was fortunate at one time to be designated by the President and \nactually confirmed by the Senate in a position for the Nation's \nbicentennial to lead discussions all across America in all 50 States--\nand indeed I traveled to 22 foreign countries--working on the concept \nof America's bicentennial and of the magnificence of the Constitution, \nthe Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights. I remember so \nwell when talking to audiences the rapt attention that was given at \nthat period in our history about the importance of these documents. Not \none, not two--I don't know how many people would say to me that they \nfelt the hand of divine providence came down and rested upon the \nshoulders of the Founding Fathers to put together such a magnificent \nframework of government.\n  That framework of government today stands as the longest and oldest \nsurviving form of a democratic republic on Earth. It is something to \nthink about. All the other forms of government--monarchies and so \nforth--have either been changed or have gone into the dust bin of \nhistory but not ours. It is because of the genius of these individuals \nthat enables us to carry forward.\n  I remember I was challenged one time that Switzerland's Government \nwas continuous. I reminded them that Napoleon crossed the Alps, I think \nit was in--and I will check it and correct it for the record--in about \n1827 and annexed Switzerland to France. That persisted for some 18 \nmonths, and then Napoleon decided it was too cold over there, didn't \nwant it, and cut it loose and let it go. I will polish that history \nlater on.\n  I believe we should focus on the magnificence of this document, its \nendurance, and that we are proudly the trustees of this framework of \ngovernment, to make it work as envisioned by the Founding Fathers. We \nrecognize that with the passage of time, there are things that have \novertaken some of the original--not their basic concepts, but just the \nelectronic world in which we live now, the instantaneous information \nworld and all of those things have contributed. Nevertheless, we are \nthe oldest surviving democratic republic on Earth today because of the \nmagnificent work of the Founding Fathers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Warner for \nthose very eloquent words. I can't think of a better way to end this \ncelebration of the Declaration of Independence written by Thomas \nJefferson of Virginia than with the words of the great Senator from \nVirginia today, John Warner. I appreciate all of the Members of the \nSenate having participated in this celebration of our founding \ndocuments and of the principles that have given America its purpose and \ndestiny over these many decades. Of course, we hope this will serve in \nits way as a teaching instrument, a civics\n\n[[Page S6378]]\n\nlesson for those around the country who may be listening.\n  For our own part here in the Senate, let's pledge today to uphold \nthese principles and their values and the eloquence with which they \nwere expressed, with the same dedication and persistence in courage as \nthe great first generation of Americans who wrote them.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the time \nbetween now and 11:30 is equally divided between myself and a Senator \non the Republican side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is not part of the unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is there any pending unanimous consent or any pending \nconsent relative to the time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Only that morning business continue \nuntil 11:30.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes--well, \nlet me just make that request, that the remaining time between now and \n11:30 be equally divided between the Democratic side and the Republican \nside and that I be allocated the Democratic time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/08/senate-section/article/S6378-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6378-S6379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, after this debate on the history of our \ncountry and this institution, it is worth reflecting on the fact that \nwere it not for this Chamber, this Senate, we may not be a United \nStates of America. They couldn't reach an agreement on what to do with \nsmall Colonies when they became States. Would they be overwhelmed by \nsome House of Representatives where the big Colonies with the big \npopulations would dominate? So the small Colonies held back, and they \nreached a compromise. They said: We will create a Senate of small \nColonies and large Colonies, soon to become States; they will each have \ntwo Senators. So even if you are small in population, you will have an \nequal voice as a large Colony and a large State. That is why today in \nthe Senate, every State has two Senators regardless of its size, and \nthat is why the Senate is of equal import in the legislative process as \nthe House. That was the great compromise.\n  Then the Senate wrote its rules consistent with that compromise and \nsaid: And then within the Senate, each of these States will be \nrecognized and respected as a minority. So it takes more votes to do \nthings in the Senate than it does in the House. It isn't strictly a \nmajority rules.\n  They created something called a filibuster. A filibuster, which some \nof you recall from Jimmy Stewart in ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' \nis when a Senator would stand and start to speak, hold the floor, stop \nthe debate, and this Senator, by himself or herself, really controlled \nthe Chamber. For the longest time, that is the way it worked or, in \nfact, didn't work. Any Senator could stop the train. Any Senator could \nstop the Senate.\n  Then, in the early 1900s, they said: Well, there ought to be a way to \nstop one Senator from bringing the Senate to a halt. Maybe if we came \nup with 67 votes or a two-thirds vote of the Senate, then we could make \nthat Senator stop filibustering and go on with our business. That was \nthe rule for a long time. Then in the 1960s it was changed again to 60 \nvotes. Today that is the rule. If any Senator starts a filibuster to \namend or stop any nomination, any bill, any treaty, it takes 60 votes \nto stop the filibuster and move forward on the bill.\n\n  How often are filibusters used? In the history of the Senate, rarely. \nBut now there is a new game in town. The history of the Senate tells us \nthat the largest number of filibusters in any 2-year period in the \nhistory of the Senate has been 57 filibusters.\n  Look at the record for this session of Congress. We have had 79 \nRepublican filibusters, and we are still counting. In other words, 79 \ndifferent times the Republican minority Senators have tried to stop the \nbusiness of the Senate, stop the debate, stop the amendment, and force \nthis vote, the 60 votes to resume business in the Senate.\n  Of course, every time we have to come up with 60 votes, we have to \nburn 30 hours off the clock. So we waste a day and a few hours. And \nevery time we need 60 votes to move something forward, we need at least \nnine Republican Senators joining the 51 Democrats. That is the math of \nthe Senate today, 51 to 49.\n  On many occasions, when 79 Republican filibusters were initiated, the \nmatter before the Senate came to a halt. We could not come up with 60 \nvotes. The filibuster prevailed. We had to move on to another item of \nbusiness.\n  You say to yourself: How do you ever get anything done? If any \nSenator can stand up and stop the Senate, and 79 times in the last year \nand a few months this has happened, how do you ever get anything done? \nThe answer is, there are some Senators who do not want anything to get \ndone. They are determined that the Senate not take up controversial \nissues, that the Senate not pass legislation, and they are the dominant \nvoice in the minority today.\n  The most recent issue that brought this before the Senate is one that \naffects 40 million Americans directly. I am talking about senior \ncitizens under Medicare and another 8 or 9 million Americans under \nTRICARE, which is the health insurance plan for those members of the \nmilitary and their families and some veterans. Here is the issue.\n  On July 1, there went into effect a provision that reduced the \nreimbursement for doctors who treated Medicare patients by 10.6 \npercent. We knew this was coming. We have tried to address it. Many \ndoctors have said: This would be a disaster. If you reduce our \nreimbursement for Medicare, many of us cannot afford to take Medicare \npatients. We will reduce our caseloads, which means senior citizens \nwill not have the choice and doctors they want.\n  Some of the doctors they trusted will say: I am sorry, we have to \nreduce the number of Medicare patients because we are not getting paid \nadequately by the Federal Government.\n  We had a provision before the Senate, and we said let's stop the 10-\npercent reimbursement cut from going into effect. That is what it said. \nThe House considered that same provision, and the House passed it by a \nmargin of 6 to 1. A majority of the Republicans joined the overwhelming \nnumber of Democrats and said: We don't want the pay cut for physicians \ntreating Medicare patients to go into effect. It passed 6 to 1.\n  Then it came over here, and we thought it was fairly routine. Guess \nwhat. Filibuster No. 79. The Republicans stood up and said: We don't \nwant you to consider this issue. You will need 60 votes to move forward \non this Medicare issue. So we called it for a vote before the Fourth of \nJuly recess, and we lost. How many votes did we put on the board? We \nneeded 60. We put 59 on the board. Of course, Senator Kennedy is \nrecovering. He was not here. But all the other Democrats--including \nSenator Clinton who was back from the Presidential campaign, and \nSenator Obama came back--voted in favor of suspending this cut in \nMedicare reimbursement for physicians. But only nine of the Republicans \ncrossed the aisle. We needed the 10th Republican, and we could not get \nit. We could not get 60 votes. As a result, we went home.\n  We are back because the issue is back because across America we are \nhearing from doctors, we are hearing from seniors, the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Association of Retired Persons, and scores of \nother health and senior groups that are saying to us: This is \nirresponsible. The Senate has a responsibility to stop this cut from \ngoing into effect and jeopardizing the medical care for 40 million \nseniors and 8 or 9 million members of military families.\n  So when the vote comes up tomorrow to strengthen Medicare, we need \none more Republican vote. We need one more Republican Senator to join \nus. We are hoping that out of those who voted against this provision \nthe last time, some have gone home and heard from seniors, heard from \nthe doctors, and believe Medicare is important.\n  What I have just described to you is the centerpiece of this debate. \nBut there is another part to it which I have to mention. The way we pay \nfor this reimbursement to Medicare physicians is\n\n[[Page S6379]]\n\nto slightly--slightly--reduce the compensation given to private health \ninsurance companies which are offering Medicare coverage. They are \ncalled Medicare Advantage companies. These companies were given this \nright to compete with Medicare a number of years back. Some of them \nhave never been fans of Medicare. Some of them believe the private \ninsurance companies can do a better job than the Government's Medicare \nProgram, so they said: Let these private health insurance companies \ncompete. Let them offer Medicare coverage.\n  They started offering it, and guess what happened. They started \ncharging dramatically more for the same service that the Government \nMedicare Program was already providing. How much more? It was 13 to 17 \npercent more in cost.\n\n  Secondly, we found out they were not providing the basic health care \nthey said they were going to provide to the Medicare people. And, \nthird, they were using marketing practices that were unacceptable.\n  We reduced slightly the reimbursement to these companies so we can \npay doctors under Medicare, and many of the Republicans objected saying \nthey were more devoted to standing by these private health insurance \ncompanies than providing reimbursement for Medicare physicians.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is the vote tomorrow. On the vote tomorrow, we need \none more Republican Senator to join in this effort. We hope Senator \nMcCain will be back. I don't know Senator McCain's position on this \nissue. I hope he is for Medicare. I hope he is against this physician \nMedicare cut. It is time for Senator McCain to make his position clear \nand return to the Senate for this critically important vote, this \nhistoric vote. We want to make sure tomorrow that Medicare's future is \nbright. We have confidence that the doctors will be reimbursed and that \nseniors across America can receive their Medicare services without fear \nof having them cut off. We need John McCain on the Senate floor \ntomorrow. We need to make sure we have enough Republican votes tomorrow \nto make this bipartisan measure the same success in the Senate as it \nwas in the House.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I understand there is no Republican who \nwill claim the time remaining in morning business. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I may have the time until 11:30 a.m.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/08/senate-section/article/S6379-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6379-S6381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to final page \nof this legislation, H.R. 6304, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct of 1978, FISA, Amendments Act of 2008, if it is not amended to \nchange the retroactive immunity provisions.\n  The President must have the necessary authority to track terrorists, \nintercept their communications, and disrupt their plots. Our Nation \nstill faces individuals and groups that are determined to do harm to \nAmericans, as well as our interests throughout the world.\n  I have spent many hours at the National Security Agency, which is \nlocated in Fort Meade, MD. The men and women of our intelligence \nagencies are dedicated public servants who are doing a great job on \nbehalf of their country. They are trying to do their jobs correctly, \nand comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have received classified \nbriefings about the advice and requests that were given to the \ntelecommunications companies by the U.S. Government. I have seen the \nopinions of counsel on this issue. I have attended numerous hearings on \nthis issue.\n  Congress must indeed make needed changes to FISA to account for \nchanges in technology and rulings from the FISA Court involving purely \ninternational communications that pass through telecommunications \nroutes in the United States. While we have a solemn obligation to \nprotect the American people, we must simultaneously uphold the \nConstitution and protect our civil liberties.\n  After learning about executive branch abuses in the 1960s and 1970s, \nCongress passed very specific laws which authorize electronic \nsurveillance. Congress has regularly updated these measures over the \nyears to provide the executive branch the tools it needs to investigate \nterrorists, while preserving essential oversight mechanisms for the \ncourts and the Congress. FISA requires the Government to seek an order \nor warrant from the FISA Court before conducting electronic \nsurveillance that may involve U.S. persons. The act also provides for \npostsurveillance notice to the FISA Court by the Attorney General in an \nemergency.\n  I am very concerned that the FISA law was disregarded by the \nadministration, and want to ensure that we put an end to this type of \nabuse. We are a nation of laws and no one is above the law, including \nthe President and Attorney General. The President deliberately bypassed \nthe FISA Court for years with his warrantless wiretapping program--long \nafter any emergency period directly following the 9/11 terrorist \nattacks--and did not ask Congress to change the FISA statute. In fact, \nPresident Bush refused to fully brief Congress on the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program, TSP, the existence of which was only exposed \nthrough a New York Times story. After the story broke, the \nadministration reluctantly agreed to place this program under the \nsupervision of the FISA Court.\n  I do believe that many of the telecommunications companies cooperated \nwith the Government in good faith, and may be entitled to relief. But \nthe FISA statute of 1978 already lays out procedures for the Government \nto seek a court order and present this order to the telecommunications \ncompanies and require their assistance. The 1978 FISA statute also \nprovides certain immunities to telecommunications companies that \nprovide this type of assistance to the Government.\n  The President chose to ignore the FISA statute. If the President did \nnot want to use the FISA statute or wanted to change it, he had the \nresponsibility to come to Congress and ask for that change. He cannot \nchange the law by fiat, or by issuing a Presidential signing statement. \nCongress must change the law, and the courts must interpret the law. \nCongress and the courts have the power, and often the responsibility, \nto disagree with the President, and these co-equal branches have the \nconstitutional checks to override his veto, disapprove of a request for \na warrant, or strike down an action as unconstitutional.\n  I will vote against retroactive immunity for the telecommunications \ncompanies. The current bill only authorizes the district court to \nreview whether the companies received written requests from the U.S. \nGovernment stating that the activity was authorized by the President \nand determined to be lawful by the executive branch. The Court would \nhave to simply accept the executive branch's conclusion that the \nwarrantless wiretapping outside of the FISA statute and without FISA \nCourt approval was legal, which means the executive branch--not the \njudiciary--gets to decide whether the law was broken. I want the courts \nto be able to look at what the executive branch is doing. I want the \ncourt to protect individual rights. Granting this type of immunity \nwould violate the basic separation of powers. It would also create a \ndangerous precedent for future administrations and private actors to \nviolate the law, and then seek relief in Congress or from the President \nthrough an after-the-fact amnesty or pardon.\n  There was a way to provide the telecommunications companies with \nappropriate relief. Senator Feinstein's amendment would have allowed \nthe courts to grant relief to the telecommunications companies if they \nacted reasonably under the reasonable assumption that the Government's \nrequests were lawful. This amendment would have preserved the \nindependent judgment of the judiciary, and preserved the necessary \ncheck and balance in our system of government. Unfortunately, the \nnegotiators for this legislation rejected this compromise.\n\n[[Page S6380]]\n\n  I also want to note the improvements made to title I of this \nlegislation, compared to current law and the Senate-passed Intelligence \nCommittee version. I thank the Members of the House and Senate who \nworked hard on improvements to this legislation, particularly House \nmajority leader Steny Hoyer.\n  Title I is not perfect, but it is does bring the President's program \nunder the FISA statute and FISA Court, and provides for oversight by \nCongress and the courts.\n  Title I contains a sunset of December 2012 for this legislation. I \nfeel strongly that the next administration should be required to come \nback and justify these new authorities to Congress. As a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, I believe the only meaningful cooperation we \nreceived from the executive branch on this issue occurred when they \nwere facing a sunset and a potential lapsing of their authorities and \npowers under the statute. Congress will then have time to evaluate how \nthe new law has been implemented, and debate whether further changes \nare needed.\n  This legislation also requires the inspector general to review \ncompliance with: (1) Targeting and minimization procedures; (2) reverse \ntargeting guidelines; (3) guidelines for dissemination of U.S. person \nidentities; and (4) guidelines for acquisition of targets who turned \nout to be in the United States. The inspector general review will be \nprovided to the Attorney General, Director of National Intelligence, \nand the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees of the Senate and House. \nThe public would also be given an unclassified version of these \nreviews, reports, and recommendations. These reviews will help Congress \nevaluate the new authorities under the FISA statute, and how the \nexecutive branch and the FISA Court are using these new authorities, \nbefore the legislation sunsets. Congress can then decide how best to \nreauthorize this program.\n  The bill strengthens the exclusivity language of FISA and the \ncriminal wiretap laws. Congress is making very clear that these \nstatutes are the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance can \nbe legally conducted by the U.S. Government. The bill also removes a \ntroubling attempt to unduly broaden the definition of ``electronic \nsurveillance.''\n  Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his opinion in the recent \nBoumediene case on the Guantanamo detainees, stated: ``The laws and \nConstitution are designed to survive, and remain in force, in \nextraordinary times. Liberty and security can be reconciled; and in our \nsystem they are reconciled within the framework of the law.''\n  I believe title I should have been strengthened by more effective \ncourt review. However, absent the retroactive immunity provisions in \ntitle II, I would support the compromise legislation, because it is \nimportant for the intelligence community to have the tools it needs. \nHowever, I regret that if the retroactive immunity provision remains \nunchanged in the final legislation, I will vote against the \nlegislation, because of the fundamental problem with that provision.\n  In conclusion Mr. President, shortly we will be considering the \namendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the FISA act. \nI must tell you, I think it is important that our intelligence \ncommunity have the tools they need to obtain information from foreign \nsources. That is what this legislation is about. We need to modernize \nthe FISA law. Communication methods have changed, and we need to give \nthe tools to the intelligence community to meet their modern needs of \ncommunication.\n  I serve on the Judiciary Committee. I was privy to many hearings we \nhad, some of which were classified, to find out the information as to \nwhat we could do. We brought forward legislation that I think was the \nright legislation that would have given the necessary tools to the \nintelligence agencies to get information from foreign sources without \nbeing burdened by unnecessary court approval and protect the civil \nliberties of the people of this Nation. Unfortunately, that compromise \nwas rejected.\n  We are in this situation today where we have had major disagreements \non how to amend the FISA statutes because of the action of the Bush \nadministration. It is absolutely clear to me that the President went \nbeyond the legal or constitutional authority that he has in doing \nwiretaps without court approval. I want to make it clear, the men and \nwomen who work at our intelligence agencies, many of whom are in \nMaryland at NSA, are doing a great job. They are trying to do \neverything that is correct to protect our Nation and do it in the \ncorrect manner. It was the Bush administration that went beyond the \nlaw. It was the Bush administration that went beyond the Constitution.\n  It is important for us to balance the needs of our community to get \ninformation to protect us but also protect the civil liberties with the \nproper checks and balances in our system.\n  That brings me to H.R. 6304, the legislation that will shortly be \nbefore us.\n  Title I is a much better bill than the bill that left the Senate \nearlier this year. I think this bill has been worked on in a very \nconstructive environment. I compliment not only Senator Rockefeller, \nwho is on the Senate floor, for his hard work on this legislation, I \nalso compliment my colleague from Maryland, Congressman Hoyer, the \nmajority leader of the House of Representatives, for the work he did in \nbringing us together on a bill that I think is a better bill than the \nbill that left the Senate.\n  This bill provides for a sunset in 2012. That is important because I \nfind we do not get the attention from the administration on this issue \nunless they are faced with a deadline from Congress. This will force \nthe next administration to take a look at this legislation and come \nback to the Congress with modifications or justifications for the \ncontinuation of the legislation. I think that is an important \nimprovement.\n  The legislation provides for the inspector general to review the \ntargeting and minimization provisions. The targeting is when a U.S. \ncitizen, perhaps indirectly, is targeted. And the minimization \nprocedures deal with when the intelligence community gets information \nabout an American without court approval, to minimize the use of that \ninformation or to seek court approval. Both of those provisions will be \nreviewed by the inspector general and reports issued back to the \nCongress with unclassified versions available for public inspection.\n  The FISA Court is strengthened through the compromise that has been \nreached. Let me make it clear, I would have liked to have seen the \nJudiciary Committee's bill passed and enacted into law. I think we can \nstill improve title I. But I believe in the legislative process, and I \nthink there has been a fair compromise reached on title I.\n  If title I were before us as an individual action, I would support \nthe compromise because I think it is time to move forward. But there is \ntitle II, and title II is the retroactive immunity. It gives \nretroactive immunity to our telecommunications companies, our telephone \ncompanies. They are entitled to some relief. They acted under the \nurgency of the attacks on our country on September 11 and with the \nrequest of the President of the United States. They are entitled for \nsome relief. But this provision goes way too far.\n  It authorizes the executive branch to determine the legality of their \nactions. In other words, the agency, the President who asked for the \ninformation, will determine whether the telephone companies acted \nproperly. It should be the courts. This takes too much away from the \njudicial branch. It, in my view, compromises the checks and balances \nthat are so important in our constitutional system.\n  We didn't have to be here. I thought Senator Feinstein offered a fair \ncompromise, and I am surprised it was not taken by the negotiators. \nSenator Feinstein said: Why don't we let the FISA Court make a decision \nas to whether the telephone companies acted legally? That is a \ncompromise I could have supported. I think it would have been a fair \ncompromise. Unfortunately, that was rejected. Title II is a fundamental \nflaw in the separation of powers, in the proper protection of civil \nliberties of the people of this Nation, and a dangerous precedent for \nfuture action by this Congress.\n  I will vote to remove or modify title II by the amendments that will \nbe presented later today. I prefer to modify it. As I suggested, I \nthink we have compromises that can work, but I will vote\n\n[[Page S6381]]\n\nto remove it if there are no other options presented. If we do not \nmodify title II, reluctantly I will not be able to support the \ncompromise legislation that has been presented.\n  I urge my colleagues to try to get this done right. This is an \nimportant bill. Unfortunately, it is fatally flawed with the \nlegislation that is before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/08/senate-section/article/S6381-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 6304, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6304) to amend the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 to establish a procedure for \n     authorizing certain acquisitions of foreign intelligence, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nmotion to proceed is agreed to and the motion to reconsider is made and \nlaid on the table.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time I \nconsume be allocated to the Dodd amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Dodd's \namendment to strike the immunity provision from this bill, and I \nespecially thank the Senator from Connecticut for his leadership on \nthis issue. Both earlier this year, when the Senate first considered \nFISA legislation, and again this time around, he has demonstrated \ntremendous resolve on this issue, and I have been proud to work with \nhim.\n  Some have tried to suggest that the bill before us will leave it up \nto the courts to decide whether to give retroactive immunity to \ncompanies that allegedly participated in the President's illegal \nwiretapping program. But make no mistake, this bill will result in \nimmunity being granted--it will--because it sets up a rigged process \nwith only one possible outcome. Under the terms of this bill, a Federal \ndistrict court would evaluate whether there is substantial evidence \nthat a company received . . .\n\n     a written request or directive from the Attorney General or \n     the head of an element of the intelligence community \n     indicating that the activity was authorized by the President \n     and determined to be lawful.\n\n  We already know, from the report of the Senate Intelligence Committee \nthat was issued last fall, that the companies received exactly such a \nrequest or directive. This is already public information. So under the \nterms of this proposal, the court's decision would actually be \npredetermined.\n  As a practical matter, that means that regardless of how much \ninformation the court is permitted to review, what standard of review \nis employed, how open the proceedings are, and what role the plaintiffs \nare permitted to play, it won't matter. The court will essentially be \nrequired to grant immunity under this bill.\n  Now, our proponents will argue that the plaintiffs in the lawsuits \nagainst the companies can participate in briefing to the court, and \nthis is true. But they are not allowed any access to any classified \ninformation. Talk about fighting with both hands tied behind your back. \nThe administration has restricted information about this illegal \nwiretapping program so much that roughly 70 Members of this Chamber \ndon't even have access to the basic facts about what happened. Do you \nbelieve that? So let's not pretend that the plaintiffs will be able to \nparticipate in any meaningful way in these proceedings in which \nCongress has made sure their claims will be dismissed.\n  This result is extremely disappointing. It is entirely unnecessary \nand unjustified, and it will profoundly undermine the rule of law in \nthis country. I cannot comprehend why Congress would take this action \nin the waning months of an administration that has consistently shown \ncontempt for the rule of law--perhaps most notably in the illegal \nwarrantless wiretapping program it set up in secret.\n  We hear people argue that the telecom companies should not be \npenalized for allegedly taking part in this illegal program. What you \ndon't hear, though, is that current law already provides immunity from \nlawsuits for companies that cooperate with the Government's request for \nassistance, as long as they receive either a court order or a \ncertification from the Attorney General that no court order is needed \nand the request meets all statutory requirements. But if requests are \nnot properly documented, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \ninstructs the telephone company to refuse the Government's request, and \nit subjects them to liability if they instead decide to cooperate.\n  When Congress passed FISA three decades ago, in the wake of the \nextensive, well-documented wiretapping abuses of the 1960s and 1970s, \nit decided that in the future, telephone companies should not simply \nassume that any Government request for assistance to conduct electronic \nsurveillance was appropriate. It was clear some checks needed to be in \nplace to prevent future abuses of this incredibly intrusive power; that \nis, the power to listen in on people's personal conversations.\n  At the same time, however, Congress did not want to saddle telephone \ncompanies with the responsibility of determining whether the \nGovernment's request for assistance was legitimate. So Congress devised \na good system. It devised a system that would take the guesswork out of \nit completely. Under that system, which is still in place today, the \ncompany's legal obligations and liability depend entirely on whether \nthe Government has presented the company with a court order or a \ncertification stating that certain basic requirements have been met. If \nthe proper documentation is submitted, the company must cooperate with \nthe request and it is, in fact, immune from liability. If the proper \ndocumentation, however, has not been submitted, the company must refuse \nthe Government's request or be subject to possible liability in the \ncourts.\n  This framework, which has been in place for 30 years, protects \ncompanies that comply with legitimate Government requests while also \nprotecting the privacy of Americans' communications from illegitimate \nsnooping. Granting companies that allegedly cooperated with an illegal \nprogram this new form of retroactive immunity in this bill undermines \nthe law that has been on the books for decades--a law that was designed \nto prevent exactly the type of abuse that allegedly occurred here.\n  Even worse, granting retroactive immunity under these circumstances \nwill undermine any new laws we pass regarding Government surveillance. \nIf we want companies to obey the law in the future, doesn't it send a \nterrible message, doesn't it set a terrible precedent, to give them a \n``get out of jail free'' card for allegedly ignoring the law in the \npast?\n\n  Last week, a key court decision on FISA undercut one of the most \npopular arguments in support of immunity; that is, that we need to let \nthe companies off the hook because the State secrets privilege prevents \nthem from defending themselves in court. A Federal Court has now held \nthat the State secrets privilege does not apply to claims brought under \nFISA. Rather, more specific evidentiary rules in FISA govern in \nsituations such as that. Shouldn't we at least let these cases proceed \nto see how they play out, rather than trying to solve a problem that \nmay not even exist?\n  That is not all. This immunity provision doesn't just allow telephone \ncompanies off the hook; it will also make it that much harder to get at \nthe core issue I have been raising since December 2005, which is that \nthe President broke the law and should be held accountable. When these \nlawsuits are dismissed, we will be that much further away from an \nindependent judicial review of this illegal program.\n  On top of all this, we are considering granting immunity when roughly \n70 Members of the Senate still have not been briefed on the President's \nwiretapping program. The vast majority of this body still does not even \nknow what we are being asked to grant immunity for. Frankly, I have a \nhard\n\n[[Page S6382]]\n\ntime understanding how any Senator can vote against this amendment \nwithout this information.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to strike the immunity \nprovision from the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, would the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will.\n  Mr. SPECTER. As the Senator from Wisconsin doubtless knows, there was \na very extensive analysis of these issues by Chief Judge Walker of the \nSan Francisco District Court handed down last Wednesday, and I think it \nwas no coincidence that the decision preceded just a few days--after \neverybody knew, including Chief Judge Walker--of the Senate taking up \nthis question.\n  In that opinion, Chief Judge Walker finds the Terrorist Surveillance \nProgram unconstitutional. He says, flatly, that the language of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 means what it says on the \nexclusive remedy for warrants, and that the President exceeded his \narticle II powers as Commander in Chief.\n  As we all know, the Detroit District Court came to the same \nconclusion, was reversed by the Sixth Circuit in a 2-to-1 opinion on \nstanding, and then the Supreme Court of the United States handily \nducked the question by the noncert. That is the principal \nconstitutional confrontation of our era, on article I powers by \nCongress and article II powers of the President as Commander in Chief. \nThey denied cert. And on the standing issue, as disclosed by the Senate \nopinion in the Sixth Circuit, the Supreme Court could easily have taken \nthe case to resolve this big issue.\n  But now Judge Walker has decided, and it is very significant, because \nJudge Walker has these more than 40 cases pending on the effort to \ngrant retroactive immunity. The case he decided it on is the Oregon \ncase where State secrets are involved, with the inadvertent disclosure \nby the Federal agents.\n  It is hard for me to see how you have a State secret which is no \nlonger secret. And you have a document, just electronic surveillance, \nwhich was disclosed, so it is no longer a secret. That remains to be \ndecided under the opinion of Chief Judge Walker, but he says there is a \n``rich lode'' of material on the standing issue.\n  These questions involve extraordinarily complex matters. The Senator \nfrom Wisconsin knows that. He has been deeply involved in it. And the \ndistinguished chairman knows that, because he has been deeply involved \nin these matters. My question to the Senator from Wisconsin is twofold:\n  One, what do you see as the immediate ramifications of Chief Judge \nWalker's opinion handed down a few days before we are to decide it?\n  And a related question: What do you think of the likelihood that \nMembers of the Senate have had or could have an adequate opportunity to \nreview that 59-page opinion with all of its detailed ramifications?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for asking the \nquestion. Yes, I referred to this decision in my brief comments about \nthis amendment. I think it is obviously a significant decision. As I \nindicated, it deals with the State secrets issue. It says that FISA is \nin fact the exclusive means and that the evidentiary rules regarding \nFISA should control, rather than State secrets. That is an important \nfinding. But even more important is what the Senator from Pennsylvania \nis alluding to, which is the broader issue that the judge didn't \ndecide, but clearly he indicated where he would head on the question of \nwhether the President's TSP program was illegal--and I have long \nbelieved that it was illegal. In fact, the Senator and I were the first \nMembers to comment on the revelation of this program in December of \n2005 on the floor of the Senate.\n  I have examined it closely myself, as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee and the Judiciary Committee, and I feel even more strongly \ntoday than I did then that this program was illegal and there needs to \nbe accountability for that illegality. That accountability can come in \npart from litigation of the kind that involved this district court \ndecision, and it can come from other cases that are pending. But my \nconcern, of course, is that if we jam this bill through, it may have an \nimpact on the ability to pursue that underlying legal issue because of \nthe effective granting of immunity to telephone companies. So this \ndecision has significance, but I can't tell you that I know all the \nramifications.\n  Obviously, Members of the Senate, to answer your question, should \nreview the opinion and have a chance to find out more about the \nopinion. But there are 70 Members of the Senate who haven't even had \nthe benefit of what you and I have had, which is the briefing on the \nactual TSP and what happened from 2001 to 2007 with regard to \nwiretapping.\n  I thank the Senator for making this important point about Senators \nbeing ready to grant this immunity without reviewing the litigation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if the Senator from Wisconsin will yield \nfor just one more question? And that is, in the context, is the \nSenator--I asked him to yield for one more question, and I will use a \nmicrophone so perhaps he can hear me, perhaps some people on C-SPAN2 \nwill hear me, perhaps some Senators will hear me, because we need to be \nheard on this subject because of its complexity.\n  The question relates to what the Senator from Wisconsin has said. He \nputs it at some 70 Members of the Senate have not been briefed on the \nprogram. I have heard from House leadership that most of the Members of \nthe House have not been briefed on the program. There has been no \nofficial determination. The language is picked up from the allegations \nof the complaint as to what is alleged.\n  The question is, How can the Congress intelligently decide--maybe \nthat is too high a standard. But how can the Congress, especially the \nworld's greatest deliberative body, the U.S. Senate--how can the \ndecision be made on electronic surveillance, granting retroactive \nimmunity, when we don't know what we are granting retroactive immunity \nto?\n  The second part is, How can we fly in the face of the decision by the \njudge who is ruling on these cases--we are sending them all to him--\nwhen he, speaking for the court: The law of the case is that the \nterrorist surveillance program is unconstitutional, that it exceeds the \nauthority.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act also covers the pen \nregister and related items, so--not specifying what is involved here--\nwhatever is involved, sending it to the judge who has already said it \nis unconstitutional. How can we deal in an intelligent manner given \nthose two critical factors?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania for his comments and question. Really, the only \nappropriate answer is to say ``amen'' to everything he just said. Think \nabout this: To vote on anything when 70 Members of the Senate haven't \nbeen briefed on it seems unbelievable, and then you add to it that it \nhas to do with the most critical issue of our time: How can we best \nprotect our country from those who attacked us while also observing the \nrule of law? That would be bad enough. But then you add to it, as the \nSenator from Pennsylvania has indicated, that this goes to the very \ncore issue of the structure of the Constitution. Is it really true, as \nthe administration puts forward in defense of the TSP program, that \narticle II of the Constitution somehow allows the executive and \nCommander in Chief power to override an absolutely clear, exclusive \nauthority adopted by Congress pursuant to Justice Jackson's third tier \nof the test set out in his Youngstown opinion?\n  All of these levels are implicated by this. The Senator could not be \nmore correct. This is an amazingly inappropriate use of legislative \ninterference, pushed by this administration, and Senators should take a \nvery hard look at whether they want to be associated with such an \nattack on the rule of law in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am opposing the amendment. So I \nwould be taking time from Senator Bond. I ask for approximately 20 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Duly noted.\n\n[[Page S6383]]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, my colleagues have submitted two \namendments seeking to accomplish somewhat the same goal before, and in \na sense now down to one. Senators Dodd and Feingold have an amendment \nto strike title II of the FISA bill. It is very plain and simple, and \nthey are very clear about that. The amendments have the same effect--\neliminating the title that provides a mechanism for a U.S. district \ncourt to decide whether pending suits against telecommunications \ncompanies should be dismissed.\n  Two other amendments with respect to title II, to be offered by \nSenator Specter and Senator Bingaman, will follow. While I address \nthose amendments in separate statements, I would like to say now with \nrespect to the amendments that I oppose each of them and I urge that \nthe Senate pass H.R. 6304 without amendment so that the delicate \ncompromise which serves as best it can to protect both national \nsecurity and privacy and civil liberties can, in fact, become law.\n  Six and a half years ago, instead of consulting with Congress about \nchanges that might be needed to FISA, the President made the very \nmisguided decision to create a secret surveillance program that \ncircumvented the judicial review process and authorization required by \nFISA and was kept from the full congressional oversight committees. \nThat is calling it running around the end altogether. We are right to \nbe angry about the President's actions, but our responsibility today is \nto look forward. That is what this bill is about, to make sure we have \nadequately dealt with the numerous issues that have arisen from the \nPresident's very poor decision, bad decision.\n  The bill in front of us today accomplishes three important goals with \nrespect to the President's warrantless program.\n  First, the bill establishes a sure and realistic method of learning \nthe truth about the President's program--I repeat, learning the truth \nabout the President's program. It requires the relevant inspectors \ngeneral--that is a term of art. What I mean by that is the inspectors \ngeneral of the CIA, DOD, NSA, et cetera, people who oversee and know \nwhat is in this program altogether--to submit an unclassified report \nabout the program to the Congress. This report will ensure that both \nCongress and, by the way, therefore, obviously, the public will have as \ncomplete a picture of the President's warrantless surveillance program \nas possible or as messy as it may be for them to ingest.\n  Second, the bill tightens the exclusivity of the FISA law, making it \nimprobable for any future President to argue that acting outside of \nFISA is lawful. That is huge. That means the President can never again, \never use what he has used--his all-purpose powers--and say he can just \nwalk right around the end of FISA. He has to have a statutory \nauthority, it has to come from us, and he cannot bypass FISA as he did \naltogether.\n  Third, the bill addresses the problems the President's decision has \ncaused for the telecommunications companies that were told their \ncooperation was both legal and necessary to prevent another terrorist \nattack. They were not told a lot, but they were certainly told that. \nThe bill does not provide those companies with a free pass. It requires \nmeaningful district court review of whether statutory standards for \nprotection from liability have been met for the companies having relied \non the Government's written representations of legality.\n\n  You remember there was a period when we were using the FISA Court to \nmake these kinds of judgments, and we bent to the better wisdom of the \nHouse with respect to the district court, which is a more public court. \nSo they have that responsibility.\n  All of these pieces fit together, and not just because they are part \nof a larger compromise on this bill. Private companies that cooperated \nwith the Government in good faith, as the facts before the \ncongressional intelligence committees demonstrate they did, should not \nbe held accountable for the President's bad policy decisions. But if \nthe court ultimately dismisses the litigation against those companies, \nit is important that there be a mechanism for public disclosure about \nthe President's program, and it is precisely, therefore, in this bill \nthat the inspectors general report, which has to be provided to us \nwithin a year, provide that public accountability.\n  Likewise, we can only put past actions behind us if we can be \nreassured that this will not happen again, and therefore the strength \nin the exclusivity language in the FISA bill addresses that concern. \nThat it does.\n  Together, the three components of the bill provide accountability for \nthe mistakes of the past as well as a way to move forward.\n  Although title II in the bill before us today differs in important \nways from the title II we passed out of the Senate this past February, \nthe two bills address the same underlying problems faced by the \ntelecommunications companies.\n  Because the majority of the information in the cases is classified, \nthere has been no substantial progress in the cases against the \ntelecommunications companies--several of them have been going on for \nyears. Classified information, they can't have it; state secrets, can't \nhave it. The Government has not even allowed the telecommunications \ncompanies in the many pending lawsuits to disclose publicly whether \nthey assisted the Government. These companies, therefore, have not been \npermitted to invoke the defense to which they are entitled. But sued \nthey are. The companies cannot reveal, for example, whether they did \nnot participate in the program. That would be a false accusation \nagainst some company, but they cannot say that they didn't participate \nor that they only participated pursuant to a court order--they can't \ntalk about that--or participated in reliance on written Government \nrepresentation of legality--cannot talk about that. The bill before us \ntoday allows these defenses to be presented to the district court, the \npublic court--not the FISA Court, which is kind of a secret court, but \nto the district court, which is not a secret court. It is a public \ncourt.\n  The Attorney General is authorized to certify to the court that \nparticular statutory requirements have been met without requiring \npublic acknowledgment of whether particular providers assisted the \nGovernment.\n  The bill then requires the district court to determine whether the \nAttorney General's certification is supported by ``substantial \nevidence.'' That is a higher, tougher standard than the ``abuse of \ndiscretion'' test we had in the Senate bill. In making this assessment, \nthe district court is specifically authorized to review the underlying \ndocuments on which the Attorney General's certification is based. The \ncourt can, therefore, ``review any court orders, statutory directives \nor certifications authorizing providers' cooperation.''\n  Importantly, the court may also review the highly classified \ndocuments provided to the companies indicating that the President had \nauthorized the program and that it had been determined to be lawful. \nExplicitly allowing the court to base its decision on whether companies \nare entitled to liability protection on relevant underlying documents \nis an important improvement to the bill, and I am happy it is in it.\n  Because such documents would be classified, any review of those \ndocuments in the litigation prior to this bill would have been limited \nto a court assessment of whether the documents were privileged. The \ncourt could not have relied on what the Government's communications to \nthe providers actually said in making its assessment about whether the \ncases should be dismissed. The court could not have relied on what \nthose Government communications said--it is different.\n  This bill before the Senate, therefore, gives the district court both \nan important role in determining whether statutory requirements for \nliability protection have been met and the tools to make that \nassessment.\n  The FISA bill also provides a more explicit role for the parties to \nthe litigation--this is new and better--to ensure that they will have \ntheir day in court open--sort of, and so to speak--but they will have \ntheir day in court.\n  But they will have their day in court. They are provided the \nopportunity to brief the legal and constitutional issues before the \ncourt and may submit documents to the court for review. Whatever it is \nthey want to submit, they can submit.\n\n[[Page S6384]]\n\n  A few of my colleagues have argued that including any sort of \nmechanism that would allow the district court to resolve these cases \nwill prevent the public from hearing the details about the President's \nprogram. But even if the litigation were to continue indefinitely, it \nwould never tell the full story.\n  Lawsuits have now been pending for, as I indicated, over 2 years. The \nfight during all that time, and the likely fight in the future, has \nbeen about whether the plaintiffs will have access to any classified \ninformation about the program. The plaintiffs in the litigation, they \nhave never been and will never be provided with wide-ranging \ninformation about the President's classified program that would enable \nthem to put together a comprehensive picture of what happened.\n  This capability is reserved for those who have complete access to \ninformation about the program. And that again is why I come back to the \nimportance of the inspectors general aspect of this oversight. You can \nsay: inspectors general, them and their reports. Well, inspectors \ngeneral can take apart their agencies, and they are sort of in there to \ndo that.\n  That is why we have asked the inspectors general of these relevant \nintelligence agencies, including the DOD, who do, in fact, have \ncomplete access to information about the program, to conduct a \ncomprehensive review of that same program, the whole thing.\n  The FISA bill requires a report of the review be submitted to the \nCongress in a year and requires that the report, apart from any \nclassified annex, be submitted in an unclassified form that can be made \navailable to the public.\n  That is not a dodge, that is simply a fact. You cannot release \nclassified information to the public. So this is an appropriate way to \nobtain answers to questions about the President's program and ensure \nthe public's accountability.\n  Critics have also claimed that granting immunity will suggest to the \ntelecommunications companies that that compliance with the law is \noptional or that Congress believes that the President's program was \nlegal. An examination of the bill that is before us in the Senate would \nmake it impossible for anyone to come to either conclusion.\n  The administration made very strained arguments to circumvent \nexisting laws in carrying out the President's warrantless surveillance \nprogram: a claim, for example, that the 2001 authorization for use of \nmilitary force was a statutory authorization for electronic \nsurveillance outside FISA, even though that authorization did not \nmention electronic surveillance.\n  What role did we expect telecommunications companies to play in those \nassessments of legality? To answer that question, we must consider the \nlegal regime under which these companies were operating. Numerous \nstatutes over the years have stressed the importance of cooperation \nbetween the telephone companies and the Federal Government, \nparticularly in times of emergency. This has a fairly long history.\n  FISA itself allows the Attorney General to authorize electronic \nsurveillance for short periods of time in emergencies prior to the \nsubmission of an application for an order. The law, as it existed in \n2001 and as it exists today, grants immunity to telecommunications \ncompanies, based solely on a certification from the Attorney General \nthat no warrant or court order is required by law, that the statutory \nrequirements have been met, and that the specified assistance is \nrequired.\n  Given the need for speedy cooperation in times of emergency, Congress \nhas never asked companies to question the Government's legal analysis \nthat their cooperation is legal and necessary. Thus, although the \ntelecommunications companies have always been and will always be \nexpected to comply with the law, Congress has told them, prior to 2001, \nthat they were entitled to rely on representations from the highest \nlevels of Government as to what conduct was legal.\n  That is the way it worked. In the case of the President's \nsurveillance program, representations of legality were made to \nproviders from the very highest levels of Government. The FISA bill \nbefore the Senate, therefore, eliminates any possible loopholes in \nexisting law, ensuring that neither the telecommunications companies \nnor any future Presidents have any doubt about what is required to \ncomply with the law.\n  It strengthens the exclusivity language of FISA--I have mentioned \nthat, I do again--making it absolutely clear that the Congress does not \nintend general statutes to be an exception to FISA's exclusivity \nrequirements. In other words, no future President can therefore claim \nthat an authorization for use of military force allows the Government \nto circumvent FISA.\n  Even more importantly for the telecommunications companies, the bill \nbefore us makes it a criminal offense to conduct electronic \nsurveillance outside of specifically listed statutes. Unlike existing \ncriminal and civil penalties which exempt electronic surveillance that \nis authorized by statute, the bill puts telecommunications companies on \nnotice that any electronic surveillance outside FISA or specifically \nlisted criminal intercept provisions, in the future, is a criminal \noffense that is subject to civil penalties for claims brought by \nindividuals who are free to do so.\n  This clear language provides no room for any future President or \nAttorney General to argue that criminal and civil penalties should not \nattach for any circumvention of FISA.\n  Now, the improvements to this bill address many of the concerns \nraised with the possibility that the court might dismiss the lawsuits \nagainst the telecommunications companies. The bill before us makes \nclear that Congress expects compliance with the laws, and it assures \nthat public accountability is on the Government, where it belongs, and \nnot on the companies that acted in good faith in cooperating with the \nGovernment.\n  It is important to say that whatever the inspectors general come up \nwith in their analysis of this, and believe me, they will be under the \ngun to do it right, that they have to report that, both unclassified \nand classified, to the Intelligence Committees and the Judiciary \nCommittees in both Houses. So the oversight factor again comes in.\n  I think it is time to pass this bill and move forward. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the Dodd-Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question; \ntwo questions, very briefly?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Of course.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The first question relates to the fact, as represented, \nthat some 70 Members of the Senate will not have been briefed on the \nprogram.\n  I have been advised by the leadership in the House that most of the \nMembers of the House have not been briefed on the program. The \nchairman, in detail, went over what the telephone companies cannot do \nbecause they cannot make any public disclosures.\n  And my question is: How can we intelligently grant retroactive \nimmunity on a program that most Members of Congress do not know what we \nare granting retroactive immunity on?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. First of all, I should point out to the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania that there was a period when \nmembers of the Intelligence Committee, members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, were not even able to go to the Executive Office Building to \nlook at any of the orders that came down, President to Attorney General \nto National Security Advisor, then a letter to the companies. We were \nnot allowed to do that.\n  The chairman and the vice chairman were allowed to do that. Nobody \nelse was. That changed. And it changed because this Senator and a \nnumber of others put tremendous pressure, because it was such a \nridiculous situation that I could not even talk to my committee members \nabout it. And so they expanded that to include not only committee \nmembers but also some staff from both the Intelligence and \nJudiciary Committees.\n\n  So I would say to the good Senator that intelligence is difficult, \nand it is difficult to legislate it on the floor of the Senate. Let me \nphrase it this way. There is a common view held by many that members of \nthe Intelligence Committee and then, to some extent, the Judiciary \nCommittee, in fact, have the intelligence, they control the \nintelligence, it is all theirs.\n  I wish to debunk that right now. We control no intelligence. It is \nentirely controlled, meted out or not, by the executive branch. This \nexecutive branch\n\n[[Page S6385]]\n\nhas been extremely cautious, stingy, I would say undemocratic, in doing \nthis.\n  The good Senator from Missouri who is coming in now, the vice \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee and I have fought like bears to \nexpand the number of people who can have access to these programs. But \nI cannot argue that the Senator--his point is worthy of thought.\n  I think then one has to consider, are the people on the Judiciary \nCommittee and the people on the Intelligence Committee representative \nof good faith, people of reasonable intellect, people who know their \nbusiness, and people who exercise fair judgment? I have been handed a \nnote to say something I have already said, that the public reporting \naccompanying the Senate Intelligence Committee bill, detailed, with a \ngreat deal of specificity, what the companies received from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  That still does not allow me to argue the Senator's point. It is a \npeculiar and difficult nature of legislating intelligence legislation \non the floor of the Senate. But it is not weakened by so doing because \nof what I have indicated, because of what the inspectors general, \ngranted, not in time for this, will come up with, and, secondly, what I \nwould call the very high standard of people who serve on both the \nRepublican and the Democratic side of the Senate and House Judiciary \nCommittee and Intelligence Committee.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, my second question is, very briefly----\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to reclaim my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 34 minutes remaining in \nopposition. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, very briefly on the second question, and \nI will be very brief--the chairman has gone over the ineffectiveness of \nCongress in dealing with the statutory requirement for notice to the \nIntelligence Committees which wasn't followed. We have gone over the \nineffectiveness of the courts in dealing with enforcing the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, where the Supreme Court, as I detailed \nearlier, had ducked the question. So given the ineffectiveness of \nCongress--and I know, I chaired the Intelligence Committee in the 104th \nCongress and could find out hardly anything; I found the Director of \nthe CIA knew so little about what was going on--and then the signing \nstatements, the only recourse we have now is to the courts and to Chief \nJudge Walker.\n\n  So my question to you is, if we are to maintain separation of powers \nand determination of constitutionality, article I versus article II \npowers, how in the world can we act to divest Chief Judge Walker of his \njurisdiction in the case, especially in light of the opinion he handed \ndown last Wednesday?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I respond to the Senator from Pennsylvania by saying \nhe indicated that Judge Walker said this was not a constitutional \neffort between 2001 and 2007, and it was not constitutional. But when \nthe Senator offers his own amendment this afternoon, I will make the \npoint I make now, that even if it is determined that the program is \nunconstitutional--and that, for reasons I will explain after lunch when \nwe do the amendment, will not be possible--the immunity fact is not \ncompromised. It is not changed. You are talking about the \nconstitutionality of the White House's action. This bill talks about \ntitle I and then title II and a couple of other titles which referred \nto protecting basic rights, reverse targeting, all kinds of things such \nas that, which, in fact, came from Senator Feingold, and it is not \ninvolved in the constitutionality. It is not involved in that. Even if \nthe judge ruled it unconstitutional, it would make no difference \nwhatsoever on title II.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I respect Senator Bond's time, and I will pursue this \nwith the chairman when my amendment is called up later today.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will state it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Dodd has yielded me 10 minutes of his time to \nspeak in favor of his amendment to strike the immunity clause. I am \nwondering how I may get recognition here and how much time does Senator \nDodd have left in this debate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 43 minutes remaining for \nthe Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wonder if Senator Bond would allow me to take 10 \nminutes of the 43 minutes Senator Dodd has remaining?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am happy to accommodate the Senator from \nCalifornia. With respect to the comments by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, I had asked that those be reserved for the arguments in \nfavor of the amendment. How much time remains on the chairman and my \nside of the aisle?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. We will reserve that and accommodate the Senator from \nCalifornia. I thank the Chair and my colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of \nthe amendment offered by Senator Dodd to strike the provision from the \nbill providing immunity to the telecom companies who assisted President \nBush with his warrantless surveillance program; in essence, breaking \nthe law they were supposed to live by. I also note that not every \ntelecom company went along with this. There was at least one, Qwest, \nthat refused to go along because they said it would break the law if \nthey did so. I thank Senators Dodd, Feingold, Leahy, and others for \ntheir leadership. I know these are difficult debates to have because \npeople could say: My goodness, they are offering an amendment to the \nintelligence bill and, ipso facto, that must be a bad thing because \nthey are slowing things down.\n  I have to say, when you are standing up to fight for liberty and \njustice and the truth, you should never be afraid to slow something \ndown. As a matter of fact, it is our job to do so. I do thank my \ncolleagues for their leadership.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment. In my support of this \namendment to strike the immunity to the telecom companies who went \nalong with the President's secret and, I believe, illegal program, I \nwish to say I am not seeking punishment for them. As a matter of fact, \nI have stated a long time ago that I support indemnification for the \ntelecom companies. I believe Senator Whitehouse took the lead on that. \nSenator Specter, at one point, I think, was involved in that and \nothers. I thank them for their leadership on that issue.\n  I understand the predicament of a company that is facing the White \nHouse and the White House is saying: You need to spy on your customers \nbecause we are asking you to do it for the safety of the people. I \nunderstand their predicament. But I do believe, at this point in time, \nto give retroactive immunity kind of makes a mockery of the fact that \nwe are supposed to be a government of laws, not people. We are \na government of laws. Do we then come back and say: By the way, there \nare three laws over here we don't like so we are going to say to the \npeople who broke them, it is OK, because we have looked at it and we \nthink it is OK? This is America. We are a country of laws. So this \nissue is so important. I can't overstate how deeply I feel about it.\n\n  We cannot place the interests of the companies and, frankly, of this \nadministration, that doesn't want the truth to come out, ahead of the \nconstitutional rights of our citizens who seek justice in our courts. \nThis administration is so desperate to have this immunity because they \nhave no interest in the American people finding out the truth.\n  In another subject area, I had a press conference today with a \nwonderful man who stood up and quit the Environmental Protection Agency \nbecause they were thwarting him every step of the way as he tried to \ntell the truth about the real dangers, as a matter of fact, the \nendangerment posed by global warming. He sent the White House an e-\nmail, and it was entitled ``Endangerment Finding.'' The White House \ncalled and said: Take it back. We don't want to open it. And he said: \nIt is too late. So that e-mail is floating around in cyberspace because \nthe\n\n[[Page S6386]]\n\nWhite House knows, if they open it, it becomes public domain. So \nsecrecy is what this administration lives by.\n  This is a blatant example of where they want to keep secret an \nillegal program. I don't think we should be complicit. I don't think we \nshould enable them to avoid the constitutional scrutiny of our Federal \ncourts. We can't sacrifice--we can't--the truth for convenient \nexpediency. It is not American. We have a system of government that is \nbuilt not only on our Constitution but on the notion of checks and \nbalances. The Federal courts are doing their job by checking this \nadministration's broad exercise of Executive power. That is why I will \nbe supporting other amendments that will be coming up that deal with \nthis matter.\n  Last week, Chief Judge Walker, of the Northern District of \nCalifornia, issued an opinion rejecting this administration's claim to \nhave ``inherent authority'' to eavesdrop on Americans outside of \nstatutory law. What does this Senate want to do? A lot of the leaders \nyou hear speaking on this want to make it possible to give \nretroactively to this administration the inherent authority to \neavesdrop on Americans outside the law. In the future, we are fixing \nit. Good, I am glad. I am happy. But you can't then say, but we are \ngoing to look back and change the law. It is not right.\n  Listen to what Judge Walker wrote:\n\n       Congress appears clearly to have intended to establish the \n     exclusive means for foreign intelligence activities to be \n     conducted. Whatever power the executive might otherwise have \n     had in this regard, FISA limits the power of the executive \n     branch to conduct such activities and it limits the executive \n     branch's authority to assert the State secrets privilege in \n     response to challenges to the legality of its foreign \n     intelligence surveillance activities.\n\n  So we, Congress, limited the power of the executive. We said: You \ncan't assert the state secrets privilege in response to challenges to \nthe legality of its foreign intelligence activities. And here we are \nrolling over with bravado to say to this administration--and by the \nway, I would feel the same way whoever was the President, this \nadministration or any administration--oh, you are the absolute ruler, \nthe King. You can do whatever you want. You can roll over. You can do \nall of that.\n  We need to protect this country from terrorists. We must. I voted to \ngo to war against bin Laden, and I will not rest until he is gone and \nwe break the back of al-Qaida. Unfortunately, that has gone awry. I \nwill be very willing to have our Government listen in on conversations \nof the bad actors out there, but I don't want good people being spied \non. That was the whole reason FISA came into being in the first place. \nPeople seem to forget the original FISA was to protect the people from \nbeing spied on, ordinary people. Suddenly, it has been turned on its \nhead. I believe the current process works. Our system of government \nworks. The Federal courts are exercising their constitutional duty to \nreview Executive power.\n  So why in this bill are we seeking to stop that process? Why are we \nattempting to tie the capable hands of the Federal courts and deny our \ncitizens their day in court? Covering up the truth is not the way to \ngain or regain the trust of the American people. The truth is the basis \nof the American ideal.\n  I always marveled, as a little girl and as a young woman, growing up, \nwatching as the truth came out about America. I remember my dad, who \nloved this country so much, saying to me: Honey, you just watch this \ncountry. We are not afraid to admit a mistake. We are not fearful of \ngiving people rights. We will stand up and tell the truth, even when we \nmake the biggest mistakes.\n  Covering up the truth is not the way to gain the trust of the \nAmerican people. Since learning, in late 2005, that the President \nviolated the trust of our people by spying on our citizens, Congress \nand the American people have struggled to find out what happened. Last \nweek, we celebrated the day we adopted the Declaration of Independence, \nIndependence Day, July 4. In that historic document is the following \nphrase:\n\n       To secure these rights, governments are instituted among \n     men deriving their just powers from the consent of the \n     governed.\n\n  ``The consent of the governed,'' that means the law has to be behind \nyou when you undertake to do something such as this administration did. \nThey didn't care about the consent of the governed. They didn't care \nabout the law that was in place. Truth is the centerpiece of justice. I \ndon't see how we ever get to the truth if we grant this immunity. I \ndon't. It is not, to me, about the punishment.\n  As I said, I will be happy to have substitution, to have the \nGovernment step in. That is not the issue. We need to get to the truth, \nand we all know how that happens in our country. The immunity provision \nin this bill sweeps the warrantless program under the carpet. It hides \nthe truth. The people deserve better from us.\n  I will close with a quote by former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor:\n\n       It is during our most challenging and uncertain moments \n     that our nation's commitment to due process is severely \n     tested. It is in those times we must preserve our commitment \n     at home to the principles for which we fight abroad.\n\n  I hope we will support the Dodd amendment to strike the immunity \nprovision.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I understand we are coming up on a hard \nbreak, as they say in television, for the party lunches.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I note only before we go into that break \nthat the Senator from Pennsylvania has made a number of comments on \ntime for the supporters of the bill that actually deserve a response.\n  One clear point that needs to be made in response to the Senator from \nPennsylvania and the Senator from California is that Judge Walker's \nactions will not be dismissed if retroactive liability protection is \naccorded carriers. It is a case against the United States, not a case \nagainst the telephone companies.\n  Furthermore, I would say that the dictum in Judge Walker's opinion is \ncontrary to higher, more authoritative courts. So Judge Walker was not \ncorrect, and I believe should his case go up on appeal, he will be \nfound not to be accurate. But that does not go, as my colleague from \nWest Virginia has said, to the issue of whether carriers deserve \nretroactive liability protection. So I will reserve my comments, and I \nwill ask to be recognized when--when will the Senate return to session?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. At 2:15 p.m.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized \nfor what remains of time on this side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/08/senate-section/article/S6386-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMissouri is recognized for 29 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the recognition.\n  To begin, to clarify for the floor and our colleagues the arrangement \nthe chairman and I have on this bill, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Rockefeller manage the time in opposition to the Specter \namendment and that I manage the time in opposition to the Dodd and \nBingaman amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier today, the Senate is \npoised to wrap up consideration of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Amendments Act of 2008 in the form of H.R. 6304. Now, most \nof my colleagues know this legislation has had a way of hanging around \nfor quite awhile, being caught up in the congressional process. Many, \nincluding myself, believe we should have passed it well before now, but \nit appears that we are on about the\n\n[[Page S6387]]\n\n5 yard line and ready to move it across into the end zone. As one who \nbelieves this badly needed update to FISA will enhance our Nation's \nsecurity and advance and protect America's civil liberties and privacy \nrights, I certainly hope a strong majority of the Senate will pass this \nlegislation unamended tomorrow.\n  Some of my colleagues have been intent on using Senate procedures to \nslow this legislation to a snail's pace. They have succeeded in doing \nso, first by choosing to ignore the Director of National Intelligence--\nand I will call him the DNI from now on--the DNI's pleas for \nmodernization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, as \nwe will call it, in April 2007, for over 3 months, until August of \n2007, and back in December of 2007 when a Democratic Member \nfilibustered us past the end of the year and into the recess, into \n2008. It came to the floor in February when it took us several weeks to \nwork out a way to move forward; then, once again, over the past few \nweeks, with another Democratic Member filibuster of sorts that pushed \nus past last week's recess. Up until now, we have been delayed, but one \nthing is sure in the Senate. Just as they say in military and basic \ntraining: No matter what you do, you can't stop the clock. Now that \nsome of my colleagues are out of time in delaying any further, the \nSenate will move ahead this week, despite all of these delays.\n  I am very proud of the comprehensive compromise legislation before us \ntoday which passed out of the House with a strong bipartisan vote of \n293 to 129. That was almost 3 weeks ago. As with the Senate's original \nFISA bill that passed several months ago, the compromise that is before \nus required a little give from all sides but, in essence, what we have \nbefore us today is basically the Senate bill all over again. Everyone \nwho studied the language recognizes that. I have here a detailed \nlegislative history that I will ask unanimous consent to be printed in \nthe Record that explains the provisions of the bill. Chairman \nRockefeller submitted his own legislative history before the recess, \nand while we largely agree on the description of the legislation, we do \nhave a few key differences. So as Vice Chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, I believe it is important to make my views and those of \nseveral other Senators a part of the legislative history of this bill \nby including it in the Record. I therefore ask unanimous consent to \nhave this legislative description printed in the Record as part of my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 H.R. 6304, FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008\n\n              Section-by-Section Analysis and Explanation\n\n       This section-by-section analysis is based almost entirely \n     upon the good work of Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, \n     Chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence. Time did \n     not permit us to reach an agreement on text that may have \n     been mutually agreeable to both of us, so I have modified his \n     section-by-section analysis to reflect my own perspective as \n     a co-manager on this important legislation. A careful \n     comparison of these two versions will reveal that there are \n     fewer areas in which our analyses diverge than in which they \n     agree.\n       The consideration of legislation to amend the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (``FISA'') in the 110th \n     Congress began with the submission by the Director of \n     National Intelligence (``DNI'') on April 12, 2007 of a \n     proposed Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Modernization Act \n     of 2007, as Title IV of the Administration's proposed \n     Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The \n     DNI's proposal was the subject of an open hearing on May 1, \n     2007 and subsequent closed hearings by the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence, but was not formally introduced. \n     It is available on the Committee's website: http://\nintelligence.senate\n.gov/070501/bill.pdf.\n       In May 2007, a decision by the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court (FISA Court) led to the creation of \n     significant gaps in our foreign intelligence collection. As a \n     result of this decision, throughout the summer of 2007, the \n     DNI asked Congress to consider his FISA modernization \n     legislation. In response to the DNI's concerns, Congress \n     passed the Protect America Act of 2007, Pub. L. 110-55 \n     (August 5, 2007) (``Protect America Act''). As a result of \n     the Protect America Act, the Intelligence Community was able \n     to close immediately the intelligence gaps that had been \n     created by the court's decision. While the Protect America \n     Act provided important authorities for the collection of \n     foreign intelligence, it did not contain any retroactive \n     civil liability protections for those electronic \n     communication service providers who had assisted with the \n     President's Terrorist Surveillance Program following the \n     September 11th terrorist attacks on our nation.\n       The Protect America Act included a sunset of February 1, \n     2008. After the passage of the Protect America Act, the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman began to draft permanent FISA \n     legislation. S. 2248 was reported by the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence on October 26, 2007 (S. Rep. No. 110-209 \n     (2007)), and then sequentially reported by the Committee on \n     the Judiciary on November 16, 2007 (S. Rep. No. 110-258 \n     (2008)). In the House, the original legislative vehicle was \n     H.R. 3773. It was reported by the Committee on the Judiciary \n     and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on October \n     12, 2007 (H. Rep. No. 110-373 (Parts 1 and 2) (2007)). H.R. \n     3773 passed the House on November 15, 2007. S. 2248 passed \n     the Senate on February 12, 2008, and was sent to the House as \n     an amendment to H.R. 3773. On March 14, 2008, the House \n     returned H.R. 3773 to the Senate with an amendment.\n       No formal conference was convened to resolve the \n     differences between the two Houses on H.R. 3773. Instead, \n     following an agreement reached without a formal conference, \n     the House passed a new bill, H.R. 6304, which contains a \n     complete compromise of the differences on H.R. 3773.\n       H.R. 6304 is a direct descendant of the Protect America Act \n     and S. 2248, which became the basis for the Senate amendment \n     to H.R. 3373 (February 12, 2008) and influenced the House \n     amendment to H.R. 3373 (March 18, 2008). The Protect America \n     Act, H.R. 3773, as well as the original Senate bill, S. 2248, \n     and the legislative history of those measures constitutes the \n     legislative history of H.R. 6304.\n       The section-by-section analysis and explanation set forth \n     below is based on the analysis and explanation in the report \n     of the Select Committee on Intelligence on S. 2248, at S. \n     Rep. No. 110-209, pp. 12-25, as expanded and edited to \n     reflect the floor amendments to S. 2248 and the negotiations \n     that produced H.R. 6304.\n\n\n                      Overall Organization of Act\n\n       The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (``FISA Amendments Act'') \n     contains four titles.\n       Title I includes, in Section 101, a new Title VII of FISA \n     entitled ``Additional Procedures Regarding Certain Persons \n     Outside the United States.'' This new title of FISA (which \n     will sunset in four and a half years) is a successor to the \n     Protect America Act, with amendments. Sections 102 through \n     110 of the Act contain a number of amendments to FISA apart \n     from the collection issues addressed in the new Title VII of \n     FISA. These include a provision that FISA is the exclusive \n     statutory means for electronic surveillance, important \n     streamlining provisions, and a change in the definitions \n     section of FISA (in Section 110 of the bill) to facilitate \n     foreign intelligence collection against proliferators of \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n       Title II establishes a new Title VIII of FISA, entitled \n     ``Protection of Persons Assisting the Government.'' This new \n     title establishes a long-term procedure, in new FISA Section \n     802, for the Government to implement statutory defenses and \n     obtain the dismissal of civil cases against persons, \n     principally electronic communication service providers, who \n     assist elements of the intelligence community in accordance \n     with defined legal documents, namely, orders of the FISA \n     Court or certifications or directives provided for and \n     defined by statute. Section 802 also incorporates a procedure \n     with precise boundaries for civil liability relief for \n     electronic communication service providers who are or may be \n     defendants in civil cases involving an intelligence \n     activity authorized by the President between September 11, \n     2001, and January 17, 2007. In addition, Title II provides \n     for the protection, by way of preemption, of the federal \n     government's ability to conduct intelligence activities \n     without interference by state investigations.\n       Title III directs the Inspectors General of the Department \n     of Justice, the Department of Defense, the Office of National \n     Intelligence, the National Security Agency, and any other \n     element of the intelligence community that participated in \n     the President's Surveillance Program authorized by the \n     President between September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007, \n     to conduct a comprehensive review of the program. The \n     Inspectors General are required to submit a report to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress, within one year, that \n     addresses, among other things, all of the facts necessary to \n     describe the establishment, implementation, product, and use \n     of the product of the President's Surveillance Program, \n     including the participation of individuals and entities in \n     the private sector related to the program.\n       Title IV contains important procedures for the transition \n     from the Protect America Act to the new Title VII of FISA. \n     Section 404(a)(7) directs the Attorney General and the DNI, \n     if they seek to replace an authorization under the Protect \n     America Act, to submit the certification and procedures \n     required in accordance with the new Section 702 to the FISA \n     Court at least 30 days before the expiration of such \n     authorizations, to the extent practicable. Title IV \n     explicitly provides for the continued effect of orders, \n     authorizations, and directives issued under the Protect \n     America Act, and of the provisions pertaining to protection \n     from liability, FISA Court jurisdiction, the use of \n     information acquired, and Executive branch reporting \n     requirements, past the statutory sunset of that act. Title IV \n     also contains provisions on the\n\n[[Page S6388]]\n\n     continuation of authorizations, directives, and orders under \n     Title VII that are in effect at the time of the December 31, \n     2012, sunset, until their expiration within the year \n     following the sunset.\n\n\n               TITLE I. FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE\n\n     Section 101. Targeting the Communications of Persons Outside \n         the United States\n       Section 101(a) of the FISA Amendments Act establishes a new \n     Title VII of FISA. Entitled ``Additional Procedures Regarding \n     Certain Persons Outside the United States,'' the new title \n     includes, with important modifications, an authority similar \n     to that granted by the Protect America Act as temporary \n     sections 105A, 105B, and 105C of FISA. Those Protect America \n     Act provisions had been placed within FISA's Title I on \n     electronic surveillance. Moving the amended authority to a \n     title of its own is appropriate because the authority \n     involves not only the acquisition of communications as they \n     are being carried but also while they are stored by \n     electronic communication service providers.\n     Section 701. Definitions\n       Section 701 incorporates into Title VII the definition of \n     nine terms that are defined in Title I of FISA and used in \n     Title VII: ``agent of a foreign power,'' ``Attorney \n     General,'' ``contents,'' ``electronic surveillance,'' \n     ``foreign intelligence information,'' ``foreign power,'' \n     ``person,'' ``United States,'' and ``United States person.'' \n     It defines the congressional intelligence committees for the \n     purposes of Title VII. Section 701 defines the two courts \n     established in Title I that are assigned responsibilities \n     under Title VII: the FISA Court and the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court of Review. Section 701 also defines \n     ``intelligence community'' as found in the National Security \n     Act of 1947. Finally, Section 701 defines a term, not \n     previously defined in FISA, which has an important role in \n     setting the parameters of Title VII: ``electronic \n     communication service provider.'' This definition is \n     connected to the objective that the acquisition of foreign \n     intelligence pursuant to this title is meant to encompass the \n     acquisition of stored electronic communications and related \n     data.\n     Section 702. Procedures for Targeting Certain Persons Outside \n         the United States Other than United States Persons\n       Section 702(a) sets forth the basic authorization in Title \n     VII, replacing Section 105B of FISA, as added by the Protect \n     America Act. Unlike the Protect America Act, the collection \n     authority in Section 702(a) cannot be exercised until the \n     FISA Court has conducted its review in accordance with \n     subsection (i)(3), or the Attorney General and the DNI, \n     acting jointly, have made a determination that exigent \n     circumstances exist, as defined in Section 702(c)(2). \n     Following such determination and subsequent submission of a \n     certification and related procedures, the Court is required \n     to conduct its review expeditiously. Authorizations must \n     contain an effective date and may be valid for a period of up \n     to one year from that date.\n       Subsequent provisions of the Act implement the prior order \n     and effective date provisions of Section 702(a): in addition \n     to Section 702(c)(2) which defines exigent circumstances, \n     Section 702(i)(1)(B) provides that the court shall complete \n     its review of certifications and procedures within 30 days \n     (unless extended under Section 702(j)(2)); Section \n     702(i)(5)(A) provides for the submission of certifications \n     and procedures to the FISA Court at least 30 days before the \n     expiration of authorizations that are being replaced, to the \n     extent practicable; and Section 702(i)(5)(B) provides for the \n     continued effectiveness of expiring certifications and \n     procedures until the court issues an order concerning their \n     replacements.\n       Section 105B and Section 702(a) differ in other important \n     respects. Section 105B authorized the acquisition of foreign \n     intelligence information ``concerning'' persons reasonably \n     believed to be outside the United States. To make clear that \n     all collection under Title VII must be targeted at persons \n     who are reasonably believed to be outside the United States, \n     Section 702(a) eliminates the word ``concerning'' and instead \n     authorizes ``the targeting of persons reasonably believed to \n     be located outside the United States to collect foreign \n     intelligence information.''\n       Section 702(b) establishes five related limitations on the \n     authorization in Section 702(a). Overall, the limitations \n     ensure that the new authority is not used for surveillance \n     directed at persons within the United States or at United \n     States persons. The first is a specific prohibition on using \n     the new authority to target intentionally any person within \n     the United States. The second provides that the authority may \n     not be used to conduct ``reverse targeting,'' the intentional \n     targeting of a person reasonably believed to be outside the \n     United States if the purpose of the acquisition is to target \n     a person reasonably believed to be in the United States. If \n     the purpose is to target a person reasonably believed to be \n     in the United States, then the electronic surveillance should \n     be conducted in accordance with FISA or the criminal wiretap \n     statutes. The third bars the intentional targeting of a \n     United States person reasonably believed to be outside the \n     United States. In order to target such United States person, \n     acquisition must be conducted under three subsequent sections \n     of Title VII, which require individual FISA court orders for \n     United States persons: Sections 703, 704, and 705. The fourth \n     limitation goes beyond targeting (the object of the first \n     three limitations) and prohibits the intentional acquisition \n     of any communication as to which the sender and all intended \n     recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be \n     located in the United States. The fifth is an overarching \n     mandate that an acquisition authorized in Section 702(a) \n     shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the Fourth \n     Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which provides for ``the \n     right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, \n     papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \n     seizures.''\n       Section 702(c) governs the conduct of acquisitions. \n     Pursuant to Section 702(c)(1), acquisitions authorized under \n     Section 702(a) may be conducted only in accordance with \n     targeting and minimization procedures approved at least \n     annually by the FISA Court and a certification of the \n     Attorney General and the DNI, upon its submission in \n     accordance with Section 702(g). Section 702(c)(2) describes \n     the ``exigent circumstances'' in which the Attorney General \n     and Director of National Intelligence may authorize targeting \n     for a limited time without a prior court order for purposes \n     of subsection (a). Section 702(c)(2) provides that the \n     Attorney General and the DNI may make a determination that \n     exigent circumstances exist because, without immediate \n     implementation of an authorization under Section 702(a), \n     intelligence important to the national security of the United \n     States may be lost or not timely acquired and time does not \n     permit the issuance of an order pursuant to Section 702(i)(3) \n     prior to the implementation of such authorization. Section \n     702(c)(3) provides that the Attorney General and the DNI may \n     make such a determination before the submission of a \n     certification or by amending a certification at any time \n     during which judicial review of such certification is pending \n     before the FISA Court.\n       Section 702(c)(4) addresses the concern, reflected in \n     Section 105A of FISA as added by the Protect America Act, \n     that the definition of electronic surveillance in Title I \n     might prevent use of the new procedures. To address this \n     concern, Section 105A redefined the term ``electronic \n     surveillance'' to exclude ``surveillance directed at a person \n     reasonably believed to be located outside of the United \n     States.'' In contrast, Section 702(c)(4) does not change the \n     definition of electronic surveillance, but clarifies the \n     intent of Congress to allow the targeting of foreign targets \n     outside the United States in accordance with Section 702 \n     without an application for a court order under Title I of \n     FISA. The addition of this construction paragraph, as well as \n     the language in Section 702(a) that an authorization may \n     occur ``notwithstanding any other law,'' makes clear that \n     nothing in Title I of FISA shall be construed to require a \n     court order under that title for an acquisition that is \n     targeted in accordance with Section 702 at a foreign person \n     outside the United States.\n       Section 702(d) provides, in a manner essentially identical \n     to the Protect America Act, for the adoption by the Attorney \n     General, in consultation with the DNI, of targeting \n     procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that \n     collection is limited to targeting persons reasonably \n     believed to be outside the United States. As provided in the \n     Protect America Act, the targeting procedures are subject to \n     judicial review and approval. In addition to the requirements \n     of the Protect America Act, however, Section 702(d) provides \n     that the targeting procedures also must be reasonably \n     designed to prevent the intentional acquisition of any \n     communication as to which the sender and all intended \n     recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be \n     located in the United States. Section 702(d)(2) subjects \n     these targeting procedures to judicial review and approval.\n       Section 702(e) provides that the Attorney General, in \n     consultation with the DNI, shall adopt, for acquisitions \n     authorized by Section 702(a), minimization procedures that \n     are consistent with Section 101(h) or 301(4) of FISA, which \n     establish FISA's minimization requirements for electronic \n     surveillance and physical searches. Unlike the Protect \n     America Act, Section 702(e)(2) provides that the minimization \n     procedures, which are essential to the protection of United \n     States persons, shall be subject to judicial review and \n     approval.\n       Section 702(f) provides that the Attorney General, in \n     consultation with the DNI, shall adopt guidelines to ensure \n     compliance with the limitations in Section 702(b), including \n     prohibitions on the acquisition of purely domestic \n     communications, targeting persons within the United States, \n     targeting United States persons located outside the United \n     States, and reverse targeting. Such guidelines shall also \n     ensure that an application for a court order is filed as \n     required by FISA. It is intended that these guidelines will \n     provide clear requirements and procedures governing the \n     appropriate implementation of the authority under this title \n     of FISA. The Attorney General is to provide these guidelines \n     to the congressional intelligence committees, the judiciary \n     committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate, \n     and the FISA Court. Subsequent provisions implement the \n     guidelines requirement. See Section 702(g)(2)(A)(iii) \n     (certification requirements); Section 702(l)(1) and 702(l)(2) \n     (Attorney General and DNI assessment of compliance with \n     guidelines); and Section 707(b)(1)(G)(ii) (reporting on \n     noncompliance with guidelines).\n       Section 702(g) requires that the Attorney General and the \n     DNI provide to the FISA Court, prior to implementation of an \n     authorization under subsection (a), a written certification, \n     with any supporting affidavits. In\n\n[[Page S6389]]\n\n     exigent circumstances, the Attorney General and DNI may make \n     a determination that, without immediate implementation, \n     intelligence important to the national security may be lost \n     or not timely acquired prior to the implementation of an \n     authorization. It is expected that the Attorney General and \n     the DNI will utilize this ``exigent circumstances'' exception \n     as often as necessary to ensure the protection of our \n     national security. For this reason, the standard to use this \n     authority is much lower than in traditional emergency \n     situations under FISA. In exigent circumstances, if time does \n     not permit the submission of a certification prior to the \n     implementation of an authorization, the certification must be \n     submitted to the FISA Court no later than seven days after \n     the determination is made. The seven-day time period for \n     submission of a certification in the case of exigent \n     circumstances is identical to the time period by which the \n     Attorney General must apply for a court order after \n     authorizing an emergency surveillance under other provisions \n     of FISA, as amended by this Act.\n       Section 702(g)(2) sets forth the requirements that must be \n     contained in the written certification. The required elements \n     are: (1) the targeting and minimization procedures have been \n     approved by the FISA Court or will be submitted to the court \n     with the certification; (2) guidelines have been adopted to \n     ensure compliance with the limitations of subsection (b); (3) \n     those procedures and guidelines are consistent with the \n     Fourth Amendment; (4) the acquisition is targeted at persons \n     reasonably believed to be outside the United States; (5) a \n     significant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign \n     intelligence information; and (6) an effective date for the \n     authorization that in most cases is at least 30 days after \n     the submission of the written certification. Additionally, as \n     an overall limitation on the method of acquisition permitted \n     under Section 702, the certification must attest that the \n     acquisition involves obtaining foreign intelligence \n     information from or with the assistance of an electronic \n     communication service provider.\n       Requiring an effective date in the certification serves to \n     identify the beginning of the period of authorization (which \n     is likely to be a year) for collection and to alert the FISA \n     Court of when the Attorney General and DNI are seeking to \n     begin collection. Section 702(g)(3) permits the Attorney \n     General and DNI to change the effective date in the \n     certification by amending the certification.\n       As with the Protect America Act, the certification under \n     Section 702(g)(4) is not required to identify the specific \n     facilities, places, premises, or property at which the \n     acquisition under Section 702(a) will be directed or \n     conducted. The certification shall be subject to review by \n     the FISA Court.\n       Section 702(h) authorizes the Attorney General and the DNI \n     to direct, in writing, an electronic communication service \n     provider to furnish the Government with all information, \n     facilities, or assistance necessary to accomplish the \n     acquisition authorized under Section 702(a). It is important \n     to note that such directives may be issued only in exigent \n     circumstances pursuant to Section 702(c)(2) or after the FISA \n     Court has conducted its review of the certification and the \n     targeting and minimization procedures and issued an order \n     pursuant to Section 702(i)(3). Section 702(h) requires \n     compensation for this assistance and provides that no cause \n     of action shall lie in any court against an electronic \n     communication service provider for its assistance in \n     accordance with a directive. It also establishes expedited \n     procedures in the FISA Court for a provider to challenge the \n     legality of a directive or the Government to enforce it. In \n     either case, the question for the court is whether the \n     directive meets the requirements of Section 702 and is \n     otherwise lawful. Whether the proceeding begins as a provider \n     challenge or a Government enforcement petition, if the court \n     upholds the directive as issued or modified, the court shall \n     order the provider to comply. Failure to comply may be \n     punished as a contempt of court. The proceedings shall be \n     expedited and decided within 30 days, unless that time is \n     extended under Section 702(j)(2).\n       Section 702(i) provides for judicial review of any \n     certification required by Section 702(g) and the targeting \n     and minimization procedures adopted pursuant to Sections \n     702(d) and 702(e). In accordance with Section 702(i)(5), if \n     the Attorney General and the DNI seek to reauthorize or \n     replace an authorization in effect under the Act, they shall \n     submit, to the extent practicable, the certification and \n     procedures at least 30 days prior to the expiration of such \n     authorization.\n       The court shall review certifications to determine whether \n     they contain all the required elements. It shall review \n     targeting procedures to assess whether they are reasonably \n     designed to ensure that the acquisition activity is limited \n     to the targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located \n     outside the United States and prevent the intentional \n     acquisition of any communication whose sender and intended \n     recipients are known at the time of acquisition to be located \n     in the United States. The Protect America Act had limited the \n     review of targeting procedures to a ``clearly erroneous'' \n     standard; Section 702(i) omits that limitation. For \n     minimization procedures, Section 702(i) provides that the \n     court shall review them to assess whether they meet the \n     statutory requirements. The court is to review the \n     certifications and procedures and issue its order within 30 \n     days after they were submitted unless that time is extended \n     under Section 702(j)(2). The Attorney General and the DNI may \n     also amend the certification or procedures at any time under \n     Section 702(i)(1)(C), but those amended certifications or \n     procedures must be submitted to the court in no more than 7 \n     days after amendment. The amended procedures may be used \n     pending the court's review.\n       If the FISA Court finds that the certification contains all \n     the required elements and that the targeting and minimization \n     procedures are consistent with the requirements of \n     subsections (d) and (e) and with the Fourth Amendment, the \n     court shall enter an order approving their use or continued \n     use for the acquisition authorized by Section 702(a). If \n     it does not so find, the court shall order the Government, \n     at its election, to correct any deficiencies or cease, or \n     not begin, the acquisition. If acquisitions have begun, \n     they may continue during any rehearing en banc of an order \n     requiring the correction of deficiencies. If the \n     Government appeals to the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court of Review, any collection that has \n     begun may continue at least until that court enters an \n     order, not later than 60 days after filing of the petition \n     for review, which determines whether all or any part of \n     the correction order shall be implemented during the \n     appeal.\n       Section 702(j)(1) provides that judicial proceedings are to \n     be conducted as expeditiously as possible. Section 702(j)(2) \n     provides that the time limits for judicial review in Section \n     702 (for judicial review of certifications and procedures or \n     in challenges or enforcement proceedings concerning \n     directives) shall apply unless extended, by written order, as \n     necessary for good cause in a manner consistent with national \n     security.\n       Section 702(k) requires that records of proceedings under \n     Section 702 shall be maintained by the FISA Court under \n     security measures adopted by the Chief Justice in \n     consultation with the Attorney General and the DNI. In \n     addition, all petitions are to be filed under seal and the \n     FISA Court, upon the request of the Government, shall \n     consider ex parte and in camera any Government submission or \n     portions of a submission that may include classified \n     information. The Attorney General and the DNI are to retain \n     directives made or orders granted for not less than 10 years.\n       Section 702(l) provides for oversight of the implementation \n     of Title VII. It has three parts. First, the Attorney General \n     and the DNI shall assess semiannually under subsection (l)(1) \n     compliance with the targeting and minimization procedures, \n     and the Attorney General guidelines for compliance with \n     limitations under Section 702(b), and submit the assessment \n     to the FISA Court and to the congressional intelligence and \n     judiciary committees, consistent with congressional rules.\n       Second, under subsection (l)(2)(A), the Inspector General \n     of the Department of Justice and the Inspector General \n     (``IG'') of any intelligence community element authorized to \n     acquire foreign intelligence under Section 702(a) are \n     authorized to review compliance of their agency or element \n     with the targeting and minimization procedures adopted in \n     accordance with subsections (d) and (e) and the guidelines \n     adopted in accordance with subsection (f). Subsections \n     (l)(2)(B) and (l)(2)(C) mandate several statistics that the \n     IGs shall review with respect to United States persons, \n     including the number of disseminated intelligence reports \n     that contain references to particular known U.S. persons, the \n     number of U.S. persons whose identities were disseminated in \n     response to particular requests, and the number of targets \n     later determined to be located in the United States. Their \n     reports shall be submitted to the Attorney General, the DNI, \n     and the appropriate congressional committees. Section \n     702(l)(2) provides no statutory schedule for the completion \n     of these IG reviews; the IGs should coordinate with the heads \n     of their agencies about the timing for completion of the IG \n     reviews so that they are done at a time that would be useful \n     for the agency heads to complete their semiannual reviews.\n       Third, under subsection (l)(3), the head of an intelligence \n     community element that conducts an acquisition under Section \n     702 shall review annually whether there is reason to believe \n     that foreign intelligence information has been or will be \n     obtained from the acquisition and provide an accounting of \n     information pertaining to United States persons similar to \n     that included in the IG report. Subsection (l)(3) also \n     encourages the head of the element to develop procedures to \n     assess the extent to which the new authority acquires the \n     communications of U.S. persons, and to report the results of \n     such assessment. The review is to be used by the head of the \n     element to evaluate the adequacy of minimization procedures. \n     The annual review is to be submitted to the FISA Court, the \n     Attorney General and the DNI, and to the appropriate \n     congressional committees.\n     Section 703. Certain Acquisition Inside the United States \n         Targeting United States Persons Outside the United States\n       Section 703 governs the targeting of United States persons \n     who are reasonably believed to be outside the United States \n     when the acquisition of foreign intelligence is conducted \n     inside the United States. The authority and procedures of \n     Section 703 apply when the acquisition either constitutes \n     electronic surveillance, as defined in Title I of FISA, or is \n     of stored electronic communications or stored electronic \n     data. If the United States person returns to the United \n     States, acquisition under Section 703 must cease. The \n     Government may always, however, obtain an\n\n[[Page S6390]]\n\n     order or authorization under another title of FISA.\n       The application procedures and provisions for a FISA Court \n     order in Sections 703(b) and 703(c) are drawn from Titles I \n     and III of FISA. Key among them is the requirement that the \n     FISA Court determine that there is probable cause to believe \n     that, for the United States person who is the target of the \n     surveillance, the person is reasonably believed to be located \n     outside the United States and is a foreign power or an agent, \n     officer, or employee of a foreign power. The inclusion of \n     United States persons who are officers or employees of a \n     foreign power, as well as those who are agents of a foreign \n     power as that term is used in FISA, is intended to permit the \n     type of collection against United States persons outside the \n     United States that has been allowed under Executive Order \n     12333 and existing Executive branch guidelines. The FISA \n     Court shall also review and approve minimization procedures \n     that will be applicable to the acquisition, and shall order \n     compliance with such procedures.\n       As with FISA orders against persons in the United States, \n     FISA orders against United States persons outside of the \n     United States under Section 703 may not exceed 90 days and \n     may be renewed for additional 90-day periods upon the \n     submission of renewal applications. Emergency authorizations \n     under Section 703 are consistent with the requirements for \n     emergency authorizations in FISA against persons in the \n     United States, as amended by this Act; the Attorney \n     General may authorize an emergency acquisition if an \n     application is submitted to the FISA Court in not more \n     than seven days.\n       Section 703(g) is a construction provision that clarifies \n     that, if the Government obtains an order and targets a \n     particular United States person in accordance with Section \n     703, FISA does not require the Government to seek a court \n     order under any other provision of FISA to target that United \n     States person while that person is reasonably believed to be \n     located outside the United States.\n     Section 704. Other Acquisitions Targeting United States \n         Persons Outside the United States\n       Section 704 governs other acquisitions that target United \n     States persons who are outside the United States. Sections \n     702 and 703 address acquisitions that constitute electronic \n     surveillance or the acquisition of stored electronic \n     communications. In contrast, Section 704 addresses any \n     targeting of a United States person outside of the United \n     States under circumstances in which that person has a \n     reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would be \n     required if the acquisition occurred within the United \n     States. It thus covers not only communications intelligence, \n     but, if it were to occur, the physical search for foreign \n     intelligence purposes of a home, office, or business of a \n     United States person by an element of the United States \n     intelligence community, outside of the United States.\n       Pursuant to Section 704(a)(3), if the targeted United \n     States person is reasonably believed to be in the United \n     States while an order under Section 704 is in effect, the \n     acquisition against that person shall cease unless authority \n     is obtained under another applicable provision of FISA. The \n     Government may not use Section 704 to authorize an \n     acquisition of foreign intelligence inside the United States.\n       Section 704(b) describes the application to the FISA Court \n     that is required. For an order under Section 704(c), the FISA \n     Court must determine that there is probable cause to believe \n     that the United States person who is the target of the \n     acquisition is reasonably believed to be located outside the \n     United States and is a foreign power, or an agent, officer, \n     or employee of a foreign power. An order is valid for a \n     period not to exceed 90 days, and may be renewed for \n     additional 90-day periods upon submission of renewal \n     applications meeting application requirements.\n       Because an acquisition under Section 704 is conducted \n     outside the United States, or is otherwise not covered by \n     FISA, the FISA Court is expressly not given jurisdiction to \n     review the means by which an acquisition under this section \n     may be conducted. Although the FISA Court's review is limited \n     to determinations of probable cause, Section 704 anticipates \n     that any acquisition conducted pursuant to a Section 704 \n     order will in all other respects be conducted in compliance \n     with relevant regulations and Executive Orders governing the \n     acquisition of foreign intelligence outside the United \n     States, including Executive Order 12333 or any successor \n     order.\n     Section 705. Joint Applications and Concurrent Authorizations\n       Section 705 provides that if an acquisition targeting a \n     United States person under Section 703 or 704 is proposed to \n     be conducted both inside and outside the United States, a \n     judge of the FISA Court may issue simultaneously, upon the \n     request of the Government in a joint application meeting the \n     requirements of Sections 703 and 704, orders under both \n     sections as appropriate. If an order authorizing electronic \n     surveillance or physical search has been obtained under \n     Section 105 or 304, and that order is still in effect, the \n     Attorney General may authorize, without an order under \n     Section 703 or 704, the targeting of that United States \n     person for the purpose of acquiring foreign intelligence \n     information while such person is reasonably believed to be \n     located outside the United States.\n     Section 706. Use of Information Acquired Under Title VII\n       Section 706 fills a void that has existed under the Protect \n     America Act which had contained no provision governing the \n     use of acquired intelligence. Section 706(a) provides that \n     information acquired from an acquisition conducted under \n     Section 702 shall be deemed to be information acquired from \n     an electronic surveillance pursuant to Title I of FISA for \n     the purposes of Section 106 of FISA, which is the provision \n     of Title I of FISA that governs public disclosure or use in \n     criminal proceedings. The one exception is for subsection (j) \n     of Section 106, as the notice provision in that subsection, \n     while manageable in individual Title I proceedings, would \n     present a difficult national security question when applied \n     to a Title VII acquisition. Section 706(b) also provides that \n     information acquired from an acquisition conducted under \n     Section 703 shall be deemed to be information acquired from \n     an electronic surveillance pursuant to Title I of FISA for \n     the purposes of Section 106 of FISA; however, the notice \n     provision of subsection (j) applies. Section 706 ensures a \n     uniform standard for the types of information acquired under \n     the new title.\n     Section 707. Congressional Oversight\n       Section 707 provides for additional congressional oversight \n     of the implementation of Title VII. The Attorney General is \n     to fully inform ``in a manner consistent with national \n     security'' the congressional intelligence and judiciary \n     committees about implementation of the Act at least \n     semiannually. Each report is to include any certifications \n     made under Section 702, the reasons for any determinations \n     made under Section 702(c)(2), any directives issued during \n     the reporting period, a description of the judicial review \n     during the reporting period to include a copy of any order or \n     pleading that contains a significant legal interpretation of \n     Section 702, incidents of noncompliance and procedures to \n     implement the section. With respect to Sections 703 and 704, \n     the report must contain the number of applications made for \n     orders under each section and the number of such orders \n     granted, modified and denied, as well as the number of \n     emergency authorizations made pursuant to each section and \n     the subsequent orders approving or denying the relevant \n     application.\n     Section 708. Savings Provision\n       Section 708 provides that nothing in Title VII shall be \n     construed to limit the authority of the Government to seek an \n     order or authorization under, or otherwise engage in any \n     activity that is authorized under, any other title of FISA. \n     This language is designed to ensure that Title VII cannot be \n     interpreted to prevent the Government from submitting \n     applications and seeking orders under other titles of FISA.\n     Section 101(b). Table of Contents\n       Section 101(b) of the bill amends the table of contents in \n     the first section of FISA.\n     Subsection 101(c). Technical and Conforming Amendments\n       Section 101(c) of the bill provides for technical and \n     conforming amendments in Title 18 of the United States Code \n     and in FISA.\n     Section 102. Statement of Exclusive Means by which Electronic \n         Surveillance and Interception of Certain Communications \n         May Be Conducted\n       Section 102(a) amends Title I of FISA by adding a new \n     Section 112 of FISA. Under the heading of ``Statement of \n     Exclusive Means by which Electronic Surveillance and \n     Interception of Certain Communications May Be Conducted,'' \n     the new Section 112(a) states: ``Except as provided in \n     subsection (b), the procedures of chapters 119, 121 and 126 \n     of Title 18, United States Code, and this Act shall be the \n     exclusive means by which electronic surveillance and the \n     interception of domestic wire, oral, or electronic \n     communication may be conducted.'' New Section 112(b) of FISA \n     provides that only an express statutory authorization for \n     electronic surveillance or the interception of domestic wire, \n     oral, or electronic communications, other than as an \n     amendment to FISA or chapters 119, 121, or 206 of Title 18 \n     shall constitute an additional exclusive means for the \n     purpose of subsection (a). The new Section 112 is based on a \n     provision which Congress enacted in 1978 as part of the \n     original FISA that is codified in Section 2511(2)(f) of Title \n     18, United States Code, and which will remain in the U.S. \n     Code.\n       Section 102(a) strengthens the statutory provisions \n     pertaining to electronic surveillance and interception of \n     certain communications to clarify the express intent of \n     Congress that these statutory provisions are the exclusive \n     means for conducting electronic surveillance and interception \n     of certain communications. This section makes it clear that \n     any existing statute cannot be used in the future as the \n     statutory basis for circumventing FISA. Section 102(a) is \n     intended to ensure that additional exclusive means for \n     surveillance or interceptions shall be express statutory \n     authorizations.\n       In accord with Section 102(b) of the bill, Section 109 of \n     FISA that provides for criminal penalties for violations of \n     FISA, is amended to implement the exclusivity requirement \n     added in Section 112 by making clear that the safe harbor to \n     FISA's criminal offense provision is limited to statutory \n     authorizations for electronic surveillance or the \n     interception of domestic wire, oral, or electronic \n     communications which are pursuant to a provision of FISA, one \n     of the enumerated chapters of the criminal code, or a\n\n[[Page S6391]]\n\n     statutory authorization that expressly provides an additional \n     exclusive means for conducting the electronic surveillance. \n     By virtue of the cross-reference in Section 110 of FISA to \n     Section 109, that limitation on the safe harbor in Section \n     109 applies equally to Section 110 on civil liability for \n     conducting unlawful electronic surveillance.\n       Section 102(c) requires that, if a certification for \n     assistance to obtain foreign intelligence is based on \n     statutory authority, the certification provided to an \n     electronic communication service provider is to include the \n     specific statutory authorization for the request for \n     assistance and certify that the statutory requirements have \n     been met. This provision is designed to assist electronic \n     communication service providers in understanding the legal \n     basis for any government request for assistance.\n       In the section-by-section analysis of S. 2248, the report \n     of the Select Committee on Intelligence (S. Rep. No. 110-209, \n     at 18) described and incorporated the discussion of \n     exclusivity in the 1978 conference report on the original \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, in particular the \n     conferees' description of the analysis in Youngstown Sheet \n     and Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) and the \n     application of the principles described there to the current \n     legislation. That full discussion should be deemed \n     incorporated in this section-by-section analysis.\n       Section 102 of the bill will not--and cannot--preclude the \n     President from exercising his Article II constitutional \n     authority to conduct warrantless foreign intelligence \n     surveillance. At most, this exclusive means provision only \n     places the President at his ``lowest ebb'' under the third \n     prong of the Youngstown case analysis. That is exactly where \n     the President was when FISA was passed back in 1978 and the \n     ``revised'' exclusive means provision in this bill does not \n     change this fact. Even at his lowest ebb, the President's \n     authority with respect to intercepting enemy communications \n     is still quite strong, especially when compared to the non-\n     existent capability of Congress to engage in similar \n     interception activities.\n       Further, Section 102(c) actually reinforces the President's \n     Article II authority, stating that ``if a certification . . . \n     for assistance to obtain foreign intelligence information is \n     based on statutory authority, the certification shall \n     identify the specific statutory provision and shall certify \n     that the statutory requirements have been met.'' The \n     implication from such language is that if a certification is \n     not based on statutory authority, then citing statutory \n     authority would be unnecessary. This language thus \n     acknowledges that certifications may be based on something \n     other than statutory authority, namely the President's \n     inherent constitutional authority.\n     Section 103. Submittal to Congress of Certain Court Orders \n         under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978\n       Section 6002 of the Intelligence Reform Act and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004 (Pub. L. 108-458), added a Title VI to \n     FISA that augments the semiannual reporting obligations of \n     the Attorney General to the intelligence and judiciary \n     committees of the Senate and House of Representatives. Under \n     Section 6002, the Attorney General shall report a summary of \n     significant legal interpretations of FISA in matters before \n     the FISA Court or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of \n     Review. The requirement extends to interpretations presented \n     in applications or pleadings filed with either court by the \n     Department of Justice. In addition to the semiannual summary, \n     the Department of Justice is required to provide copies of \n     court decisions, but not orders, which include significant \n     interpretations of FISA. The importance of the reporting \n     requirement is that, because the two courts conduct their \n     business in secret, Congress needs the reports to know how \n     the law it has enacted is being interpreted.\n       Section 103 adds to the Title VI reporting requirements in \n     three ways. First, as significant legal interpretations may \n     be included in orders as well as opinions, Section 103 \n     requires that orders also be provided to the committees. \n     Second, as the semiannual report often takes many months \n     after the end of the semiannual period to prepare, Section \n     103 accelerates provision of information about significant \n     legal interpretations by requiring the submission of such \n     decisions, orders, or opinions within 45 days. Finally, \n     Section 103 requires that the Attorney General shall submit a \n     copy of any such decision, order, or opinion, and any \n     pleadings, applications, or memoranda of law associated with \n     such decision, order, or opinion, from the period five years \n     preceding enactment of the bill that has not previously been \n     submitted to the congressional intelligence and judiciary \n     committees. The Attorney General, in consultation with the \n     Director of National Intelligence, may authorize redactions \n     of documents submitted in accordance with subsection 103(c) \n     as necessary to protect national security.\n\n\n    Overview of Sections 104 through Section 109; FISA Streamlining\n\n       Sections 104 through 109 amend various sections of FISA for \n     such purposes as reducing a paperwork requirement, modifying \n     time requirements, or providing additional flexibility in \n     terms of the range of Government officials who may authorize \n     FISA actions. Collectively, these amendments are described as \n     streamlining amendments. In general, they are intended to \n     increase the efficiency of the FISA process without depriving \n     the FISA Court of the information it needs to make findings \n     required under FISA.\n     Section 104. Applications for Court Orders\n       Section 104 of the bill strikes two of the eleven \n     paragraphs on standard information in an application for a \n     surveillance order under Section 104 of FISA, either because \n     the information is provided elsewhere in the application \n     process or is not needed.\n       In various places, FISA has required the submission of \n     ``detailed'' information, as in Section 104 of FISA, ``a \n     detailed description of the nature of the information sought \n     and the type of communications or activities to be subjected \n     to the surveillance.'' The DNI requested legislation that \n     asked that ``summary'' be substituted for ``detailed'' for \n     this and other application requirements, in order to reduce \n     the length of FISA applications. In general, the bill \n     approaches this by eliminating the mandate for ``detailed'' \n     descriptions, leaving it to the FISA Court and the Government \n     to work out the level of specificity needed by the FISA Court \n     to perform its statutory responsibilities. With respect to \n     one item of information, ``a statement of the means by which \n     the surveillance will be effected,'' the bill modifies the \n     requirement by allowing for ``a summary statement.''\n       In aid of flexibility, Section 104 increases the number of \n     individuals who may make FISA applications by allowing the \n     President to designate the Deputy Director of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation (``FBI'') as one of those \n     individuals. This should enable the Government to move more \n     expeditiously to obtain certifications when the Director of \n     the FBI is away from Washington or otherwise unavailable.\n       Subsection (b) of Section 104 of FISA is eliminated as \n     obsolete in light of current applications. The Director of \n     the Central Intelligence Agency is added to the list of \n     officials who may make a written request to the Attorney \n     General to personally review a FISA application as the head \n     of the CIA had this authority prior to the establishment of \n     the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n     Section 105. Issuance of an Order\n       Section 105 strikes from Section 105 of FISA several \n     unnecessary or obsolete provisions. Section 105 strikes \n     subsection (c)(1)(F) of Section 105 of FISA which requires \n     minimization procedures applicable to each surveillance \n     device employed because Section 105(c)(2)(A) requires each \n     order approving electronic surveillance to direct the \n     minimization procedures to be followed.\n       Subsection (a)(6) reorganizes, in more readable form, the \n     emergency surveillance provision of Section 105(f), now \n     redesignated Section 105(e), with a substantive change of \n     extending from 3 to 7 days the time by which the Attorney \n     General must apply for and obtain a court order after \n     authorizing an emergency surveillance. The purpose of the \n     change is to ease the administrative burdens upon the \n     Department of Justice, the Intelligence Community, and the \n     FISA Court currently imposed by the three-day requirement.\n       Subsection (a)(7) adds a new paragraph to Section 105 of \n     FISA to require the FISA Court, on the Government's request, \n     when granting an application for electronic surveillance, to \n     authorize at the same time the installation and use of pen \n     registers and trap and trace devices. This change recognizes \n     that when the Intelligence Community seeks to use electronic \n     surveillance, pen register and trap and trace information is \n     often essential to conducting complete surveillance, and the \n     Government should not need to file two separate applications.\n     Section 106. Use of Information\n       Section 106 amends Section 106(i) of FISA with regard to \n     the limitations on the use of unintentionally acquired \n     information. Currently, Section 106(i) of FISA provides that \n     unintentionally acquired radio communication between persons \n     located in the United States must be destroyed unless the \n     Attorney General determines that the contents of the \n     communications indicates a threat of death or serious bodily \n     harm to any person. Section 106 of the bill amends subsection \n     106(i) of FISA by making it technology neutral on the \n     principle that the same rule for the use of information \n     indicating threats of death or serious harm should apply no \n     matter how the communication is transmitted.\n     Section 107. Amendments for Physical Searches\n       Section 107 makes changes to Title III of FISA: changing \n     applications and orders for physical searches to correspond \n     to changes in Sections 104 and 105 on reduction of some \n     application paperwork; providing the FBI with administrative \n     flexibility in enabling its Deputy Director to be a \n     certifying officer; and extending the time, from 3 days to 7 \n     days, for applying for and obtaining a court order after \n     authorization of an emergency search.\n       Section 303(a)(4)(C), which will be redesignated Section \n     303(a)(3)(C), requires that each application for physical \n     search authority state the applicant's belief that the \n     property is ``owned, used, possessed by, or is in transmit to \n     or from'' a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. In \n     order to provide needed flexibility and to make the provision \n     consistent with electronic surveillance provisions, Section \n     107(a)(1)(D) of the bill allows the FBI to apply for \n     authority to search property that also is ``about to be'' \n     owned, used, or possessed by a foreign power or agent of a \n     foreign power, or in transit to or from one.\n\n[[Page S6392]]\n\n     Section 108. Amendments for Emergency Pen Registers and Trap \n         and Trace Devices\n       Section 108 amends Section 403 of FISA to extend from 2 \n     days to 7 days the time for applying for and obtaining a \n     court order after an emergency installation of a pen register \n     or trap and trace device. This change harmonizes among FISA's \n     provisions for electronic surveillance, search, and pen \n     register/trap and trace authority the time requirements that \n     follow the Attorney General's decision to take emergency \n     action.\n     Section 109. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\n       Section 109 contains four amendments to Section 103 of \n     FISA, which establishes the FISA Court and the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review.\n       Section 109(a) amends Section 103 to provide that judges on \n     the FISA Court shall be drawn from ``at least seven'' of the \n     United States judicial circuits. The current requirement--\n     that the eleven judges be drawn from seven judicial circuits \n     (with the number appearing to be a ceiling rather than a \n     floor) has proven unnecessarily restrictive or complicated \n     for the designation of the judges to the FISA Court.\n       Section 109(b) amends Section 103 to allow the FISA Court \n     to hold a hearing or rehearing of a matter en banc, which is \n     by all the judges who constitute the FISA Court sitting \n     together. The Court may determine to do this on its own \n     initiative, at the request of the Government in any \n     proceeding under FISA, or at the request of a party in the \n     few proceedings in which a private entity or person may be a \n     party, i.e., challenges to document production orders under \n     Title V, or proceedings on the legality or enforcement of \n     directives to electronic communication service providers \n     under Title VII.\n       Under Section 109(b), en banc review may be ordered by a \n     majority of the judges who constitute the FISA Court upon a \n     determination that it is necessary to secure or maintain \n     uniformity of the court's decisions or that a particular \n     proceeding involves a question of exceptional importance. En \n     banc proceedings should be rare and in the interest of the \n     general objective of fostering expeditious consideration of \n     matters before the FISA Court.\n       Section 109(c) provides authority for the entry of stays, \n     or the entry of orders modifying orders entered by the FISA \n     Court or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of \n     Review, pending appeal or review in the Supreme Court. This \n     authority is supplemental to, and does not supersede, the \n     specific provision in Section 702(i)(4)(B) that acquisitions \n     under Title VII may continue during the pendency of any \n     rehearing en banc and appeal to the Court of Review subject \n     to the requirement for a determination within 60 days under \n     Section 702(i)(4)(C).\n       Section 109(d) provides that nothing in FISA shall be \n     construed to reduce or contravene the inherent authority of \n     the FISA Court to determine or enforce compliance with an \n     order or a rule of that court or with a procedure approved by \n     it. The recognition in subsection (d) of the FISA Court's \n     inherent authority to determine or enforce compliance with a \n     court order, rule, or procedure does not authorize the Court \n     to assess compliance with the minimization procedures used in \n     the foreign targeting context. This conclusion is based upon \n     three observations.\n       First, Section 702 contains no explicit statutory provision \n     that authorizes the FISA Court to assess compliance with the \n     minimization procedures in the foreign targeting context. If \n     it had so desired, Congress could have included a specific \n     statutory authorization like those included in Sections \n     105(d)(3), 304(d)(3), and 703(c)(7). In fact, there were \n     several unsuccessful efforts during the legislative process \n     to include a specific statutory authorization in this bill.\n       Second, the Court's inherent authority to review and \n     approve minimization procedures in the context of domestic \n     electronic surveillance or physical searches is different \n     from its inherent authority to review and approve \n     minimization procedures in the foreign targeting context. In \n     the domestic context, the Court must direct that the \n     minimization procedures be followed. See Sections \n     105(c)(2)(A), 304(c)(2)(A), and 703(c)(5)(A). There is no \n     such requirement in the foreign targeting context. Instead, \n     the Court's judicial review is limited to assessing whether \n     the procedures meet the definition of minimization procedures \n     under FISA. See Section 702(i)(2)(C). When the Court issues \n     an order under Section 702, it merely enters an order \n     approving the use of the minimization procedures for the \n     acquisition. See 702(i)(3)(A). This limitation on the scope \n     of the Court's order in the foreign targeting context should \n     be interpreted as not providing the Court with any inherent \n     authority to assess compliance with the approved minimization \n     procedures in the foreign targeting context.\n       Finally, assessing compliance with minimization procedures \n     in the foreign targeting context has historically been a \n     responsibility performed by the Executive branch. This bill \n     preserves that responsibility by requiring the Attorney \n     General and the Director of National Intelligence to assess \n     compliance with the minimization procedures on a semi-annual \n     basis. See Section 702(l)(1). Inspectors General of each \n     element of the Intelligence Community are authorized to \n     review compliance with the adopted minimization procedures. \n     See Section 702(l)(2). Also, the heads of each element of the \n     Intelligence Community are required to conduct an annual \n     review to evaluate the adequacy of the minimization \n     procedures used by their element in conducting a particular \n     acquisition. See Section 702(l)(3). Conversely, the FISA \n     Court has little, if any, historical experience with \n     assessing compliance with minimization in the context of \n     foreign targeting. There are significant differences between \n     the scope, purpose, and means by which the acquisition of \n     foreign intelligence is conducted in the domestic and foreign \n     targeting contexts. While the FISA Court is well-suited to \n     assess compliance with minimization procedures in the \n     domestic context, such assessment is better left to the \n     Executive branch in the foreign targeting context.\n     Section 110. Weapons of Mass Destruction\n       Section 110 amends the definitions in FISA of foreign power \n     and agent of a foreign power to include individuals who are \n     not United States persons and entities not substantially \n     composed of United States persons that are engaged in the \n     international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \n     Section 110 also adds a definition of weapon of mass \n     destruction to the Act that defines weapons of mass \n     destruction to cover explosive, incendiary, or poison gas \n     devices that are designed, intended to, or have the \n     capability to cause a mass casualty incident or death, and \n     biological, chemical and nuclear weapons that are designed, \n     intended to, or have the capability to cause illness or \n     serious bodily injury to a significant number of persons. \n     Section 110 also makes corresponding technical and conforming \n     changes to FISA.\n\n\n  TITLE II. PROTECTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS\n\n       This title establishes a new Title VIII of FISA. The title \n     addresses liability relief for electronic communication \n     service providers who have been alleged in various civil \n     actions to have assisted the U.S. Government between \n     September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007, when the Attorney \n     General announced the termination of the Terrorist \n     Surveillance Program. In addition, Title VIII contains \n     provisions of law intended to implement statutory defenses \n     for electronic communication service providers and others who \n     assist the Government in accordance with precise, existing \n     legal requirements, and provides for federal preemption of \n     state investigations. The liability protection provisions of \n     Title VIII are not subject to sunset.\n     Section 801. Definitions\n       Section 801 establishes definitions for Title VIII. Several \n     are of particular importance.\n       The term ``assistance'' is defined to mean the provision \n     of, or the provision of access to, information, facilities, \n     or another form of assistance. The word ``information'' is \n     itself described in a parenthetical to include communication \n     contents, communication records, or other information \n     relating to a customer or communications. ``Contents'' is \n     defined by reference to its meaning in Title I of FISA. By \n     that reference, it includes any information concerning the \n     identity of the parties to a communication or the existence, \n     substance, purport, or meaning of it.\n       The term ``civil action'' is defined to include a ``covered \n     civil action.'' Thus, ``covered civil actions'' are a subset \n     of civil actions, and everything in new Title VIII that is \n     applicable generally to civil actions is also applicable to \n     ``covered civil actions.'' A ``covered civil action'' has two \n     key elements. It is defined as a civil action filed in a \n     federal or state court which (1) alleges that an electronic \n     communication service provider (a defined term) furnished \n     assistance to an element of the intelligence community and \n     (2) seeks monetary or other relief from the electronic \n     communication service provider related to the provision of \n     the assistance. Both elements must be present for the lawsuit \n     to be a covered civil action.\n       The term ``person'' (the full universe of those protected \n     by Section 802) is necessarily broader than the definition of \n     electronic communication service provider. The aspects of \n     Title VIII that apply to those who assist the Government in \n     accordance with precise, existing legal requirements apply to \n     all who may be ordered to provide assistance under FISA, such \n     as custodians of records who may be directed to produce \n     records by the FISA Court under Title V of FISA or \n     landlords who may be required to provide access under \n     Title I or III of FISA, not just to electronic \n     communication service providers.\n     Section 802. Procedures for Implementing Statutory Defenses\n       Section 802 establishes procedures for implementing \n     statutory defenses. Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no civil action may lie or be maintained in a federal or \n     state court against any person for providing assistance to an \n     element of the intelligence community, and shall be promptly \n     dismissed, if the Attorney General makes a certification to \n     the district court in which the action is pending. (If an \n     action had been commenced in state court, it would have to be \n     removed, pursuant to Section 802(g) to a district court, \n     where a certification under Section 802 could be filed.) The \n     certification must state either that the assistance was not \n     provided (Section 802(a)(5)) or, if furnished, that it was \n     provided pursuant to specific statutory requirements \n     (Sections 802(a)(1-4)). Three of these underlying \n     requirements, which are specifically described in Section 802 \n     (Sections 802(a)(1-3)), come from existing law. They include: \n     an order of the FISA Court directing assistance, a \n     certification in writing under Sections 2511(2)(a)(ii)(B) or \n     2709(b) of Title 18, or directives to electronic\n\n[[Page S6393]]\n\n     communication service providers under particular sections of \n     FISA or the Protect America Act.\n       The Attorney General may only make a certification under \n     the fourth statutory requirement, Section 802(a)(4), if the \n     civil action is a covered civil action (as defined in Section \n     801(5)). To satisfy the requirements of Section 802(a)(4), \n     the Attorney General must certify first that the assistance \n     alleged to have been provided by the electronic communication \n     service provider was in connection with an intelligence \n     activity involving communications that was (1) authorized by \n     the President between September 11, 2001 and January 17, 2007 \n     and (2) designed to detect or prevent a terrorist attack or \n     preparations for one against the United States. In addition, \n     the Attorney General must also certify that the assistance \n     was the subject of a written request or directive, or a \n     series of written requests or directives, from the Attorney \n     General or the head (or deputy to the head) of an element of \n     the intelligence community to the electronic communication \n     service provider indicating that the activity was (1) \n     authorized by the President and (2) determined to be lawful. \n     The report of the Select Committee on Intelligence contained \n     a description of the relevant correspondence provided to \n     electronic communication service providers (S. Rep. No. 110-\n     209, at 9).\n       The district court must give effect to the Attorney \n     General's certification unless the court finds it is not \n     supported by substantial evidence provided to the court \n     pursuant to this section. In its review, the court may \n     examine any relevant court order, certification, written \n     request or directive submitted by the Attorney General \n     pursuant to subsection (b)(2) or by the parties pursuant to \n     subsection (d).\n       If the Attorney General files a declaration that disclosure \n     of a certification or supplemental materials would harm \n     national security, the court shall review the certification \n     and supplemental materials in camera and ex parte, which \n     means with only the Government present. A public order \n     following that review shall be limited to a statement as to \n     whether the case is dismissed and a description of the legal \n     standards that govern the order, without disclosing the basis \n     for the certification of the Attorney General. The purpose of \n     this requirement is to protect the classified national \n     security information involved in the identification of \n     providers who assist the Government. A public order shall not \n     disclose whether the certification was based on an order, \n     certification, or directive, or on the ground that the \n     electronic communication service provider furnished no \n     assistance. Because the district court must find that the \n     certification--including a certification that states that a \n     party did not provide the alleged assistance--is supported by \n     substantial evidence in order to dismiss a case, an order \n     failing to dismiss a case is only a conclusion that the \n     substantial evidence test has not been met. It does not \n     indicate whether a particular provider assisted the \n     government.\n       Subsection (d) makes clear that any plaintiff or defendant \n     in a civil action may submit any relevant court order, \n     certification, written request, or directive to the district \n     court for review and be permitted to participate in the \n     briefing or argument of any legal issue in a judicial \n     proceeding conducted pursuant to this section, to the extent \n     that such participation does not require the disclosure of \n     classified information to such party. The authorities of the \n     Attorney General under Section 802 are to be performed only \n     by the Attorney General, the Acting Attorney General, or the \n     Deputy Attorney General.\n       In adopting the portions of Section 802 that allow for \n     liability protection for those electronic communication \n     service providers who may have participated in the program of \n     intelligence activity involving communications authorized by \n     the President between September 11, 2001, and January 17, \n     2007, the Congress makes no statement on the legality of the \n     program. The extension of immunity in Section 802 also \n     reflects the Congress's determination that the electronic \n     communication service providers acted on a good faith belief \n     that the President's program, and their assistance, was \n     lawful. Both of these assertions are in accord with the \n     statements in the report of the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee. S. Rep. No. 110-209, at 9.\n     Section 803. Preemption of State Investigations\n       Section 803 addresses actions taken by a number of state \n     regulatory commissions to force disclosure of information \n     concerning cooperation by state regulated electronic \n     communication service providers with U.S. intelligence \n     agencies. Section 803 preempts these state actions and \n     authorizes the United States to bring suit to enforce the \n     prohibition.\n     Section 804. Reporting\n       Section 804 provides for oversight of the implementation of \n     Title VIII. On a semiannual basis, the Attorney General is to \n     provide to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     on any certifications made under Section 802, a description \n     of the judicial review of the certifications made under \n     Section 802, and any actions taken to enforce the provisions \n     of Section 803.\n     Section 202. Technical Amendments\n       Section 202 amends the table of contents of the first \n     section of FISA.\n\n\n                 TITLE III. REVIEW OF PREVIOUS ACTIONS\n\n       Title III directs the Inspectors General of the Department \n     of Justice, the Office of the Director of National \n     Intelligence, the Department of Defense, the National \n     Security Agency, and any other element of the intelligence \n     community that participated in the President's surveillance \n     program, defined in the title to mean the intelligence \n     activity involving communications that was authorized by the \n     President during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, \n     and ending on January 17, 2007, to complete a comprehensive \n     review of the program with respect to the oversight authority \n     and responsibility of each Inspector General.\n       The review is to include: (1) all of the facts necessary to \n     describe the establishment, implementation, product, and use \n     of the product of the program; (2) access to legal reviews of \n     the program and information about the program; (3) \n     communications with, and participation of, individuals and \n     entities in the private sector related to the program; (4) \n     interaction with the FISA Court and transition to court \n     orders related to the program; and (5) any other matters \n     identified by any such Inspector General that would enable \n     that inspector general to complete a review of the program \n     with respect to the Inspector General's department or \n     element. While other versions of this Inspector General audit \n     provision may have included the requirement that the \n     Inspectors General review the ``substance'' of the legal \n     reviews or opinions regarding the President's Terrorist \n     Surveillance Program, this bill expressly excludes that \n     language. Thus, it is not intended for the Inspectors General \n     to determine or consider the legality of the Terrorist \n     Surveillance Program.\n       The Inspectors General are directed to work in conjunction, \n     to the extent practicable, with other Inspectors General \n     required to conduct a review, and not unnecessarily duplicate \n     or delay any reviews or audits that have already been \n     completed or are being undertaken with respect to the \n     program. In addition, the Counsel of the Office of \n     Professional Responsibility of the Department of Justice is \n     directed to provide the report of any investigation of that \n     office relating to the program, including any investigation \n     of the process through which the legal reviews of the program \n     were conducted and the substance of such reviews, to the \n     Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who shall \n     integrate the factual findings and conclusions of such \n     investigation into its review.\n       The Inspectors General shall designate one of the Senate \n     confirmed Inspectors General required to conduct a review to \n     coordinate the conduct of the reviews and the preparation of \n     the reports. The Inspectors General are to submit an interim \n     report within sixty days to the appropriate congressional \n     committees on their planned scope of review. The final report \n     is to be completed no later than one year after enactment and \n     shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a \n     classified annex.\n\n\n                       TITLE IV. OTHER PROVISIONS\n\n     Section 401. Severability\n       Section 401 provides that if any provision of this bill or \n     its application is held invalid, the validity of the \n     remainder of the Act and its application to other persons or \n     circumstances is unaffected.\n     Section 402. Effective Date\n       Section 402 provides that except as provided in the \n     transition procedures (Section 404 of the title), the \n     amendments made by the bill shall take effect immediately.\n     Section 403. Repeals\n       Section 403(a) provides for the repeal of those sections of \n     FISA enacted as amendments to FISA by the Protect America \n     Act, except as provided otherwise in the transition \n     procedures of Section 404, and makes technical and conforming \n     amendments.\n       Section 403(b) provides for the sunset of the FISA \n     Amendments Act on December 31, 2012, except as provided in \n     Section 404 of the bill. This date ensures that the \n     amendments by the Act will be reviewed during the next \n     presidential administration. The subsection also makes \n     technical and conforming amendments.\n     Section 404. Transition Procedures\n       Section 404 establishes transition procedures for the \n     Protect America Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act Amendments of 2008.\n       Subsection (a)(1) continues in effect orders, \n     authorizations, and directives issued under FISA, as amended \n     by Section 2 of the Protect America Act, until the expiration \n     of such order, authorization or directive.\n       Subsection (a)(2) sets forth the provisions of FISA and the \n     Protect America Act that continue to apply to any acquisition \n     conducted under such Protect America Act order, authorization \n     or directive. In addition, subsection (a) clarifies the \n     following provisions of the Protect America Act: the \n     protection from liability provision of subsection (l) of \n     Section 105B of FISA as added by Section 2 of the Protect \n     America Act; jurisdiction of the FISA Court with respect to a \n     directive issued pursuant to the Protect America Act, and the \n     Protect America Act reporting requirements of the Attorney \n     General and the DNI. Subsection (a) is made effective as of \n     the date of enactment of the Protect America Act (August 5, \n     2007). The purpose of these clarifications and the effective \n     date for them is to ensure that there are no gaps in the \n     legal protections contained in that act, including for \n     authorized collection following the sunset of the Protect \n     America Act, notwithstanding that its sunset provision was \n     only extended once until February\n\n[[Page S6394]]\n\n     16, 2008. Additionally, subsection (a)(3) fills a void in the \n     Protect America Act and applies the use provisions of Section \n     106 of FISA to collection under the Protect America Act, in \n     the same manner that Section 706 does for collection under \n     Title VII.\n       In addition, subsection (a)(7) makes clear that if the \n     Attorney General and the DNI seek to replace an authorization \n     made pursuant to the Protect America Act with an \n     authorization made under Section 702, as added by this bill, \n     they are, to the extent practicable, to submit a \n     certification to the FISA Court at least 30 days in advance \n     of the expiration of such authorization. The authorizations, \n     and any directives issued pursuant to the authorization, are \n     to remain in effect until the FISA Court issues an order with \n     respect to that certification.\n       Subsection (b) provides similar treatment for any order of \n     the FISA Court issued under Title VII of this bill in effect \n     on December 31, 2012.\n       Subsection (c) provides transition procedures for the \n     authorizations in effect under Section 2.5 of Executive Order \n     12333. Those authorizations shall continue in effect until \n     the earlier of the date that authorization expires or the \n     date that is 90 days after the enactment of this Act. This \n     transition provision is particularly applicable to the \n     transition to FISA Court orders that will occur as a result \n     of Sections 703 and 704 of FISA, as added by this bill.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, before the recess I mentioned how the press \npicked up on the similarities between this bill and the Senate bill and \nhow they kept asking me to help find out the big changes in the bill \nthat no one could find. Well, they stopped asking me that question \nbecause they realized there is not much that is significantly \ndifferent, save some cosmetic fixes that satisfied the House Democratic \nleadership. Since we started with a bipartisan product here in the \nSenate, that means we still have a very strong bipartisan bill before \nus.\n  I am very pleased that the strong liability protections the Senate \nbill offered are still in place and our vital intelligence sources and \nintelligence methods will be safeguarded. I am pleased this compromise \npreserves the ability of the intelligence community to collect foreign \nintelligence quickly and in exigent circumstances without any prior \ncourt review. I am also pleased that the 2012 sunset--3 years longer \nthan any sunset previously offered in any House bill--will give our \nintelligence collectors the certainty they need and the tools they use \nto keep us safe. I am confident that the few changes we made to the \nSenate bill in H.R. 6304 will not diminish the intelligence community's \nability to target terrorists overseas, and the Director of National \nIntelligence--the DNI--and the Attorney General agree.\n  I will highlight for my colleagues five of the six main tweaks to the \nSenate bill that we find in the bill before us, as nuanced as they may \nbe. I say ``five'' because one of these tweaks I explained in detail \nbefore the recess. I trust all of my colleagues remember that \ndiscussion very clearly. It was that the civil liability protection \nprovision was slightly modified but still ensures that the companies \nwho may, in good faith, have assisted the Government in the terrorist \nsurveillance program, or TSP, will receive relief. Another way to \ndescribe it is that we have essentially provided the district court \nwith an appellate standard review just as we did in the Senate bill. \nCongress affirms in this legislation that the lawsuits will be \ndismissed unless the district court judge determines that the Attorney \nGeneral's certification was not supported by substantial evidence based \non the information the Attorney General provides to the court. The \nintent of Congress is clear. The Intelligence Committee found that the \ncompanies deserve liability protection. They were asked by legitimate \nGovernment authorities to assist them in a program to keep our country \nsafe. They did it, and now they are being thanked by lawsuits designed \nnot only to destroy their reputation but to destroy the program.\n  There are several misconceptions that were brought up in the \ndiscussions today. Several have said that we don't know what we are \ngranting immunity for; we shouldn't grant it without reviewing the \nlitigation; and there were 70 Members of the Senate who haven't even \nbeen briefed on the program. Well, the reason the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence was set up was to review some of the most \nimportant and highly classified intelligence-gathering activities of \nthe intelligence community. It was agreed, as we all believe very \nstrongly, that these are very important tools. No. 1, they must be \noverseen carefully to make sure that the constitutional rights, the \nprivacy rights of American citizens, are protected, and at the same \ntime, within the constitutional framework, the ability of the limited \nauthority of the intelligence community to collect the intelligence is \nnot inhibited. That is what the Senate Intelligence Committee has done \nin reporting out this bill on a 13-to-2 vote. I am very pleased that \nour colleagues showed confidence in us by passing this, essentially the \nsame measure, 68 to 29 in February.\n  There are some who say we don't even know whom we are granting \nimmunity to or what we are granting it to. Very simply, the people--the \ncarriers, the good citizens--who responded to the request to protect \nour country from terrorist acts are now being sued, and some of them \nwho didn't even participate may be sued. They can't say whether they \nparticipated. We are only saying if the Attorney General provides \ninformation to be judged on an appellate standard that is not without \nsubstantial supporting evidence, then these companies should be \ndismissed, either because they didn't participate or they participated \nin good faith.\n  It does not, as I pointed out, say the Government cannot be sued. \nThere are some who believe--and I think they are wrong--that the \nPresident's TSP was unlawful. That can be litigated in the court \nsystem. It is being litigated. I will discuss further Judge Walker's \nopinion and why I think it is wrong and it will not stand up, but that \ndoesn't change the fact that at the time the Attorney General told \nthese American companies, these good citizens, that it was lawful for \nthem to participate and they needed that help, they provided that help, \nand helped to keep our country safe. We should not thank them by \nslapping them with lawsuits that would not only destroy their \nreputation, endanger their personnel here and abroad, but potentially \ndisclose even more of the operations of our very sensitive electronic \nsurveillance program. The more the terrorists who wish to do us harm \nlearn about it, the better able they are to defend against it.\n  These three amendments all seek to destroy that protection provided \nby good corporate citizens, patriotic Americans who are responding to a \ndirective of the President, approved by the Attorney General.\n  Moving on to the first of the five items I haven't discussed, the \nfirst item is the concept of prior court review that was included in \nthis language. It is important for all of us to understand that prior \ncourt review is not prior court approval. Prior court approval occurs \nwhen the court approves the actual acquisition of electronic \nsurveillance as it does in the domestic FISA context. Prior court \nreview, on the other hand, is limited to the court's review of the \nGovernment's certification and the targeting and minimization \nprocedures. The prior court review contained in this bill is \nessentially the same as it was under the bipartisan Senate bill. \nHowever, the timing has been changed to allow the court to conduct its \nreview before the Attorney General and the DNI authorize actual \nacquisition.\n  The bottom line here is that what many of us feared in prior court \napproval scenarios has been avoided. To ensure that will always remain \nthe case, we have included a generous ``exigent circumstances'' \nprovision offered by House Majority Leader Hoyer that allows the \nAttorney General and the DNI to act immediately if intelligence may be \nlost or not timely acquired. I thank Leader Hoyer for that suggestion. \nThus, a finding of exigent circumstances requires a much lower \nthreshold than an emergency under traditional FISA.\n  One of our nonnegotiables in reaching this agreement is that the \ncontinued intelligence collection would be assured and uninterrupted by \ncourt procedures and delays. It is only because this broad ``exigent \ncircumstances'' exemption allows for continuous collection that I can \nwholeheartedly support this nuanced version of prior court review of \nthe DNI and the AG authorizations.\n  Second, we agreed to language insisted upon by House Speaker Pelosi \nregarding an ``exclusive means'' provision. I am confident that the \nexclusive means provision we have agreed to will not--and indeed \ncannot--preclude the\n\n[[Page S6395]]\n\nPresident from exercising his constitutional authority to conduct \nwarrantless foreign intelligence surveillance. That is the President's \narticle II constitutional power that no statute can remove, and case \nlaw, including recent statements in opinions by the FISA Court itself, \nreaffirmed this.\n  I am aware, as several people have discussed, of the district court's \nruling last week in California where, in a suit against the Government, \nthe judge stated in dicta that:\n\n       Congress appears clearly to have intended to--and did--\n     establish the exclusive means for foreign intelligence \n     surveillance activities to be conducted.\n  Interestingly, Judge Walker ignored legislative history which \nacknowledged the President's inherent constitutional authority. Even \nthough it may have been placed at the lowest ebb, if you agree with \nthat interpretation of the constitutional limitations cited in the \nSenate Intelligence Committee report on the Senate FISA bill, he still \nhas that authority.\n  For a variety of reasons, I strongly believe Judge Walker's decision \nwill not stand on appeal. As to the court's comments on exclusive \nmeans, there is a fair amount of dictum standing in opposition to his \nopinion. I happen to think it is right.\n  For example, the FISA Court in 2002 ruled In re: Sealed Case--a very \nimportant decision which I urge everybody to read, if they have time--\nnoted with approval the U.S. Fourth Circuit's holding in the Truong \ncase that the President does have ``inherent authority to conduct \nwarrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information.''\n  The Truong case involved a U.S. person in the United States, and the \nsurveillance was ordered by the Carter administration without getting a \nwarrant. The Fourth Circuit upheld that action in the criminal \nprosecution of Truong.\n  These decisions, along with others like them, were ignored by the \nanalysis of the district court judge last week. At most, this exclusive \nmeans provision only places the President at his lowest ebb under the \nthird prong of the steel seizure case analysis, which I do not accept \nas being valid. But if you use that test, it still exists.\n  That is exactly where the President was when FISA was passed in 1978, \nand the revised exclusive means provision in this bill does not change \nthat fact.\n  We should remember, however, even at its lowest ebb, the President's \nauthority with respect to intercepting enemy communications is still \nquite strong, especially when compared to the nonexistent capability of \nCongress to engage in similar interception activities.\n  It has been said that the President initiated this without any \ncongressional notice. I was not among them at the time, but I \nunderstand the Gang of 8 was thoroughly briefed before they started \nthis program. The Gang of 8, for those who may be listening and may not \nbe aware, consists of the Republican and Democratic leaders and second \nleaders in this body and the other body and the Democratic and \nRepublican leaders of the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees. \nI believe these people were briefed on this program, and I understand \nthat advice was given in that meeting that we could not change the FISA \nstatute to enable the collection of vital information in any timely \nfashion; that we could not wait to start listening in on foreign \nterrorists abroad, possibly plotting against this country, until we \npassed it.\n  I think they were right. It has been 15 months since we were told \nthat we needed to revise FISA. Outside of one 6-month, 15-day patch \nthat we elected to adopt last August, we have not been able to change \nit. I hope a mere 15 months will allow us to change it. But the fact \nis, had we not had the concurrence of the Gang of 8 in the TSP, it is \nlikely we would not be talking with shock and horror about 9/11, but we \nwould be talking about other similar incidents occurring in the United \nStates.\n  I believe with respect to the Speaker's own language, conditional \nlanguage that she offered to us, it actually reinforces the President's \narticle II authority. That bill language we accepted states:\n\n       If a certification . . . for assistance to obtain foreign \n     intelligence information is based on statutory authority, the \n     certification shall identify the specific statutory provision \n     and shall certify that the statutory requirements have been \n     met.\n\n  The obvious implication from this language is if a certification is \nnot based on statutory authority, then citing statutory authority would \nbe unnecessary. This language acknowledges that certifications may be \nbased on something other than statutory authority; namely, the \nPresident's inherent constitutional authority. Furthermore, the DNI and \nAttorney General have assured me there will not be any operational \nimpediments due to this provision. From a constitutional perspective, \nthis language actually improved upon what we were looking at before in \nthe Senate.\n  What Congress is clearly saying in this language is FISA is the \nexclusive statutory means for conducting electronic surveillance for \nintelligence purposes.\n  I am well aware that some will argue that there is no nonstatutory or \nconstitutional means, but I can remember a long time ago when I was in \na basic constitutional law course in law school that the Constitution \ntrumps statutes. What the Constitution gives in rights or powers or \nauthority cannot be exterminated, eliminated, or taken out by statute.\n  The courts have clearly said the President has that constitutional \nauthority. I mentioned the Carter administration and the Truong case, \nbut on a historical note, it is interesting to note that when President \nClinton ordered a warrantless physical search, not electronic \neavesdropping but a more intrusive, actual physical search of Aldrich \nAmes' residence in 1993, Congress responded by seeking to bolster the \nPresident's authority by updating FISA to include physical searches.\n  Aldrich Ames is a U.S. citizen, probably still in prison. Let's pause \nand think about that: President Clinton ordered a warrantless physical \nsearch of an American citizen inside the United States, and what did \nCongress do? Congress sought to assist the President instead of accuse \nhim of illegal activity. It sought to help him. I would hope some of my \ncolleagues would take a similar approach as we did with President \nClinton before.\n  Third, as a part of our compromise with the House Democrats, we \nagreed to replace our version of what we call a carve-out from the \ndefinition of electronic surveillance with their definition of a carve-\nout which they call construction. Operationally, there is no difference \nbetween the two approaches, but we think our approach is more \nforthright with the American people because we put our carve-out right \nup front instead of burying it several chapters later in title VII of \nFISA as they wanted to do.\n  Why did they do this? I am sure this is not of great moment to \nanybody here, but let me say that it was clear from negotiations the \nother side wanted to be able to come out of the negotiations and say: \nWe wrestled the Republicans back to the original definition of \n``electronic surveillance'' in the 1978 FISA Act, but they failed to \nmention they buried their carve-out deep in this legislation, and it \nhas the same effect.\n  They also failed to remind folks it was the original language of the \n1978 FISA Act that, due to technology changes, got us into this mess in \nthe first place.\n  Last year, when the DNI first asked us to modernize FISA, he \nrequested we create a technology-neutral definition of ``electronic \nsurveillance.'' I believed then and I still believe we should redefine \n``electronic surveillance.'' FISA is complicated enough, and we should \nbe forthright with the American people.\n  But some other leaders prefer for political reasons to bury \nconstruction provisions deep within the bill instead of presenting an \nupfront, crystal-clear carve-out. One consequence of their approach is \nthat the same acquisition activities the Government uses to target non-\nU.S. persons overseas will trigger both the definition of electronic \nsurveillance in title I of FISA and the construction provision in \nsection 7.\n  Essentially, we have agreed to build an unnecessary internal \ninconsistency in statute as a political compromise. I reluctantly \nagreed to do this because the DNI and the Attorney General assured us \nthat going for the carve-out\n\n[[Page S6396]]\n\nnow would not create any operational problems for the intelligence \ncommunity, but we should fix this in the future during less politically \ncharged times.\n  For historical note, it should be remembered that the American \nGovernment was able to intercept radio communications long before we \ngot into this stage of the intercepts without getting court orders. \nThey were intercepting overseas communications which might have been \ncoming into the United States, and they followed the same procedure \nthat we do now. That was called the procedure of minimization for \ninnocent conversations. Just like the case back when the radio \ninterceptions were going forward, there is not, as I have said before, \nany evidence that we have seen that innocent Americans were being \nlistened in on.\n\n  The bugaboo that this gives the intelligence community the right to \nlisten in on ordinary citizens' conversations willy-nilly, without any \nlimitations, is absolutely false. That is why we built in the \nprotections in the law. That is why we have the layers of supervision \nto make sure it does not happen.\n  Fourth, we included a provision for coordinated inspector general \naudits of the TSP. However, the IGs will not review the substance of \nthe legal reviews related to the President's TSP. In other words, they \nwill not review whether the program was lawful.\n  I know some colleagues are saying the opposite in the media, but I \nencourage them to read the language because it is accurate. It is \naccurate that the IGs will not review whether the program was lawful.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee already conducted an exhaustive \nreview of the TSP and found no legal or unlawful conduct. There is no \nneed for an IG audit to second-guess the bipartisan determination. \nNumerous IGs have already conducted reviews, and several reviews are \nongoing. I cannot imagine the IG finding out anything different than \nthey already have or that the Intelligence Committee has found for that \nmatter. But it does make for good politics in an election year to say \nCongress mandated these reviews even if, in some cases, they will \nsimply be doing reviews that have already been done. To reach \nagreement, we reluctantly agreed to a more redundant review on the \noverly taxed intelligence community.\n  I offer to those who want to challenge the lawfulness of the \nPresident's Terrorist Surveillance Program that this bill does not \nblock plaintiff suits against the Government or Government officials. \nWe only offer civil liability protection for providers in the bill. The \ncourt case I mentioned earlier against the Government will be able to \nproceed unaffected by this legislation.\n  Fifth, and finally, we agreed to a 5-year sunset instead of 6 years. \nI don't like sunsets. As intelligence community leaders have told us, \nthere are no sunsets in fatwahs against the United States issued by al-\nQaida leaders. I only agreed to a 6-year sunset in the Senate bill as a \nbipartisan compromise. But even with a 5-year sunset, Congress is \nunlikely to take up FISA reform again in the fall of a Presidential \nelection year, and I trust they will have the good wisdom to push the \nsunset out longer so they don't find themselves in an election year \ngoing through the same drill. Regardless, there is little operational \nimpact.\n  Remember, it is the job of the House and Senate Intelligence \nCommittees to conduct ongoing, continuing oversight of electronic \nsurveillance, as well as the rest of the intelligence community's \nprograms. If we see the need to make changes before sunset, we will. A \nsunset does not change that.\n  In the end, I am proud to say we accomplished our collective goals of \nmaking sure we have a bill with clear authorities for foreign \ntargeting, with strong protections for U.S. persons, and with civil \nliability protection for those providers who allegedly assisted with \nthe President's TSP. We are in a better position today than we were a \nfew months ago legislatively because we not only have the Senate bill \nbefore us in essence all over again--and one that received 68 votes the \nlast time--but we have it before us already having passed the House. We \nknow we have a bill we can send straight to the President that the \nAttorney General and DNI would support and the President can sign into \nlaw.\n  Should we fail to do so, there is a real danger we could fall back \ninto the trap we were in last summer when because of the existing \nunderlying outmoded FISA bill, we put the intelligence community out of \nbusiness of collecting much vital intelligence during a brief period, \nfar too long, but brief nevertheless.\n  Why is having essentially the Senate bill with minor tweaks before us \nall over again a major bipartisan victory? I answer: Because the Senate \nbill we passed a few months ago was the delicate bipartisan compromise \nthat took months to produce. We had the bipartisan product that \nincreased civil liability protections more than ever before and gave \nour intelligence operators the tools they needed to keep us safe. I am \nproud of that bipartisan bill, proud to have negotiated with the House \nto bring it back to the Senate with essentially the same position in a \nmajor bipartisan victory for all sides.\n\n  Mr. President, I will reserve the rest of my comments in appreciation \nof my colleagues. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator from Missouri will \nyield for two questions?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has used his time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Chair repeat that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has used his entire \n29 minutes allocated under the previous order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will yield myself 5 minutes from my \ntime on the amendment which is scheduled later this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Missouri consent to \nbeing questioned by the Senator from Pennsylvania?\n  Mr. BOND. Of course. I would be honored.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The first question I have relates to the Senator's \ncontention that the action by the Intelligence Committee is sufficient.\n  We know from the representations made earlier today that some 70 \nMembers of the Senate have not been briefed on this subject, and the \nHouse leadership has said that the majority of the House Members have \nnot been briefed on this subject. There is no question that a Member's \nconstitutional authority cannot be delegated to another Member. Under \nthe procedures of the Senate and the House but focusing on the Senate, \nwhich is where we are, the committees hear the matters, they file \nreports, they make disclosure to the full body, and the full body then \nacts.\n  The question I have for the Senator from Missouri is: How can some 70 \nMembers of the Senate be expected to cast an intelligent vote granting \nretroactive immunity to a program that the Senators have not been \nbriefed on and don't know about, in light of the clear-cut rule that we \ncannot delegate our constitutional responsibilities?\n  Mr. BOND. Well, to reply to my friend--who served in the past on the \nIntelligence Committee, I believe--that committee was set up to handle \nmatters that involved the most critical classified information. The \ncommittee was set up, long before I came to the Senate, to provide a \nforum, a bipartisan group of Senators with a very able staff, to go \nover everything that was done in the intelligence community, to oversee \nit, to make sure it was proper, to make sure it stayed within the \nguidelines and to provide support and change it where necessary.\n  Now, I have fought very strongly, alongside my colleague, the \nchairman, to get the full committee briefed on all these programs. As I \nhave said before, the terrorist surveillance program was not briefed to \nthe full committee, it was briefed and then oversight held with eight \npeople. This, to me, was a mistake. I believe it should have been \nbriefed to the entire committee, but the members of that group of eight \ndid know about it and were briefed about it.\n  Now, I might say to my good friend, the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nthat we have many important committees putting out legislation on the \nfloor. No person can participate in all the committee work. No person \ncan be involved\n\n[[Page S6397]]\n\nin every committee. So we have to take the reports, and usually on a \nbipartisan agreement or disagreement, based on what our colleagues in \nthose committees have studied, have reviewed, and have found to be the \ncase. In this case, an overwhelmingly bipartisan majority of 13 to 2, \nafter studying the bill and the question for 6 months and engaging in \nabout 2 solid months of hard work, found out it was appropriate to give \nretroactive liability protection to these companies that had acted in \ngood faith.\n  We were shown the certifications and the authorizations that went to \nthem, and I believe, based on my legal background, that those were \nadequate and sufficient for these companies to participate. Let us \nremember, these were critical times. We had just experienced an attack. \nWe were being threatened with more attacks. The Government went to some \nof these--not all of them but some--companies and said: Please help us. \nYou must help us. We believe in the committee that their actions should \nnot be punished but should be rewarded by preventing them from being \nharassed by lawsuits.\n  The legality of the program, if it is to be judged, was not one for a \njudgment for those companies to make, but it will be played out in \nJudge Walker's and other courtrooms.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on my time, which we are on, may I say, \nbefore moving to the second brief question, that I admire what the \nSenator from Missouri has done as vice chairman. I see his diligent \nwork, and I know what the Intelligence Committee is involved with \nbecause I served on it for 8 years and chaired it in the 104th \nCongress. But when the Senator from Missouri delineates even the fewer \nmembers within the Intelligence Committee who were briefed, it \nunderscores my point, and that is that most Senators haven't been \nbriefed.\n  While it is true every Senator does not know what is in every \ncommittee report, at least every Senator has access to it, and it is \nnot a matter where there are secret facts and there has been no \nbriefing of them, or where there has been no disclosure and they are \ncalled upon to vote. Significantly, the Senator does not deny that no \nSenator can delegate his constitutional authority, and that is exactly \nwhat 70 Senators will be doing.\n  Let me move within my 5-minute time limit because time is fleeting \nand there is a great deal to argue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 6 minutes. There is 4 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have here litigation which has been ongoing in the \nFederal court in San Francisco for several years, and a very extended \nopinion was filed on July 20 of 2006 by Chief Judge Walker on the \ntelephone case on the state secrets doctrine, and that case is now on \nappeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  Here we have a context where the Congress has been totally \nineffective in limiting executive authority, where the Executive has \nviolated the specific mandate of the National Security Act of 1947 to \nbrief all members of the Intelligence Committee. It hasn't been done. \nThe Congress has been ineffective on the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, where the Supreme Court denied cert, as I said \nearlier today, and ducked the decision. Although from the dissenting \nopinion in the Sixth Circuit, they could have found the requisite \nstanding. Now we have Chief Judge Walker coming down with a 56-page \nopinion last Wednesday, which does bear on the telephone case. I \nconcede, as the Senator from Missouri has said, that the telephone \ncompanies have been good citizens. But there is a way to save them \nharmless with the amendment I offered in February to substitute the \nGovernment in the shoes of the telephone companies.\n  Have they had problems with their reputation? Well, perhaps so, but \nthey can withstand that. Have they had legal expenses? Well, those can \nbe compensated by indemnity from the Government. We are all called upon \nto make sacrifices. My father, who served in World War I, was wounded \nin action. My brother served in World War II. I served 2 years in the \nKorean war, stateside. I don't think the telephone companies, given \ntheir positions, as regulated companies, have been asked for too much. \nI think it is highly unlikely they would ever have to pay a dime, but \nthat could all be handled by substitution, so we look at a situation \nwhere we can both have this electronic surveillance program continue \nand not give up court jurisdiction through court stripping.\n  So that brings me to my question: Does the Senator from Missouri now \nknow of any case--there have been jurisdictional issues of a variety of \nsorts--but any case involving constitutional rights, which has been \npending for more than 3 years and is in midstream on appeal to the \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit--from a very learned opinion \nhanded down by Chief Judge Walker in 2006--when the Congress has \nstepped in and taken the case away from the courts, in a context where \nthere is no other way to get a judicial determination on the \nconstitutionality of this conduct?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am happy to answer my colleague. He has \nstated that the Executive has violated the laws. Not under the \nconstitutional authority that I have outlined. The FISA Court itself \nrecognized what he fails to understand; that it is not a question of \nthe carriers being held liable for any amount of money. Because I agree \nwith him, they are not going to find anybody liable. But what they \nwould do, by continuing having this out in open hearing, is to disclose \nthe most secretive methods and procedures used by our intelligence \ncommunity, giving the terrorists and those who seek to do us harm a \nroadmap for getting around it and avoiding those intercepts.\n  Now, what it would also do is expose those companies to tremendous \npublic scorn and possibly even to injury to their property or to their \npersonnel. Where they operate overseas, they might be attacked. When we \nstarted this debate, my colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, \nwas talking about how an unwarranted disclosure of a question about one \nof the vitally important exchanges operating in Chicago had cost \nbillions of dollars to that exchange.\n  When you leak out something that is classified, when you leak out \nsomething that is secret, you can have a tremendous impact, and every \nshareholder of that exchange and every shareholder, whether it be in \nyour pension fund or anyone else, of one of the carriers that might be \ndrawn out and drawn into court in one of these actions, would lose \nsignificantly.\n  Now, to answer the question put specifically by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, the cases against the Government are not blocked. The \ncases against the Government are not blocked. If we are looking for a \nmeans of determining the constitutionality, which I believe exists--he \nobviously doesn't believe exists. OK, we have a disagreement. He is a \nlearned lawyer, and I studied constitutional law a long time ago. We \nhave different views. I can line up a bunch of constitutional law \nprofessors on my side. I am sure he can do the same. But that court can \ngo forward because a suit really is a suit against the government.\n  I think he is right when he is saying he doesn't want to hurt the \ncompanies. I don't believe any significant number of Members of this \nbody want to hurt the employees or their shareholders of the companies \nthat may have participated because they were true American heroes. But \nif he wants to solve the problem that he has--getting court review--\nthen there is no bar in this legislation to a suit against the \nGovernment, a Government officer, or a Government agent.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is advised he \nhas used all his time--13 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield myself 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. On my time, Mr. President.\n  When the Senator from Missouri talks about being exposed to risks or \nphysical harm, that is happening to American soldiers every day around \nthe world, as we know. It happened to my father serving in World War I. \nThere are certain risks, physical or otherwise, which have to be \nsustained in a democracy doing our duty. We talk about money, about \ncosts. Dollars and cents don't amount to a hill of beans when you are \ntalking about constitutional rights.\n  When the Senator from Missouri talks about the case can continue\n\n[[Page S6398]]\n\nagainst the Government, that is a fallacious argument. The Government \nhas the defense of governmental immunity. The telephone companies do \nnot have that.\n  I offered the amendment in February to have the Government step into \nthe shoes of the telephone companies with no different defenses. They \nwould have state secrets but no governmental immunity. That was turned \ndown. It is a very different matter to drop suits as to the telephone \ncompanies. They do not have governmental immunity. It is very \ndifferent. Significantly, when challenged for any case which has been \ngoing on for years, with these kinds of opinions by the Chief Judge in \nSan Francisco and on appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit, for the Congress to step in and take away jurisdiction is an \nanathema. In the context of congressional ineffectiveness on oversight \non separation of powers and in the context of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, which, as I elaborated earlier today, has ducked it, the \nonly way to get this decision is to let the courts proceed. Congress is \nineffective on curtailing executive authority. That is why I think it \nis so important that we can both keep this surveillance program and at \nthe same time protect constitutional rights.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 15 minutes, so he has \n45 minutes remaining on his amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could the Presiding Officer please \nindicate what the order of sequence of events is at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is authorized to \noffer his amendment with 1 hour of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me defer to my friend from Michigan. Let me \nindicate I will plan to use the first 15 minutes of the 30 minutes \nallocated to me to make a statement now, and then Senator Casey from \nPennsylvania will take 5 minutes, and then Senator Levin from Michigan \nwill have the remaining 10 minutes. That is my plan.\n  I believe the Senator from Michigan wanted to state a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I thank my friend \nfrom New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Under the plan that was just stated, if 10 minutes is \nyielded to this Senator, can the 10 minutes be used at any time this \nafternoon or must it follow immediately in sequence to either Senator \nCasey or Senator Bingaman?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes would have to be used sometime \nthis afternoon.\n  Mr. LEVIN. At any time this afternoon. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5066\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask to call up amendment No. 5066.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Casey, and Mr. Specter, proposes an amendment numbered \n     5066.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To stay pending cases against certain telecommunications \n  companies and provide that such companies may not seek retroactive \n     immunity until 90 days after the date the final report of the \nInspectors General on the President's Surveillance Program is submitted \n                              to Congress)\n\n       Beginning on page 88, strike line 23 and all that follows \n     through page 90, line 15, and insert the following:\n       ``(a) Requirement for Certification.--\n       ``(1)  In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law other than paragraph (2), a civil action may not lie or \n     be maintained in a Federal or State court against any person \n     for providing assistance to an element of the intelligence \n     community, and shall be promptly dismissed, if the Attorney \n     General certifies to the district court of the United States \n     in which such action is pending that--\n       ``(A) any assistance by that person was provided pursuant \n     to an order of the court established under section 103(a) \n     directing such assistance;\n       ``(B) any assistance by that person was provided pursuant \n     to a certification in writing under section 2511(2)(a)(ii)(B) \n     or 2709(b) of title 18, United States Code;\n       ``(C) any assistance by that person was provided pursuant \n     to a directive under section 102(a)(4), 105B(e), as added by \n     section 2 of the Protect America Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-\n     55; 121 Stat. 553), or 702(h) directing such assistance;\n       ``(D) in the case of a covered civil action, the assistance \n     alleged to have been provided by the electronic communication \n     service provider was--\n       ``(i) in connection with an intelligence activity involving \n     communications that was--\n\n       ``(I) authorized by the President during the period \n     beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on January 17, \n     2007; and\n       ``(II) designed to detect or prevent a terrorist attack, or \n     activities in preparation for a terrorist attack, against the \n     United States; and\n\n       ``(ii) the subject of a written request or directive, or a \n     series of written requests or directives, from the Attorney \n     General or the head of an element of the intelligence \n     community (or the deputy of such person) to the electronic \n     communication service provider indicating that the activity \n     was--\n\n       ``(I) authorized by the President; and\n       ``(II) determined to be lawful; or\n\n       ``(E) the person did not provide the alleged assistance.\n       ``(2) Limitation on implementation.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Attorney General may not make a \n     certification for any civil action described in paragraph \n     (1)(D) until after the date described in subparagraph (C).\n       ``(B) Stay of civil actions.--During the period beginning \n     on the date of the enactment of the FISA Amendments Act of \n     2008 and ending on the date described in subparagraph (C), a \n     civil action described in paragraph (1)(D) shall be stayed by \n     the court in which the civil action is pending.\n       ``(C) Date described.--The date described in this \n     subparagraph is the date that is 90 days after the final \n     report described in section 301(c)(2) of the FISA Amendments \n     Act of 2008 is submitted to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress, as required by such section.''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment cosponsored by \nSenators Casey and Specter. The main thrust of this amendment is to \nmake a point that this legislation which is currently before us puts \nthe cart before the horse. As soon as we enact the legislation, it \nessentially grants telecommunications companies retroactive immunity \nfor their past actions, but then after the fact, after they have been \ngranted that retroactive immunity, it requires that an in-depth \ninvestigation occur regarding what those activities actually were.\n  The purpose of the amendment I am offering is simply to put the horse \nand the cart in the right order. I believe this chart makes the case \nvery well. Let me just allude to this chart.\n  First, let's look at the process for dismissing lawsuits under the \ncurrent bill, the way the bill now pends. That is the top line here. \nYou can see the first step would be to enact provisions that would set \nup a procedure for the telecom companies to seek the retroactive \nimmunity.\n  Second, in the middle here, in accordance with the underlying \nprovisions, the pending civil cases would almost certainly be promptly \ndismissed as soon as the Attorney General makes the necessary \ncertifications.\n  Then the last step, over here at the right--it is very difficult to \nread from any distance, but the last step says, ``IG's investigation \nand report to Congress.'' The last step would be investigation about \nwhether the companies' participation in the President's warrantless \nwiretapping program was lawful and whether the relevant inspectors \ngeneral can report back to Congress with their findings within a year. \nThat is a requirement in the bill, that they do that report within 1 \nyear.\n  Basically, the current bill's approach is to grant the immunity first \nand investigate later, after the companies have already been provided \nwith legal liability protection for whatever it is later determined \nthey have been engaged in. The amendment I am offering would change \nthis by modifying the timing of the process that enables these telecom \ncompanies to seek immunity, and it changes it so that the investigation \nof what has occurred would occur first. Only after that investigation \nhas been completed would we allow the immunity to be granted.\n  Under the amendment--this is the bottom part of this chart--the first \nstep would still be to enact the legislation establishing the \nprocedures for companies to seek immunity. At the same time, the \namendment would stay all of the pending court cases against the telecom \ncompanies, thereby putting all those cases on hold. The second\n\n[[Page S6399]]\n\nstep would be to allow the inspectors general--that is, from each of \nthese Federal agencies that are designated in the statute--allow the \ninspectors general to conduct their investigation and to inform \nCongress about what they found. The amendment would then give Congress \n90 days to review those findings, after which time the companies could \ngo ahead and seek dismissal of their lawsuits. So the dismissal of the \nlawsuits would be the last step and not the first step and could only \noccur after the investigation was complete and after Congress had an \nopportunity to review their report that has been done.\n  The bill does recognize that it is important to understand all the \nfacts surrounding the President's warrantless program. I am glad the \nlegislation requires that the relevant inspectors general come to \nCongress with a report on the subject. This review will cover the \nestablishment and implementation and use of the surveillance program, \nas well as the participation of private telecom companies.\n  However, as I have discussed, the bill also allows the same telecom \ncompanies to immediately seek and to obtain retroactive immunity for \ntheir participation in the program as soon as the bill becomes law. And \nthat is a mistake, in my view. I find it troubling that Congress would \nconfer immunity before the full extent of the companies' participation \nin the program is known. Maybe these companies acted in good faith, as \nsome of my colleagues have argued. Maybe they did not. I don't know, \nmyself, what the facts are, but, like most Members of Congress who do \nnot sit on the Intelligence Committee or the Judiciary Committee, I \nreceived very little information regarding what actually did occur. I \ndo know, however, that their participation in an unlawful, warrantless \nsurveillance program is a serious issue. It deserves the in-depth \nreview we call for in this legislation, but it deserves that review \nbefore we grant those companies blanket protection for their past \nactions. If we go down this path without first conducting the thorough \nreview, we may very well look back with great regret.\n  To me, a much more sensible approach would be to have the \ncomprehensive IG report submitted to Congress before companies are \nallowed to seek dismissal of their suits. The amendment would stay all \nof the civil cases against the telecom companies. It would allow time \nfor the inspectors general to investigate the circumstances surrounding \nthe President's warrantless surveillance program. It would give \nCongress the 90 days to review what is found in the IG's report.\n  While retaining the overall substance and structure of the bill, this \nwould give Congress an opportunity, even though it is a brief \nopportunity, to at least review the inspectors general report before \nthe companies would be permitted to apply for immunity. If Congress \ndoes not affirmatively pass legislation within 90 days of getting the \nreport from the inspectors general, then the companies would be free to \nseek relief from the court.\n  I would also like to take just a minute to discuss what the amendment \nwould not do. The amendment is not a deal breaker. The amendment would \nnot remove or alter the substantive provisions in the immunity title of \nthe bill. With passage of this amendment, those provisions would remain \nintact. Personally, I am opposed to retroactive immunity, but the \namendment I am offering does not change the substance of those \nprovisions.\n  Additionally, by staying the pending lawsuits, the companies would \nnot be subject to the costs of litigation during the development of the \nIG report or while Congress reviews the report's findings. Proceedings \nin these cases would be suspended until the called-for report is \ndelivered to Congress and the 90 days have passed.\n  Some of my colleagues have expressed concerns that unless we \nimmediately grant the telecom companies retroactive immunity, they will \nrefuse to provide assistance in the future. I think that is unfounded. \nClearly they are under an obligation to do so under the language of \nthis bill.\n  Regardless of whether Senators generally favor the legislation or are \nadamantly opposed to it; that is, the underlying legislation, I hope my \ncolleagues will agree that this amendment is a reasonable modification \nwhich would, in fact, improve the bill.\n  Let me point out one other red herring that has come up. In a letter \nto Senate leadership dated yesterday, July 7, the administration urged \nthat my amendment:\n\n        . . . fails to address the risk that on-going litigation \n     will result in the release of sensitive national security \n     information, a risk that, if realized, could cause grave harm \n     to the national security.\n\n  I suggest the Attorney General and the Director of National \nIntelligence need to read the amendment I am offering. As I stated, the \namendment puts all of the cases on hold. There would be no ongoing \nactivity during the time that proceedings in these cases were stayed, \nso there is no activity that could create a risk of releasing sensitive \ninformation.\n  This is a good amendment. It would improve this bill. It would make \nit more logical and certainly improve our ability to understand what it \nis we are being asked to grant immunity for. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes in opposition.\n  When the inspector general audit provisions were first discussed in \nthe House and Senate, there was a great concern that these audits would \nbe used to delay or deny essential civil liability protections. \nUnfortunately, this amendment shows that these concerns were justified.\n  When negotiating this compromise legislation with House Majority \nLeader Hoyer, I agreed in good faith to a limited inspector general \nreview of the President's terrorist surveillance program even though \nthis program has been reviewed up and down on a bipartisan basis by the \nSenate Intelligence Committee and no abuse or wrongdoing had been \nfound.\n  Now, in what I could only assume is a political move to undermine the \ncritical civil liability protections in this bill, this amendment \ndelays any liability protection until 90 days after the inspector \ngeneral review of the bill is completed. What is supposed to happen \nafter that is anything but clear, but I can only assume that will be \nfollowed by yet another effort to delay liability relief. That is \nextraordinarily and unacceptably unfair to those providers that \nassisted the Government in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist \nattacks. We owe them our thanks, not our continued partisan \nmaneuvering.\n  Earlier, we heard a justification for exposing these providers to \npublic light, having participated in a classified program. The \nassertion was made: It is like our troops who go abroad and go under \nfire. Mr. President, as the father of a son who spent 20 months in the \nlast 3 years as a marine sniper in Iraq, I can tell you that they go \nunder tremendous threat and tremendous danger. But they are extremely \nwell trained, they are extremely well supported, and they are extremely \nwell armed.\n  To say with a straight face that we can subject private companies to \nthat, private companies with American citizens working for them, and \nthat we don't care if they are attacked when they don't have any \nprotection, they don't have any weapons, they don't have any training, \nI think goes way too far.\n  That is not reasonable. Let's not hear any more of that stuff, that \nthey should be put in the same position as our trained military men and \nwomen who go into battle accepting the risks of battle. These people, \nthese good American citizens, did not expect to be under physical \nattack.\n  How often are we going to tell those patriotic Americans we have to \ndelay further any halt to the lawsuits so we can ``review'' the \nterrorist surveillance program? Enough is enough. Inspectors general \nhave very clear roles in our Government. They determine if there is \nwaste, fraud, or abuse. Their review under title IV of this bill is \nessentially for these purposes. They will not determine whether the TSP \nwas lawful. They will not determine whether the providers acted in good \nfaith. That is for the court to do.\n  So exactly what purpose does it serve to delay liability relief to \nthese companies? The only purpose I can think of is to appease these \nliberal activists who\n\n[[Page S6400]]\n\nhave tried repeatedly throughout this FISA debate to tie the hands of \nthe intelligence community and punish these companies with frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  What message are we sending to all of those private partners who help \nour intelligence community, our military, our law enforcement community \non a daily basis far beyond the FISA context: Help us now, but we \ncannot guarantee that years later you will not be taken to the cleaners \nbecause you did. Is that an incentive? Is that the way we want to deal \nwith fellow Americans whose help we need?\n  I appreciate there is serious debate about whether the President has \narticle II authority to conduct surveillance. But this is a debate that \nshould not impact whether these providers, who trusted their \nGovernment, who in good faith, on the word of the Attorney General, \nhelped to ensure our homeland did not suffer another terrorist attack. \nAnd we think they should be treated fairly and protected.\n  We need to remember the Senate Intelligence Committee conducted an \nexhaustive review of the TSP. It found no evidence of illegal or \nunlawful conduct either by the providers or the Government. We agreed \non a bipartisan basis, ratified by the Senate, that the providers acted \nin good faith. So I do not see how waiting to give them the fair and \njust relief they deserve advances any goals. It is more likely, the \nlonger these lawsuits, these frivolous lawsuits go on, that our most \nsensitive sources and methods will be revealed. It becomes much more \nlikely that the providers who helped us will refuse to do so unless we \ngo through a lengthy process to compel them.\n  We went without cooperation for some time when the act expired, and \nit was only on the assurance of prompt action that they were able to \nwithstand shareholder pressure and the advice of lawyers not to worry.\n  The Attorney General and the DNI sent a letter on July 7. It says:\n\n       Any FISA modernization bill must contain effective legal \n     protection for those companies sued because they're believed \n     to have helped the Government prevent terrorist attacks. \n     Liability protection, a fair and just result, is necessary to \n     ensure the continued assistance of the private sector.\n       H.R. 6304 contains such protection, but the amendment \n     addressed in this letter\n\n  Essentially the Bingaman amendment--\n\n     would unnecessarily delay implementation of the protections \n     with the purpose of deferring any decision on this issue for \n     more than a year.\n       Accordingly, we as well as the President's other senior \n     advisors will recommend that the President veto any bill that \n     includes such an amendment. The Intelligence Committee has \n     recognized the intelligence community cannot obtain \n     intelligence it needs without assistance from these \n     companies. We recognize that the companies in the future may \n     be less willing to assist the Government if they face the \n     threat of lawsuits, and we know that a delay could result in \n     the very degradation and the cooperation that this bill was \n     designed to provide. Continued delay in protecting those who \n     provided assistance will be invariably noted by those who may \n     some day be called upon to help us again.\n       Finally, by raising the prospect that the litigation at \n     issue could eventually proceed, this amendment fails to \n     address the risks that ongoing litigation will result in \n     release of national security sensitive information, a risk \n     that if realized could cause grave harm to national security.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time on this side. I ask unanimous \nconsent that after the Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized, the \nchairman of the committee be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter addressed to Leader Reid \nfrom the DNI and the Attorney General be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     July 7, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: This letter presents the views of the \n     Administration on an amendment to the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 (``FISA'') Amendments Act of 2008 \n     (H.R. 6304) that was not covered in our letter of June 26, \n     2008. As we stated in that letter, we strongly support \n     enactment of H.R. 6304, which would represent an historic \n     modernization of FISA to reflect dramatic changes in \n     communications technology over the last 30 years. This bill, \n     which passed the House of Representatives by a wide margin of \n     293-129, is the result of a bipartisan effort that will place \n     the Nation's foreign intelligence effort in this area on a \n     firm, long-term foundation. The bill provides our \n     intelligence professionals the tools they need to protect the \n     country and protects companies whose assistance is vital to \n     this effort from lawsuits for past and future cooperation \n     with the Government.\n       As we have previously noted, any FISA modernization bill \n     must contain effective legal protections for those companies \n     sued because they are believed to have helped the government \n     prevent terrorist attacks in the aftermath of September 11, \n     2001. Liability protection is the fair and just result and is \n     necessary to ensure the continued assistance of the private \n     sector. H.R. 6304 contains such protection, but the amendment \n     addressed in this letter would unnecessarily delay \n     implementation of the protections with the purpose of \n     deferring any decision on this issue for more than a year. \n     This amendment would reportedly foreclose an electronic \n     communication service provider from receiving retroactive \n     liability protection until 90 days after the Inspectors \n     General of various departments, as required by section 301 of \n     H.R. 6304, complete a comprehensive review of, and submit a \n     final report on, communications intelligence activities \n     authorized by the President between September 11, 2001, and \n     January 17, 2007. The final report is not due for a year \n     after the enactment of the bill. Any amendment that would \n     delay implementation of the liability protections in this \n     manner is unacceptable. Providing prompt liability protection \n     is critical to the national security. Accordingly, we, as \n     well as the President's other senior advisors, will recommend \n     that the President veto any bill that includes such an \n     amendment.\n       Continuing to deny appropriate protection to private \n     parties that cooperated in good faith with the Government in \n     the aftermath of the attacks of September 11 has negative \n     consequences for our national security. The Senate \n     Intelligence Committee recognized that ``the intelligence \n     community cannot obtain the intelligence it needs without \n     assistance from these companies.'' That committee also \n     recognized that companies in the future may be less \n     willing to assist the Government if they face the threat \n     of private lawsuits each time they are alleged to have \n     provided assistance, and that the ``possible reduction \n     intelligence that might result from this delay is simply \n     unacceptable for the safety of our Nation.'' These cases \n     have already been pending for years, and delaying \n     implementation of appropriate liability protection as \n     proposed by the amendment would mean that the companies \n     would still face the prospect of defending against multi-\n     billion-dollar claims and would continue to suffer from \n     the uncertainty of pending litigation. Indeed, the \n     apparent purpose of the amendment is to postpone a \n     decision on whether to provide liability protection at \n     all. Such a result would defeat the point of the carefully \n     considered and bipartisan retroactive liability \n     protections in H.R. 6304--to provide for the expeditious \n     dismissal of the relevant cases in those circumstances in \n     which the Attorney General makes, and the district court \n     reviews, the necessary certifications--and could result in \n     the very degradation in private cooperation that the bill \n     was designed to prevent. The intelligence community, as \n     well as law enforcement and homeland security agencies, \n     continue to rely ont he voluntary cooperation and \n     assistance of private parties in other areas. Continued \n     delay in protecting those who provided assistance after \n     September 11 will invariably be noted by those who may \n     someday be called upon again to help the Nation. Finally, \n     by raising the prospect that the litigation at issue could \n     eventually proceed, this amendment fails to address the \n     risk that on-going litigation will result in the release \n     of sensitive national security information, a risk that, \n     if realized, could cause grave harm to the national \n     security.\n       Deferring a final decision on retroactive liability \n     protection for 15 months while the Inspectors General \n     complete the review required by H.R. 6304 is also \n     unnecessary. The Senate Intelligence Committee conducted an \n     extensive study of the issue, which included the review of \n     the relevant classified documents, numerous hearings, and \n     testimony. after completing this comprehensive review, the \n     Committee determined that providers had acted in response to \n     written requests or directives stating that the activities \n     had been authorized by the President and had been determined \n     to be lawful, and that the providers ``had a good faith \n     basis'' for responding to the requests for assistance they \n     received. Accordingly, the Committee agreed to the necessary \n     legal protections on a 13-2 vote. Similarly, the Intelligence \n     Committee of the House of Representatives has been \n     extensively briefed and has exercised thorough oversight in \n     regard to these intelligence matters. We also have made \n     extraordinarily sensitive information available to the \n     Judiciary Committees of both the Senate and House.\n       The Senate passed a prior version (S. 2248) of the current \n     pending bill, which included retroactive liability \n     protection, by a vote of 68-29. Both Houses of Congress, by \n     wide bipartisan margins, have now made the judgment that \n     retroactive liability protection is the appropriate and fair \n     result. The Congress has been considering this issue for over \n     two years and conducted extensive oversight in this area. \n     During this period, we have emphasized the critical nature of \n     private sector cooperation in protecting our national \n     security and the difficulties of obtaining such cooperation \n     while issues of liability protection remained unresolved. \n     Further delay will damage our intelligence capabilities.\n\n[[Page S6401]]\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to present our views on this \n     crucial bill. We reiterate our sincere appreciation to the \n     Congress for working with us on H.R. 6304, a long-term FISA \n     modernization bill that will strengthen the Nation's \n     intelligence capabilities while protecting the liberties of \n     Americans. We strongly support its prompt passage.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael B. Mukasey,\n       Attorney General.\n     J.M. McConnell,\n       Director of National Intelligence.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, is there any time remaining on the 15 \nminutes that I had set aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania that I use two of \nthose to respond to this latest statement. Then I will defer to him for \nhis statement.\n  Mr. President, I want to respond to the statement by the Senator from \nMissouri about what all of the reports from the inspectors general \nwould essentially deal with. I believe he said waste, fraud, and abuse, \nwhich is sort of the general purview of inspectors general.\n  That is not my understanding. I understand the inspectors general \nhave been asked to essentially do a review of this.\n\n       The Inspectors General of the Department of Justice, the \n     Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National \n     Security Agency, the Department of Defense, and any other \n     elements of the intelligence community that participated in \n     the President's surveillance program--\n\n  Shall all work together to do a report which will look into--\n\n     all of the facts necessary to describe the establishment, \n     implementation, product, and use of the product of the \n     Program;\n       access to legal reviews of the Program and access to \n     information about the Program;\n       communications with, and participation of, individuals and \n     entities in the private sector related to the Program;\n       interaction with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Court and transition to court orders related to the Program; \n     and\n       any other matters identified by any such Inspector General \n     that would enable that Inspector General to complete a review \n     of the Program with respect to such Department of element.\n\n  I believe the review we are talking about here, and that we are \nlegislating or proposing to legislate, is intended to tell the Congress \nand tell anybody who reads the report what this program consisted of. \nThat is information we do not have today. And it is entirely \nappropriate that we get that report before we grant immunity.\n  That is the thrust of my amendment, I hope all of my colleagues will \nsupport it. I appreciate my colleague from Pennsylvania yielding me \nadditional time to speak in response.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I have limited time, and I know my \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, did an excellent job of \noutlining his amendment. I will skip much of what I was going to read \nin my statement.\n  Basically, what we are talking about is a time out. We are giving the \nCongress the opportunity to review the inspectors general report before \nthe Congress chooses to authorize limited immunity for the telecom \nfirms.\n  It is actually very simple. Basically, what we are saying is, the \namendment simply allows the Congress to say: Wait a minute. Hold on. We \nshould take a deep breath before we decide to authorize a Federal \ndistrict court to grant telecom firms legal immunity for their actions \nrelated to the administration's warrantless surveillance program.\n  Let's figure out what this program entailed. Let's figure out what \nhappened. Let's figure out what the telecom firms actually did, what \nthey actually did when it came to wiretapping and surveillance.\n  So under this amendment, the pending lawsuits would remain stayed \nwhile the inspectors general complete their report. If the firms did \nnothing wrong, as they have proclaimed, they will be vindicated by the \nfinal inspectors general report. Then the Congress will have the \nconfidence to grant these firms the immunity for which they ask.\n  So I think many Members of this body would have buyer's remorse if \nthey voted for limited immunity without the understanding of what the \nPresident's surveillance program did and did not do. This amendment \nwould prevent that buyer's remorse by allowing the Congress to better \nunderstand the conduct of the telecommunications firms before we decide \nto grant sweeping legal immunity for such conduct.\n  I encourage my colleagues, all Members of the Senate, to vote for \nthis amendment. It strikes the right balance. It is about \naccountability. It is also about the rule of law. It is a reasonable \nbalance to strike on very important issues, the issues of security and \nhow we are going to implement any kind of program which involves \nwiretapping and surveillance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask Senator Bond, the vice chairman \nof the committee, to yield me 10 or 11, potentially even 12 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I make a very generous allotment of 12 minutes. If he needs \nmore, I am anxious to hear what he has to say.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I appreciate my colleague yielding me time.\n  Mr. President, Senator Bingaman, who I greatly respect in all ways, \nhas offered an amendment altering the liability protections of title \nII. That is it. His amendment would postpone the implementation of the \nliability provisions of the bill until 90 days after the submission of \nthe final report of the inspectors general required under title II.\n  Now, I appreciate the Senator's desire to have more information out \nthere. But I want the Senator to contemplate, and the Senate as a whole \nto contemplate, what we are asking. We are talking about a year for the \ninspectors general to complete their reports.\n  Does it really work that way? Is it really a flat year? Are we going \nto send out Federal marshals to have them all do their reports on the \nexact day? Probably it will stretch a little bit. Maybe it will not; \nmaybe it will.\n  But you cannot assume it will not. Then you have to add on 90 days. \nThen you can get to the question of the immunity. I am really baffled \nby that because what it, in effect, says is, we are almost certainly \ngoing to be going through a period of something, which I have not heard \ndiscussed today during this entire debate, and that is the actual \ncollection of intelligence that involves highly classified material of \na foreboding nature for a long period of time until the Senator from \nNew Mexico and/or the Senate can be convinced that it is worthwhile to \ngive immunity or to understand this program.\n  Now, I want to make an even more basic point: By inserting this \namendment, requesting this amendment be passed, I hope the good Senator \ndoes understand that he is undoing a very carefully calibrated \ncompromise between the Senate-passed bill and the House-passed bill \nthat is on title II, taking months and months of negotiations to get to \nthe point where Speaker Pelosi, for example, who was violently against \nthe bill, and title II in particular, and Steney Hoyer, who was very \nmuch against title II, the immunity portion of the bill, where they \ncould say, on the floor of the House: We think sufficient progress has \nbeen made in the negotiations that we will vote for this bill, which \nthe House did by about 70 percent.\n  Now, that is going from the House not even considering title II. I \nmean, they considered and rejected it. It was a sea change.\n  It was a sea change, and one has to have been there to see how the \nchange took place, the good faith bargaining on the part of Vice \nChairman Bond, myself, our mutual staffs, working with the DNI and \nothers, long hours and long days with which we have arrived at \nsomething which, if we pass this today, will go to the President to be \nsigned. If we accept this amendment or, for that matter, accept the \nSpecter amendment that follows, it will have to go back to the House, \nwhich will not take it up, which will not consider it, which will undo \neverything, and there will be no bill.\n  Is that important? Yes, it is. Why is it important? Because the \nchance of not being able to collect on extremely foreboding matters \naround this world will come to a halt, either because the PATRIOT Act \nterms have expired or because the companies will withdraw in disgust. \nIn any event, the bill would be vetoed, as the vice chairman said.\n\n[[Page S6402]]\n\nSo it would be the end of the bill. Therefore, I oppose this amendment.\n  As I will say about each of these amendments--well, I just did--it \nundoes everything that has been done for the purpose of making a \nperfecting amendment to satisfy a particular need of a particular \nSenator. I also must oppose this amendment because there is no reason \nfor delaying the liability protection provisions. There is not a \nsufficient reason. It is true the Select Committee struggled to get \naccess to details about the President's surveillance program for many \nmonths, but in the end we succeeded. We went from maybe eight, more \nlikely four, sometimes six, to all four committees in the House and the \nSenate, Judiciary and Intelligence. We heard the necessary testimony. \nWe went to the EOP. We read all the documents, and our chiefs of staff \nwere allowed to do the same thing. We read the legal reasoning used to \njustify within the executive branch and the role of the private sector. \nWe did all of that, not only our committee but also the House \nIntelligence Committee, and both Judiciary Committees spent \nconsiderable time looking at this issue. I am satisfied we have a basis \nfor taking action now.\n  On national security grounds, we have to, in my judgment. We haven't \ntalked about that today. We have talked about refined points of \nconstitutional niceties and all the rest of it. I don't denigrate that, \nbut there is something called the protection of the Nation. I take that \nvery seriously. I take that very, very seriously. So a form of \nliability protection has passed the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives a total of three times, once in the Senate and twice in \nthe House. We should not now reverse these actions by passing the \nprovisions of suspension.\n  Let me be clear. I strongly support the requirement in this bill for \na comprehensive review of the President's surveillance program by the \ninspectors general. They will be very tough and very thorough and \nembarrass a lot of people. A report on their general review is one of \nthe best ways to inform the American people about the facts. Litigation \nis an imperfect mechanism to bring facts to the public, rather a \nterrible mechanism, because of something called the State secrets \nprivilege which is involved, which means the people can't know \nanything, that a lot of people dealing with the court can't know \nanything, that the companies can't know anything. It is a closedown. \nPeople have to understand that. It is not an open court. You are not \ngetting a traffic ticket. It is a highly complex, nuanced matter which \nis rigidly guarded by rules. You could argue the rules, but there they \nare. Unfortunately, if this amendment passes, the fact that litigation \nis still pending may have the effect of limiting the amount of \ninformation that will be released to the public in the report of the \ninspectors general, the opposite of what the distinguished Senator \nwants. Certain facts that might be releasable if the litigation were \nresolved might be held back, if the Government anticipated a continuing \nneed to assert the State secrets privilege in litigation, which it \nwould.\n  It is also important to note that this amendment, if it were to pass, \nthe liability protection provisions that the Senator is trying to get \nat would not go away. In other words, if his amendment passed and we \ntook this long delay, nothing would affect the progress of the \nliability legislation and that possibility. So it is an amendment which \ndoesn't accomplish anything. The provisions would still go into effect \nafter 90 days, unless new legislation is passed. Let's hope that \ndoesn't happen. The new Congress, thus, might be launched into a \ncontentious debate next summer, instead of working with the new \nPresident on a new agenda. That is the point of the Cardin amendment, \nthat the date was changed to December 2012, so that the next President, \nwhoever it might be--it is very close--will have a chance to review and \nperhaps act upon what we have done here in the next term, which is \ngood. I urge defeat of the amendment.\n  I have one more thing to say, with the indulgence of my colleague. \nThe senior Senator from Pennsylvania and I were engaged in earlier \ndebate over the access Senators have had, both with myself and with the \nvice chairman, to the Government letter sent to the telecommunications \ncompanies requesting their cooperation during the period of 9/11 to \nJanuary of 2007. The Senator from Pennsylvania lamented the fact that \nthese documents were kept to only the members of the Intelligence and \nJudiciary Committees and not shared with the full Senate.\n  I share the view of the Senator that these documents should be viewed \nby all Senators, and I have advocated this very position to senior \nofficials of the Bush administration for many months. But recognizing \nthe administration's unwillingness to extend this access, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee did the next best thing. We were able to get \ndeclassified the relevant facts upon which the committee and, \nultimately, the full Senate reached the judgment that a narrowly drawn \nimmunity bill remedy might be appropriate.\n  For the record, our committee report, 110-209, accompanying S. 2248, \nthe FISA amendments----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. And dated October 26, 2007, includes a lengthy \ndeclassified explanation of the committee's review and conclusions as \nwell as a description of the representations made by the Government in \nthe letters sent to the companies during the period of time covered by \nthe bill. So for the past 8 months, this public report has been \navailable not only to all Senators--here it is, I have labeled it, \npages 8 through 12, right here--but to the general public as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that portion be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Title II of the FISA Amendments Act of 2007\n\n       Title II of this bill reflects the Committee's belief that \n     there is a strong national interest in addressing the extent \n     to which the burden of litigation over the legality of \n     surveillance should fall on private parties. Based on a \n     review of both current immunity provisions and historical \n     information on the President's program, the Committee \n     identified three issues relating to the exposure of \n     electronic communication service providers to liability that \n     needed to be addressed in this bill.\n       First, the Committee considered the exposure to liability \n     of providers who allegedly participated in the President's \n     surveillance program. Second, the Committee considered the \n     absence, in current law, of a procedural mechanism that would \n     give courts an appropriate role in assessing statutory \n     immunity provisions that would otherwise be subject to the \n     state secrets privilege. Third, the Committee sought to \n     clarify the role of state public utility commissions in \n     regulating electronic communication service providers' \n     relationships with the intelligence community. The Committee \n     addressed these three issues, respectively, in sections 202, \n     203, and 204 of the bill.\n\n\n                          RETROACTIVE IMMUNITY\n\n       Sections 201 and 202 of the bill provide focused \n     retroactive immunity for electronic communication service \n     providers that were alleged to have cooperated with the \n     intelligence community in implementing the President's \n     surveillance program. Only civil lawsuits against electronic \n     communication service providers alleged to have assisted the \n     Government are covered under the provision. The Committee \n     does not intend for this section to apply to, or in any way \n     affect, pending or future suits against the Government as to \n     the legality of the President's program.\n       Section 202 was narrowly drafted to apply only to a \n     specific intelligence program. Section 202 therefore provides \n     immunity for an intelligence activity involving \n     communications that was designed to detect or prevent a \n     terrorist attack, or activities in preparation for a \n     terrorist attack, that was authorized in the period \n     between September 11, 2001 and January 17, 2007, and that \n     was described in written requests to the electronic \n     communication service provider as authorized by the \n     President and determined to be lawful.\n       The extension of immunity in section 202 reflects the \n     Committee's determination that electronic communication \n     service providers acted on a good faith belief that the \n     President's program, and their assistance, was lawful. The \n     Committee's decision to include liability relief for \n     providers was based in significant part on its examination of \n     the written communications from U.S. Government officials to \n     certain providers. The Committee also considered the \n     testimony of relevant participants in the program.\n       The details of the President's program are highly \n     classified. As with other intelligence matters, the \n     identities of persons or entities who provide assistance to \n     the U.S. Government are protected as vital sources and \n     methods of intelligence. But it reveals no secrets to say--as \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, this bill, and \n     Title 18 of the U.S. Code all make clear--that electronic\n\n[[Page S6403]]\n\n     surveillance for law enforcement and intelligence purposes \n     depends in great part on the cooperation of the private \n     companies that operate the Nation's telecommunication system.\n       It would be inappropriate to disclose the names of the \n     electronic communication service providers from which \n     assistance was sought, the activities in which the Government \n     was engaged or in which providers assisted, or the details \n     regarding any such assistance. The Committee can say, \n     however, that beginning soon after September 11, 2001, the \n     Executive branch provided written requests or directives to \n     U.S. electronic communication service providers to obtain \n     their assistance with communications intelligence activities \n     that had been authorized by the President.\n       The Committee has reviewed all of the relevant \n     correspondence. The letters were provided to electronic \n     communication service providers at regular intervals. All of \n     the letters stated that the activities had been authorized by \n     the President. All of the letters also stated that the \n     activities had been determined to be lawful by the Attorney \n     General, except for one letter that covered a period of less \n     than sixty days. That letter, which like all the others \n     stated that the activities had been authorized by the \n     President, stated that the activities had been determined to \n     be lawful by the Counsel to the President.\n       The historical context of requests or directives for \n     assistance was also relevant to the Committee's determination \n     that electronic communication service providers acted in good \n     faith. The Committee considered both the extraordinary nature \n     of the time period following the terrorist attacks of \n     September 11, 2001, and the fact that the expressed purpose \n     of the program was to ``detect and prevent the next terrorist \n     attack'' in making its assessment.\n       On the basis of the representations in the communications \n     to providers, the Committee concluded that the providers, in \n     the unique historical circumstances of the aftermath of \n     September 11, 2001, had a good faith basis for responding to \n     the requests for assistance they received. Section 202 makes \n     no assessment about the legality of the President's program. \n     It simply recognizes that, in the specific historical \n     circumstances here, if the private sector relied on written \n     representations that high-level Government officials had \n     assessed the program to be legal, they acted in good faith \n     and should be entitled to protection from civil suit.\n       The requirements of section 202 reflect the Committee's \n     determination that cases should only be dismissed when \n     providers acted in good faith. Section 202 applies only to \n     assistance provided by electronics communication service \n     providers pursuant to a ``written request or directive from \n     the Attorney General or the head of an element of the \n     intelligence community. . . that the program was authorized \n     by the President and determined to be lawful.''\n       Section 202 also preserves an important role for the \n     courts. Although the bill reflects the Committee's \n     determination that, if the requirements of section 202 are \n     met, the provider acted in good faith, the section allows \n     judicial review of whether the Attorney General has abused \n     the discretion provided by statute in certifying that a \n     provider either furnished no assistance or cooperated with \n     the Government under the terms referenced in the section.\n       In determining whether to provide retroactive immunity, the \n     Committee weighed the incentives such immunity would provide. \n     As described above, electronic communication service \n     providers play an important role in assisting intelligence \n     officials in national security activities. Indeed, the \n     intelligence community cannot obtain the intelligence it \n     needs without assistance from these companies. Given the \n     scope of the civil damages suits, and the current spotlight \n     associated with providing any assistance to the intelligence \n     community, the Committee was concerned that, without \n     retroactive immunity, the private sector might be unwilling \n     to cooperate with lawful Government requests in the future \n     without unnecessary court involvement and protracted \n     litigation. The possible reduction in intelligence that might \n     result from this delay is simply unacceptable for the safety \n     of out Nation.\n       At the same time, the Committee recognized that providers \n     play an essential role in ensuring that the Government \n     complies with statutory requirements before collecting \n     information that may impact the privacy interests of U.S. \n     citizens. Because the Government necessarily seeks access to \n     communications through the private sector, providers have the \n     unparalleled ability to insist on receiving appropriate \n     statutory documentation before agreeing to provide any \n     assistance to the Government.\n       The Committee sought to maintain the balance between these \n     factors by providing retroactive immunity that is limited in \n     scope. The provision of retroactive immunity was intended to \n     encourage electronic communication service providers who \n     acted in good faith in the particular set of circumstances at \n     issue to cooperate with the Government when provided with \n     lawful requests in the future. Restricting that immunity to \n     discrete past activities avoids disrupting the balance of \n     incentives for electronic communication service providers to \n     require compliance with statutory requirements in the future. \n     Under this bill and existing statutory provisions, providers \n     will only be entitled to protection from suit for their \n     future activities if they ensure that their assistance is \n     conducted in accordance with statutory requirements.\n       The Committee believes that adherence to precise, existing \n     statutory forms is greatly preferred. This preference is \n     reflected in section 203 of the bill, which establishes \n     procedures by which civil actions against those who assist \n     the Government shall be dismissed upon a certification by \n     the Attorney General that any assistance had been provided \n     pursuant to a court order or a statutorily-prescribed \n     certification or directive. The action the Committee \n     proposes for claims arising out of the President's program \n     should be understood by the Executive branch and providers \n     as a one-time response to an unparalleled national \n     experience in the midst of which representations were made \n     that assistance to the Government was authorized and \n     lawful.\n\n\n             PROCEDURES FOR IMPLEMENTING STATUTORY DEFENSES\n\n       Section 203 of this bill provides a procedure that can be \n     used in the future to seek dismissal of a suit when a \n     defendant either provided assistance pursuant to a lawful \n     statutory requirement, or did not provide assistance. This \n     section, a new section 802 of FISA, reflects the Committee's \n     recognition that the identities of persons or entities who \n     provide assistance to the intelligence community are properly \n     protected as sources and methods of intelligence.\n       Under the existing statutory scheme, wire or electronic \n     communication providers are authorized to provide information \n     and assistance to persons with authority to conduct \n     electronic surveillance if the providers have been provided \n     with (1) a court order directing the assistance, or (2) a \n     certification in writing signed by the Attorney General or \n     certain other officers that ``no warrant or court order is \n     required by law, that all statutory requirements have been \n     met, and that the specific assistance is required.'' See 18 \n     U.S.C. 2511(2)(a)(ii). Current law therefore envisions that \n     wire and electronic communication service providers will play \n     a lawful role in the Government's conduct of electronic \n     surveillance.\n       Section 2511(2)(a)(ii) protects these providers from suit \n     as long as their actions are consistent with statutory \n     authorizations. Once electronic communication service \n     providers have a court order or certification, ``no cause of \n     action shall lie in any court against any provider of wire or \n     electronic communication service . . . for providing \n     information, facilities, or assistance in accordance with the \n     terms of a court order, statutory authorization, or \n     certification under this chapter.'' Id. The Protect America \n     Act and Title I of this bill provide similar protections from \n     suit for providing information or assistance in accordance \n     with statutory directives. All of these immunity provisions \n     are designed to ensure that wire and electronic communication \n     service providers assist the Government with electronic \n     surveillance activities when necessary, and recognize the \n     good faith of those providers who assist the Government in \n     accordance with the statutory scheme.\n       To the extent that any existing immunity provisions are \n     applicable, however, providers have not been able to benefit \n     from the provisions in the civil cases that are currently \n     pending. Because the Government has claimed the state secrets \n     privilege over the question of whether any particular \n     provider furnished assistance to the Government, an \n     electronic communication service provider who cooperated with \n     the Government pursuant to a valid court order or \n     certification cannot prove it is entitled to immunity under \n     section 2511(2)(a)(ii) without disclosing the information \n     deemed privileged by the Executive branch. Thus, electronic \n     communication providers are prohibited from seeking immunity \n     under section 2511(2)(a)(ii) for any assistance they may have \n     provided to the intelligence community, with the approval \n     of the FISA Court, after January 17, 2007. Providers who \n     did not assist the Government are similarly unable to \n     extract themselves from ongoing litigation, because the \n     assertion of the state secrets privilege makes it \n     impossible for them to demonstrate their lack of \n     involvement.\n       By addressing the situation in which an entity is \n     prohibited from taking advantage of existing immunity \n     provisions because of Government restrictions on disclosure \n     of the information, Section 203 seeks to ensure that existing \n     immunity provisions have their intended effect. The Committee \n     also intends to reassure providers that as long as their \n     assistance to the Government is conducted in accordance with \n     statutory requirements, they will be protected from civil \n     liability and the burden of further litigation.\n       The procedure in section 203 allows a court to review a \n     certification as to whether an individual either assisted the \n     Government pursuant to a lawful statutory requirement or did \n     not assist the Government, even when public disclosure of \n     such facts would harm the national security. Because an \n     assertion of state secrets over the same facts would likely \n     prevent all judicial review over whether, and under what \n     authorities, an individual assisted the Government, this \n     provision serves to expand judicial review to an area that \n     may have been previously non-justiciable. In addition, the \n     statute explicitly allows the court to review for abuse of \n     discretion the Attorney General's certification that a person \n     either did not assist the Government or cooperated with the \n     Government pursuant, to statutory requirements.\n\n[[Page S6404]]\n\n                               PREEMPTION\n\n       Section 204 of the bill preempts state investigations or \n     required disclosure of information about the relationship \n     between individual electronic communication service providers \n     and the intelligence community. The provision reflects the \n     Committee's view that, although states play an important role \n     in regulating electronic communication service providers, \n     they should not be involved in regulating the relationship \n     between electronic communication service providers and the \n     intelligence community.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I hope very much that the Senator's amendment will \nbe defeated. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent \nthat the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, with the goodwill of the vice \nchairman, he has granted me a couple of moments to enter a couple \ndocuments in the Record. We have had several good days of debate or \ngood hours of debate on the FISA bill going back to before the recess. \nI guess that would be several months. In the course of a discussion of \na bill as lengthy and complex as this, several arguments have been made \nthat warrant response, but there isn't always time to give the \nresponse. In the interest of establishing an accurate legislative \nhistory to accompany the bill, as manager of the bill, I ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record a statement providing such \nclarifications and corrections.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n H.R. 6304, FISA Amendments Act of 2008, Response to Various Points in \n                    Pre-Recess Debate, July 8, 2008\n\n       Mr. President, prior to the recess, we had several good \n     days of debate on the FISA bill. Inevitably, in the course of \n     discussion of a bill as lengthy and detailed as this, several \n     arguments have been made that warrant a response in the \n     interest of an accurate legislative history. As a manager of \n     the bill, I would like to take a few moments to clear up \n     several matters.\n\n\n                              Exclusivity\n\n       Sections 102(a) and (b) are the bill's main exclusivity \n     provisions. Section 102(a) strengthens present exclusivity \n     law by providing, in a new section 112 of FISA, that only an \n     express statutory authorization for electronic surveillance \n     or the interception of domestic communications shall \n     constitute an exclusive means in addition to specifically \n     listed statutes. Section 102(b) amends section 109 of FISA, \n     the Act's key criminal offense provision, so that the \n     criminal offense and the exclusivity provision dovetail \n     exactly.\n       These main parts of section 102 are well understood. There \n     has been some confusion, however, about a conforming \n     amendment in section 102(c), which performs a useful but \n     distinctly minor role in the overall exclusivity section.\n       Section 102(c) adds a detail to the section of the U.S. \n     criminal code (18 USC 2511), which gives immunity from suit \n     to companies who have received a certification from the \n     Attorney General. It requires the Government to identify in \n     the certification the specific statutory provision that \n     authorizes the company's assistance ``if a certification . . \n     . for assistance to obtain foreign intelligence information \n     is based on statutory authority.''\n       Several colleagues have suggested, or at least strongly \n     intimated, that this language acknowledges the President's \n     constitutional authority to conduct warrantless surveillance \n     of the kind involved in the President's Terrorism \n     Surveillance Program. Any such argument is inconsistent with \n     both the language of the provision and the intent of its \n     drafters.\n       To understand the purpose of section 102(c), we need to \n     look at the course of negotiations about it. In its proposed \n     amendment to our Intelligence Committee bill, the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee recommended the following language: ``A \n     certification . . . for assistance to obtain foreign \n     intelligence information shall identify the specific \n     provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n     1978 . . . that provides an exception from providing a court \n     order, and shall certify that the statutory requirements of \n     such provision have been met.''\n       As the Judiciary Committee pointed out in its report, this \n     language responded to the need of providers to have clarity \n     regarding the legality of their actions and entitlement to \n     immunity.\n       After the Judiciary Committee sequentially reported our \n     bill, there were extensive discussions with the \n     administration about this language. In the course of those \n     discussions, the Department of Justice noted that FISA, as \n     drafted in 1978, was only intended to regulate particular \n     activities, those that constitute ``electronic \n     surveillance,'' a term that is carefully defined in FISA. \n     Indeed, the nuance in FISA's definition of electronic \n     surveillance, as well as its very detailed parameters, led us \n     to decide not to alter the definition of electronic \n     surveillance in FISA in this compromise bill. Activities that \n     do not constitute electronic surveillance within the meaning \n     of FISA, or the interception of domestic wire, oral or \n     electronic communications, were not restricted by FISA's \n     original exclusivity provision and the same will be true \n     under this bill. Thus, theoretically there may be activities \n     that fall outside of the statute's restrictions but are not \n     subject to an explicit statutory ``exception from providing a \n     court order,'' as that term was used in the Judiciary \n     Committee amendment.\n       These discussions led to the language in the current bill, \n     which was included as part of Senator Feinstein's exclusive \n     means amendment in the original Senate debate in February. \n     The amendment was intended to ensure that the provider has as \n     much information as possible, while still recognizing that, \n     going back to the birth of FISA, activities may be conducted \n     side-by-side with FISA, although not under the authority of \n     FISA, if they do not fall within FISA's definition of \n     electronic surveillance.\n       Section 102(c) was not intended to permit, and its language \n     would not permit, any activities that would violate the main \n     parts of the exclusive means provision, whatever the legal \n     justification. Any suggestion that Congress would take away \n     in a conforming amendment the central achievement of the \n     overall exclusivity section makes no sense.\n       Indeed, the bill makes it painstakingly clear: any person \n     who engages in electronic surveillance outside of FISA or the \n     U.S. criminal code is committing a criminal offense. Given \n     this statutory requirement, the Attorney General cannot \n     lawfully certify that electronic surveillance outside of FISA \n     satisfies ``all statutory requirements,'' as is required and \n     will continue to be required for a certification in section \n     2511 of title 18.\n       Whether or not the President has constitutional authority \n     to conduct surveillance--and there is widespread disagreement \n     here on that point--the language of section 102(c) simply \n     cannot be read to recognize any authority to conduct \n     electronic surveillance that is inconsistent with FISA.\n\n\n                        Assessment of Compliance\n\n       In debate on the bill, the question has been raised whether \n     the decision not to include in the final compromise a \n     provision specifically addressing the authority of the FISA \n     court to assess compliance with minimization procedures in \n     section 702 represents a determination that the court should \n     not have that authority.\n       Minimization procedures are specific procedures that are \n     reasonably designed to minimize acquisition and retention, \n     and prohibit dissemination, of nonpublic information \n     concerning United States persons consistent with the need to \n     obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence \n     information. Compliance with them is central to the \n     protection of the privacy of Americans. The Protect America \n     Act failed to provide for court review and approval of \n     minimization procedures. This bill corrects that omission. \n     The PAA also failed to provide for rules on the use of \n     information acquired under it. This bill corrects that \n     omission by making section 106 of FISA applicable to \n     collection under its foreign targeting provisions. That \n     section explicitly mandates that federal employees may only \n     use or disclose information concerning U.S. persons in \n     accordance with required minimization procedures.\n       Although section 702 does not have a provision that \n     mandates compliance reviews, as the original House bill \n     contained, the bill before us today recognizes the authority \n     of the FISA court to assess compliance with the procedures \n     that it has approved. The courts of the United States are not \n     advisory bodies. All of them, including the FISA court, have \n     the inherent authority of any other court that exercises the \n     judicial power of the United States to ensure that the \n     parties before them are complying with their orders and the \n     procedures they approve.\n       An amendment to the original bill that was offered by \n     Senator Whitehouse, who had strongly advocated on the Senate \n     floor in support of judicial review of compliance with \n     minimization procedures, makes the Congress's recognition of \n     this inherent court authority clear. That language, which the \n     Senate adopted by unanimous consent and which is section \n     109(d) in the final bill, specifically states that no \n     provision of FISA will be construed to reduce or contravene \n     the inherent authority of the FISA court ``to determine or \n     enforce compliance with an order or rule of such court, or \n     with a procedure approved by such court.''\n       The decision in negotiating the compromise of this bill not \n     to include in section 702 a separate provision for \n     minimization compliance reviews by the court, should be \n     understood, as we understood in the Senate when considering \n     Senator Whitehouse's amendment, to represent satisfaction \n     that the amendment adequately recognizes the authority of the \n     FISA court to assess compliance.\n\n\n                         Exigent Circumstances\n\n       The next issue that deserves clarification is the exigent \n     circumstances exception to prior court approval. The bill \n     requires the\n\n[[Page S6405]]\n\n     Government to obtain prior court approval of targeting and \n     minimization procedures before beginning collection under the \n     new procedures. There is one exception to this requirement: \n     in exigent circumstances, the Attorney General and Director \n     of National Intelligence may authorize collection to begin \n     immediately.\n       In section 702(c)(2), the bill describes an exigent \n     circumstances determination to be ``a determination by the \n     Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence \n     that exigent circumstances exist because, without immediate \n     implementation of an authorization under subsection (a) [of \n     section 702], intelligence important to the national security \n     may be lost or not timely acquired and time does not permit \n     the issuance of an order pursuant to subsection (i)(3) prior \n     to the implementation of such authorization.''\n       In both Houses, there has been some discussion about the \n     meaning of the phrase ``exigent circumstances'' and the \n     expectations of Members about the use of this authority. \n     While the bill does not define the phrase ``exigent \n     circumstances'' standing alone, it does describe the limits \n     of the appropriate use of the authority: a determination by \n     the Nation's highest law enforcement official, the Attorney \n     General, and highest intelligence official, the DNI, that (a) \n     without immediate implementation ``intelligence important to \n     the national security may be lost or not timely acquired'' \n     and (b) time does not permit the issuance of a FISA court \n     approval order prior to implementation.\n       To the extent that auxiliary aids are needed to assist in \n     defining ``exigent circumstances,'' at least three are \n     available.\n       First, section 702 as a whole demonstrates the clear intent \n     of Congress that prior judicial approval is strongly \n     preferred. To the extent practicable, the Government's \n     submissions of certifications and procedures to the FISA \n     court with regard to annual authorizations shall precede the \n     effective date of those authorizations by at least 30 days. \n     On receiving Government submissions, the FISA court is to \n     complete action on them within 30 days unless the court \n     exercises its limited extension authority.\n       Those provisions, working together, implement the design of \n     the Congress to ensure that judicial review will ordinarily \n     precede implementation. The benefit of doing so is obvious. \n     The intelligence community, telecommunication providers who \n     are asked to implement Government directives, and the \n     American public will be assured that the procedures and \n     certifications that ensure the lawfulness of collection have \n     been approved before collection begins. In light of the \n     centrality of prior review in section 702, and the \n     significant benefits flowing from it, exceptions should be \n     rare.\n       Second, if more is needed to define ``exigent \n     circumstances,'' the dictionary definition of ``exigent'' is \n     a tool of first resort outside the text and structure of the \n     Act. For example, the Random House College Dictionary defines \n     ``exigent'' as ``requiring immediate action or aid; urgent, \n     pressing.'' ``Urgent'' in turn is defined as ``pressing, \n     compelling or requiring immediate action or attention; \n     imperative.''\n       Third, the interpretation of the bill by agencies charged \n     with its administration is an acknowledged guide, \n     particularly, as here, where that interpretation has been \n     offered to the Congress in the course of the legislative \n     process. In writing to the Speaker on June 19, the Attorney \n     General and the DNI explained: ``The exigent circumstances \n     exception is critical to allowing the Intelligence Community \n     to respond swiftly to changing circumstances when the \n     Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence \n     determine that intelligence may be lost or not timely \n     acquired. Such exigent circumstances could arise in certain \n     circumstances where an unexpected gap has opened in our \n     intelligence collection efforts.''\n       The recognition that the ``exigent circumstances'' \n     provision is an ``exception'' to prior court approval that it \n     is applicable to ``changing circumstances'' and ``unexpected \n     gaps,'' when considered in the light of the text and \n     structure of section 702 and the ordinary meaning of \n     ``exigent,'' all convey, as I believe, that this authority \n     should be used only rarely, when urgent and unexpected action \n     is truly required.\n       We intend to monitor the use of this authority carefully, \n     so that we can address any abuses at the time of the sunset, \n     if necessary.\n\n    Title II--Documentary Support for Attorney General Certification\n\n       During the pre-recess debate, a suggestion was made that \n     the bill establishes clear limits on what documents the \n     district court may review in determining whether substantial \n     evidence supports a certification by the Attorney General on \n     a provider's entitlement to immunity.\n       The burden is on the Attorney General to provide to the \n     court the equivalent of an administrative record that \n     satisfies the substantial evidence test. While I agree that \n     the parties cannot seek discovery to provide the court with \n     information as to whether the substantial evidence test is \n     met, the bill does not limit what the Attorney General may \n     submit, in his or her discretion, to provide substantial \n     evidence to support the certification.\n       A certification under section 802 shall be given effect \n     unless the court, in accordance with subsection (b), finds \n     that it is not supported by substantial evidence ``provided \n     to the court pursuant to this section.'' The phrase ``this \n     section'' covers the entire section. Thus, the scope of the \n     evidence that the Attorney General may submit to sustain the \n     substantial evidence burden is not dependent on any \n     particular subsection of section 802 but is drawn from the \n     entirety of the section including, importantly, all of the \n     substantive requirements for the implementation of liability \n     protection.\n       Section 802(b)(2) provides that in reviewing a \n     certification under section 802 the court may examine the \n     court order, certification, written request, or directive \n     described in the substantive provisions of section 802. This \n     authority ensures that the court will be able to examine \n     those documents. But it does not limit the Attorney General \n     to those documents in supporting a certification under \n     section 802. For example, the Attorney General may determine \n     that providing substantial evidence to support a \n     certification that a person did not provide assistance \n     requires evidence that is not included in communications with \n     that person. Section 802 therefore should not be read as a \n     limit on what may be submitted to the court by the Attorney \n     General. As for the method by which additional information \n     may be provided, section 802 imposes no limit on what the \n     Attorney General may include within a certification or \n     annexed to it.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I also point out, there was an op-ed piece in \nsupport of the FISA bill in today's New York Times which I call to the \nattention of my colleagues. It was written by Mr. Morton Halperin and \nentitled ``Listening to Compromise.'' Mr. Halperin, in addition to \nbeing executive director of the Open Society Policy Center, has a \nlengthy career of public service in both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nMr. Halperin's op-ed in support of the bill as it appeared in today's \nNew York Times.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 8, 2008]\n\n                        Listening to Compromise\n\n                        (By Morton H. Halperin)\n\n       Two years ago, I stated my belief that the Bush \n     administration's warrantless wiretapping program and \n     disregard for domestic and international law poses a direct \n     challenge to our constitutional order, and ``constitutes a \n     far greater threat than the lawlessness of Richard Nixon.''\n       That was not a casual comparison. When I was on the staff \n     of the National Security Council, my home phone was tapped by \n     the Nixon administration--without a warrant--beginning in \n     1969. The wiretap stayed on for 21 months. The reason? My \n     boss, Henry Kissinger, and the director of the F.B.I., J. \n     Edgar Hoover, believed that I might have leaked information \n     to this newspaper. Even after I left government, and went to \n     work on Edmund Muskie's presidential campaign, the F.B.I. \n     continued to listen in and made periodic reports to the \n     president.\n       I was No. 8 on Richard Nixon's ``enemies list''--a strange \n     assemblage of 20 people who had incurred the White House's \n     wrath because they had disagreed with administration policy. \n     As the presidential counsel John Dean explained it in 1971, \n     the list was part of a plan to ``use the available federal \n     machinery to screw our political enemies.'' My guess is that \n     I earned this dubious distinction because of my opposition to \n     the Vietnam War, though no one ever said for sure.\n       Because I rejected the Nixon administration's use of \n     national security as a pretext for broad assertions of \n     unchecked executive power, I became engaged with the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act when it was proposed in the \n     early 1970s. And because I reject the Bush administration's \n     equally extreme assertions of executive power at the expense \n     of civil liberties, I have been engaged in trying to improve \n     the current legislation.\n       The compromise legislation that will come to the Senate \n     floor this week is not the legislation that I would have \n     liked to see, but I disagree with those who suggest that \n     senators are giving in by backing this bill.\n       The fact is that the alternative to Congress passing this \n     bill is Congress enacting far worse legislation that the \n     Senate had already passed by a filibuster-proof margin, and \n     which a majority of House members were on record as \n     supporting.\n       What's more, this bill provides important safeguards for \n     civil liberties. It includes effective mechanisms for \n     oversight of the new surveillance authorities by the FISA \n     court, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and now \n     the Judiciary Committees. It mandates reports by inspectors \n     general of the Justice Department, the Pentagon and \n     intelligence agencies that will provide the committees with \n     the information they need to conduct this oversight. (The \n     reports by the inspectors general will also provide \n     accountability for the potential unlawful misconduct that \n     occurred during the Bush administration.) Finally, the bill \n     for the first time requires FISA court warrants for \n     surveillance of Americans overseas.\n       As someone whose civil liberties were violated by the \n     government, I understand this legislation isn't perfect. But \n     I also believe--and here I am speaking only for myself--that \n     it represents our best chance to protect I\n\n[[Page S6406]]\n\n     both our national security and our civil liberties. For that \n     reason, it has my personal support.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a little while \nabout one part of the bill, and I will have more to say tomorrow. I \nstrongly oppose the blanket grant of immunity that is contained in this \nbill. I would hope Senators would reject what is an ill-advised \nlegislative effort to engineer specific outcomes in ongoing Federal \njudicial proceedings. Basically, we are telling another branch of \nGovernment: Here is the way you have to come out in your decisions.\n  There is a way to cure that problem. Instead of the Congress telling \nthe courts how they have to rule, we could adopt the Dodd-Feingold-\nLeahy amendment to strike title II from the bill. This would strike the \nretroactive immunity provisions, and it would allow for accountability \nfor those who violated Americans' rights and violated the law. It would \nsend a strong message that no one stands above the law in the United \nStates.\n  I am not out to get the telephone companies. I just want us to know \nwho it was in the administration who said: You may break the law. The \nAmerican people ought to know who in the White House said, ``You may \nbreak the law,'' who it was who made the decision that somehow this \nPresident stands above the law.\n  The administration circumvented the law by conducting warrantless \nsurveillance of Americans for more than 5 years. They were breaking the \nlaw, and then they got caught. The press reported this illegal conduct \nin late 2005. The Republican-controlled Congress did not ask the \nquestions to find it out. The press found it out. Had they not done so, \nI have to assume this unlawful surveillance would still be going on \ntoday.\n  When the public found out that the Government had been spying on the \nAmerican people outside of FISA for years, the Government and the \nproviders were sued by citizens who believed their privacy rights were \nviolated. They said: You are violating our privacy. We want you to be \nheld accountable. But, of course, that is why the Founders created a \nsystem of Federal courts through the Constitution--so people can assert \ntheir rights before a fair and neutral tribunal without interference \nfrom the other branches of Government, so they have some way to say: I \nam not a Democrat. I am not a Republican. I am not rich. I am not poor. \nI am an American. I am seeking to have my rights upheld.\n  Title II of this bill would effectively terminate these lawsuits and \nthose rights. It seeks to reduce the role of the court to a rubber \nstamp. So long as the Attorney General certifies that the Government \nrequested the surveillance and indicated that it had been ``determined \nto be lawful,'' the cases will be dismissed and everybody is off the \nhook. It is not the court that says whether you followed the law. No, \nthis bill allows the government to say: Oh, you are looking at us? Ah, \nwe certify we followed the law. So, therefore, you courts have to let \nus off the hook because, after all, we said, whether we broke the law \nor not, we are following the law, so we are home free.\n  That is not a meaningful judicial inquiry. Thinking back to my days \nas a prosecutor in Vermont, that would be as if the police caught \nsomeone in a burglary, I charged them, and the defendant then told the \njudge: But I have determined that for me, your Honor, the burglary laws \ndo not apply, so you have to let me go. I can't be prosecuted. I can't \nbe held accountable. Nobody would take that seriously. We should not \ntake this seriously. We should not do something that does not give the \nplaintiffs their day in court. It is not just a heavy thumb on the \nscales of justice; it is a whole hand and an arm on the scales of \njustice, and I cannot support it.\n  If we look at the publicly available information about the \nPresident's program, it becomes clear that title II is designed to tank \nthese lawsuits, pure and simple, but then to allow the administration \nto avoid any accountability for their actions. The Senate Intelligence \nCommittee said in a report last fall that the providers received \nletters from the Attorney General stating that the activities had been \n``authorized by the President'' and ``determined to be lawful.''\n  Guess what. These are precisely the ``magic'' words that will \nretroactively immunize the providers under title II of this bill. Mr. \nPresident, the fix is in. The bill is rigged, based on what we already \nknow, to ensure that the providers get immunity and the cases get \ndismissed.\n  What it says is, if you are in charge, you can just go out and break \nthe law, and then when they look at you, send a letter to the court \nsaying: I have determined that when I broke the law, I did not really \nbreak the law, so you have to let me off the hook.\n  Lewis Carroll once wrote a book about that. I think it was called \n``Alice in Wonderland.'' So what if Americans' rights were violated. So \nwhat if statutes were violated. So what if those privacy-protecting \nstatutes provide for damages. This bill makes our courts the \nhandmaidens to a coverup, and it is wrong. It tells the courts--the \nU.S. Federal courts--it tells them: Take part in a coverup. I cannot \nsupport something that does that. It is wrong.\n  Make no mistake, if title II becomes law, there will be no \naccountability for this administration's actions in a court of law. We \nwould take away the only viable avenue for Americans to seek redress \nfor harms to their privacy and liberties.\n  Those who claim that American citizens can still pursue their privacy \nclaims against the Government know that sovereign immunity is a \nroadblock. They know that cases against the Government have already \nbeen dismissed for lack of standing. They know about the Government's \nability to assert the state secrets doctrine and various other legal \ndefenses and protections for Government officials. They know these \nsuits will go nowhere. They know, and it is wrong for them to suggest \notherwise. This is a red herring if there ever was one.\n\n  The report of the Select Committee on Intelligence in connection with \nits earlier version of the bill that also included retroactive immunity \nis telling. The Select Committee on Intelligence wrote:\n\n       The Committee does not intend for this section to apply to, \n     or in any way affect, pending or future suits against the \n     Government as to the legality of the President's program.\n\n  And later wrote:\n\n       Section 202 makes no assessment about the legality of the \n     President's program.\n\n  But neither that bill nor this one makes any allowance for such suits \nagainst the Government to proceed to a decision on its merits. That is \nprecisely what is lacking in this measure: an avenue to obtain judicial \nreview and accountability.\n  Now, those who support retroactive immunity for the \ntelecommunications carriers and dismissal of the suits against them \nwithout providing an effective avenue to challenge the program or \nobtain judicial review of its legality--well, what they are doing is \nsupporting unaccountability, pure and simple. They are saying: \nEverybody is off the hook. I am not out to get the telephone companies. \nAll I want to know is, who in our Government said: You may break the \nlaw. And this bill is going to make sure we never find out.\n  In fact, the case that did proceed to decision in the Federal court \nin Michigan was appealed by the Government, was vacated and dismissed \nfor lack of ``standing.'' So the judicial decision on the merits that \nthe President's program of warrantless wiretapping of Americans was a \nviolation of law and the Constitution was effectively wiped from the \nbooks.\n  I note again that the proponents of this retroactive immunity have \nnot and cannot say that the administration acted lawfully. They do not \nsay the administration acted lawfully because they know the \nadministration did not act lawfully.\n  Even if one believes the telephone companies merit protection, there \nis simply no good reason why Congress must act now to deal with the \nissue of the ongoing lawsuits against providers. The claim that these \nlawsuits will somehow ``bankrupt'' the providers is belied by the \nrecord demonstrating the financial health of these companies today \ndespite the ongoing litigation.\n  Even the most alarmist critics of the lawsuits acknowledge it would \nbe years\n\n[[Page S6407]]\n\nand probably at least two trips to the U.S. Supreme Court before we \nhave any enforceable final judgments.\n  If there is such a risk, well, what does that say? It says there were \nviolations and that people's rights were violated. Now, I have said \nbefore that I would support the Government stepping into the shoes of \nthese defendants, of these telephone companies, if we want to protect \nthem. It is simple. If you are that concerned about the telephone \ncompanies, exclude them. Substitute the U.S. Government. But we should \nnot protect them if the cost of protecting them is all accountability \nand the cost of never getting a judicial determination on the merits of \nthe cases whether the Government violated the law.\n  Americans have a right to know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I believe the rule of law is important. I trust our courts \nto handle even the most difficult and sensitive disputes. That is the \ncourts' role in our constitutional scheme, not ours. Title II of this \nbill would have Congress decide these cases by legislative fiat.\n  We do not want to diminish our Federal judiciary and risk selling out \nlarge numbers of Americans whose fundamental rights may have been \nviolated. We should not pass this bill unamended. I urge my colleagues \nto cast a vote for accountability and support the Dodd-Feingold-Leahy \namendment.\n  I strongly oppose the immunity provisions contained in this bill, and \nI have supported every effort to strike them. But if we cannot \neliminate these ill-advised provisions, then I agree that Senator \nBingaman's amendment to delay a decision on immunity until after the \ninspectors general have conducted their review of the warrantless \nsurveillance program makes good sense.\n  I worked hard to include the inspectors general amendment as a part \nof this FISA bill. For that provision to have its full effect, we \nshould delay any grant of retroactive immunity until we know what the \nfinal report says.\n  Senator Bingaman's amendment would stay all pending cases against the \ntelecom companies related to the warrantless surveillance program and \ndelay the effective date of the immunity provisions in title II of the \nbill until 90 days after Congress receives the inspectors general \nreports.\n  I have maintained throughout this debate that it makes little sense \nfor Senators--many who have never been given the opportunity to view \nkey documents relevant to the warrantless surveillance program--to cast \nan uninformed vote on retroactive immunity. That is buying a pig in a \npoke. To mix farm metaphors, the Bingaman amendment puts the horse back \nin front of the cart.\n  First, let's get the facts. And then, only after reviewing the \nrelevant facts that the administration claims support granting \nretroactive immunity, determine whether Congress should attempt to \nlegislatively determine the result of the 40 or so Federal cases \nalleging violations of fundamental rights of Americans.\n  Again, I believe the retroactive immunity provisions in this bill \nshould be stripped entirely. But if that cannot be accomplished, then I \nsupport Senator Bingaman's amendment as a commonsense way to ensure \nthat the Senate makes a fully informed decision on retroactive \nimmunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5059\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now call up my amendment No. 5059.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5059.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To limit retroactive immunity for providing assistance to the \n  United States to instances in which a Federal court determines the \n  assistance was provided in connection with an intelligence activity \n                        that was constitutional)\n\n       On page 90, strike lines 17 through 21 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(1) Review of certifications.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), \n     a certification under subsection (a) shall be given effect \n     unless the court finds that such certification is not \n     supported by substantial evidence provided to the court \n     pursuant to this section.\n       ``(B) Covered civil actions.--In a covered civil action \n     relating to assistance alleged to have been provided in \n     connection with an intelligence activity involving \n     communications that was authorized by the President during \n     the period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on \n     January 17, 2007, a certification under subsection (a) shall \n     be given effect unless the court--\n       ``(i) finds that such certification is not supported by \n     substantial evidence provided to the court pursuant to this \n     section; or\n       ``(ii) determines that the assistance provided by the \n     applicable electronic communication service provider was \n     provided in connection with an intelligence activity that \n     violated the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe that history will look back at \nthe period of time between 9/11 and the present as the greatest \nexpansion of the executive authority in the history of this country. We \nhave seen the unauthorized military commissions. We have seen the \nextraordinary rendition to the frequent invocation of state secrets, \nprivilege, and the misuse of so-called signing statements.\n  The signing statements represent a fundamental failure of the \nCongress to utilize its constitutional authority. When the Constitution \nprovides that there is a presentment by both Houses, the President \neither signs it or vetoes it, and the widespread practice has now come \ninto play where the President signs and issues a signing statement \nundercutting key provisions of the legislation. I introduced a bill to \ngive Congress standing to challenge that in court. It has gone nowhere \nbecause of the impossibility of overriding a veto and because of the \nconsiderations of case in controversy.\n  We have seen, in the context of the evolving issues, the total ill-\neffectiveness of Congress to provide the oversight of the Intelligence \nCommittees. The National Security Act of 1947 expressly provides that \nmatters such as the terrorist surveillance program should be submitted \nto the Intelligence Committees, but that has not been done. Only a \nportion of the Intelligence Committees have been briefed. Most of the \nlimited briefing was done only when the administration needed some \nsupport for the confirmation of General Hayden as CIA Director. We have \nseen the provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n1978 bypassed by the executive branch on a claim of constitutional \nauthority under article II, power as Commander in Chief, contrasted \nwith the congressional authority under article I.\n  A Detroit Federal court declared the terrorist surveillance program \nunconstitutional. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, \nin a 2-to-1 decision on the ground of the lack of standing, with the \ndissenter filing an opinion showing ample basis for standing. The \nSupreme Court of the United States refused to review the case. They \ncalled it a denial of certiorari. That is the major constitutional \nconfrontation of our era, between the President asserting article II \npowers as Commander in Chief and the explicit statutory provision \nenacted by Congress in 1978 providing for the exclusive means of having \nwiretapping. Instead, we have warrantless wiretapping.\n  The legislation pending now would provide retroactive immunity. I \nsuggest retroactive immunity in a context that we could both preserve \nthe electronic surveillance and leave the court with jurisdiction in \none of two ways. One, by substituting the Federal Government as the \nparty defendant of the telephone companies, in the shoes of the \ntelephone companies with no more, no less rights; or secondly, \nrequiring, as my amendment does, that the Federal district court would \ndecide constitutionality. No one is denying the\n\n[[Page S6408]]\n\ntelephone companies have been good citizens.\n  The argument has been made that, well, there may be money damages or \nthere is a matter of public image which is involved. Well, monetary \ndamages and public image, in my judgment, don't measure up to the right \nof privacy. Just as Oliver Wendell Holmes, in a 1928 case almost a \ncentury ago, said that wiretapping was ``dirty business''--and it \nremains dirty business--it may be necessary on national security \ngrounds, but it has to be done within the confines of the law. That can \nbe decided only by the courts, especially in the atmosphere that we \nhave where the Congress has been so ineffective and where the Supreme \nCourt of the United States ducked the issue on the case coming out of \nthe Sixth Circuit, where there was ample grounds for finding standing \nto proceed with that case.\n  Within the past 6 days, there has been a major development on this \nissue as a result of a judgment handed down by Chief Judge Vaughn \nWalker of the U.S. district court in San Francisco. Judge Walker is the \nsame judge who has the telephone company cases which were consolidated \nand sent to him under Federal rules on a multidistrict panel. Judge \nWalker found flatly that the President exceeded his constitutional \nauthority when he ignored the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. \nThis is the exact language in the 56-page opinion:\n\n       Congress appears clearly to have intended to--and did--\n     establish the exclusive means for foreign intelligence \n     surveillance activities to be conducted. Whatever power the \n     executive may otherwise have had in this regard, FISA--\n\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--\n\n     limits the power of the executive branch to conduct such \n     activities.\n\n  So now we have the judge who is hearing these telephone cases having \nsaid that such surveillance is unconstitutional. FISA covers not only \nthe traditional wiretaps but explicitly covers pen registers and trap-\nand-trace devices which could include whatever it is the telephone \ncompanies were allegedly doing. On that subject, we do not know the \nfull extent of what the telephone companies are doing. All we have are \nthe allegations and the legal papers. Here, Congress is being asked to \npass upon a program on which most Members have not been briefed. As \nstated earlier on the floor today, 70 Members of the Senate would be \ncalled upon to vote on a program when they don't even know what it is. \nThe House leadership has pointed out that most of the Members of the \nHouse of Representatives have not been briefed.\n  In an exchange with the Senator from Missouri today, I raised the \nfundamental constitutional point that Members' constitutional \nresponsibilities cannot be delegated. You can't delegate them to a \nminority of the Senate, but that is what we are being asked to do. It \nis a pig in a poke. The old expression describes it very well. We don't \neven know what the program is, and we are being asked to ratify it.\n  The issue was put to the Senator from Missouri, the chief defender of \nthis bill, of any precedent where you have a case pending before Judge \nWalker, an extended opinion in July of 2006 on appeal to the Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit. If this act is passed, it will be \nunceremoniously jerked out from under the court. I asked him if there \nis any case in history, and I would repeat that challenge to the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee.\n  What we have left is judicial review. Without judicial review, there \nis no way to effectuate the constitutional doctrine of separation of \npowers, which is so fundamental in our society. Even when the \nproponents of the bill talk about money and business reputation--no one \nis challenging the good citizenship of the telephone companies, and the \nlikelihood of monetary damages is extremely remote. But if the \nGovernment were to be substituted as the party defendant, that is a \nmatter of dollars and cents which hardly comports to the fundamental \nissues which are involved in civil liberties.\n  It is understandable that Congress continues to support law \nenforcement powers because of the continuing terrorist threat. No one \nwants to be blamed for another 9/11. My own briefings on the telephone \ncompanies' cooperation with the Government have convinced me of the \nprogram's value so that I voted for it, even though my amendment to \nsubstitute the Government for the telephone companies was defeated in \nthe Senate's February vote. Similarly, I am prepared to support it \nagain as a last resort, even if it cannot be improved by providing for \njudicial review, the pending amendment. However, since Congress has \nbeen so ineffective in providing a check and balance, I will fight \nhard--and I am fighting hard--to secure passage of this amendment to \nkeep the courts open. It is our last refuge, our last big stand when \nthe stakes are high, and they invariably are. When Congress addresses \ncivil liberties and national security, Members frequently must choose \nbetween the issues of two imperfect options. Unfortunately, we too \noften back ourselves into these corners by deferring legislation until \nthere is a looming deadline. Perhaps that is why so many of my \ncolleagues have resigned themselves to accepting the current bill \nwithout seeking to improve it further.\n\n  Although I am prepared to stomach this bill if I must, I am not yet \nready to concede that the debate is over. Contrary to the conventional \nwisdom, I do not believe it is too late to make this bill better. \nPerhaps the Fourth of July holiday will inspire the Senate to exercise \nits independence from the executive branch, now that we are back in \nWashington.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). There are 32 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Who yields time to the Senator from Rhode Island?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield as much time as the Senator requires.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I appreciate very much the courtesy \nof my chairman in allowing me some time. I should not take more than 10 \nminutes.\n  Once more we find ourselves debating President Bush's warrantless \nwiretapping program, a self-inflicted wound that this administration \nhas visited upon our Government.\n  The way this Senator sees it at least, the Bush administration broke \nfaith with the American people with its warrantless surveillance \nprogram, and now we in Congress are meant to clean up the \nadministration's mess. Unfortunately, we are doing so with a \nlegislative fix that in one critical area--immunity for the phone \ncompanies--misapplies the substantial evidence standard, trespasses \nconstitutional boundaries, and breaks dangerous new ground in American \nlaw.\n  We would not be in this position if the Bush administration had \nsought and received a court order in the first place, as it easily \ncould have. There would be no debate over granting immunity since a \ncompany following a court order is protected. Or the Bush \nadministration could have used FISA procedures to seek and receive \nlawful assistance from telecommunications companies. But the \nadministration chose to go outside the law. I suspect the \nadministration wanted to prove a point about the President's article II \nauthority, so it deliberately avoided these well-established \nmechanisms. If so, the Bush administration deliberately walked these \ntelecommunications companies into this problem and this litigation to \nvindicate ideological ambitions. But the problem is now before us.\n  I have worked diligently and across the aisle to try to develop \nthoughtful solutions to the problem. In February, with the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Arlen Specter, the \nlearned ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I offered a \nbipartisan amendment that would have substituted the U.S. Government \nfor the telecommunications companies if it was determined they acted in \ngood faith and with the reasonable belief that compliance was lawful.\n  Similarly, I supported an amendment offered by Senators Dianne \nFeinstein and Bill Nelson, drawn from the Specter-Whitehouse amendment, \nthat offered immunity to those companies that acted, again, in good \nfaith and with the reasonable belief that compliance was lawful.\n  Good faith is the proper standard here. It is the standard repeatedly \nreferenced by respected Members in this\n\n[[Page S6409]]\n\nChamber who have asserted that any telecommunications company that \nassisted the Government acted in good faith.\n  My friend, Senator Martinez, said:\n\n       The fact is that these companies acted in good faith, and \n     they acted in good faith when they were called upon to assist \n     our intelligence professionals.\n\n  My friend on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Kyl, noted:\n\n       [t]he general rule that private citizens acting in good \n     faith to assist law enforcement are immune from suit.\n\n  Senator Chambliss, my colleague on the Intelligence Committee, argued \nthat America's telecommunications carriers ``should not be subjected to \ncostly legal battles and potentially frivolous cases . . . merely for \ntheir good faith-assistance to the Government.''\n  Senator Allard said that ``the U.S. Government owes these patriotic \ncompanies and their executives protections based on the good-faith \neffort they made in working with our intelligence community.''\n  Senator Bond, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, noted that \n``the intelligence community advised us . . . that these companies \nacted in good faith, and we in the committee agreed with them.''\n  We seem to have agreement amongst Members in this body that good \nfaith is the proper standard. So we should let a court, which has \navailable to it the procedural mechanisms necessary to get to the \nbottom of this in a confidential manner, make the determination, the \nfundamental determination: Did these companies, if they received \nGovernment requests, act in good faith? We may in this body assume it \nto be true, but it is not our role as Members of Congress to decide on \nthe good faith of an individual litigant in a matter that is before a \ncourt.\n  Many Senators have not even been read into the classified materials \nthat would allow us to reach an informed conclusion about good faith. \nWe as a body are incapable of making an informed conclusion because as \na body, we have not had access to the necessary materials. So we should \nprovide a fair mechanism for a finding of good faith by a proper \njudicial body with the proper provisions for confidentiality.\n  This simple determination can be made with limited proceedings based \nlargely on the record of any documents provided to the companies. We \nask so little--a proper hearing, applying a proper standard. \nUnfortunately, the Bush administration opposed this option, and I have \nnot had the chance to offer this amendment. For all its talk, the Bush \nadministration was evidently and tellingly not confident that a good-\nfaith threshold could be met.\n\n  So instead of requiring a finding of good faith, the bill states that \nimmunity will be granted if the Attorney General's certification is \n``supported by substantial evidence.'' It is worth drilling down to \nsome lawyering for a moment to reflect on what ``substantial evidence'' \nmeans in this context.\n  The first point is that ``substantial evidence'' standard is \nessentially a meaningless standard, given the minimal showing necessary \nto be granted immunity. The elements as to which substantial evidence \nmust exist are these: The intelligence activity was ``authorized by the \nPresident''; ``designed to detect or prevent a terrorist attack''; and \n``the subject of a written request or directive . . . indicating that \nthe activity was (I) authorized by the President; and (ii) determined \nto be lawful.''\n  That is it. That is achieved by simply putting into evidence the \npiece of paper containing the Attorney General's certification.\n  But the substantial evidence standard implies more than that, and it \nis out of place here. This standard is typically applied in what is \ncalled a ``sufficiency challenge''--a judicial inquiry into whether \nthere is substantial evidence to support a jury verdict. I cannot tell \nyou how many sufficiency challenges I have withstood as an attorney \ngeneral and U.S. attorney. It is standard fare in criminal cases.\n  The substantial evidence standard is also frequently used for \njudicial review of an administrative agency's adjudication or \nrulemaking.\n  So the substantial evidence standard is used to review the results of \nadversarial proceedings where the parties had a chance to make their \ncase and build their record, and the court then reviews to determine \nwhether there is substantial evidence to support the agency's or jury's \ndetermination.\n  The substantial evidence standard is a standard used to weigh the \nresult of an adversarial process. Not so here. Here the court will \napply the substantial evidence standard to an Attorney General's \nunilateral certification. That is bad lawyering. That is discouraging, \nwhen it would have been so easy to get this right.\n  Let me close with a few words about the constitutionality of title \nII. It is a core principle of our system of separated powers that no \nbranch of Government may exercise powers allocated to another branch. \nThe United States Supreme Court has said that the Framers of the \nFederal Constitution felt in drafting our Constitution ``the sense of a \nsharp necessity to separate the legislative from the judicial power.'' \nThis sense of sharp necessity, the Court said, was ``prompted by the \ncrescendo''--the words the Court used--``the crescendo of legislative \ninterference with private judgment of the courts.''\n  If you wish to see a case of legislative interference with private \njudgment of the courts, look no further than what we are doing today.\n  Plaintiffs in the telecom litigation have brought causes of action \nalleging that their core constitutional rights were violated. By \nproviding immunity, Congress is telling the judicial branch: You cannot \nhear an entire category of constitutional claims. Congress is intruding \nupon a core function of the judicial power--the resolution of \nconstitutional disputes.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has warned on more than one occasion, most \nrecently in the 1988 case of Webster v. Doe, that ``a serious \nconstitutional question would arise if a federal statute were construed \nto deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim.''\n  This statute has as its very purpose to deny a judicial forum to \nthese colorable constitutional claims.\n  I further note that Congress stepping in to pick winners and losers \nin ongoing litigation on constitutional rights not only raises \nseparation of powers concerns but it veers near running afoul of the \ndue process and takings clauses. Article II of this bill is the most \nextreme measure Congress, as best as I can find, has ever taken to \ninterfere in ongoing litigation. Congress usually provides at least a \nfigleaf of an alternative remedy when it takes away the judicial one. \nFor example, in the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, Congress put \na stop to Federal court actions but provided an alternative path for \nclaims to be heard. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act \neliminated liability for people who take certain countermeasures during \nor after a pandemic outbreak. But a special fund for victims was \nestablished by Congress.\n  Today's effort is a naked intrusion into ongoing litigation. Where \nwill that stop? Will Congress be able to rove at will through \nlitigation anywhere in the judicial branch, picking winners and losers \nas we like? We don't just trespass on the separation of powers; we \ntrespass onto dangerous ground.\n  If I were a litigant, I would challenge the constitutionality of the \nimmunity provisions of this statute, and I would expect a good chance \nof winning.\n\n  I spoke before the Independence Day recess about article I of this \nbill, how proud I am of the work that went into it and the exemplary \nresults we have achieved. Chairman Rockefeller, in particular, but many \nothers as well, deserves commendation, first for resisting the Bush \nadministration's unseemly efforts to create a legislative stampede and, \nsecond, for thoughtfully crafting an improved and modernized FISA Act \nthat contains many new important protections for Americans. I will \nincorporate my reference of my previous remarks on that subject, but \nsuffice it to say as an attorney general and a U.S. attorney who has \nrun wiretap vehicles, article I is a fine piece of legislation which \nmakes it all the more disappointing that the Bush administration will \nnot tolerate an amendment to article II that allows for a proper \nhearing before the proper court set to the proper standard. It would be \nso easy to get article II right. So close and yet so far.\n\n[[Page S6410]]\n\n  I close by reiterating my deep anger that the Bush administration \nunnecessarily created this mess in the first place, my frustration with \nthe solution that Congress has established to the immunity question, \nand my hope that our great judicial branch will vindicate the error we \nin the legislative branch make today.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I had hoped to ask a couple questions \nof the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. I consulted with the \nchairman, who wants to be recognized next. It would be my request, if I \nmay have Senator Whitehouse's attention, that he stay on the floor to \nengage in a discussion, a colloquy with me when the chairman has \nconcluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, Senator Specter has offered an \namendment altering the liability protections of title II. His amendment \nwould require the district court to assess the constitutionality of the \nPresident's warrantless wiretapping program before it could dismiss \ncases against telecommunications companies that met statutory \nrequirements for liability protection.\n  Although I appreciate the Senator's desire to ask the court to \naddress the constitutionality of the President's program once and for \nall, he has picked the wrong mechanism to ask the court to answer his \nquestion.\n  First, Senator Specter's amendment would completely undermine, as I \nsaid before, the delicate compromise in front of us today. People say: \nWell, we are freshly back in town, newly minted, widely open. I am \nsorry, this was a bill which just got through on a thread, and it will \nprobably get close to 70 votes, a compromise already accepted by the \nHouse with 70 percent of their votes, and I think that balances the \nprotection of liberties and also does something I have stated I think \nis rather important; that is, it allows the collection of intelligence \nto continue in order to protect the United States of America.\n\n  Senator Specter's amendment also would require the court to consider \na difficult constitutional question that otherwise would not be at \nissue in the cases.\n  Title II does not cover cases against Government actors. This \nexclusion was intentional. Cases against the Government for any \nunlawful or unconstitutional actions Government actors may have \nundertaken should be allowed to proceed. Arguments over the \nconstitutionality of the President's actions can and should be \nlitigated in those proceedings.\n  The amendment, however, injects this complicated constitutional \nquestion about the interplay of the fourth amendment and separation of \npowers into cases requesting civil damages from private companies. The \namendment does not require that there be a relationship between the \ncompanies and this constitutional question. It does not ask whether the \ncompanies were aware of the scope of the President's program, nor does \nit ask whether the companies' actions were done in good faith or even \nwhether they were legal. Indeed, if the court finds that the \nPresident's program violated the Constitution, the cases against the \ncompany will not be dismissed even if that company had no involvement \nin the unconstitutional components of the President's program.\n  Madam President, this is simply unfair. A company should not be \nsubjected to liability solely because the Government acted \nunconstitutionally. A company should not be subjected to liability \nsolely because the Government acted unconstitutionally. Any \naccountability and liability should be based on actions of the company, \nwhich is what title II is about.\n  Imposing this barrier to liability protection is also inconsistent \nwith our expectation about the role companies are expected to play when \nthey receive Government requests for information. Our existing \nstatutory approach is based on the idea that the Government requires \nprompt cooperation from the telecommunications companies. Although we \nexpect those companies to seek documentation from the highest levels of \nGovernment, they are not expected to assess the constitutionality of \nparticular requests on which they lack, to say the least, complete \ninformation.\n  The ongoing litigation is complicated by classified information \nissues that make it virtually impossible for the cases to move forward. \nBut if the cases could proceed without regard to the classified \ninformation at issue, the court would not consider the question of \nwhether the President's program was constitutional. Instead, it would \nask whether the companies were entitled to immunity based on existing \nlaw.\n  In addition, a case against any particular company is necessarily \nlimited to the facts relevant to that company. The court would, \ntherefore, not be provided a comprehensive look at the President's \nprogram in any of those cases.\n  We should not ask the district court to assess whether the \nPresident's program is constitutional when the answer to that question \nis unnecessary to resolve the underlying litigation between the \nplaintiffs and the carriers, and the court does not have sufficient \nfacts to address that far-reaching question of constitutionality. We \nare talking about apples and oranges, but it is apples here that we are \nconcerned with.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I do wish to engage in a colloquy with \nthe Senator from Rhode Island, but first, with the chairman having just \ncompleted, I would like to respond to some of his contentions and \nengage in a question or two with the chairman.\n  When the Senator from West Virginia argues that my amendment would \nundermine the delicate compromise which the Intelligence Committees \nhave reached, that is what the full Senate is supposed to do. The \ncommittees deliberate, the House and the Senate come to a conference \nreport, they bring the matter to the Senate, and then it is up to the \nfull body to make a determination. So there is nothing unusual about \ndisagreeing with the compromise, however delicate.\n  The chairman argues that it would require the courts to consider \ndifficult constitutional issues. That is exactly what the courts are \nsupposed to do. The full impact of Chief Judge Vaughn Walker's decision \nand how far-reaching it goes has not been felt, understood, or analyzed \nin the course of only 6 days--an opinion which runs more than 50 pages. \nWe are dealing with court-stripping in the middle of litigation that \nhas been going on for years. Judge Walker's opinion concerning the \ntelecom companies was in July 2006, with the telephone companies now on \nappeal.\n  It really goes back to the fundamental principle of Marbury v. \nMadison, when Chief Justice Marshall made the determination that it is \nup to the courts to decide what the Constitution means, and we would be \nundercutting that judicial process in midstream.\n  Earlier, I posed a question to the Senator from Missouri, which if \nthe chairman wishes to answer would be fine. I know and I admire what \nSenator Rockefeller has done. I have worked with him since he was \nelected in 1984, and we worked together on the Veterans' Committee and \non intelligence matters and on many major matters. When the history is \nwritten, there will be a famous handwritten letter disclosed by Senator \nRockefeller to the administration about how deeply he feels and how \ndeeply he cares about these matters. But I questioned the Senator from \nMissouri, who is a member of the bar and quite a scholar on \nconstitutional law, if there had been any case known to him picked up \nin midstream after years of work in the district court and pending on \nappeal. It really goes right to the heart of Marbury vs. Madison.\n\n  You have Chief Judge Walker having flatly decided that the terrorist \nsurveillance program is unconstitutional, and you have Chief Judge \nWalker leaving aside the issues of standing but saying:\n\n       Plaintiff amici hint at the proper showing when they refer \n     to ``independent evidence disclosing that plaintiffs have \n     been surveilled'' and a ``rich lode of disclosure to support \n     their claims.''\n\n  Going to the standing issue. Although not decided, why not let the \ncourts finish it? You have these decisions. Why not keep the current \nprogram in effect and not interrupt the courts and have the judicial \ndecision?\n\n[[Page S6411]]\n\n  So when the chairman raises the point that it would require the \ncourts to consider difficult constitutional questions, I agree with \nhim, but that is what the Federal courts are supposed to do, and it \nreally is untoward for the Congress to step into the middle of it. I \nknow of no case like it. And here we are being asked to strip the court \nof jurisdiction when they are in midstream, where they may well find \nsome important facts to some important matters in the course of the \njudicial decisions which would influence Congress.\n  We have the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Bingaman, which would call upon the inspector general to \nfind out what the facts are on immunity since, as I say, we are being \nasked to pass on this when we don't know the full import. And I support \nthe Bingaman amendment. I am an original cosponsor of it. Well, \nsimilarly, what Chief Judge Walker may find here may be very important.\n  But let me raise the first of two questions with the chairman.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. May I respond to the Senator's observation?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Certainly. I will yield.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would say to my distinguished friend from \nPennsylvania that Judge Walker's case is not, under any circumstance, \ngoing to be stopped by whatever happens here. It will not happen, and \nit will, therefore, continue. The bill only addresses cases against \ncarriers, is the point I was trying to make. Judge Walker--his case is \na case against the Government. This bill is not against the Government. \nIt is against what happens to the carriers, or in this particular case \nwhether they get liability. The Government is not the point. The \ncarriers are the point. The case continues, and we have not intervened \nin a malicious or malevolent way.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, Madam President, by way of reply, I understand \nthat this provision only concerns the telephone companies, and I \nunderstand the chairman's argument about good faith. But good faith is \nnot determinative in and of itself. If the conduct violates the \nConstitution, there is a constitutional violation no matter how good \nthe faith may be. It would be a good reason to indemnify, to \nsubstitute, to hold them harmless, but not to exonerate them for a \nconstitutional violation.\n  The chairman says companies should not be held liable if the \nGovernment acted unconstitutionally. That is not correct as a matter of \nlaw. Where the telephone companies are aiders and abetters and \naccessories before and after the fact and really act jointly with the \nGovernment, they can be liable.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That is quite an assumption to make, I say to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let me finish the reply, and I will be glad to yield \nagain.\n  When the argument is made that only the case against the telephone \ncompanies is involved, that is not quite accurate. It is being \ndismissed. It is no coincidence that Chief Judge Walker handed this \nopinion down a few days--6 days--before it was publicly known that the \nSenate would be taking up this issue. And he went out of his way to \nraise the issue about standing and the rich lode of disclosure. So if \nthis act is passed and retroactive immunity is granted, it will remove \nthe telephone companies, true, and there will be another case standing, \nbut there will be no judicial determination of the constitutionality of \nwhat the telephone companies did.\n  Chief Judge Walker has those cases against the telephone companies \ntoo, and he has pretty well given a roadmap as to what he is going to \ndo because he said the terrorist surveillance program is \nunconstitutional and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act covers \npen registers and trap-and-trace devices, covering whatever it is the \ntelephone companies did here; although, again, we do not know for sure. \nSo where he said the terrorist surveillance program is unconstitutional \nand the statute covers pen registers and trap-and-trace devices, to \nremove the case from him at this stage will eliminate a determination \nof the constitutionality of whatever it is the telephone companies did \nand really flies in the face of the historic role of the courts since \n1803 in Marbury vs. Madison.\n  Now I am glad to yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will just reply very briefly with three points, \nand when you are finished, I would like to yield to--or hopefully the \nvice chairman will yield to the senior Senator from Virginia.\n  The one point is that this is not a bill we are addressing here about \nthe Government. We are doing it about carriers, and particularly in \ntitle II.\n  Secondly, I am interested in what the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee feels might be the result if we went the Judge Walker route \nregardless of its inapplicability, in my view, to this situation when \nit went through the appeal process.\n  I am not a lawyer. Right now I wish I were, but I am not. Usually, I \nam glad I am not. But it seems to me that you would be looking at a \nperiod of appeals going right on up to the Supreme Court that might \nlast 3 or 4 years. I am not experienced in how long these things take. \nBut this is a matter that might take that kind of time and that causes \nme to raise again the question I have raised several times with the \nvice chairman this afternoon: The only thing that we appear to be \ndiscussing in the Senate is rights and liberties. I think I have yet to \nhear almost any word about the security of the Nation and what the \npurpose of the Intelligence Committee is, what the purpose of \nintelligence is, what the purpose of collection is, how the collection \nis done, who does it, how important is it to how we gauge our situation \nin the world, where we need to deploy, where we need to be watching.\n  This is extraordinarily serious stuff but not a word does it get in \nthe Senate, which is two-thirds made up of lawyers--and I honor every \none of them. But we are picking at ``would the Constitution allow'' \nthis or that. I am looking at something which to me is very clear. This \nis all about carriers, this particular bill. My name isn't Judge \nWalker. I haven't issued the opinion. If my name were Judge Walker, and \nit was an opinion, it would be about constitutionality. We are not \naddressing that in this bill.\n  The Senator earlier said: Look, we are here. Why not duke it out and \nget all the substitutes and arrangements and compromises back on the \ntable again. I know that does work in some fashion. But I think the \nvice chairman and I and our staffs could say that what was achieved \nover the last month or so could probably never be achieved again, which \nis to get the House to agree. John Conyers is chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who was gracious and polite but unfriendly to this bill. \nThere is the question of the Blue Dogs. You can say always these are \nquestions--on farm bills, on steel bills, on automobile bills, on \nwhatever bills.\n  This is a particular type of emergency based upon the fact that we \nare still, under my definition, under attack. Not that we have not been \nattacked, but we have been able to interdict, because of intelligence, \nsome of those attacks--or all of those attacks. This is a very \ndifferent matter than running an ordinary piece of legislation through \nthe Senate.\n  If 20 or whatever Judiciary plus Intelligence is in the Senate--35, \nwhatever that is. No, because there are some cross-memberships. Let's \nsay 20. Understand, the others have not been read in. I have said they \ncould have found out the information that has been available for a full \nyear. Any Senator has the ability to go and read intelligence, if they \nwish to do that. It sort of implies that the Senate, as a matter of \nhabit, comes to full agreement and full understanding that 80 out of \n100, as opposed to 20 or 25 out of a 100, fully understand what is at \nstake in the amendments to a bill and then to the final passage of a \nbill.\n  I think the Senator knows that is not the way it works. I think the \nSenator, although he says we should not delegate, knows we delegate all \nthe time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will. That takes various forms. Sometimes it will \nbe that I am very much on the edge of how I am going to vote on \nsomething, and I go to a particular Senator--it might be the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania--and say: I have this feeling and I have that \nfeeling, I am right on the cusp of which way I should vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S6412]]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will.\n  Mr. SPECTER. For the first time, I take sharp distinction with the \nchairman when he says there has been no recognition about the \nimportance of intelligence or the workings of the Intelligence \nCommittee or of special expertise.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I wasn't talking about special expertise--I was \ntalking about: We have not talked about the threat.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may continue?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may continue, no recognition of the work of the \nIntelligence Committee--let me limit it to that--which was certainly \nsaid.\n  I take sharp exception because I served 8 years on the committee and \nserved as chairman for 2 years. I think I know what the Intelligence \nCommittee does and what its work is.\n  I take sharp exception to the suggestion that there is not a full \nawareness on the part of this Senator as to the terrorism threat. I \nmade that explicit. When I said that if I have to take this bill, I \nwill, because of the threat of terrorism, just as I voted for the bill \nearlier when my substitution amendment was not adopted.\n  But when the chairman says that this has gone through a laborious \nprocess with the House and is a delicate compromise--that happens all \nthe time. It happens all the time. You are right in the middle of it, \nyou have seen it, and I know, too, because I have been there. I have \nbeen here 28 years, and I know exactly what goes on.\n  When you say this ought to be accepted, I disagree. This bill can be \nmade better.\n  When you say you deal with the intelligence function and not the \nconstitutional function--again, I sharply disagree. We have to \nlegislate on what is constitutional. We may have a different opinion \nthan Chief Judge Walker, but we cannot ignore the question of \nconstitutionality. If it takes 3 or 4 more years, we are talking about \ncivil rights and constitutional rights.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. My point.\n  Mr. SPECTER. This program has been continued on a temporary basis. It \nhas been extended. The intelligence chiefs have been satisfied with \nthat.\n  I don't like to extend it. I would like to resolve it now. But if it \ntakes the courts longer--the Supreme Court ducked the Detroit case. If \nit takes them years to decide this, that is the price of constitutional \nrights.\n  If you take a look at the history of this country, if you take just \none case, Plessy v. Ferguson, in 1896, I believe, to Brown v. Board in \n1954, to eliminate separate but equal, you come to a constitutional \ndoctrine.\n  I am prepared to take my time, if I can find the requisite number of \nvotes in this body.\n  Madam President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 20 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from West Virginia has 34 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, this is as good a time as any to move \nforward with a question or two, which I would like to have in a \ncolloquy with Senator Whitehouse. This issue has been raised before, \nbut I would like your views on it, Senator Whitehouse. You have a \ndistinguished record as an attorney, U.S. attorney, attorney general, \nserving with distinction on the Judiciary Committee for the past year \nand a half.\n  I raised the issue earlier about the constitutional authority of a \nMember to delegate his authority, recognizing that there are many \nmatters where we accept committee reports, but at least Senators have \naccess to material. When I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee--the \ntradition is to tell the chairman and the ranking member about a \nprogram such as the terrorist surveillance program. I was blindsided by \nit, in mid-December of 2005. We were on a Friday, the final day of the \nargument on the PATRIOT Act. We were about to go to final passage, when \nthe New York Times published its paper. That morning Senators said they \nhad been prepared to vote for it but no longer were. As chairman of the \ncommittee, I could not be briefed on the program.\n\n  Since that time, there has been a change of heart to an extent but, \nas stated on the floor of the Senate earlier, some 70 Members of this \nbody will be voting on retroactive immunity for a program they do not \nknow or understand. The majority of the House, according to House \nleadership, has not been briefed on the program.\n  Do you have any doubt that we may not constitutionally delegate our \nauthorities to vote?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Does the distinguished Senator yield me time to \nreply?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would like a reply as to whether it is your view, as a \nconstitutional matter, Members of Congress can delegate their authority \nto vote.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If the Senator from Rhode Island would give me 30 \nseconds, I would be grateful.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I have no objection, of course.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The fact of the matter, I say to the senior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, is that there are 37 Members of the Senate who have \nbeen briefed on this matter--not 20 but 37. We decided to do a little \nbit of homework: Fifteen on the Senate Intelligence Committee, 19 on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, that is 34--minus 4 crossover members; \n2 leadership on each side, Senator Roberts and the Appropriations \nCommittee chairman and, I suspect, vice chairman, plus Senator Levin \nand Senator McCain, who are ex officio.\n  That is not bad.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the statistics I have are, out of the \nHouse there have been 21 House Intelligence Committee members briefed \nand as many as 40 Judiciary Committee members; in the Senate, 15 on the \nIntelligence Committee and 19 on the Judiciary Committee for a \nbicameral total of 95, which is 17.75 percent of the entire Congress. \nBut if you take the chairman's figures, you still have a majority of \nMembers of Congress who have not been briefed, who are, in effect, \ndelegating their authority to vote on a matter where they don't know \nwhat they are granting immunity for.\n  But I refer, again, to the Senator from Rhode Island, if he cares to \nanswer the question.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Of course, I did say in my remarks that I believed \nthat this body is incapable of making a determination as to the good \nfaith of the telecommunications companies for the reason the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania has indicated, to wit, very few \nof us, less than a majority and certainly not all of us, have been \nbriefed as to what the actual facts are, what was provided, if \nanything, to the telecommunications companies that would support our \nfinding of good faith.\n  As I said in my remarks, I think essentially every Senator who has \nspoken to this question has implicitly referred to good faith, directly \nreferred to good faith as the implicit standard.\n  I view it, although I defer to the far greater experience and \nlearning of my colleague from Pennsylvania--I see it less as a \nconstitutional issue of deference than one of legislative prudence. I \nthink it is not prudent for us as a Senate to take it upon ourselves to \nmake the good-faith determination. I think that is a determination that \nshould be made by a judicial tribunal, it should be made with \nappropriate provision for confidentiality, and it should be made by the \njudicial agency that customarily makes good-faith determinations.\n  It isn't our legislative role to do that. So I agree with the concern \nof the distinguished Senator about this. I see it less as a \nconstitutional limitation on my ability as a Senator to cast my vote, \nwhich I think is untrammeled. I can cast my vote about things I know \nnothing about, have not studied on, am totally uninformed, if I wish. \nIt would be bad and imprudent for me to do it, but I do not believe the \nConstitution prevents me from doing it, so I see it more as a matter of \nlegislative prudence.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, one final question. Does the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island know of any case which has been pending in the \nFederal courts for at least 3 years, as the telephone company case has, \nwith the opinion by Chief Justice Walker in July of 2006 and now \npending on appeal in the Ninth Circuit, where the Congress stepped in \nto take away the jurisdiction by a grant of immunity as proposed in \nthis legislation?\n\n[[Page S6413]]\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am aware of none. I cannot guarantee that our \nresearch has been complete and exhaustive. But, certainly, the recent \nefforts that Congress has done where an immunity from liability has \nbeen an issue, either responding to pandemics or responding to \nvaccines, what Congress has done there is to create an alternative \nremedy.\n  I am aware of no precedent for the Congress of the United States \nstepping into ongoing litigation, choosing a winner and a loser, \nallowing no alternative remedy. And I believe the constitutional \nproblem with doing that as a separation of powers matter is \nparticularly acute where the cause of action that is being litigated in \nthe judicial branch is a constitutional claim. And Judge Vaughan is \nlistening to constitutional claims. That is the subject matter of the \nlitigation.\n  So I believe it will be determined by a court that ultimately this \nsection of the legislation is unconstitutional, in violation of the \nseparation of powers, because we may not, as a Congress, take away the \naccess of the people of this country to constitutional determinations \nheard by the courts of this country.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Judge Walker is certainly listening to constitutional \nclaims. He may even be listening to the Senate. Somebody may be \nlistening on C-SPAN 2.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island for his candid \nanswers.\n  How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lautenberg.) The Senator has 13 and a half \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose a blanket grant of \nimmunity. I also urge Senators to reject this ill-advised legislative \neffort to engineer a specific outcome in ongoing Federal judicial \nproceedings. No one should stand above the law in the United States.\n  The administration circumvented the law by conducting warrantless \nsurveillance of Americans for more than 5 years. They got caught. The \npress reported this illegal conduct in late 2005. Had the media not \ndone so, this unlawful surveillance may still be going on today.\n  When the public found out that the Government had been spying on the \nAmerican people outside of FISA for years, the Government and the \nproviders were sued by citizens who believed that their privacy rights \nwere violated. That is why we have Federal courts--so people can \nvindicate their rights before a fair and neutral tribunal, without \ninterference from the other branches of government.\n  Title II of this bill is apparently designed to terminate these \nlawsuits. It seems to reduce the role of the court to a rubber stamp. \nSo long as the Attorney General will certify that the Government \nrequested the surveillance and indicated that it had been ``determined \nto be lawful,'' the cases are to be dismissed and everybody is off the \nhook. That is not a meaningful judicial inquiry. That doesn't give the \nplaintiffs their day in court. It is not just a heavy thumb but a whole \nhand and arm on the scales of justice, and I cannot support it.\n  Here is what the report of the Select Committee on Intelligence said \nin connection with reporting its earlier version of retroactive \nimmunity:\n\n       The Committee has reviewed all of the relevant \n     correspondence. The letters were provided to electronic \n     communications service providers at regular intervals. All of \n     the letters stated that the activities had been authorized by \n     the President. All of the letters also stated that the \n     activities had been determined to be lawful by the Attorney \n     General, except for one letter that covered a period of less \n     than sixty days. That letter, which like all the others \n     stated that the activities had been authorized by the \n     President, stated that the activities had been determined to \n     be lawful by the Counsel to the President.\n\n  So if anyone had any doubt where the criteria in the bill come from, \nthere it is. Do those words seem familiar? Do the criteria carefully \nworded for inclusion in the bill now make sense?\n  I expect that the American people remember the testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee of James Comey and FBI Director Mueller about the \nperiod of time when Attorney General Ashcroft was in the hospital, \nsenior advisers at the Justice Department had advised against extending \napproval for the warrantless wiretapping program and the Counsel to the \nPresident, Alberto Gonzales, went to John Ashcroft's hospital room \nseeking to get Attorney General Ashcroft to override the acting \nAttorney General's concerns. Some time thereafter, the program was \napparently adjusted in some way, but only after FBI Director Mueller \nspoke to the President and several high-ranking officers threatened to \nquit the administration. That period could account for the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence's reference to a letter and period of less \nthan 60 days when it was the Counsel to the President who had \n``determined'' the activities ``to be lawful.''\n  Senator Specter has long said that he supported judicial review of \nthe legality of the President's warrantless wiretapping program. During \nthe last Congress, when he chaired the Judiciary Committee, he \nintroduced a bill that would have allowed the courts to review the \nlegality of the administration's warrantless surveillance program. \nUnfortunately, he later modified the bill in his discussions with the \nWhite House that made it unacceptable and ineffective in my view and it \nwas never passed. I have always supported allowing the courts the \nopportunity to review the legality of those activities.\n  I believe that independent judicial review will reject the \nadministration's claims to authority from the Authorization for the Use \nof Military Force that overrides FISA. I believe that the President's \nclaim to an inherent power, a Commander-in-Chief override, derived \nsomewhere from the interstices or penumbra of the Constitution's \narticle II will not prevail over the express provisions of FISA.\n  Indeed, Chairman Rockefeller seemed to concede as much this morning \nwhen he asserted that nothing in his bill should be taken to mean \n``that Congress believes that the President's program was legal.'' He \ncharacterized the administration as having made ``very strained \narguments to circumvent existing law in carrying out the President's \nwarrantless surveillance program.'' At various points Senator \nRockefeller alluded to the administration's argument that the \nAuthorization for the Use of Military Force was some sort of statutory \noverride authority and the administration's claim that the President \nhas what Senator Rockefeller called ``his all-purpose powers,'' which I \nunderstand to be the administration's argument that inherent authority \nfrom article II of the Constitution creates a Commander-in-Chief \noverride, and said that these are not justifications for having \ncircumvented FISA.\n  Consistent with Justice Jackson's now well-accepted analysis in the \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube case, when the President seeks to act in an \narea in which Congress has acted and exercised its authority, the \nPresident's power is at its ``lowest ebb.'' So I believe that the \nPresident's program of warrantless wiretapping contrary to and in \ncircumvention of FISA will not be upheld based on his claim of some \noverriding article II power. I do not believe the President is above \nthe law.\n  What is most revealing is that the administration has worked so \nfeverishly to subvert any such independent judicial review. That sends \na strong signal that the administration has no confidence in its \nsupposed legal analysis or its purported claims to legal authority. If \nit were confident, the administration would not be raising all manner \nof technical legal defenses but would work with Congress and the courts \nto allow a legal test of its contentions and the legality or illegality \nof its actions.\n  This amendment now offered by Senator Specter is more limited than I \nwould have liked. It says its purpose is to allow the courts to review \nthe constitutionality of the assistance provided by the electronic \ncommunication services in connection with the program. Exactly how the \ncourts get to such a review is not clear. Although I do not believe \nthat this expressly allows the court to conduct the kind of \ncomprehensive judicial review required to make a real determination \nabout the legality of this program, and a fair decision about the merit \nof these lawsuits, it nevertheless seeks in spirit to provide judicial \nreview. In the hope that it might provide an avenue to accountability \nfor the illegal actions of this administration, I will support it.\n\n[[Page S6414]]\n\n  In so doing I should note that I do not believe that Congress can \ntake away the authority of the Federal courts to consider \nunconstitutionality or illegality in the course of meaningful judicial \nreview. Senator Rockefeller emphasized this morning that the parties to \nthe ongoing cases are to be ensured ``their day in court'' and that \nthey are ``provided the opportunity to brief the legal and \nconstitutional issues before the court.'' These statements do not have \nmeaning unless the legal issues and constitutional issues presented by \nthese cases can be considered. The value of the Specter amendment lies \nin making the issue of constitutionality explicit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, like so many of my colleagues, I spent the \nweek of the Fourth of July traveling my State of South Dakota. I met \nwith members of the general public at an energy forum, met with small \nbusinesses, folks in the tourism industry. Everywhere I went it was the \nsame story: High gas prices are crippling the American economy.\n  I remember stopping in the small town of Parkston and visiting with \nsomeone who manages a small cafe there, and visiting with them about \nthe impact that high gas prices are having on their business.\n  She said: Well, it is not really the weekend travelers, the RV \nowners, the people who camp, but it is those people who are commuting \nto work every single day who now do not have the money to eat out \nnearly as often.\n  Of course, Parkston is a small town. It is about 20 miles, give or \ntake, from Mitchell, SD. There are a number of people who commute back \nand forth. It is those commuters who are feeling the most economic \nhardship as a result of high energy prices.\n  I attended my parents' 65th wedding anniversary in my hometown of \nMurdo. In my hometown, tourism, the visitor industry, is the very \nlifeblood of that community. I grew up in that business, worked in \nrestaurants, motels, that sort of thing. And I even had a forum, as \nwell, with members of the tourism industry in South Dakota in Rapid \nCity when I was home just to gauge the impact of high fuel prices on \ntheir individual businesses.\n  The Rapid City mayor, who owns a campground, said: I think we are \ngoing to reach a tipping point where the very foundations of the travel \nindustry could be shaken.\n  Bill Honerkamp, president of the Black Hills, Badlands and Lakes \nAssociation said tourism fell about 7 percent in the region in May, and \nnumbers for the rest of the summer are barely holding steady.\n  Teddy Hustead, president of the popular South Dakota tourist stop \nWall Drug, said tourist stops were down 1 percent in June. But he went \non to say that Wall Drug needs to be up 4 to 5 percent to be a healthy, \ngrowing, viable concern, and it is hard to grow a business when gas is \nincreasing by 10, 20, and 25 percent every single year.\n  Sean Casey, the vice president of another popular South Dakota \ntourist destination, Bear Country USA, noted that visitation is down 7 \npercent for the year 2008. And he went on to say: Energy is pinching \nus. I always joke that we are going to a model like the space shuttle--\ntwo visitors at $10 million each.\n  Jo Casky of the Spearfish Convention and Visitors Bureau noted that \nconvention is dropping because of high gas prices. One particular \nconvention was booked with a prediction of 1,200 to 1,400 attendees. \nThat is unlikely now because of the rising pump prices.\n  Casky said: We are now at about 800. As soon as gas started getting \nto the $4 mark, we started to see reservations back off.\n  High gas prices are having a dramatic impact on families, small \nbusinesses, the tourism industry, the airline industry, the \nagricultural industry, and virtually every sector of the American \neconomy.\n  I toured a UPS facility in Sioux Falls, SD. Many of my colleagues may \nhave heard what they are doing in terms of dealing with the price of \nfuel. They actually now, as they diagram routes for their drivers, \ndiagram routes that only allow them to make right turns so they do not \nsit in a left-turn lane and idle thereby using more energy.\n  My point is that people are taking extraordinary steps to deal with \nthe high cost of energy. Higher costs for companies such as UPS, \ntransportation companies, get passed on to consumers in the form of \nhigher prices for everything they buy. They are looking for leadership \nin Washington, DC. But instead of leadership, they have seen a decade \nof inaction, as arguably the most important issue of impacting the \nAmerican economy has been left unattended.\n  We have done nothing to affect the basic law of supply and demand. \nSome argue, and perhaps rightly so, that high energy costs are partly a \nfunction of the weak dollar. They would be, as I said, accurate to say \nthat because oil is denominated in dollars. When it takes $1.57 to \npurchase a Euro, it is going to make anything denominated in dollars \nmore expensive.\n  There are those who think speculators are driving up the cost of \nenergy in this country, and it is true that trading in energy \ncommodities has increased dramatically over the past 30 years since the \nexchanges were created. I, for one, happen to believe we need to look \nfor ways to define the degree to which speculation is impacting energy \nprices in this country and also look at what we can do to address that \nissue in a way that makes matters better and not worse.\n  Trading since 2004 on the NYMEX Exchange has nearly tripled. So we \nneed to make sure our farmers, our ranchers, our airlines, our trucking \ncompanies, have the opportunity and ability that they need to manage \nrisk. That is what those markets were created for. We also need \ntransparent markets where all traders are subjected to the same sets of \nrules.\n  I believe we need more cops on the beat. We need to make sure the \nCFTC has the funding it needs to do its job and to enforce our laws. I \nthink we can do some things, such as codifying CFTC position limits and \ntransparency for foreign boards of trade. I guess my point is that \nthere are a number of things we can do to address the impact that \nspeculators may be having on the price of energy in this country. And, \nfrankly, I think that is a role and responsibility that Congress should \nfill.\n  But if you take the weak dollar, and you take speculators out of the \nequation, we still have a major problem and a major crisis in this \ncountry. That problem is that we have greater demand for energy than we \nhave supply. We use about 86, 85 to 86 million barrels of oil every \nsingle day worldwide. Of that amount, the United States uses about 20 \nmillion barrels or about 24 percent of the total. Of that amount of 20 \nmillion barrels that the United States uses every single day, about 12 \nmillion barrels are imported.\n  In other words, 60 percent of the oil that we use every single day in \nAmerica comes from outside the United States. We are transporting and \nshipping and transferring about a half trillion dollars every single \nyear of American wealth outside of the United States to petro dictators \nwho are being enriched by that American wealth and using it in ways \nthat I think most of us would disagree with; in fact, in many ways to \nsupport terrorist organizations in places around the world.\n  Now, we cannot solve our dangerous dependance upon foreign sources of \nenergy absent affecting that basic law and rule of supply and demand. \nWe have to find more energy in this country. We should be taking steps \nnow to add supply and to reduce our demand.\n  One of the things we need to continue to support and intensify, in my \nview, is our commitment toward renewable energy. I want to read \nsomething that Tom Friedman said in an op-ed on June 29. The op-ed was \ntitled ``Anxious in America.''\n  But he said:\n\n       My fellow Americans. We are a country in debt and in \n     decline, not terminal, not irreversible, but in decline. Our \n     political system seems incapable of producing long-range \n     answers to big problems or big opportunities. We are the ones \n     who need a better functioning democracy. More than the Iraqis \n     and Afghans, we are the ones in need of nationbuilding as it \n     is our political system that is not working.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n\n[[Page S6415]]\n\n\n       I continue to be appalled at the gap between what is \n     clearly going to be the next great global industry, renewable \n     energy and clean power, and the inability of Congress and the \n     administration to put in place the bold policies we need to \n     ensure that America leads that industry.\n\n  Well, one of the things that we did, and it was a moonshot in terms \nof renewable energy and making an investment in our future, is the \nrenewable fuels standard. Last December there were 80 Senators who \nvoted to increase the renewable fuels standard to 36 billion gallons by \nthe year 2022. That was a policy that was put in place less than a year \nago, and yet already we have people, Members of the Senate, politicians \nin Washington, who are talking about rolling that back. That could be \nthe absolute worst thing that we do.\n\n  We do not need less energy in this country, we need more energy in \nthis country. We need more renewable fuels. The 8 or 9 billion gallons \nof renewable energy that we produce in this country every single year \ntoday is taking pressure off gasoline and oil prices by, according to a \nstudy conducted by Merrill-Lynch, up to about 15 percent.\n  In the current market economy that is about 50 to 60 cents per gallon \nof gasoline. Someone has said it is ethanol and corn prices that are \ndriving up the cost of everything we buy in this country, and \nparticularly with regard to this whole food-versus-fuel debate. But the \nAmerican Truckers Association recently did a study which found that in \nlate 2004 it cost about 16 cents per box of cereal to transport that \nbox of cereal to the marketplace. Today it costs about 36 cents per box \nof cereal. So we have seen a 20-cent increase in the transportation \ncost for a box of cereal. Couple that with the fact that the amount of \ncorn in a box of Corn Flakes is about 10 cents per box, and you can see \nwhat is driving up the cost of everything in our economy. It is the \nincreasing price per barrel of oil, increasing price of energy in this \ncountry.\n  We need to speed cellulosic ethanol to the marketplace. We need to \nincrease the blends of ethanol. We need not fewer gallons of renewable \nenergy in this country, we need more gallons of renewable energy. I \nhope those in Washington, in the administration and Congress, who are \ntalking about considering rolling back the renewable fuels standard \nwould reconsider that and think about the importance of renewable \nenergy and what it can do for America's future and our dangerous \ndependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  The second thing, of course, we have to do is we have to increase our \ndomestic supply. That means the Outer Continental Shelf. That means the \noil shale in places in the Western States. It means ANWR. It means coal \nto liquid. It means nuclear. It means wind. We have all of these \ndomestic energy supplies in this country, and we have heard people say \nit would take 5 to 100 years to develop some of these energy supplies. \nWell, that is what they were saying 5 or 10 years ago about many of \nthese same things.\n  We did not do it then, and now we are paying a price for it. Is it \nnot our job as policymakers to be looking down the road to future \ngenerations to make decisions that are in the best interests of \nAmerica's future. There is not any issue, I would argue, that is more \nimportant to America's future than energy security because it ties \ndirectly into and correlates directly into our national security.\n  We have to have more domestic supply, and the last thing we have to \ndo is we have to use less. We have to find more sources of energy, more \ndomestic sources of energy, so we do not continue to get 60 percent of \nthat energy from outside the United States. And we have to figure out \nways in this country to use less energy.\n  I have a bill that I have introduced. I am on a bill that Senator \nMcConnell, the Republican leader, has introduced which has 43 \ncosponsors. I have introduced a bill of my own to deal with this energy \nsituation. I am working with a group of both Republicans and Democrats. \nWe need to put the politics aside, the partisanship aside, and work on \ngetting a solution for the American people.\n  In the bill that I introduced, one of the things I include is a \nprovision that requires that of additional Government lands that are \nleased for energy production--whether they be offshore, whether they be \noil shale in the Western States, whether it be ANWR, the lease revenue, \nhalf of the lease revenue that comes into the Federal Government be \nplowed back into research and development and new technologies, in \nrenewables, alternative sources of energy, things like plug-in hybrid \ncars, cellulosic advanced biofuels, hydrogen fuel cells.\n  Those are the types of things we also need to be investing in to make \nsure that not only are we increasing the supply of energy in this \ncountry, the amount that we have, but also that we are using less.\n  We can do this. We can put aside the finger-pointing and the blame \ngame and do something for our energy future. I believe when people come \ntogether, and when they decide that this is an important priority for \nAmerica's future, we can get this done.\n  But we can't do it by saying no to every proposal put on the table. \nMy colleagues on the other side--many of them; not all, but many--have \nsaid no to offshore production, no to oil shale, no to nuclear, no to \ncoal to liquid, no to additional refinery capacity. We can't solve this \nproblem by saying no. We have to start saying yes to more domestic \nproduction and to more measures that would allow us to conserve and \nreduce the amount of energy we use. We have to get serious about this \nissue. It starts with addressing that fundamental law and rule of \nsupply and demand. We can do all these other things, the dollar can \nstart firming up, we can address the role of speculation in the \nmarketplace. But at the end of the day, we don't solve the problem \nunless we get serious about increasing our domestic supply of energy \nand reducing and using less energy. When we do that, we will see the \nprice per barrel start to come down, the price per gallon of gasoline \nstart to come down, and we will see the American economy, in places \nsuch as South Dakota, where tourism and agriculture are so critically \nimportant, start to rebound and start to draw more visitors to the \ntourism industry and to make sure our farmers continue to produce food \nand fiber in a way that allows them to maximize their return on \ninvestment and not get choked with high input costs coming from higher \nenergy costs.\n  I hope before we adjourn for the August recess, we will come together \nbehind an energy proposal and plan that is good for America's future, \nthat emphasizes renewables, more domestic supply and production, and \naddresses the important issue of conservation. But we can't do that by \ncontinuing to say no. I ask my colleagues on both sides to quit saying \nno and to start saying yes to America's energy independence. Say no to \nour dangerous dependence upon foreign energy but yes to making America \nenergy independent and making this country more prosperous for \nAmerica's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the leadership and the floor \nmanagers, I have been asked to propound a unanimous-consent request \nthat the following Senators be recognized, assuming they are here on \nthe floor in time to be recognized: I will speak now for about 15 \nminutes, to be followed by Senator Carper for 10 minutes. I see my \ndistinguished friend, the Senator from Mississippi; if he could \nindicate how much time he would like.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. About 8 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. He is to be joined by Senator Wicker.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes, he is in the Chamber as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. All right.\n  Mr. WICKER. About 8 minutes also.\n  Mr. WARNER. All right. And Senator Stabenow, I do not see her, but \nlet's put her down for 10, and Senator Cornyn.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would need 15 minutes. If I can yield back some time, \nthat would be great.\n  Mr. WARNER. With that in mind--I do not see any other Senators \nseeking recognition--I ask it in the form of a unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise, along with the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member of the Intelligence Committee on which I am \nprivileged to serve. I commend my chairman and ranking member for the \nextraordinary capability with which they have handled this \ncontroversial issue of\n\n[[Page S6416]]\n\nthe FISA legislation and the bipartisanship they have shown. Our \ncommittee voted 13 to 2 on this measure which is now before the Senate. \nCurrently, we have the Bingaman and Specter amendments. I join my \nchairman and ranking member in opposing these two amendments. They seek \nin one way or another to remove or render useless one of the most \nimportant sections of the FISA Amendments Act which is liability \nprotection for the telecommunication carriers that assisted our \nGovernment with the President's terrorist surveillance program or TSP. \nWithout the title II liability protection, the other sections of the \nFISA Amendments Act would become irrelevant because the carriers would \nnot cooperate in the authorized programs.\n  This would be unfortunate, because the FISA Amendments Act is a \ncritical piece of legislation for America's present and future security \nthat achieves an important balance between protecting civil liberties \nand ensuring that our dedicated intelligence professionals have the \ncapabilities they need to protect the Nation. The bill ensures that the \nintelligence capabilities provided by the Protect America Act, enacted \nin August 2007, remain sealed in statute.\n  Reforming FISA has not been an easy process. I would like to thank \nChairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond for the work they have done \nto garner bipartisan support for the FISA Amendments Act. It would be \nunfortunate if that work were undone by one of these amendments.\n  If passed, the Specter amendment would prohibit the dismissal of the \nlawsuits against the telecommunications carriers if the President's \nTerrorist Surveillance Program were found to be unconstitutional by the \ncourts. With all due respect to my colleague from Pennsylvania, I \nbelieve that whether the President acted within his constitutional \nauthorities should be treated separately from the issue of whether the \ncarriers acted in good faith.\n  The extensive evidence made available to the Intelligence Committee \nshows that carriers who participated in this program relied upon our \nGovernment's assurances that their actions were legal and in the best \ninterest of the security of America.\n  Mr. President, I would like to call the Senate's attention to the \nreport which accompanied the version of the FISA Amendments Act passed \nby the Senate Intelligence Committee by a vote of 13-2. Based on the \ncommittee's extensive examination of the President's TSP, the report \nnoted that the executive branch provided written directives to the \ncarriers to obtain their assistance with the program. After its review \nof all of the relevant correspondence, the committee concluded that the \nletters ``stated that the activities had been authorized by the \nPresident [and] had been determined to be lawful'' The committee report \nadded the following:\n\n     On the basis of the representations in the communications to \n     providers, the Committee concluded that the providers, in the \n     unique historical circumstances of the aftermath of September \n     11, 2001, had a good faith basis for responding to the \n     requests for assistance they received. Section 202 makes no \n     assessment about the legality of the President's program. It \n     simply recognizes that, in the specific historical \n     circumstances here, if the private sector relied on written \n     representations that high-level Government officials had \n     assessed the program to be legal, they acted in good faith \n     and should be entitled to protection from civil suit.\n\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee believed, by a vote of 13-2, that \nthe companies acted in good faith and that they deserve to be \nprotected. I agree and I believe that the TSP was legal, essential, and \ncontributed to preventing further terrorist attacks against our \nhomeland.\n  But, even if one were to disagree that the President acted within his \narticle II powers, I cannot see the wisdom in seeking to punish the \ncarriers and their shareholders for something the Government called on \nthe carriers to do with the assurance that the action was legal.\n  The Specter amendment would put the companies, and their millions of \nshareholders, in legal limbo, waiting while the Government litigates \nunrelated constitutional claims. Historically, the Supreme Court has \nbeen reluctant to adjudicate constitutional disputes between the \npolitical branches of our Government, suggesting that a constitutional \nquestion could take years to resolve, if it can be resolved. Lawsuits \nagainst the companies would likely continue in the interim which would: \nHave negative ramifications on our intelligence sources and methods; \nlikely harm the business reputations of these companies; and cause the \ncompanies to reconsider their participation--or worse--cause them to \nterminate their cooperation in the future.\n  I believe it would be unfair to use private companies as a substitute \nto adjudicate constitutional claims properly directed against the \nGovernment. My colleagues should keep in mind that individuals who \nbelieve that the Government violated their civil liberties can pursue \nlegal action against the Government, and the FISA Amendments Act does \nnothing to limit that legal recourse. As noted by my colleague from \nWest Virginia, the case that was before Judge Walker--which addresses a \nconstitutional challenge against the government--can proceed.\n  Bottom line, companies who participate in this program do so \nvoluntarily to help America preserve its freedom and the safety--\nindividually and collectively--of its citizens. I have long supported \nthe idea of a ``volunteer force'' for our military and I believe a \n``volunteer force'' of citizens and businesses who do their part to \nprotect our great Nation from harm is equally important. I fear that if \nwe are forced to draft companies into compliance when our Nation calls \nthem to duty, ultimately our security will suffer. Without this \nretroactive liability provision, I believe companies will no longer \nvoluntarily participate. This will result in a degradation of America's \nability to protect its citizens.\n  It is for these reasons that I urge my colleagues to oppose the \nSpecter amendment and any other amendment that would change the FISA \nAmendments Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I wish to conclude by saying that as I view this situation, I liken \nthe private sector that has responded to the request of the Federal \nGovernment, which has been given assurances by the Federal Government, \nto the all-volunteer military force we have today. It is imperative \nthat within the private sector there be elements, primarily these \ncorporations and companies which have come forward to provide the \ntechnical assistance and also the facilities by which to implement the \nFISA program. They have done it by and large voluntarily. The program \ncould not succeed without their participation. Therefore, they ask no \nmore than what is justly owed to them, and that is protection from the \nlawsuits. I hope we can turn back these two amendments and proceed to \nfinal passage and that the Senate will go on record as supporting the \nessential nature of the FISA program.\n\n\n                             Energy Crisis\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to turn to the question that \nconfronts America today; namely, the energy crisis. I use the word \n``crisis'' advisedly, because today no less than a third of Americans \nare absolutely struggling night and day to find the funds necessary to \nmeet ever increasing food prices and ever increasing energy prices. It \nis for that reason I have taken a step. I wish to repeat that. I have \nsimply taken a step to write the Secretary of Energy and to write the \nComptroller General, the head of the GAO, to determine what are the \nfacts relating to the 1973-1974 energy crisis, how America addressed \nthat crisis, and the actions taken by the President and the Congress in \n1973-1974. Again, Congress acted unanimously to back the President in \nimposing a national speed limit, that speed limit for the purpose of \nlessening the demand for gasoline and hopefully to have consequent \nsavings at the gas pump.\n  That is a chapter in American history. I remember it quite well. I \nwas privileged at that time to be Secretary of the Navy. Indeed, the \nDepartment of Defense, although at war in Vietnam, came forward and \nparticipated to try and help America work its way through that energy \ncrisis. The national speed limit was the centerpiece of that program.\n  I ask unanimous consent now to print in the Record the letters I sent \nto the Secretary of Energy and the Comptroller General at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n\n[[Page S6417]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Again, I am not taking a position that at this time we should invoke \na new initiative in the Congress to pass legislation calling for a \nnational speed limit because I simply do not have the facts. I am on a \nfact-finding mission. But if those facts come forward, as I believe \nthey will, and show that this will help alleviate and lessen the demand \nat the pump and the cost to the American citizen, then I am quite \nlikely to try--more than that, I am quite probably going to try--and \ngarner support on both sides of the aisle to push forward with this \nlegislation. I say so because I come back again to about a third of \nAmerica at this point in time is frantically trying to make ends meet. \nWe have to come up with a solution. We have to lead in the Congress, \nand hopefully the President will join. We have that duty.\n  Therefore, these two letters going to, certainly, the GAO, an \nimpartial arbiter of the facts and finder of the facts, will provide \nthis Chamber with the information necessary to make an informed \njudgment as to whether to go forth with legislation. I deem that the \nSecretary of Energy will reflect, quite understandably, the policy of \nan administration toward such a measure to bring about alleviation of \nthe pressures at the gas pump today and on families.\n  Again, this step is in the category of conservation of energy. My \ncolleagues--and I have participated with them--are looking at, in my \nopinion, three areas of addressing this problem: short-term, which is \nconservation, that is the only way to bring about some immediate \nmeasure of relief; secondly, intermediate steps, which I outlined in my \nspeech here; and lastly, the long term. Much has been said about long-\nterm steps. I take pride and push aside any sense of humility because \nfor several years I have stood on this floor and urged offshore \ndrilling, even put forth a measure here in this body which was defeated \nwhich called for the right of my State, Virginia, and such other States \nthat might wish to join, through the Governor and the State \nlegislature's participation, agreeing to drilling offshore of Virginia \nfor gas. I am not suggesting I brought about a change of thinking in \nthe administration, but the President now supports that concept. \nIndeed, a number of my colleagues now support that concept. I opine \nthat I believe in due course the Congress will provide the President \nwith legislation to take those important steps. But that offshore \ndrilling will not lessen the price today at the pump.\n  It will not help a case which was the final straw to decide that I \nwould embark on this course, when I read an article about the meals on \nwheels program where the shut-ins at home, who for economic reasons and \nphysical reasons and other reasons can't go out and get their meals. \nThey rely upon a system of volunteers to bring the meals to their \nhomes. But that program is beginning to founder because the volunteers \nsimply cannot afford the additional cost of gasoline. I don't know \nabout my colleagues, but this causes me severe heart palpitations and \nconcern. The reporter said to me, when he interviewed me on this an \nhour or so ago, a national reporter: All right, Senator, are you \nwilling to drive at a slower rate? What sort of car are you driving?\n  I told him what type of car I drive. I said: There are occasions when \nI drive over 55 miles an hour, 60 miles an hour, sometimes 65. But I am \nwilling to give up whatever advantage to me to drive at those speeds \nwith the fervent hope that that modest sacrifice on my part will help \nthose people across this land tonight and tomorrow and in the \nindefinite future dealing with this financial crisis.\n  I point out also that in 1973-1974, these were automobiles, how well \nI remember, without growth of the quick production lines that started \nafter World War II. America was flourishing. Then all of a sudden, the \nArabs put an oil embargo on this country and took away our ability to \nget fuel. The President reacted quickly. The Congress reacted quickly. \nWe put in that limit. In due course, the pressure on the pump declined \nand gas fell to about $2 a gallon. In 1995, 20 years after the \nenactment of this legislation by the Congress and the President, the 55 \nmiles was lifted. Mind you, it wasn't one President; it was a series of \nPresidents who endorsed this program of conservation in terms of the \nreduction of speed. I don't know. At one time I used to be a pretty \ngood mechanic on automobiles, but they have now gotten a degree of \ncomplexity that is beyond my grasp. I rely on my son, who has devoted \nmuch of his life to auto racing.\n  He is a wonderful mechanic and an engineer on cars. He said the \ncarburetion system--he argued with me about this when I spent the past \nweekend with him--shook his fist at me: I don't want this 55-mile-per-\nhour limit. And that is good advice. But he said the carburetion \nsystems in cars today are better than they were in 1973 and 1974, and I \njudge that to be the case.\n  So I asked in my letters: Analyze the technical capabilities of the \ncars today, and could we anticipate bringing about a savings at the gas \npump by virtue of a national speed limit? So we have to get the facts \nand put them together.\n  But I ask my colleagues, as they proceed to work on this issue--and I \nam all for the renewables, but that is long term. Offshore drilling: \nlong term. We have to focus now on what measures we can take to help \npeople now, if not long term.\n  I know colleagues are getting the same calls and the same letters I \nam receiving from those people who, frankly, feel very oppressed by \nthis rapid development. Although it has increased basically a dollar a \ngallon in the last year, so much of it has come on in the last 120 \ndays, unanticipated in speed and causing great hardship here at home.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 3, 2008.\n     Hon. Samuel W. Bodman,\n     Secretary of Energy,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Bodman: I write today with respect to the \n     high cost of gasoline. Today, the average cost of a gallon of \n     regular gasoline is more than $4.10. This is an increase of \n     well over a dollar a gallon from a year ago.\n       As you know, each and every day, Americans struggle to cope \n     with this rapid, record increase in fuel costs. Across the \n     United States, individual Americans are taking their own \n     initiatives to find ways to reduce gas consumption through \n     driving less, altering daily routines, and even changing or \n     cancelling family vacation plans.\n       To date, as far as I can determine, the federal government \n     has taken few, if any, initiatives to join in this national \n     effort to help address this ever increasing crisis.\n       I believe it is essential that we continue to modernize our \n     energy infrastructure and develop a reliable, commonsense \n     American energy strategy--one that includes new supplies from \n     domestic exploration and extraction, encourages conservation, \n     and promotes the use and advancement of clean, renewable \n     energies.\n       I am among a group of many senators today who are working \n     in a bipartisan fashion to find a solution. For the past \n     several years, I have supported permitting the Commonwealth \n     of Virginia to explore and extract energy offshore if its \n     Governor and General Assembly so desire. This concept has \n     just recently gained the support of the administration and a \n     growing number of colleagues in Congress.\n       However, the truth is that new technologies and new sources \n     of energy will not provide meaningful relief for years to \n     come as new technologies are developed and as new sources of \n     energy are discovered and extracted. We must be straight with \n     the American public and not raise hopes that these efforts \n     will provide immediate solutions and possible relief.\n       There are ways to give some immediate relief. In my view: \n     new conservation efforts are the quickest way to see an \n     immediate reduction in the price of gas at the pump. The \n     American public is already doing its part through individual \n     means of cutting back.\n       On a federal level, on May 22, 2008, Senator Bingaman and I \n     introduced, and the Senate unanimously passed by voice vote, \n     a sense-of-the-Senate resolution (S. Res. 577) that urged the \n     President to initiate, among all federal departments and \n     agencies of the executive branch, a reduction of their daily \n     consumption of gasoline--if only by a small percentage.\n       To my knowledge, the administration has not responded to \n     the Senate's action. In the absence of pending administration \n     action, Congress should join with the public and make the \n     concepts in the sense-of-the-Senate resolution a mandatory \n     law.\n       Turning to another concept, I call to your attention action \n     taken by the Congress and the executive branch during a \n     similar petroleum shortage that occurred in 1973 and 1974. In \n     January 1974, the President signed into\n\n[[Page S6418]]\n\n     law ``The Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act'' (public \n     Law 93-239), which passed both the House and Senate \n     unanimously. This law was enacted in an effort to conserve \n     fuel.\n       Specifically, the law put forth inducements for states to \n     reduce speed limits to 55 miles per hour (mph) on all major \n     highways. Failure to do so would jeopardize the ability of \n     states to secure federal highway funds. The law was \n     originally intended to be temporary, ceasing to be in effect \n     if the President declared that there was no longer a fuel \n     shortage or on or after June 30, 1975, whichever occurred \n     first.\n       According to a Congressional Research Service report, the \n     law resulted in reduced consumption of 167,000 barrels of \n     petroleum a day, a roughly 2 percent reduction in the \n     nation's highway fuel consumption. In addition, the National \n     Academy of Sciences found that the law saved up to 4,000 \n     lives per year from highway accidents. Given the significant \n     increase in the number of vehicles on America's highway \n     system from 1974 to 2008, one could assume that the amount of \n     fuel that could be conserved today is far greater.\n       Given the fuel savings of the act, and the resulting \n     significant decrease in highway fatalities attributable to \n     the national speed limit, Congress made the national speed \n     limit permanent in December 1974. In 1995, the law was \n     repealed.\n       The purpose of this letter is to ask you to study this era \n     of conservation, as I have, to determine whether the \n     administration, with the support of Congress; should take \n     similar action today.\n       According to the U.S. Department of Energy Web site, \n     engineering data shows that fuel efficiency decreases rapidly \n     above 60 mph. Specifically, for every 5 mph an individual \n     drives over 60 mph, that individual essentially is paying an \n     extra 30 cents per gallon in fuel costs.\n       As Congress continues to look for ways to ease this \n     national problem, I put to you the following questions. I \n     will share your responses with my colleagues.\n       (1) Given the significant technological improvements since \n     1974, at what speed is the typical vehicle traveling on \n     America's highways today most fuel efficient?\n       (2) If a national speed limit was enacted similar to the \n     1974 law, but the speed limit under that law was consistent \n     with most fuel efficient speed for the typical vehicle \n     traveling on America's highways, what would be a reasonable \n     projection for total fuel savings? And, what would be the \n     savings for the average citizen who owns and operates a \n     vehicle?\n       (3) If a new national speed limit was enacted consistent \n     with the two questions listed above, how many fewer barrels \n     of petroleum a day would Americans consume? Is it reasonable \n     to believe that there would be a reduction in price at the \n     pump? And, if so, what are the ranges you could project for \n     cost reductions?\n       (4) If the federal government took the initiative to reduce \n     its oil consumption, consistent the concepts of the sense-of-\n     the-Senate resolution (S. Res. 577) how many fewer barrels of \n     petroleum a day would be saved by the federal government?\n       Given that Congress, upon its return next week, will be \n     vigorously considering all options, your response to this \n     request could be of great help to my colleagues and me. \n     Again, years ago, the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation \n     Act worked. The administration's advice, after examining this \n     era and these concepts, would be helpful.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n     John Warner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 2008.\n     Hon.

And, if so, what are the ranges you could project for \n     cost reductions?\n       (4) If the federal government took the initiative to reduce \n     its oil consumption, consistent the concepts of the sense-of-\n     the-Senate resolution (S. Res. 577) how many fewer barrels of \n     petroleum a day would be saved by the federal government?\n       Given that Congress is vigorously considering all options, \n     your response to this request could be of great help to my \n     colleagues and me.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Warner.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the pending business on the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act is an amendment which I have pending, No. \n5059. We started at 4 o'clock, and we are due for 2 hours. I stepped \noff the floor for just a few minutes for necessaries and have come back \nto find a unanimous consent proposal for some six speakers. I have \ntalked to a number of Senators on the floor, and they are in morning \nbusiness.\n  It seems to me the orderly procedure would be to allow us to finish \nour bill. I understand any Senator can come out and ask for unanimous \nconsent. But, candidly, my good friend from Virginia, I wish you had \ngiven me notice.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I felt I was acting at the personal \nrequest of\n\n[[Page S6419]]\n\nChairman Rockefeller and the ranking member when I did this. I inquired \non the floor as to the desires of other Senators. I regret, my dear \nfriend, I would not have done this in any way to deter your ability to \ndo what you feel you have to do on this bill.\n  So at this point in time, certainly the floor is open to additional \nunanimous consent. But I do bring to your attention the Senators who \nare currently in the Chamber are here as a consequence of the UC that I \nproposed at the request of the two managers.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, with all due respect to my good friend from \nVirginia, I was on the floor all afternoon, you sitting there and me \nsitting here. But that is water over the dam.\n  My request, Mr. President, is that--the only Senator on this list who \nI have ascertained is going to speak to the bill is Senator Carper; he \nis on the list now for 10 minutes--we conclude the bill, or the \nalternative: to move ahead with the balance of the times reserved until \ntomorrow morning.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, again, Senators on the floor can certainly \nspeak for themselves, but I point out I think the Chair advised the \nmanagers as to the time remaining on both sides of the bill.\n  Am I not correct, I ask the Presiding Officer? Could you inform the \nSenate as to the times remaining under the UC to which my good friend \nfrom Pennsylvania refers?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 10 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from West Virginia has 33 minutes remaining. The \nSenator from New Mexico has 14 minutes. The Senator from Missouri has 5 \nminutes. The Senator from Connecticut has 21 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I leave it to the Chair to address that. I \nthink the Senator from Pennsylvania should be recognized for the \npurpose of his 10 minutes, but I am not sure we are in a position to \nforeclose other Senators who have been waiting here patiently to \naddress the Senate on other matters.\n  It seems to me the Senator from Pennsylvania should revise the \nrequest to enable him to have his 10 minutes and Senator Carper his 10 \nminutes and then allow the Chamber to proceed with other matters. It \nseems to me that is a fair resolution to this problem.\n  Again, I apologize if I was acting--as I was so asked to do--contrary \nto the Senator's wishes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with respect to waiting, I have been here \nsince 11 o'clock this morning on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Carper be \nrecognized, as he is, for 10 minutes, and that the other Senators \nsubject to the unanimous consent request be accorded the time given to \nthem, and that the remainder of the time reserved be scheduled for \ntomorrow at the discretion of the majority leader.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will not object. I wish to thank my \ncolleague for what I think is a very fair resolution to this situation.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, may I be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am told \nwe cannot shift the time until tomorrow. I am told we need to use the \ntime that has been allocated today. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator repeat his reservation, \nplease.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I understand--and I look to the \nParliamentarian and to the Presiding Officer--I am told the Senate is \nrequired to use the time that has been allocated for the discussion of \nthese amendments today, and there is additional time for it tomorrow in \ntomorrow's debate before we begin voting. But we need to use up the \ntime that is allocated for this afternoon and this evening.\n  I would inquire of the Presiding Officer, is that your understanding \nas well?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I heard the Chair \nsay there is 10 minutes remaining of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, that time is yielded to Senator Carper, so that \nwould take all the time allotted to this Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withdraw his unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, there has been an objection to it, as I \nunderstand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARPER. Reluctantly, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I believe under the unanimous consent \nagreement entered earlier, I am recognized for 10 minutes, and I ask \nunanimous consent that my time be counted against time controlled by \nSenator Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nFISA compromise legislation that is before us this week. I believe \nreasonable people can disagree about this measure, and I certainly \nrespect the views of those who oppose it. But I wish to take a moment \nthis afternoon to explain, first, why I am supporting this bipartisan \ncompromise and, second, to encourage my colleagues and others to do so \nas well.\n\n  All of us know we live in a dangerous world today. We face serious \nthreats to our safety and to our security. At the same time, we face a \ndifficult balancing act between, on the one hand, the need to protect \nour country and the safety of our citizens and, on the other hand, the \nneed to preserve our civil liberties.\n  All too often, the Bush administration's approach has been, at least \nin my judgment, misguided. Many opponents of the FISA legislation \nbefore us are rightly concerned that civil liberties have been ignored \nand in some cases violated.\n  I believe that is why, to some extent, many critics of this bill have \nfocused so heavily--almost exclusively, in fact--on the legislation's \nretroactive immunity provisions. I regret the majority of my colleagues \nin the House and the Senate do not see eye to eye with those critics \nregarding immunity. However, I wish to take a few minutes to explain \nwhy most of us who support this bill in its amended form believe that \ngranting immunity is fair.\n  During the extraordinary national emergency that followed the \nSeptember 11 attacks upon our Nation, the Federal Government reached \nout--\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Delaware yield for \na moment?\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Delaware is \nusing time from Senator Rockefeller.\n  Mr. CARPER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. So my time would remain. I had thought there was 13 \nminutes remaining. Is there only 10?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes is all that remains.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair, and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime, however the scheduling may work out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Reclaiming my time, if I may, Mr. President, during the \nextraordinary national emergency that followed the September 11 attacks \nupon our Nation, the Federal Government reached out to some of \nAmerica's major telephone carriers. We asked them to help intercept \ncommunications between sources in our country and terrorists located \noverseas.\n  A number of our phone companies responded in good faith and agreed to \nhelp. They did so, however, only after receiving written directives \nfrom our Government's senior national security and law enforcement \nofficials that their cooperation--the cooperation of the \ntelecommunications companies--was both lawful and constitutionally \nsound.\n  It does not seem fair, at least to me, that these companies now \nshould be made victims of their own good-faith cooperation and \nassistance in the ongoing fight against terrorism. That is why I \nsupport immunity for phone companies that can demonstrate in Federal \ncourt that their participation in the program was found to be lawful by \nthe Bush administration.\n\n[[Page S6420]]\n\n  With that said, however, I believe the issue of immunity has taken on \na significance that goes beyond its actual importance. This is not to \nsuggest that immunity is unimportant, but the more critical aspects of \nthis FISA bill seem to have been overlooked. In my view, those portions \nof the bill matter more--much more.\n  Rather than looking backward, at immunity, our real focus should be \non what this FISA bill does going forward. I believe this legislation \nstrikes the right balance in providing our intelligence networks with \nthe tools they need to protect our country without diminishing our \ncivil liberties. The administration has overreached on this front \nbefore. The FISA legislation before us, though, is a significant \nimprovement over current law and will help to ensure that neither this \nadministration nor the next administration will overreach again.\n  Now, how does it do that? First of all, this compromise bill makes it \ncrystal clear that FISA is the exclusive means to conduct surveillance, \nensuring that neither this President nor our next President can go \naround the law.\n  Second, the bill mandates reports by the inspectors general of the \nJustice Department, the Department of Defense, and our intelligence \nagencies that will provide the relevant congressional committees here \nand in the House with the information we need to conduct needed \noversight.\n  Third, the compromise bill--this compromise bill--establishes a \nshorter sunset period of 4\\1/2\\ years instead of what had been proposed \nearlier, 6 years. In addition, this compromise bill--for the first \ntime--requires FISA Court warrants for surveillance of Americans \noverseas.\n  I applaud both Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond, as well as my \nfriend, Congressman Steny Hoyer of Maryland, for their collective work \nin negotiating this compromise. They know, as I do, that this \ncompromise is not ideal. It is not perfect. But, in my view, it is the \nbest bill we can agree on at this time. It represents the best chance \nwe have today to protect both our national security and our civil \nliberties.\n  For all these reasons, I am supporting this legislation. I hope my \ncolleagues--Democratic and Republican--will join me in supporting the \nefforts of those who have crafted it.\n  Mr. President, if I could, I wish to end today with a pledge: Should \nthis bill pass and be signed into law--and I hope it will--I will work \nwith my colleagues in the next Congress and with the next President and \nhis administration to make additional improvements that our country and \nour citizens may need and deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think under the order there is time for \nme to speak at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes remaining.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think the Senate should support an 18-\nmonth extension of current Medicare law with the inclusion of a 1.1-\npercent increase in physician reimbursements. We should also make an \neffort to identify long-term improvements that will strengthen a system \nthat is badly in need of repair.\n  New legislation is important and urgent because of the expiration on \nJune 30, 2008, of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act. This \nextension, which was signed on December 29, 2007, delayed cuts to \npayments under the physician fee schedule from taking effect until July \n1, 2008.\n  Unfortunately, despite the knowledge that bipartisan negotiations \nwere ongoing and could have achieved passage in time to prevent these \ncuts, the majority leadership chose to force a vote on H.R. 6331, a \nbill which the administration had promised to veto. My vote against the \nimmediate passage of H.R. 6331 was a vote to protect the beneficiaries \nof Medicare and ensure their access to affordable and high-quality \nhealth care in the future. The fact is that providing health care to \nthe constituents we represent must remain one of our top priorities. It \nis a priority that should transcend party politics.\n  In its current form, H.R. 6331 includes over $17 billion in new \nspending that comes at the expense of some of Medicare's more \nvulnerable participants, and it restricts seniors' private coverage \nthrough cuts to Medicare Advantage plans. Medicare Advantage is an \nimportant and widely used program that offers seniors quality health \ncare at a low cost. This bill would result in a $13.6 billion cut from \nMedicare Advantage over the next 5 years and a $50 billion cut within \n10 years. Specifically, over 2 million seniors would lose access to \ntheir private fee-for-service plans, reducing benefits to a one-size-\nfits-all plan and reversing what the program was intended to do in the \nfirst place.\n  This issue is particularly relevant in my State. Seventy-nine percent \nof the people in my State who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans \nare also enrolled in private fee-for-service plans. I cannot in good \nconscience vote for a bill that would put their access to health care \nin jeopardy.\n  The Senate should work to develop a bill that will accurately reflect \nthe cost of providing quality care. If we don't, we risk a disruption \nin physician services to those who need care the most and we risk \nincreasing the cost of health care. We must mitigate the negative \nimpact of expiring provisions on providers and benefits.\n  The first step is to extend the current Medicare law until a \ncompromise can be reached. We all understand that temporary fixes can \nonly carry us so far. We need a long-term solution that fixes the \nsustainable growth rate to control costs, a long-term solution that \nrecognizes the importance of increasing Medicare reimbursements, and a \nlong-term solution based on bipartisan compromise. Anything less is not \nsustainable.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3118\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 776, S. 3118, a \nbill to preserve Medicare beneficiary access to care. I further ask \nunanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nfirst indicate to my friend, the Senator from Mississippi, that, in \nfact, we have a bill in front of us that had 355 votes--a huge \nbipartisan majority--that addresses strengthening Medicare for our \nseniors. We are only 1 vote--1 Republican vote--shy of passing it here \nin the Senate.\n  My colleague also raises the concern about cutting Medicare \nAdvantage. There are no Medicare Advantage cuts in the rates in this \nbill at all. There is a small change that doesn't even start until \n2011.\n  So as a result of the fact that we have in front of us a bill to \nimmediately address the concerns about access that my colleague has \nraised, I would object to his unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the Senator from \nMichigan has objected to the unanimous consent request. I certainly \nhope, though, that we can have a conversation about this issue and move \neventually to the consideration of S. 3118 as Senator Cochran \nsuggested.\n  The American Medical Association has requested an 18-month fix--an \n18-month extension--to give the medical community and Congress time to \nenact a permanent fix to the sustainable growth rate formula. This \nlegislation--the Grassley bill--would provide for this 18-month \nextension. It would also provide an 18-month extension with a one-half \npercent increase in 2008 and a 1.1-percent increase in 2009 in \nphysician reimbursement. This, I might add, is identical to the \nprovision in the Stabenow bill, S. 2785, the Save Medicare Act, which \nwas, in fact, a bipartisan bill and a bill I was happy to cosponsor.\n  The bill Senator Cochran just asked for unanimous consent to consider \nalso increases Medicare payments for ground ambulance services, it \nextends the authorization for the Medicare\n\n[[Page S6421]]\n\nRural Hospital Flexibility Program grants, and it provides important \nprovisions for community hospitals and for rural home health care.\n  The bill does make certain noncontroversial changes to the Medicare \nAdvantage Program. It also extends critical programs involving \nMedicare, and it eliminates the double IME windfall to Medicare \nAdvantage Programs. But it doesn't contain the controversial provider \noffsets that the legislation which was offered by the majority leader \nwould have done and which the President promised to veto.\n  The legislation Senator Cochran just asked unanimous consent to \nconsider could be passed tonight, sent to the President for his \nsignature tomorrow, and the Members of the majority party in this \nCongress could claim a victory, and a bipartisan victory at that.\n  I believe it is important for people to understand the history of \nthis legislation.\n  The Senate and House have been legislating to prevent these provider \ncuts from going into effect since the year 2002. For the past 6 years, \nas a Member of the House of Representatives, I have voted numerous \ntimes to prevent these physician cuts from going into effect, and each \ntime, these cuts have been prevented. That has been done on a \nnonpartisan, bipartisan basis without political wrangling.\n  Indeed, this year, just a few days ago, before the Fourth of July \nrecess, Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley were on the verge \nof presenting a bipartisan package which would have prevented these \ncuts from going into effect and prevented this entire controversy. They \nwere moments away before the rug was pulled out from under them by the \nleadership in this body.\n  Why is it different this year? Why have we been able to do this on a \nnonpartisan basis, prevent these cuts from going into effect to the \nproviders, to the physicians, and the harm that would ensue to the \nMedicare recipients in the past? Why is it different this year? It is \nclear to me that members of the Democratic leadership in this body and \nin the other body have decided to turn this so-called ``doc fix'' into \na political issue.\n  I was struck by the exchange between the minority and the majority \nleader on the night of June 26 when Senator McConnell requested of the \nmajority leader, after the cloture had not been invoked, that we have a \nsimple 30-day extension in order to continue to work on this issue. In \nobjecting to that unanimous consent request for a simple 30-day \nextension so we could continue to work on this, it became obvious to me \nwhat a political issue this is becoming. The majority leader, in \nobjecting, mentioned elections this year for three House seats in which \nthe Democrats won. He went on to say that this time next year, there \nwould be 59 Democrats in the Senate at least. He mentioned the \nPresident's approval rating--and this is all in the Congressional \nRecord, page S6233 of the Congressional Record, if Members would like \nto follow along--he mentioned the President's approval rating. He \nmentioned numbers of people in the Senate who are up for reelection \nthis year, and he even mentioned polling before suggesting that his \nRepublican friends did not truly want to prevent these cuts from taking \neffect.\n  There is not a single Member of the Senate who wants these cuts to \ntake effect. There is not a single Member of the House of \nRepresentatives who wants these cuts to take effect. But the majority \nleader said that night: The only way out of this is to accept this \nlegislation; it is this legislation or nothing, in effect. I will say \nthis much for the distinguished Democratic leader of the Senate: He was \nopen and frank about what is really at issue here. This is very much \nabout this year's elections and less about preventing the cuts to \ndoctors.\n  Now, what are we wrangling about here? We are wrangling about the \noffsets to prevent the cuts from going into effect, particularly what \nit would have done to Medicare Advantage, a program that some 22,000 \nMississippians depend upon and a program I would like to protect for \nthem.\n  Now, we have a disagreement. The Senator from Michigan sees this \ndifferently than I do. There are people who would tell you that the \nbill offered to us that night would have gutted the Medicare Advantage \nProgram. Medicare Advantage offers seniors a choice between regular \nMedicare and traditional insurance in the form of Medicare Advantage. \nThese insurers offer the same services as traditional Medicare, but in \naddition, they offer options Medicare does not. In Mississippi, this \nmeans seniors may choose to have increased coverage of things such as \ndiabetes management, increased cancer screening, or lower cost-sharing \nin the form of lower premiums and copays.\n  Admittedly, Medicare Advantage is not a perfect program. I believe \nthere is a certain bipartisan consensus that we should take a look at \nthe plan's enrollment and billing practices. Physicians back home in my \nState of Mississippi tell me this, and I want to work with them. The \namount of payments to these plans is also an issue that needs to be \nlooked at. But the Medicare bill that the majority leader would have \nforced upon us on that Thursday night of June 26, 2008, would have \nincluded provisions that did not enjoy bipartisan support. If that bill \nhad passed, American seniors and Mississippi seniors would have lost \ntheir choices. They would have been told: Take it or leave it.\n\n  Fewer choices and less competition are not good for America's seniors \nand certainly not good for our health care system. If Medicare \nAdvantage needs adjusting, we should consider stand-alone Medicare \nAdvantage legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Mississippi must know \nthat his time has expired.\n  Mr. WICKER. I wonder if I may have an additional 2 minutes, Mr. \nPresident. I don't see anyone here at this moment. I wonder if I may \nhave an additional 2 minutes to wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank the Chair.\n  There is overwhelming support for fixing the sustainable growth rate. \nDoctors deserve better than to be involuntarily paired with a poison \npill provision that cannot pass this Congress on its own merits. I \nrepeat, there is not a single Member of this Senate who wants these \ncuts to go into effect.\n  The issue of Medicare Advantage is so important because of the \ncompetition. If we are ever going to solve the future of funding on the \nissue of Medicare as a whole, if we are going to have that goal that \nthe AMA wants of 18 months to look at a permanent fix to this issue, if \nwe are going to prevent the train wreck that looms a few short years \nfrom now on the funding of Medicare as a whole, then we are going to \nhave to inject competition. But let's not use it as a political \nfootball. Let's not adopt offsets on which there have been no hearings. \nLet's not change basic Medicare policy in the form of a pay-for for a \ntemporary fix.\n  What we are looking at is two vastly different approaches to health \ncare reform: the traditional Medicare, one size fits all, take it or \nleave it, that would lead us to a Canadian-style, single-payer type \nplan for the entire United States of America, or injecting this little \nbit of competition to see if we can help control the cost of the \nMedicare Program. That is what we are making this stand about, and that \nis why I hope eventually we will adopt the unanimous consent request \nSenator Cochran has made and move to a bipartisan plan we can all \nsupport and prevent these doctor cuts from going into effect.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Chair for indulging me on the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe remarks of Senator Cornyn, who I understand will be speaking after \nmyself, Senator Levin be recognized as under the previous order, and \nSenator Chambliss be recognized to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it is important to understand what the \nchoices in front of us are. Always we have a choice in terms of \npriorities, of how to proceed. As the person who has coauthored the \nbill in the last several sessions that would change completely the way \nwe provide physician payments, I certainly support long-term\n\n[[Page S6422]]\n\nsolutions, something called the SGR, sustainable growth rate. I believe \nthe way it is set up, it is wrong, and we need to fundamentally change \nand stop this process of trying to make sure we don't see cuts happen \nin Medicare every single year. I certainly agree with that position.\n  What we have in front of us is a choice--a choice between a bill that \nhas 355 votes in the House on a bipartisan basis--there are not a whole \nlot of times we see 355 people coming together on an issue such as this \nin the House, and 59 Members of the Senate. We had a majority. We had \n59 votes. We have seen an effort to continue to filibuster the process \nfrom moving forward, and we are tomorrow going to see whether we will \nhave one more additional Republican who stands with us, stands with the \nAARP, the American Medical Association, who stands with, most \nimportantly, our seniors, who stands with the disability community, who \nstands with those who are concerned about access to Medicare in this \ncountry. We only need one vote. That is where we are right now.\n  I find it interesting, when we look at the motion that was made \nbefore about the bill my Republican colleagues wish to bring to the \nfloor, in that bill, we see cuts in oxygen services, in speciality \nwheelchairs, large cuts in graduate medical education in order to pay \nfor the bill. That is one choice. Or we have the choice in front of us \nthat passed with 355 votes in the House and has 59 votes right now in \nthe Senate which would take some smaller cuts out of graduate medical \neducation and would do something very small and in the future to \nMedicare Advantage.\n  What is Medicare Advantage? In my mind, Medicare Advantage is part of \nthe effort to privatize Medicare. We all remember former Speaker Newt \nGingrich saying we cannot directly stop Medicare, so we are going to \nmake sure it withers on the vine. Part of that withering has been to \ndivert more and more dollars away from physicians and away from \ncommunity care into private for-profit companies, private fee-for-\nservice companies.\n  The argument was in the beginning that competition from the private \nsector, more choice will bring down costs and that they would be able \nto take 97 percent of the normal Medicare rate because it would cost \nless to bring down prices because of competition.\n  What has happened? What have we heard from the Congressional Budget \nOffice? What have we heard from those who only analyze this issue? In \nfact, the exact opposite is happening. More and more rate increases \nhave occurred. We now have a group that was getting 97 percent of the \nfull rates, supposedly lowering costs, now on average getting 113 \npercent, and the Congressional Budget Office told us if we cap the rate \nto these private businesses at 150 percent of regular Medicare, we \nwould still save money.\n  Because of the strong feeling of the Republicans and the President \nindicating he wants to protect them at all costs, in this particular \nbill we are not addressing the rates. There is no inability for people \nto get a choice through private care. There is none of that. There is \nno rate reduction, even though, in my mind, we ought to be doing that.\n  All that is done in this bill is a process that does not even take \neffect until 2011--not next year, not the year after, but the year \nafter that--which is a process called deeming. I will not go into all \nof it now except to say it addresses how the private companies interact \nwith those that are not part of their group or part of their network. \nThat is all this addresses in Medicare Advantage. One would think the \nsky is falling based on what we have heard.\n  The reality is, AARP--a pretty good barometer of what seniors are \nthinking in this country--and a wide variety of organizations have come \ntogether very strongly in support of the bill in front of us that only \nneeds one vote. Why? Because that is the bill that will strengthen \nMedicare for the future.\n  We need to act now. We are past time to act on this issue because, in \nfact, there are consequences already, even though the physician cut has \nnot taken effect.\n  I received a letter this week and I wish to read it. I received a \nletter recently from a constituent named Kay about her father. Her \nfather needs his physical therapy as part of his treatment for \nParkinson's. I know what that is like. My grandmother died of \nParkinson's. It is a very tough disease. He lives at home confined to a \nwheelchair most of the time due to Parkinson's. Despite rising gas \nprices, Kay and her sister drive her father three times a week--about \n80 miles round trip--for his therapy. But last week, they were informed \nthat Medicare would not pay for his therapy because the Medicare \nexemption process for physical therapy had expired.\n\n  We only need one more vote. If we had one more vote, Kay would not be \nworried about whether her father with Parkinson's can get the physical \ntherapy he needs.\n  Kay wrote me:\n\n       I will go down swinging to help my dad. Can you go back in \n     and fight for us? We need these services extended. Please \n     fight for us . . . go back onto the floor and reopen this.\n\n  And vote again.\n  Our leader, I am proud to say, understands all of the stories, not \nonly of Kay but of all the seniors across the country who are so \ndesperately worried about what is going to happen with Medicare. Our \nleader has come to the floor and said we are going to vote ``yes'' \nagain. We are only one vote short, only one vote.\n  The practical reality is, in my home State alone, it affects 1.4 \nmillion seniors and people with disabilities and over 90,000 veterans \nwho are TRICARE beneficiaries, people who have served in our military. \nMilitary health care, TRICARE, is tied to Medicare. So if the Medicare \ncuts take effect, our veterans also will be affected and there will be \na cut.\n  This is serious. We are past time, at this point, to be debating this \nissue. We need to vote, we need to pass it, and we need to send it to \nthe President.\n  There are so many positive provisions in this bill for the future. It \naddresses assets for low-income seniors; preventive services; rural \nservices which are so important to so many parts of Michigan; also the \neffort to move ahead and modernize the system with e-prescribing, so we \ncan actually read the physician's handwriting, so we can actually have \nan electronic system that speaks to the future; and also telehealth \nwhich in so many parts of our country--again, Michigan is a real \nexample of focusing on telehealth and the way to expand services to \nrural communities; expanding mental health services. There are so many \nimportant pieces to this bill.\n  Fundamentally, the difference between what was suggested by my \nRepublican friend from Mississippi and from what is in front of us is \nwhether we are going to have any kind of accountability at all for this \neffort that has begun to privatize Medicare.\n  We know from the testimony we received from the Congressional Budget \nOffice that for 85 percent of the seniors in traditional Medicare, they \nactually pay more in premiums because of the overpayments on Medicare \nAdvantage. Again, that is not even in this bill. That is not even in \nthis bill. We still need to address that point. There is a small change \nthat does not take effect until 2011, but because of that, colleagues \non the other side of the aisle are willing to let this whole bill go \ndown and a dramatic cut in physicians' services take effect. They are \nwilling to let us lose the help for rural America, the effort to \nmodernize Medicare with electronic e-prescribing, with telehealth, to \nfocus on seniors who need mental health services. They are willing to \nlet the whole thing go down and, in fact, have proposed, as I said \nearlier, an alternative plan, that rather than touch the for-profit \nfolks in the health care system right now that are, in my mind, too \nmany times undermining what is happening in traditional Medicare--not \nalways; there are some positive aspects, but too many times. Instead of \nthat, they bring forward an alternative that focuses on oxygen services \nand specialty wheelchairs and other areas in which to receive their \ncuts.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes, as \nmy colleague from Mississippi did prior to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair.\n  I feel so strongly about this, Mr. President. We spent a lot of time \nand effort and a lot of goodwill. A lot of people have worked together \non both sides of the aisle, with good decisions\n\n[[Page S6423]]\n\nand good ideas that have come together on how to strengthen Medicare \nthrough this bill. It is obviously something that has wide bipartisan \nsupport because, again, we are talking about a huge overwhelming vote \nin the House of Representatives--355 people. Now we have the \nopportunity in front of us tomorrow, with all of our physician \ncommunity, health care providers, senior organizations, AARP, \ndisability groups, those who serve the Parkinson's patients and other \npatients who are suffering from particular diseases, consumer groups \nall across America coming together and saying this makes sense.\n  We need to make sure Medicare is available for our seniors. These are \nDraconian cuts and we want to stop them and we are willing to do it in \na very balanced way. I thank our chairman of the Finance Committee for \nhis leadership on something that is reasonable and balanced. We know \nhim to be a reasonable person who does things in a balanced way. This \ndoesn't gut Medicare or Medicare Advantage. It doesn't even touch the \nrates. It doesn't touch the companies, other than to address one part \nof the way they deal with those who are out of State or out of service \nthrough the process called ``deeming,'' that doesn't take effect until \n2011.\n  Frankly, if that is the only part people disagree with, these cuts \nare now. These physical therapy cuts started last week. I would urge my \ncolleagues, step up and be the one vote. We have until 2011 to change \nthat part of the bill they do not like. But the therapy cuts started \nlast week, and the physician cuts are going to start in a couple of \nweeks. That is the sense of urgency we should feel if we are concerned \nabout the seniors in this country--about Medicare beneficiaries. Now is \nthe time. It is real simple. It is real simple.\n  Tomorrow afternoon we will have the opportunity to vote yes on \nsomething overwhelmingly supported by the people of this country, and I \nurge my colleagues to step up. We only need, Mr. President, one more \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, Medicare provides important health care \nbenefits for our Nation's seniors. Since 1965, the Federal Government \nhas promised that those over the age of 65 years, or those afflicted \nwith certain disabilities, will have access to health care. \nUnfortunately, Congress has had a checkered history of keeping that \npromise.\n  The vote we had 2 weeks ago, to which the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan just alluded, and one we will apparently have tomorrow \nafternoon, should be an embarrassment to Congress but not for the \nreasons that she and others have suggested. We should be looking to \nsolve the looming problems with Medicare permanently, not just with \ntemporary patches or fixes. We need a permanent solution. We should \nkeep our promise to seniors that they can rely on Medicare and provide \nfair compensation for the physicians to make sure our seniors will \nactually have access to that coverage.\n  I have repeatedly heard from seniors in Texas who depend on Medicare \nthat they find it hard to even find a physician who will accept below-\nmarket Medicare reimbursement rates. Even if we pass an 18-month \nextension now, I am not optimistic Congress will seriously consider \npermanent reform before the next round of scheduled cuts. And I shudder \nto think whether we can prevent the 20-percent cut that will occur 18 \nmonths from now.\n  This, of course, should not be about partisan politics, which it has \nbecome, because this is about people's lives. The Medicare Program, \nsimply put, is in a nosedive headed for bankruptcy. As this chart \ndemonstrates, without a long-term solution, the future is bleak indeed \nfor Medicare providers.\n  This chart depicts how the practice costs of physicians continue to \ngo up year after year. Yet because of a law Congress passed in 1997, \nMedicare reimbursement rates continue to be projecting downward. You \ncan see the gap here. No wonder many physicians are no longer able to \naccept Medicare patients.\n  In Texas recently, a survey of physicians indicated that only 58.1 \npercent of physicians currently accept new Medicare patients because \nreimbursement rates are so low that they are below market and \nphysicians cannot afford to accept those patients and those low \nMedicare reimbursement rates.\n  Congress needs to step up with a permanent solution, not the kind of \nshameful temporary patches and fixes that require physicians and other \nhealth care providers to come hat in hand to Congress every 6 months or \n12 months or 18 months and that leave Medicare beneficiaries in doubt--\nour seniors--about whether, in fact, Congress will do its duty.\n  No one gets to conduct their business this way, other than the \nCongress. If you were in the private sector, a small or large business, \nyou would be out of business or behind bars if you tried to operate \nyour business the same way Congress has dealt with Medicare \nreimbursement rates.\n  The Medicare trustees expect future costs to increase at a faster \npace than both workers' earnings and the economy overall. As a matter \nof fact, the Medicare Hospital Insurance Fund will be exhausted by \n2019, and Part B premiums will have to increase rapidly to match \nexpected expenditure growth. The Medicare trustees have warned Congress \nmore than once to act, cautioning that the sooner the solutions are \nenacted, the more flexible and gradual they can be.\n  Mr. President, Medicare is a ticking time bomb. Today, Congress \nshould be all about debating and preserving Medicare. Instead, we have \nbeen presented a bill that turns a blind eye to this smoldering powder \nkeg of long-term Medicare problems and the terribly flawed physician \npayment system. Rather than real reform, the majority party--the \nDemocratically controlled Senate--has presented us with a bill that \nprolongs damaging and rigid price controls, sets up increased premiums \nand increased taxes, abandons some private sector options, and keeps \nMedicare on the path toward more health care rationing.\n  Why would anyone be proud of this? The distinguished Senator from \nMichigan was saying that all they needed is one more vote to pass this \npartisan bill. Why would anyone be proud of this temporary fix, these \nprice controls, along with submarket reimbursement rates, so that while \nwe make the promise of Medicare coverage, the actuality of access is \ndiminishing with each day?\n  This partisan bill bypassed not only the minority in the Senate, it \nbypassed the Senate Finance Committee as well. Now we are told by the \nmajority leader that he will refuse the opportunity to offer any \namendments when the bill comes to the floor. The Democratic-controlled \nmajority has not held one hearing or introduced one piece of \nlegislation in the last 6 months that begins to address the long-term \nproblems.\n  Mr. President, I intend to offer a bill that will begin the process \nof reform and permanently eliminate the periodic cuts that are almost \nnever allowed to go into effect. I think seniors and physicians and the \nAmerican people deserve explanations and answers, and ultimately \nsolutions, rather than more posturing and just kicking the can down the \nroad.\n\n  It is worth taking a few minutes to recall how we got here in the \nfirst place.\n  In 1997, Congress was struggling with rising costs under Medicare and \npassed the Balanced Budget Act, which established something called the \nsustainable growth rate, or a formula which was intended to serve as a \nrestraint on Medicare spending. Thus, the Federal Government instituted \narbitrary price controls in an effort to reduce Medicare spending. What \nwas the result? Well, the SGR--the sustainable growth rate--formula and \narbitrary price controls have reduced access to quality care for \nbeneficiaries.\n  While the first 2 years after implementation the SGR resulted in \npositive updates for physician payments, decreases in payments have \nbeen required every year since 2002. But what has been the experience \nof Congress? This chart indicates that except for the first year, in \n2002, Congress has acted to reverse the cuts that have come with a \ntemporary patch, and temporary fix after temporary fix. In fact, I \nthink one could be forgiven for wondering whether Congress ever \nintended these cuts to take effect in the first place.\n  Thank goodness we haven't because continuing to cut into the muscle \nand\n\n[[Page S6424]]\n\nthen into the bone of the Medicare system means that the promise of \nMedicare coverage is a hollow one indeed for patients, for seniors, who \nare increasingly having a very difficult time finding physicians who \ncan accept Medicare rates because they are so low.\n  As you can see from this chart, not only has Congress, except for \n2002, not allowed these cuts to go into effect based on temporary \npatches, it has actually provided a very modest update in most years, \nexcept for 2007, when it just got back to zero. But the fact is, \nCongress never really intended or was never prepared to allow these \ncuts to go into effect. Most of the time, if you look for how Congress \nhas attempted to ``pay for'' or find revenue to offset this reversal of \nthese cuts, all it amounts to is budgetary gimmicks and games.\n  As the American Medical Association has noted, ``every temporary \nintervention has increased the cost of a permanent solution.'' Thus, \nseniors and physicians find themselves coming back to Congress every 6 \nmonths or every 18 months hat in hand seeking to prevent these cuts \nwith the kind of histrionics that we see on the Senate floor today and \nthat we saw by the majority leader just 2 weeks ago after the failed \ncloture vote--not a serious discussion of public policy but, rather, a \npolitical action designed to gain partisan advantage.\n  At this point, to repeal the SGR formula created by Congress will \ncost an estimated $250 billion or more. That is a big number, and a \nmajor reason Congress has been unable to pass, or more likely unwilling \nto even debate, a long-term solution. While many of my colleagues have \nspoken at great length about their grandiose plans to reform the \nentirety of America's health care system, they seem to whistle past the \nMedicare graveyard.\n  We can and we must do better. What good is Medicare if there is no \naccess to coverage? Even with reversing the Draconian cuts in \nreimbursement, as I said, many doctors refuse to even see patients with \nMedicare because the payments are so low. Yet Congress is seen patting \nitself on the back saying: Didn't we do a good job? Only to have more \nand more seniors unable to find doctors willing to accept Medicare \npayments.\n  Physician reimbursement cuts have been looming over the heads of \nseniors and physicians for years. Yet Congress repeatedly puts off \nuntil tomorrow what desperately needs to be done today.\n  What does the bill before use to pay for reversing these cuts for 18 \nmonths? Well, it undermines the one private sector alternative to \ntraditional Medicare--Medicare Advantage--currently subscribed to by \nabout 450,000 Texas seniors, leading to less choices, fewer services, \nand, yes, more government control.\n  We have a choice. Do we pass the hot potato once again, praying that \nwe are not the ones who get burned, or do we stand up, do the \nresponsible thing, and actually take decisive action by reforming the \nbroken SGR formula for Medicare reimbursement?\n  While some in Congress seem determined to have the Government control \nall health care decisions, competition in the private sector holds real \npromise for the future of health care, and we do not have to look very \nfar to find the proof. All we have to do is look at Medicare Part D, \nthe prescription drug program that we passed a few short years ago.\n  The Congressional Budget Office recently released a report showing \nhow effective Part D has been in lowering drug prices for seniors. This \nyear, Part D expenses will be almost half that of the original \nprojections 2 years ago. Competition by private companies that provide \nbenefits for seniors under Medicare Part D has actually created about \n$40 billion in savings this year. What's more, Part D will be returning \nroughly $4 billion this year in unused funds due to cheaper than \nexpected drug purchases.\n  Still, with the resounding success of Medicare Part D and the \ncompetition we should look to as a model, not one to be discarded or \ngutted or cannibalized in an effort to pay for this temporary patch, \nmany of my colleagues want to give up on the private sector \nalternatives to traditional Medicare. Competition created by programs \nsuch as Medicare Advantage has the potential to save more money in the \nlong run and to provide more choices and better quality services to \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  I would be the first one to say that Medicare Advantage is far from \nperfect. As a matter of fact, I have heard from many of my constituent \nphysicians who have complaints about the way Medicare Advantage is run. \nBut it would be a terrible mistake to gut it. We ought to fix it, not \ngut it.\n  Rather than abandoning the principles of the benefits of competition \nin health care, we should work to make it better. With the results of \nMedicare Part D as an example, we should work to increase the role of \nnongovernment entities in lowering costs and increasing access and \naffordability of health care.\n  These are only a few of the reasons why, over 3 months ago, in \nanticipation of the looming physician payment cuts set for July 1, I \nintroduced legislation that solves this problem permanently. This \nlegislation I called Ensuring the Future Physician Workforce Act of \n2008. It provides positive reimbursement updates for providers, it \neliminates the ineffectual expenditure cap, and increases incentives \nfor physician data reporting. At the same time, this bill facilitates \nadoption of health information technology by addressing costs and \nlegislative barriers; it educates and empowers physicians and \nbeneficiaries of Medicare spending and benefits usage, and studies ways \nto realign the way that Medicare pays for health care.\n  My bill does not mandate whether physician payments should be based \non utilization, performance, care coordination or any other \nmethodology, but it does start to lay down a new path toward reform, \ninnovation, and restoration of the eroded physician-patient \nrelationship. It does say the providers and beneficiaries should not be \nthe ones to be punished by Congress's failure to act. We have to decide \nnow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we have to decide now whether Medicare is \nworth protecting or whether political gamesmanship and partisan \npolitics are going to take over. While it is costly to fix Medicare and \nthe SGR, stalling will be far more expensive. So while some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle may be content with another \nshortsighted, short-term fix, I suggest we debate and pass a bipartisan \nsolution that will keep the promise of Medicare for seniors but also \nmake sure there will be access to that coverage by providing fair \ncompensation for physicians. Why should we, and why should they, settle \nfor less?\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, title II of the bill before us, which \namends the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act, would authorize \nretroactive immunity for telecommunications companies that collected \nintelligence information inside the United States in defiance of the \nclear requirements of the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act as it \nwas then on the books.\n  The argument has been made that we must provide such immunity because \nthese telecommunications companies responded to requests from the \nGovernment in a time of great uncertainty, after the events of \nSeptember 11, 2001. I have some sympathy for their situation, but I \nalso have sympathy for innocent Americans who may have had their \nprivacy rights violated as a result of illegal actions taken by \ntelecommunications companies at the behest of an administration that \nhas all too frequently tried to place itself above the law.\n  The bill before us makes no effort to reconcile these competing \ninterests. Instead, it requires the dismissal of all civil suits \nagainst telecommunications companies that may have illegally disclosed \nconfidential communications of their customers at the behest of U.S. \nGovernment officials. Dismissal would also be required even if the \ndisclosure violated the constitutional rights of innocent U.S. citizens \nwhose confidential communications were illegally disclosed.\n  The so-called judicial review authorized in this bill is totally \nunsatisfactory. Under title II of the bill, the FISA Court would be \npermitted to review these cases only to determine\n\n[[Page S6425]]\n\nwhether the Attorney General or the head of an element of the \nintelligence community told telecommunications companies that the \nGovernment request had been authorized by the President and \n``determined to be lawful,''--presumably determined by anybody--even if \nnobody could reasonably have believed that the request actually was \nlawful. A judicial review that is limited to determining whether the \nadministration claimed that its actions were legal is a sham review \nthat provides no justice at all. Of course the administration claimed \nits actions were legal. Indeed, the Intelligence Committee report on \nthis bill specifically states that the administration's letters \nrequesting assistance from telecommunications companies made the claims \nthat they were legal.\n  I do not believe this congressional grant of retroactive immunity is \nfair. I do not believe it is wise. And I do not believe it is \nnecessary.\n  Retroactive immunity is not fair because it leaves innocent American \ncitizens who may have been harmed by the unlawful or unconstitutional \nconduct of telecommunications companies at the behest of the \nadministration without any legal remedy. It is hard to understand how \nthe Attorney General can claim, as he does in a letter dated July 7, \n2008, that this is a ``fair and just result.''\n  Those who have been harmed are not likely to have any recourse \nagainst the Government officials who asked telecommunications companies \nto disclose the private information of their customers because the \nGovernment officials enjoy qualified immunity for actions taken in \ntheir official capacity. These officials do not even have the burden of \ndemonstrating that their actions were legal and constitutional to be \nimmune from suit.\n  Nor is retroactive immunity wise, because it sets a dangerous \nprecedent of retroactively eliminating rights of U.S. citizens and \nprecludes any judicial review of their claim. If we act here to \nimmunize private parties who cooperated with executive branch officials \nin a program that appears to have been illegal on its face, our laws \nand their prohibitions will be less of a deterrent to illegal \nactivities in the future. This would be a terrible precedent if a \nfuture administration is as inclined as the current one to place itself \nabove the law.\n  Finally, retroactive immunity is not necessary for the intelligence \ncommunity to collect intelligence against terrorists using newly \navailable technology. They have the right to use newly available \ntechnology--``they'' being the intelligence community--under title I of \nthis bill. Title I provides that the Attorney General and the Director \nof National Intelligence direct telecommunications companies to assist \nin collection programs, and these directives are enforceable by court \norder as has been the case since the Protect America Act was adopted \nlast August.\n  We are collecting needed intelligence information today pursuant to \nthat act, without any retroactive immunity for telecommunications \ncompanies, and there is no reason why we cannot continue to do so in \nthe future under title I of the bill without the retroactive immunity \nprovided in title II.\n  The administration argues that if we do not provide retroactive \nimmunity to telecommunications providers, ``companies in the future may \nbe less willing to assist the Government.''\n  But let's be clear what we are talking about here. Telecommunications \ncompanies have prospective immunity if they assist the Government in a \nmanner that is authorized by this bill. Moreover, they can be compelled \nto do so under the bill, as has also been the case since the enactment \nof the Protect America Act. What companies might be less willing to do \nis to assist the Government in intelligence gathering efforts that are \nillegal. And what is wrong with that? Do we want to encourage companies \nto assist a future administration in unlawful intelligence-gathering \nefforts?\n  Nor is retroactive immunity necessary to protect telecommunications \ncompanies that acted in good-faith reliance on representations from \nadministration officials. There are other ways in which we can \nrecognize their equity without insulating misconduct from judicial \nreview and without denying any relief to innocent U.S. citizens who may \nhave been harmed.\n  For example, we can safeguard these interests by substituting the \nUnited States as the defendant in cases against telecommunications \ncompanies, or by requiring that the United States indemnify \ntelecommunications companies for any damages in such cases. In either \ncase, we could cap damages to make sure that the taxpayers are not \nrequired to pay an unreasonable burden as a result of unlawful \ndecisions by the administration. We could also provide a measure of \nprotection to American citizens whose rights have been violated by \nlimiting the immunity provided to those cases where the \ntelecommunications companies demonstrate that they had a reasonable \nbasis for a good-faith belief that the assistance they were providing \nwas lawful, a requirement that is notably absent from the bill before \nus.\n  The Bingaman amendment is a very modest proposal which does not \ndecide the retroactive immunity question or remove the retroactive \nimmunity provision from the bill. It leaves the retroactive immunity \nprovision in the bill but postpones the effective date of that immunity \nuntil 90 days after Congress receives the comprehensive inspector \ngeneral report required by the bill.\n  This amendment, the Bingaman amendment, does not have any effect at \nall on title I of the bill, which allows the intelligence community to \ncollect information using newly available technology. The Bingaman \namendment allows title I to go into law without change and without \ndelay. The inspector general report may give us important information \nthat helps us understand the extent to which the administration's \nactions were illegal or unconstitutional, and the extent to which \ninnocent U.S. citizens may have been damaged by these actions. The \ndelayed effective date in the Bingaman amendment would give us the \nopportunity to consider this information, not just assurances of \nadministration officials, before retroactive immunity goes into effect \nand cases are dismissed. That information required to be provided to us \nby the inspector general is surely relevant to this issue.\n  If we adopt the Bingaman amendment, we will have highly relevant \ninformation about the extent to which illegal or unconstitutional \nactions were taken against innocent American citizens and the extent to \nwhich those citizens were harmed by those actions. The Bingaman \namendment gives us the opportunity to take this additional information \ninto account before retroactive immunity takes effect, while at the \nsame time preventing any harm to telecommunications companies by \nstaying any litigation against them until the information becomes \navailable.\n  We can pass this bill and we can ensure that the intelligence \ncommunity continues to have the authority to collect information on \nsuspected terrorists without surrendering the rights of Americans whose \nprivacy may have been violated.\n  I support the Bingaman amendment as a way to introduce a bit of \nbalance into the process of protecting the privacy of innocent \nAmericans while recognizing some equity in the position of the \ntelecommunications companies.\n  I yield the floor and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss H.R. 6304, the \nFISA Amendments Act. I am disappointed that after so many months of \nnegotiations, after the Senate passed similar legislation in February, \nand after the House passed this bill by 293-129, the Senate is stalling \nenactment of necessary changes to FISA by debating amendments which \nwould gut this bill of a valuable provision liability relief for our \ntelecommunications carriers.\n  The three amendments we debate today would singularly undermine \nmonths of hard work by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the House \nto reach an agreement on this bill. In particular, Senators Dodd and \nFeingold have offered an amendment striking title II of the bill which \nprovides liability relief to those telecommunication carriers who \ncurrently face lawsuits for their alleged assistance to the Government \nafter September 11. Senator Specter has offered an amendment that would \nrequire the courts to determine the constitutional merits of the\n\n[[Page S6426]]\n\nPresident's terrorist surveillance program, TSP in cases against \nprivate parties. And, Senator Bingaman has offered an amendment which \nwould needlessly delay liability relief for a review of the President's \nTSP to be completed, which Members of this body have already done. I do \nnot support any of these amendments.\n  Over 40 lawsuits have been filed against our communications providers \nalleging statutory and constitutional violations, seeking billions of \ndollars in damages. These suits are not intended to bring justice to \nany individual; rather, they are a fishing expedition. The lawyers who \nbrought these cases hope to use our court system to discover some claim \nor discover some standing for their clients; yet none of the plaintiffs \nin any of these lawsuits have any evidence to illustrate that they were \nsubjects of the President's TSP or that they suffered any harm. As a \nresult, I wonder how a court could uphold that any of these individuals \neven have a claim to raise. The President has stated repeatedly that in \nthe wake of 9/11, the TSP intercepted communications of suspected \nterrorists, including those communicating with individuals inside the \nU.S. or whose communications pass through the U.S. To date, this \nprogram has been reviewed by numerous Inspectors General, the \nDepartment of Justice, our intelligence community and Congress. Do we \nneed to add the courts to the list? The Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court is already on that list.\n  As a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, I had access to \nthe classified documents, intelligence, and legal memorandum, and heard \ntestimony, related to the President's TSP program. After careful \nreview, as stated in the committee report accompanying the Senate's \nFISA legislation, the committee determined ``that electronic \ncommunication service providers acted on a good faith belief that the \nPresident's program, and their assistance, was lawful.'' The committee \nreviewed correspondence sent to the electronic communication service \nproviders stating that the activities requested were authorized by the \nPresident and determined by the Attorney General to be lawful. The \ncommittee concluded that granting civil liability relief to the \ntelecommunications providers was not only warranted, but required to \nmaintain the regular assistance our intelligence and law enforcement \nprofessionals seek from them and others in the private sector. It was \nclear in discussions within the committee that most of us were \nconcerned about the harm the Government could face if it cannot rely on \nthe private sector. Without this provision, the harm faced by the \nGovernment will become a reality.\n  I cannot understate the importance of this assistance, not only for \nintelligence purposes but for law enforcement too. The Director of \nNational Intelligence and the Attorney General stated, ``Extending \nliability protection to such companies is imperative; failure to do so \ncould limit future cooperation by such companies and put critical \nintelligence operations at risk. Moreover, litigation against companies \nbelieved to have assisted the Government risks the disclosure of highly \nclassified information regarding extremely sensitive intelligence \nsources and methods.'' There is too much at stake for us to deny those \nwho assist the Government the liability relief they need, and deserve, \nor to delay its implementation.\n  Senator Specter's amendment asks the courts to review and determine \nthe constitutionality of the President's TSP before dismissing any \nlawsuit against the telecommunication carriers. This amendment not only \nseverely undermines the findings of this body, but also calls into \nquestion the activities of the other political branch in our \nGovernment, the executive. The courts would be granted access to highly \nsensitive, executive branch intelligence activities, which they are not \nexperienced in, and be required to make a legal determination on the \nconstitutional authorities of the President. The courts usually avoid \nthese types of decisions, and rightfully so. Moreover, the courts \nshould not issue mere advisory opinions, yet this amendment requires \nthe court to determine the constitutionality of a Presidential program \nwhen the government is not a party to these actions. Even with the \npassage of this bill the government or a Government official can still \nbe sued for a TSP violation. If a plaintiff brought an action against \nthe Government, the courts could then determine the constitutionality \nof the program; however, Congress should not hold America's private \ncompanies hostage until the courts review what Congress and others \nalready have found. Further, regardless of the Government's program, \nour companies should not be held liable for assistance that they were \nassured was lawful. Let the Government carry the burden for its own \nactions.\n  Similarly, Senator Bingaman's amendment would stay all of the \nlawsuits brought against the communications carriers until the \ninspectors general conducted a review of the TSP. Various inspectors \ngeneral have reviewed already the President's program. The review \ncalled for by the FISA Amendments Act is nothing new. I see no reason \nto delay liability relief like this. The scope of the IGs' review \nincluded by this legislation is not intended to be a legal \ndetermination of the TSP. Instead, the FISA Amendments Act calls for \nthe IGs to review each respective agency's access to the legal reviews \nof the program and grants the IGs access to communications with the \nprivate sector related to the program. Any review conducted pursuant to \nthis legislation will have no impact on the lawsuits brought against \nprivate corporations. The only thing this amendment does is hold the \ncases up in court for over a year while the reviews are completed. This \nis purely political and Congress should not play games with our \nnational security, or even when U.S. companies and their customers' \nmoney are involved.\n  Finally, Senators Dodd and Feingold offer the same amendment that \nthey did in February, to completely strike Title II of the bill which \nprovides this liability relief. This same amendment failed to pass the \nSenate in February by 31-67. As I have stated, I support Title II, and \nbelieve the Senate has already shown its lack of support for this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I oppose all three amendments offered to the FISA \nAmendments Act and urge my colleagues to do the same. It is time for \nthe Senate to stop delaying enactment of a FISA bill and to reject \nthese amendments which would gut the bill of much needed relief for our \ntelecommunications providers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use leader time for my presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on the FISA bill, \nwhich represents a final result of negotiations among the White House \nand Democrats and Republicans in Congress.\n  I opposed the version originally passed by the Senate. Although \nimprovements have been made in the version now before this body, the \nlegislation continues to contain provisions that will lead to immunity \nto the telecommunications companies that cooperated with the Bush \nadministration's warrantless wiretapping program. For that reason, I \nhave no choice but to vote no.\n  Having said that, I am pleased that President Bush and the \ncongressional Republicans finally agreed to negotiate a better bill. \nFor months, the President insisted it was his way or the highway. The \nWhite House refused to come to the negotiating table, repeatedly \ndemanding that the House simply pass the Senate's bill. I commend our \nDemocratic colleagues in the House for standing up to insist on more \nprotections for the privacy of innocent Americans.\n  This debate has shown once again that protecting the American people \nis not a Democratic or Republican issue. Democrats want to provide our \nintelligence professionals all the tools they need to fight terrorism. \nWe must also protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans and protect \nagainst abuses of our Constitution.\n  We all know that in the darkest corners of the Earth lie evil people \nwho seek to harm our country and our people. We all agree on the need \nto monitor the communications of terrorists in order to protect the \nAmerican people. But despite what the President insists, America is \nstrengthened by our\n\n[[Page S6427]]\n\nreverence for our law and our Constitution.\n  I am grateful for the efforts of congressional leaders who have \nworked tirelessly, and at times it may have seemed endlessly, to craft \nthis compromise bill. Senators Feingold and Dodd deserve special \nrecognition for reminding us that our Constitution must always come \nfirst. I have to compliment Senator Rockefeller--a very difficult \nassignment he has, being the chairman of this most important committee, \nbut he does it with great dignity.\n  This version of this legislation is better than the bill the Senate \npassed in February and better than the flawed Protect America Act \nsigned by the President last summer.\n  This legislation now includes Senator Feinstein's amendment to \nreaffirm FISA as the exclusive means by which the executive branch may \ncollect surveillance. This provision is Congress's direct response to \nthe strained argument of President Bush's lawyers that Congress meant \nto repeal the very clear and specific requirements of FISA when \nCongress passed the authorization for the use of military force in \nAfghanistan. Congress flatly rejects that argument as having no basis \nin fact or in law.\n  This bill includes Senator Leahy's important amendment requiring a \ncomprehensive IG review of the President's program as well as greater \njudicial supervision.\n  This bill requires the U.S. Attorney General to develop guidelines to \nensure compliance with the fourth amendment and prevent reverse \ntargeting; that is, targeting someone abroad when the real purpose is \nto acquire the communications of a person here in the United States.\n  This bill provides for increased congressional oversight, requiring \nextensive reporting to the Judiciary Committee and Intelligence \nCommittees about the implementation of the new provisions and their \nimpact on U.S. persons.\n  This bill rejects changes to the definition of electronic \nsurveillance, a change sought by the administration that could have had \nunforeseen and far-reaching consequences for FISA's protections for the \nprivacy of law-abiding Americans.\n  This bill ensures that the law expires in 4 years, requiring the next \nPresident and Congress to evaluate its effectiveness.\n  Let me in passing say that Senator Leahy, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, worked hard on this. As you know, there was a \njoint referral. Again, Senator Leahy worked, as he does on all pieces \nof legislation, tirelessly and for the good of this country.\n  These changes I have mentioned add checks on the expansive executive \npowers contained in the original bill. But, as I said, despite these \nimprovements, this legislation certainly needs more work. That is why I \noppose it and why I am committed to working with the new President to \nimprove it.\n  Congress should not wait until the 2012 expiration to improve this \nlegislation. I will work to ensure that Congress revisits FISA well \nbefore 2012, informed by the oversight that will be conducted in the \ncoming months by the Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence \nCommittees and by the reports of the inspectors general. Next year, for \nexample, Congress will be required to revisit a number of provisions of \nthe PATRIOT Act. That may provide a suitable occasion to review the \nrelated issues in this FISA legislation.\n  While the bill before us does include some improvements to title I's \nintelligence collection procedures, I oppose totally title II. I think \nit is just way out of line.\n  Title II establishes a process where the likely outcome is immunity \nto the telecommunications carriers that participated in the President's \nillegal warrantless wiretapping program. That is what it was. The bill \ndoes not provide any protection for the Government officials who \ndesigned and authorized the program. That is good. It also, of course, \ndoes not preclude a challenge to the constitutionality of the \nlegislation in Federal district court.\n  Nobody should read title II of this bill as a judgment on the \nlegality of the President's warrantless wiretapping program because it \nis not. Nobody should expect that a grant of immunity is anything other \nthan a one-time action. This was made clear in the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee report that accompanied an earlier version of this \nlegislation. Service providers should clearly understand that no grant \nof immunity will be forthcoming if they cooperate with future \nGovernment requests that do not comply with the procedures outlined in \nthis legislation.\n  The current lawsuits against the telecom companies seek \naccountability.\n  These lawsuits could have been a vehicle to achieve a public \naccounting of the President's illegal warrantless wiretapping program. \nThat is why it is important that the Democratic negotiators forced the \nPresident to submit his program to a comprehensive inspectors general \nreview. That review should finally provide a full airing of this entire \nsorry episode. The bill requires the inspectors general of the relevant \nagencies to complete a comprehensive review of the President's \nsurveillance program within a year. By the time that report is issued, \nPresident Bush will have left office. Although his term will have come \nto an end, the work of uncovering this administration's abuses of power \nis just beginning. Future Presidents, future Congresses, and the \nAmerican people will learn from President Bush's abuses of power in a \npositive fashion.\n  The debate on this FISA legislation may be nearing an end, but the \nhistory books are yet to be written. Throughout this fight, a small \nnumber of lonely voices insisted that there is no contradiction between \nliberty and security. As new facts have become known, their numbers \nhave swelled, and the voices have grown louder. I am confident that \nwhen it is all known, the condemnation of President Bush's blatant \ndisregard for the Constitution will be deafening. I hope that because \nthose voices refused to be silenced, the next President and all future \nPresidents will not waiver from a path that protects the American \npeople without compromising our core American values based upon our \nConstitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5064\n\n                     (Purpose: To strike title II)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before the Majority Leader leaves the floor, \nI thank him personally but also collectively for his leadership on this \nissue. This is an act of courage on his behalf, given the arguments \nmade by the other side, and his leadership on this created the \npossibility for us to offer this amendment to strike title II. I share \nhis thoughts. He expressed them very well. I wish to identify myself \nwith them. This is not at all about questioning the need for security. \nWe all understand that. This is a simple question. Should the telecom \nindustry be granted immunity, without us being able to determine \nwhether their actions are legal? It may come out that the courts \ndetermine they were legal. If so, we move forward. All we are asking is \nthat the opportunity be given to determine the legality of their \nactions.\n  The majority leader has made it clear why it is important. This is \nabout the Constitution and the rule of law. It seems to me a very \nsimple request and, as such, I ask unanimous consent to lay the pending \namendment aside and call up amendment No. 5064.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Reid, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n     Sanders, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5064.\n\n       Strike title II.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is very simple. Strike that section of \nthe bill that grants immunity to a number of telecommunications \ncompanies that, for a period of roughly 5 or 6 years, literally \nvacuumed up phone conversations, faxes, e-mails, photographs, on a \nwholesale basis, of virtually every American citizen. The only reason \nit has come to a halt is because there was a whistleblower who \nidentified the program. Otherwise the program would be ongoing. Again, \nnone of us argue, at least I don't argue at all, about the importance \nof having the ability to get the cooperation of an industry that could \nhelp us identify those who would do us harm. That is not the debate.\n\n[[Page S6428]]\n\n  The debate is whether there is an appropriate means by which those \nwarrants are sought before these telecom companies would begin to turn \nover the private conversations, e-mails, and communications of American \ncitizens. That is what this debate is about. It is a simple debate on \nwhether we keep this section of the bill or strike it out and allow the \njudicial branch, a coequal branch of Government, to determine whether \nthe acts by the executive branch were constitutional and if they were \nthey legal.\n  If this amendment is not adopted, it will be a vote by the \nlegislative body that determines whether they were legal. We are not \ncompetent or the appropriate constitutionally delegated body to perform \nthat function. That is why we have three coequal branches of \nGovernment. The executive branch made this decision. We in the \nlegislative branch have an obligation to insist that the judicial \nbranch determine the legality of the actions taken.\n  I wish to thank as well my colleague, Senator Feingold of Wisconsin, \nmy lead cosponsor, but also to mention, if I may, Senator Leahy, who \nhas been a stalwart on this effort and always a great crusader against \nthose who would do harm to the rule of law. I also want to thank \nSenator Reid, the Majority Leader, and Senators Harkin, Boxer, Sanders, \nWyden, Kennedy, Durbin, Kerry, and Clinton for their support for this \namendment. I also thank, if I may, Jay Rockefeller, who chairs this \ncommittee. While I am highly critical of title II of the bill, I have \ngreat respect for him and the work he has tried to do in leading the \nIntelligence Committee on this difficult issue. While I still have \nmajor reservations about title I of this bill, the fact that title II \nstill exists in this bill makes it impossible to be supportive of this \nlegislation, if that is retained in the bill that we vote on tomorrow.\n  For many Americans, the issue may seem a very difficult one to \nfollow. It may seem like another squabble over a corporate lawsuit. But \nin reality, it is so much more than that. This is about choosing \nbetween the rule of law and the rule of men. You heard our colleague, \nSenator Levin, and the Majority Leader eloquently describe the \nsituation as it presently exists.\n  For more than 7 years, President Bush has demonstrated time and time \nagain, unfortunately, that he neither respects the role of Congress nor \ndoes he apparently respect the rule of law on these matters. Today, we \nare considering legislation which will grant retroactive immunity to \nthe telecommunications companies that are alleged to have handed over \nto this administration the personal information of virtually every \nAmerican, every phone call, every e-mail, every fax, and every text \nmessage, and all without warrant.\n  Some may argue that, in fact, the companies received documentation \nfrom the administration stating that the President authorized the \nwiretapping program and that, therefore, it is automatically legal. \nThese advocates will argue that the mere existence of documentation \njustifies retroactive immunity; that because a document was received, \ncompanies should be retroactively exonerated from any wrongdoing. But \nas the Intelligence Committee has already made clear, we already know \nthat the companies received some form of documentation with some sort \nof legal determination.\n  But that logic is deeply flawed. Because the question is not whether \nthe companies received a document from the White House. The question \nis, were those actions legal?\n  It is a rather straightforward and surprisingly uncomplicated \nquestion. Did the companies break the law? Why did the administration \nnot go to the FISA Court as they were required to do under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act?\n  Since 1978, that court has handled 18,748 warrants, and they have \nrejected 5 since 1978, in almost 30 years, according to a recent \npublished report in the Washington Post. So the issue raised for me is, \nwhy didn't these companies go before that court to determine whether a \nwarrant was justified? Why did they decide merely to rely on some \nletter or some documentation, none of which has ever been established \nas a legal justification for their actions?\n  Either the companies complied with the law as it was at the time or \nthey didn't. Either the companies and the President acted outside the \nrule of law or they followed it. Either the underlying program was \nlegal or it was not. If we pass retroactive immunity, not a single one \nof these questions will ever be answered--ever. Because of this so-\ncalled compromise, Federal judges' hands will be tied and the outcome \nof these cases will be predetermined. Retroactive immunity will be \ngranted.\n  So this is about finding out what exactly happened between these \ncompanies and the administration. It is about holding this \nadministration to account for violating the rule of law and our \nConstitution. It is about reminding this administration that where law \nends, tyranny begins. Those aren't my words, where the law ends, \ntyranny begins. Those words were spoken by the former British Prime \nMinister, Margaret Thatcher.\n  It is time we say no more, no more trampling on our Constitution, no \nmore excusing those who violate the rule of law. These are our \nprinciples. They have been around since the Magna Carta, even predating \nthe Constitution. They are enduring. What they are not is temporary. \nAnd what we should not do at a time when our country is at risk is \nabandon them. That is what is at stake this evening and tomorrow when \nthe vote occurs.\n\n  Allowing retroactive immunity to go forward is, by its very nature, \nan abandonment of those principles. Similar to generations of American \nleaders before us, we too are confronted with a choice. Does America \nstand for all that is right with our world or do we retreat in fear? Do \nwe stand for justice that secures America or do we act out of vengeance \nthat weakens us?\n  Whatever our political party, Republican or Democratic, we are all \nelected to ensure that this Nation adheres to the rule of law. That is \nour most fundamental obligation as Members of this great body, to \nuphold the rule of law--not as partisans but as patriots serving our \nNation. The rule of law is not the province of any one political party \nor any particular Member of the Senate but is, rather, the province of \nevery American who has been safer because of it.\n  President Bush is right about one thing. The debate is about \nsecurity. But not in the way he imagines. He believes we have to give \nup certain rights in order to be safer. This false dichotomy, this \nfalse choice that to be more secure, you must give up rights is a \nfundamentally flawed idea. In fact, the opposite is true. To be more \nsecure, you must defend your rights.\n  I believe the choice between moral authority and security is a false \nchoice. I believe it is precisely when you stand up and protect your \nrights that you become stronger, not weaker. The damage done to our \ncountry on 9/11 was both tragic and stunning, but when you start \ndiminishing the rights of your people, you compound that tragedy. You \ncannot protect America in the long run if you fail to protect the \nConstitution of the United States. It is that simple.\n  As Dwight Eisenhower, who served our country as both President and as \nthe leader of our Allied forces in Europe during World War II, said:\n\n       The clearest way to show what the rule of law means to us \n     in everyday life is to recall what has happened when there is \n     no rule of law.\n\n  That is why I believe history will judge this administration harshly \nfor their disregard for our most cherished principles. If we do not \nchange course and stand for our Constitution at this hour, for what is \nbest for our country, for what we know is just and right, then history, \nI am confident, will most certainly decide that it was those of us in \nthis body who bear equal responsibility for the President's decisions--\nfor it was we who looked the other way, time and time again.\n  This is the moment. At long last, let us rise to it. Support the \namendment I am offering on behalf of myself and the other Members I \nmentioned earlier. We must put a stop to this idea of retroactive \nimmunity. It is time we stood for the rule of law. That is what is at \nstake. The FISA Courts were created specifically to strike the balance \nbetween a secure nation and a nation defending its rights. That is why \nthe law has done so well for these past 30 years, amended many times, \nto keep pace with the changes of those who would do us great harm.\n\n[[Page S6429]]\n\n  At this very hour, in the wake of 9/11, to say we no longer care \nabout that, that we will decide by a simple majority vote to grant \nretroactive immunity to companies who decided that a letter alone was \nenough legal authority for them to do what they did is wrong.\n  I have pointed out before in lengthy debate, not every phone company \nparticipated in the President's warrantless wiretapping program. Not \neveryone did. There were those who stood up to the administration and \nsaid, without a warrant, without proper legal authority, we will not \nengage in the vacuuming up of the private information of American \ncitizens. They should be recognized and celebrated for standing for the \nrule of law.\n  For those who decided they were going to go the other way, let the \ncourts decide whether that letter, that so-called documentation, was \nthe legal authority that allowed them to do what they did for more than \n5 long years.\n  Tomorrow we will vote around 11 o'clock on this amendment. I commend \nSenator Bingaman and Senator Specter. They have offered amendments as \nwell dealing with other parts of this legislation for which I commend \nthem. But I hope my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, would \nthink long and hard about this moment. Senator Carl Levin of Michigan \nsaid something very important toward the conclusion of his remarks: \nThat this in itself becomes a precedent, that some future \nadministration, fearing they would not get permission from a FISA Court \nto engage in an activity that violated the privacy of our fellow \ncitizens will no doubt use the vote tomorrow, if, in fact, those who \nare for retroactive immunity prevail. They will cite that act by this \nbody as a legal justification for some future administration \ncircumventing the FISA Courts in order to do exactly what was done in \nthis case. It becomes a legal precedent.\n\n  So there is a great deal at risk and at stake with this vote \ntomorrow. It is about the rule of law. It is not about whether you care \nabout the security of our Nation. Every one of us cares deeply about \nthat, and we want to do everything we can to thwart those who would do \nus great harm. This is about the simple issue of whether a court of law \nought to determine whether these companies violated the Constitution. \nDid they or didn't they? If they did not, so be it. If they did, then \nthose to whom they did harm ought to be compensated at what marginal or \nminimal level one would decide. But let the court decide this. Let's \nnot decide it by a simple vote here and set the precedent that I think \nwe would regret for years and years to come.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/08/senate-section/article/S6429-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MOTORCOACH SAFETY\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today the National Transportation Safety \nBoard presented its final report on the Atlanta motorcoach accident \ninvolving the Bluffton University baseball team last March.\n  The crash resulted in the deaths of five players on that team: Tyler \nWilliams, Cody Holp, Scott Harmon, Zack Arend, and David Joseph Betts. \nThe driver, Jerome Niemeyer, and his wife Jean were also killed in the \ncrash. Many of the other passengers--33 in all--were treated for \ninjuries.\n  For the families of those who lost loved ones and the families whose \nsons survived but now struggle with the aftermath, today has been \nhighly anticipated.\n  Only hours after news of the accident hit home, these families \npledged to improve safety measures on motorcoaches so that \npreventable--preventable--fatalities would not occur in the future.\n  For John Betts, who lost his son David in the crash, it was important \nto take the accident and make it into something positive in honor of \nhis son and the other bright, talented young men who died that morning. \nMotorcoach safety became his crusade.\n  I spoke to Mr. and Mrs. Betts today and their son and daughter and \ntalked to other parents of survivors and one who had died, and I think \nabout their courage and their commitment and their passion to do this \nin the names of their sons, to fight for motorcoach safety so this \ntragedy does not befall other families. The Betts family sees upgrading \nthe safety laws for motorcoaches as an opportunity to save the lives of \nfuture riders. Mr. Betts sees it also as a way to memorialize David and \nhis teammates and, as he puts it, to make the world they lived in \nbetter than it was when they left it.\n  The Motorcoach Safety Enhancement Act, which I introduced last \nNovember along with Senator Hutchison from Texas, would address the \nshortfall in safety regulations for motorcoaches.\n  Today's final report echoes the recommendations the NTSB has been \npublishing for years and aligns itself with the safety improvements \nincorporated into our legislation. Specifically, the National \nTransportation Safety Board underscored major safety shortfalls that \nthe Motorcoach Safety Enhancement Act addresses, such as development of \na motorcoach occupant protection system, improved passenger safety \nstandards, enhanced safety equipment and devices, and required onboard \nrecorders with the capability to collect crash data.\n  Many of the injuries sustained in motorcoaches could be prevented by \nincorporating high-quality safety technologies that exist today but are \nnot widely used, such as crush-proof roofing and glazed windows to \nprevent ejection. More basic safety features, such as readily \naccessible fire extinguishers and seatbelts--simple seatbelts--for all \npassengers, are still not required on motorcoaches. As a father of \nfour, I find it particularly disturbing to know students are still \nriding in vehicles without even the option of buckling up. Seatbelts, \nwindow glazing, fire extinguishers--these are not new technologies. \nThese are commonsense safety features that are widely used. Yet \nmandating them, as recommended by the NTSB, has been languishing for \nyears.\n  The Motorcoach Safety Enhancement Act would instruct the Secretary of \nTransportation to enact these and other safety features and to \nestablish a timeframe so these safety requirements do not spend any \nmore time in limbo.\n  Sadly, the Bluffton University baseball team's fatal accident was not \nunique. We have witnessed story after story about motorcoach accidents. \nOne happened in Texas, which precipitated Senator Hutchison's \ninvolvement in this effort. This bill takes the lessons learned from \nthe tragic events of the Bluffton University baseball team's motorcoach \naccident and aims to correct them for future riders.\n  It is my hope that in the future parents will not have to endure the \nanguish and the grief that the Betts family members experienced and the \nfamily members of Tyler Williams and Cody Holp and Scott Harmon and \nZack Arend and, as I said, the Betts family. I applaud the Betts family \nand the other Bluffton University parents for their courageous fight, \nfor their persistence, and for their dedication to improving motorcoach \nsafety in the midst of so much personal pain. Those families are truly \nremarkable.\n  I urge this body to swiftly pass the Motorcoach Enhanced Safety Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the inspector general of the Social \nSecurity Administration recently issued a report taking the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services to task for its failure to take steps to \nimplement the inspector general's recommendation that the agency stop \nusing Social Security numbers as a beneficiary identifier. I support \nthe inspector general's efforts and would like to bring this issue to \nthe attention of my colleagues.\n  Social Security numbers were originally created to administer the \nSocial Security Program. Over time, the public and private sectors \nbegan to use Social Security numbers for a variety of other purposes.\n  Use of Social Security numbers is a convenient method to identify \nindividuals. But wide-spread use of Social Security numbers also \nincreases the risk of identity theft and fraud. In 2006, the Federal \nTrade Commission reported that more than 8 million Americans were \nvictims of identity theft in the prior year.\n  Identity thieves can obtain an individual's personal information by \nstealing mail or a wallet or rummaging through your trash. That \npersonal information can be used to obtain a credit card in your name, \nwrite bad checks from a bank account created in your name, or authorize \nthe electronic transfer of funds from your bank account to a different \naccount.\n  A Social Security number is a key piece of information used in \nidentity thefts. Recognizing this threat, many public and private \nentities have taken steps to limit the use and display of Social \nSecurity numbers.\n  Last year, the Office of Management and Budget called on Federal \nagencies to safeguard personally identifiable information. It required \nagencies to establish plans to eliminate unnecessary collection and use \nof Social Security numbers and to explore alternatives to Social \nSecurity numbers.\n  A number of Federal agencies are reducing the use of Social Security \nnumbers. The Department of Veterans Affairs no longer displays Social \nSecurity numbers on new veteran identification cards. The Department of \nDefense is issuing health cards that no longer display Social Security \nnumbers. And the Office of Personnel Management has directed health \ninsurers participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program \nto eliminate Social Security numbers from insurance cards.\n  Unfortunately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \ncontinues to display Social Security numbers on Medicare identification \ncards. Consumers Union and others have noted this practice needlessly \nplaces Medicare beneficiaries at risk for identity theft.\n  The Social Security Administration urges people not to carry their \nSocial Security cards with them in order to protect against theft. But \nMedicare beneficiaries are instructed to carry their Medicare \nidentification cards with them--cards with the very same Social \nSecurity number on them. Why would CMS increase senior citizens' \nvulnerability to identity theft?\n  I first raised this concern in 2005 and successfully offered an \namendment to the Senate version of the fiscal year 2006 Labor-HHS-\nEducation appropriations bill to require CMS to provide a report to \nCongress outlining a plan to move away from using Social Security \nnumbers on Medicare identification cards.\n  CMS prepared a report and provided estimates of the cost and time it \nwould take to switch to an identification system other than Social \nSecurity numbers. But it has failed to implement that plan.\n  Last month, the inspector general of the Social Security \nAdministration issued a report that examined how CMS is responding to \nan IG recommendation in 2006 to remove Social Security numbers from \nMedicare cards. The inspector general found that CMS has not done \nanything beyond preparing the report to Congress.\n  The inspector general made his position clear.

BOBBY R. HIMES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to note with sadness the passing \nof Dr. Bobby R. Himes, a retired Campbellsville University professor \nand star Kentuckian who will be greatly missed. After over four decades \nof service to his students, his community and the Commonwealth of \nKentucky, he leaves behind many loved ones and a great legacy of \naccomplishment. He was 76 years old.\n  Known to students and colleagues as ``Mr. Campbellsville \nUniversity,'' Dr. Himes taught 7,940 students over his long career, \naccording to grade books he kept in his possession. He first came to \nCampbellsville University in 1961 at the age of 29 and retired in 2001 \nas a history and political science professor. More than 4,000 \nCampbellsville students took his popular class ``United States History \nSince 1877,'' which began in 1961.\n  Dr. Himes grew up in Hartford, KY, and always remained proud of his \nhometown. In his recent book ``Life in the Shadows of Hartford College \nand Campbellsville University,'' he wrote, ``I could not have grown up \nin a better place or time. Nowhere could there have been better people \nto nurture a young boy, a young man and now an old man.''\n  Dr. Himes graduated from Hartford High School in 1950 and earned his \nbachelor's degree in history and political science from Kentucky \nWesleyan College in 1959. He earned a master's degree in social science \nfrom Appalachian State University in 1961, did other graduate work at \nWestern Kentucky University, and did his doctoral studies at Vanderbilt \nUniversity. He also wore our country's uniform for 4 years in the U.S. \nAir Force, serving in the Korean War.\n  Dr. Himes's renown as a teacher was legendary. Several years ago I \nwas on a plane from Kentucky to Washington, DC, when a young woman \nintroduced herself to me as one of his former students. She had only \nthe highest praise for him. I made sure to tell Dr. Himes about that \nafterwards. The impact he had on this young woman's life, and thousands \nof young people's lives, cannot be understated.\n  Let me point out that my wife, Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, was a \nbig fan of Dr. Himes as well. When she first met him she was new to \nKentucky and just getting to know people. Dr. Himes was so friendly and \nhelpful, they soon became fast friends. He was a great guide to the \npeople and places in Kentucky.\n  Dr. Himes was always actively engaged with the world around him, and \nso it is no surprise he was involved in political campaigning and \npublic service as well. His first campaign experience came when he was \nin the third grade at Wayland Alexander Elementary School he supported \nWendell L. Willkie in the 1940 Presidential election.\n  Luckily, that first loss did not deter him from politics completely. \nMoving to Taylor County, KY, in 1961, Dr. Himes went on to serve in \nleadership posts for local campaigns. He then became chairman of the \nTaylor County Republican Party in 1982, a position he held for 10 \nyears.\n  Dr. Himes was twice named the Campbellsville/Taylor County Chamber of \nCommerce Educator of the Year. He was also named the 2001 Business and \nProfessional Women's Club Man of the Year and the 2004 Central Kentucky \nNews-Journal Man of the Year. He received the Outstanding Social \nStudies Teacher Award from the Kentucky Council for the Social Studies \nin 1982.\n  Dr. Himes was a member of Campbellsville Baptist Church, and he \nbelonged to the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels. He was perhaps \nthe biggest fan of Lady Tiger Basketball at Campbellsville University, \nand the team recognized his support by creating the Bobby Himes Award, \nwhich honors dedication, determination and loyalty.\n\n[[Page S6431]]\n\n  Dr. Himes served under five Presidents during his tenure at \nCampbellsville University. Dr. Michael V. Carter, the current \npresident, said upon hearing the news, ``We thank God for the life and \ncareer of Dr. Bobby Himes and his service to Campbellsville University \nand humanity.''\n  My prayers and those of the people of Kentucky are with his wife \nErlene and the Himes family after this sad loss. I hope the wonderful \nmemories of Dr. Himes's long and fruitful life can give them some \nstrength during this difficult time.\n  In his book, Dr. Himes looked back at his own success and wrote, \n``What a career, what a life for a rural Kentucky boy! My granddad \nHimes would be pleased.''\n  What a life, indeed. Kentucky and our Nation have lost a great \nAmerican with the passing of Dr. Bobby R. Himes. And I have lost a dear \nbeloved friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/08/senate-section/article/S6431-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTE EXPLANATIONS\n\n  Mr. TESTER.

Mr. President, I was saddened by the news of the death \nof our former colleague, Jesse Helms of North Carolina. It was a \nprivilege to work with him when he served as chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee. He was always courteous and respectful of the \ninterests of all of the members of the committee. His conscientious \nefforts to be fair and resourceful in achieving a consensus on the \nprovisions of legislation providing Federal Government support for the \nproducers of food and fiber were deeply appreciated by me as a Senator \nfrom the State of Mississippi, which is so heavily dependent on farming \nand agribusiness.\n  I also admired his warmhearted and friendly manner. He was the \nepitome of the Southern gentleman. He was forceful and combative in his \narguments in support of the issues he believed in, and he was never \nafraid to say what he thought, even though he knew he might not be \nsupporting the prevailing view.\n  His wife Dot was one of the most precious Senate Wives Club members. \nMy heartfelt sympathies go out to her and all the members of the family \nof our departed colleague.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great \npatriot--and a good friend--who passed away on our Nation's \nIndependence Day.\n  It seems somehow so fitting that Senator Jesse Helms should have left \nus on July 4, the anniversary of America's foundational document. \nSenator Helms was, above all else, a patriot who loved his country and \nthe ideals we embody as a nation. And he spent his entire adult life \ndefending those ideals, beginning with his service in the U.S. Navy in \nWorld War II.\n  Jesse always fought for what he believed in, even at great personal--\nor political--cost. Two things friends and foes alike acknowledged, and \nadmired, about Senator Helms were that you always knew where he stood \nand that his word was as good as gold. He was a man of enormous \nintegrity, as all who dealt with him on a personal and professional \nlevel can testify.\n  While he was a formidable politician, there were some things that, \nfor Jesse, were more important than political success or winning \nelections.\n  He spent much of his three decades in the Senate standing up for the \nprinciples he believed so deeply in, even if that meant taking on \npowerful opposition, sometimes in his own party. But as Jesse famously \nsaid, ``I didn't come to Washington to be a 'yes man' for any \npresident, Democrat or Republican . . . I didn't come to Washington to \nget along and win any popularity contests.''\n  What he did win in Washington was the enduring affection of people on \nboth sides of the political aisle who found that this tough-as-nails \npolitician was also a gracious, generous, compassionate human being. As \nLinda Chavez so aptly said in tribute to Senator Helms, ``he took his \npolitics seriously, but he didn't use political differences as an \nexcuse for bad manners.'' He embodied southern charm, good manners, and \ncourtliness. He seemed to recognize that there is never a contradiction \nbetween standing up strongly for your political and philosophical \nprinciples and always treating people, including those who disagree \nwith you, in a way that always respects their human dignity.\n  Nor was this just a public display of good manners--Jesse Helms' \nChristian charity extended to his private life as well. Having been \nactive in the pro-life movement for a long time I can't tell you how \nmany times I have heard the accusation that pro-lifers only care about \nlife from conception to birth--after that, they have no interest in \ncaring for their fellow human beings.\n  Well, suffice it to say that Senator Helms disproved this caricature. \nJesse and his wife Dot were always what I like to call ``pro-life and \nwhole-life.'' In 1963, after 21 years of marriage, they adopted a \ndisabled child, their son Charles, after they read a newspaper article \nin which the child, who was 9 at the time, wished for a mother and a \nfather for Christmas. Senator Helms never used adopting a child with \ncerebral palsy to soften his image as a hard, uncaring right-wing \nideologues--in fact, he refused to talk about it in interviews. But \nCharles was, he said, a great blessing and was the center of his \nfamily. He served for years on the boards of private charities to help \nothers with cerebral palsy.\n  For those young people who had the opportunity to work with him, he \nwas a wonderful mentor. More than anything else, he loved to talk to \nyoung people, give them guidance and encouragement, and show them the \nropes of public service. Those who knew the dynamics of his office \ntestified that he was always more accessible to young people than he \nwas to high-powered lobbyists. One of his great legacies is the Jesse \nHelms Center near his hometown of Monroe, NC, an organization centered \non young people and dedicated to assuring that future generations fully \nunderstand and appreciate the blessing and opportunities of this great \ncountry.\n  What is perhaps most obvious about Senator Helms was that he was, \nsimply put, a political giant. He was among the first to take up the \npro-life cause in Congress, and his dedication to that cause never \nwavered. He was a lifelong opponent of communist tyranny, and his \nleadership in key Cold War battles was indispensible. Ronald Reagan \ncould never have achieved all that he did achieve without Senator Helms \nstrong and steady leadership as chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  And that was not all the Reagan revolution owed to Jesse Helms. Like \nRonald Reagan, he left the Democratic Party after many years as a \nDemocrat because he believed it no longer embodied the principles he \nbelieved in. He was on the cutting edge of transforming the solid south \nfrom the Roosevelt coalition to the Reagan coalition. His support for \nRonald Reagan in his State's primary in 1976 was the key to Reagan's \nvictory, and the beginning of the revival of his fortunes that led to \nthe Reagan landslides of 1980 and 1984.\n  Senator Helms' political leadership will be missed, but his impact on \nour Nation will remain as his lasting legacy. We mourn the passing of \nthis great American, and we offer our heartfelt condolences to his \nfamily, his friends, and to the people of his beloved North Carolina \nand across the Nation who loved him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/08/senate-section/article/S6431-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6431-S6432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HEALTHY AMERICANS ACT\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I stand today for the 47 million \nAmericans who are uninsured and looking to Congress to address an issue \nthat has reached critical proportions.\n  I stand for the millions of Americans who are underinsured and cannot \nafford to pay the difference between their\n\n[[Page S6432]]\n\nhealth costs and their meager coverage.\n  I stand for the millions of Americans who have lost their health \ncoverage along with their jobs.\n  And, I stand for the small businesses that cannot afford to cover the \ncosts of their employees.\n  That is why I am joining Senators Ron Wyden, Bob Bennett, and many of \nmy other colleagues in taking the first steps towards a bicameral, \nbipartisan, comprehensive solution for all called the Healthy Americans \nAct.\n  The Healthy Americans Act recognizes that our health care system is \nfundamentally broken and requires Congress, the President, and the \nFederal Government as a whole to engage in a serious dialogue about our \ncountry's health care priorities and the solutions that can make those \npriorities attainable.\n  The Healthy Americans Act guarantees affordable, high quality, \npermanent health coverage for all Americans. It provides benefits equal \nto those available to Members of Congress, and gives incentives for \nindividuals to make a commitment to prevention, wellness, and disease \nmanagement.\n  It changes the crumbling foundation on which we have built our \nsystem, challenges the status quo, and makes a commitment to the right \nof all Americans to live their lives without fear of losing, or not \nbeing able to afford health coverage.\n  This solution is affordable for us. In fact, according to independent \nstudies, this piece of legislation is fully paid for using the $2.2 \ntrillion currently spent on health care in America and saves $1.48 \ntrillion over 10 years.\n  The benefit to Americans will be profound.\n  The Healthy Americans Act changes the way we think of health care in \nAmerica through the modernization of fundamental relationships in our \ncurrent system. By redefining the relationship between employers, \nemployees, and health insurance, we give the American people a choice \nwhen it comes to the coverage, the cost, and the benefits they need for \ntheir families and their health.\n  The Healthy Americans Act marks the beginning of a comprehensive, \nbipartisan effort to health care reform. There will be many challenging \nissues to consider as my colleagues and I work to provide every \nAmerican with quality coverage. These include concerns over the \npotential disruption that such a profound change to the system would \nhave on those with existing coverage, as well as the lack of a publicly \nsponsored health plan option.\n  I hope to work with Senators Wyden, Bennett, and my Senate colleagues \nin ensuring that this legislation addresses those concerns, as well as \nothers that may be raised in the future.\n  Although complex, the health care crisis is one that we cannot afford \nto ignore any longer. Together, we can turn the health care system in \nAmerican into a transparent, affordable, efficient and healthy system \nthat can help those that need it most.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/08/senate-section/article/S6432-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NEW MARKETS TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wish today to talk about the impact the \nnew markets tax credit has had in revitalizing distressed neighborhoods \nin my home State of Oregon.\n  The new markets tax credit has become a vital financing tool to \norganizations throughout Oregon, like United Fund Advisors and Portland \nFamily of Fund, to invest in and nurture business opportunities in our \nlow income communities that are in need of investment capital.\n  The New Markets Tax Credit was signed into law in 2000 with the goal \nof using a modest Federal tax credit as an incentive to attract private \ninvestment capital to viable urban and rural markets that private \ninvestors often overlook and I am happy to report that the credit has \ndone just that.\n  The Treasury Department reported that as of July 1, 2008, the credit \nis responsible for $11 billion of new investment going into \neconomically distressed communities across the country. More than $600 \nmillion in NMTC- supported projects have been launched in Portland \nalone with the promise to create more than 9,000 construction and \npermanent jobs for city residents.\n  United Fund Advisors and its sister organization Portland Family of \nFunds are but two organizations using the credit in my home State, but \nI hold up their works as an example of how the NMTC can work.\n  United Fund Advisors and Portland Family of Funds recognized the \npotential of downtown Portland. Since 2002, through their CDEs, they \nhave been awarded $165 million in credits, which they have used to \nattract investors to finance vital community services, as well as \nbusinesses in neighborhoods that have suffered from chronic poverty and \ndisinvestment.\n  In downtown Portland, the credit has financed several community \nfacility projects, including the Community Transitional School, which \nis an elementary school that serves homeless children throughout the \ncity. The school serves over 200 homeless children a year and has been \nin operation since 1990. However, it was unable to secure the financing \nit needed to support the $3.5 million rehabilitation of its facility to \ncreate a safe, stable and permanent home for the school. The credit was \nused to attract financing from U.S. Bancorp to make the project \npossible and the school now expects to open the doors to its new 9,500-\nsquare-foot facility this fall.\n  The credit also provided the gap financing necessary to develop a \ndrug rehabilitation facility within the Union Gospel Mission and to \nrehabilitate a theater and community space in the Portland Armory, \nwhich had been lying vacant for about 35 years.\n  The credit has been used to reclaim abandoned commercial space and \nencourage business development and economic activity in downtown \nPortland. Portland Family of Funds used the credit to assist a minority \ndeveloper finance the development of two business condominiums designed \nto bring minority- and women-owned businesses into the downtown \nPortland market. In addition, the credit financed the Portland Small \nBusiness Loan Fund which provides financing to new and emerging small \nbusinesses operating in low-income neighborhoods in the city.\n  None of the projects that I just described would have been completed \nwithout the new markets tax credit. Last year the GAO published a \nreport on the NMTC and found that 88 percent of the NMTC investors \nwould not have invested in the low-income community or business without \nthe subsidy provided by the credit.\n  I am a strong supporter of the NMTC because of its potential to bring \ncommunities and businesses that have traditionally been left out of the \nmainstream financial market into the mainstream market.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me to support the extension of the new \nmarkets tax credit, which is currently set to expire at the end of this \nyear. Our cities and rural communities need this program, and I will do \nall I can to see that it is extended and expanded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/08/senate-section/article/S6432-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6432-S6434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energ_prices@crapo.senate .gov to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator--I am getting sick and tired of hearing from \n     Easterners who live in New York or Washington, DC, and can \n     walk to the corner store and who have mass transit options \n     readily available constantly harping about raising gas prices \n     even higher in order to get people to use less gas. The logic \n     is absolutely heinous.\n       We live seven miles east of Mountain Home; we have no other \n     options but to drive to get anywhere, and, if it is snowing \n     real hard, our only option is our supposedly-evil\n\n[[Page S6433]]\n\n     SUV; our other cars won't make it out of our steep driveway. \n     Buying gasoline is not a choice, it is not a luxury--it is a \n     necessity. We've already cut our consumption, we've limited \n     our trips into Boise to the absolute minimum and we even try \n     to consolidate our trips into town as much as possible.\n       Any further cuts will require some major changes--the \n     biggest one would be my seriously considering quitting \n     school. I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in History \n     at BSU, I hope to graduate in May--but if gas prices go up to \n     the eight or ten dollars a gallon that I've heard many of the \n     so-called environmentalists advocate, I won't be able to \n     continue driving up to Boise three to four times a week. We \n     also have to limit our driving to one trip to Mountain Home \n     each day to my husband's office in our most gas-efficient \n     vehicle, and none on the weekends. If that means that one of \n     us has to sit around for hours waiting for the other one so \n     be it. Our trips to the base to the Commissary and BX will \n     have to be made in conjunction with a workday trip in to \n     town, and we may stop making them altogether unless they were \n     in conjunction with a trip to the hospital--the savings would \n     probably be outweighed by the gas costs.\n       Moving is not an option--my husband and I are both Air \n     Force retirees who invested our savings, an immense amount of \n     sweat equity, and a lot of love in our ultimate dream house \n     on a beautiful lot on forty acres. This is our home. We love \n     living in the country the same way many people love living in \n     the city. They have their rapid transit that is highly \n     subsidized by the government; why are we paying for their \n     lifestyle so that they can play holier than thou and harp \n     about mine being evil?\n       My husband and I are actually quite lucky--we're retirees \n     who can make choices about when and where we want to be \n     places--they're hard choices, but at least they're our \n     choices. Most people do not have that luxury. I keep thinking \n     about the many people who were out here working on our house, \n     most of whom drove from Boise. They didn't have a choice, \n     they had to make the drive. They did, however, have an \n     alternative funding source--they could pass their costs on to \n     us, which is what is now happening with all businesses and \n     commodities--and everything is just going to keep getting \n     more and more expensive as this goes around in a lovely \n     little circle. Remember the 70s and inflation? If we do not \n     find a way to stop this pretty soon, we're going to see \n     inflation like we've never seen it before. . .\n       I'm all for ``alternative energy;'' I'd be thrilled to use \n     a vehicle that runs on ``alternative energy''--if there was \n     one available and I could afford it. Additionally, the \n     government has been funding research into ``alternative \n     energy'' for years now--do not make me raise even more funds \n     for it every time I fill up my gas tank. On top of that--do \n     not you think that whoever it is who finally makes a vehicle \n     that does run on ``alternative energy'' will be able to make \n     an awful lot of money on it? Why should I be paying for the \n     R for their huge profits? Stop wasting your time and my \n     money conducting show trial hearings of oil executives and do \n     something useful like maybe suspending the stupid rules about \n     mandatory floors on ethanol usage--with the floods in the \n     midwest and the even higher corn prices that is going to \n     raise gas prices even higher. Drill everywhere we can get \n     oil. Use the shale oil. Build nuclear plants. Do it now so \n     that ten years from now your successor won't be saying ``oh, \n     well, we would have had to do that ten years ago for it to \n     have done any good so we might as well not do it now that gas \n     prices have risen to fifteen dollars a gallon. . .''\n       Oh, and by the way--why haven't the Republicans been all \n     over the Democrats about the fact that they were going to fix \n     everything that was wrong in the world once they had control \n     of Congress? Could you guys please make some noise about the \n     fact that some things aren't George Bush's fault but should \n     be laid at the feet of the Democratically-controlled \n     Congress?\n     Tamara, Mountain Home.\n                                  ____\n\n       Honorable Senator, I am absolutely astonished and even \n     sickened at the shameful interrogation of the oil company \n     executives that was conducted by Senator Durbin, Maxine \n     Waters and others. Also, Senator McCain for insinuating that \n     the `Speculators' are to blame for the high price of oil. Why \n     is so much time being spent pointing the finger of blame at \n     people who did not cause this problem in the first place?\n       These committees should be spending their time removing the \n     restrictions that have minimized access to the resources of \n     our own country as quickly as possible. I urge you to meet \n     with the Senators who somehow do not understand that it is \n     their own actions that have brought us to this place.\n       They have stifled production, placed their own taxes on our \n     fuel supply and even threaten to penalize and take away \n     profits from the very companies who can invest those profits \n     back into increasing the available supplies, finding new \n     resources in an environmentally friendly way and developing \n     cleaner fuels. With sufficient resources, the private sector \n     will be able to solve this problem.\n       You must convince other congressmen that the only solution \n     is to get out of the way and remove the restrictions that \n     prohibit qualified companies from increasing domestic \n     production of energy.\n       Thank you for the work you do on our behalf.\n     Ramona.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo, I would first like to thank you for the \n     way you voted in the recent issues. I would also like to have \n     my voice heard on the energy crisis. I feel that you should \n     take the restrictions off the oil company and allow them to \n     drill for oil. I feel that the U.S. is getting into a \n     situation such as Germany and Japan during World War II. They \n     did not have the resources so that they were in a position of \n     weakness. I feel that the energy crisis is brought about \n     because of special interest at the expense of our national \n     security. I also feel that they should allow nuclear energy. \n     It would certainly solve many problems and other countries \n     have been using it.\n       Sincerely,\n     Jackie, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Mike: I am not severely damaged by the gas prices \n     because I can still afford to drive. But I am more cautious, \n     and am much more conservative in my driving. The cost between \n     $2 gas and $4 gas is about what many families pay for the \n     cell phone service per month. Most people haven't put things \n     into perspective properly.\n       There are lots of explanations of the reason for the high \n     prices and they seem to point at two reasons: foreign demand \n     (China and India) and the commodity speculators. Neither of \n     these can be fixed. However, the exchange value of the dollar \n     can be fixed, and we can announce that we are going to start \n     new oil exploration and drilling in the Gulf of Mexico (Not \n     ANWR).\n       Those two solutions sound reasonable and obtainable. Thanks \n     for listening.\n     Bob, Gooding.\n                                  ____\n\n       Fuel prices are seriously affecting my family's income. My \n     wife and I are new parents, and my wife is staying at home \n     with the baby most of the time. I am a struggling mortgage \n     loan originator, fighting to try and keep my family afloat in \n     a suffering housing market. I live in Emmett, and my office \n     is in Boise, so like many, many other folks from Emmett, I \n     commute to work. The increase in fuel prices has caused me to \n     cut down the amount of time I spend at the office. What used \n     to cost about $27 to get back and forth to work 4 times now \n     costs over $50. And that is with driving my 32 mpg Hyundai.\n       Gas prices didn't used to be a deciding factor in the work \n     and recreational activities that we did. But, at $4 a gallon \n     for fuel, we cannot afford to get out as much as we used to, \n     which limits the amount of money we spend on other \n     activities. I'm sure I'm not alone and, with hundreds of \n     thousands of Idahoans not spending as much money on \n     recreational activities, it is further hurting our local and \n     national economies.\n       I firmly believe that we as a nation are able to and need \n     to develop alternative fuels AND drill for fossil fuels in an \n     environmentally-responsible way. With advances in technology, \n     I am sure that it is possible. No one needs to drill through \n     the head of a caribou in order to get oil. With the oil \n     available in ANWR and the newly-discovered North Dakota oil \n     reserves, we have the potential for enough fuel to sustain \n     our nation and stimulate the economy until further advances \n     in alternative energy sources can be achieved.\n       Please do everything you can to minimize the hurt we \n     Idahoans are feeling due to the sky-high energy costs. \n     Struggling young families like mine are fighting just to keep \n     our heads above water and gas prices are threatening to push \n     us under.\n       Sincerely,\n     Houston, Emmett.\n                                  ____\n\n       My wife and I live in a small rural community in Idaho. We \n     try to make one big trip each summer, and we visit my wife's \n     family in Utah once a month. We both drive mid-sized \n     American-made cars that are fairly economical, but [the cost] \n     to fill our gas tank has gone from $30 to $60.\n       This is $30 less that we can spend on groceries. Our \n     grocery bill has also increased by $20-$40 a month. We have \n     one small child and hope to have another next year, and I \n     know my salary is not going to keep up with 7% inflation. It \n     is not just fuel we are worried about. Our house is entirely \n     electric because natural gas is not available in our \n     neighborhood and, before we switched our utility bill to \n     level pay, we were paying outrageous charges to heat and cool \n     our house. Idaho has some of the cheapest electric power in \n     the nation, and our electric bill in January was nearly \n     $400.00. Idaho seems to be anti-coal fired plants, but I am \n     not. I lived next to a coal-fired plant in West Virginia and \n     didn't notice any ill effects. However, I would rather see \n     increased hydro, nuclear, and geothermal energy production. \n     Nuclear is clean, and I think it is the way to go.\n       Geothermal and hydro are both regular and efficient methods \n     of producing power. I am not in favor of wind farms; their \n     source of energy is inconsistent at best, and I do not think \n     the technology is quite good enough to place solar power \n     above nuclear or coal. I support drilling in ANWR and other \n     offshore sites in the U.S. ANWR is some of the most desolate \n     and unattractive tundra wasteland you will ever see. Drilling \n     could be accomplished there with virtually no ill effects to \n     humans and very minimal effects to the few species who can \n     survive the harsh tundra climate. Anything we can do to \n     research and drill for that shale-oil found throughout the \n     mountainous West would be beneficial. I would hope that \n     American auto makers can\n\n[[Page S6434]]\n\n     use technology to make more fuel-efficient vehicles that are \n     less reliant on petroleum. I think ethanol is a piece of the \n     puzzle, but it can never replace petroleum and is not the \n     ultimate solution. I'm sure you do not want a novel, so I'll \n     end on that note.\n     Chris, Burley.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Mr. Crapo, You're so right about the gas prices \n     affecting those of us in Idaho. So many of us are in rural \n     areas that do not offer the services of a bigger city, i.e. \n     specialized physicians, food and clothes shopping, automotive \n     and farming equipment and supplies, etc. While you say the \n     average Idaho household is spending $50 more/month, I can \n     attest to the fact that it is more like $100 more/month, \n     especially where we must travel approximately ten miles to \n     the nearest town. Those people who are on repeat chemo or \n     dialysis treatments are really taking it in the pocket book!\n       We need to tap into the alternative energy resources in our \n     country and stop relying on other Third World countries who \n     commit atrocities against humanity. Meanwhile, since it is an \n     emergency in terms of the USA economic status, let us try, \n     just try, to depend on the oil reserves and resources in the \n     U.S. and Canada and see where that takes us. I do not see (in \n     my limited experience) how it would make us any less of a \n     super power. Frankly, we'd be setting a good example.\n       Thank you for considering my request to be heard as a \n     lifetime citizen of Idaho and the USA.\n     Melanie, Silverton.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a recently (February) divorced woman; mid-50's living \n     in Blackfoot. I have been doing okay, being able to make ends \n     meet. Recently I had to change my taxes. At the present time, \n     I have no real estate, which should change by December. Being \n     single again my taxes have changed to take out another \n     $284.00 per month.\n       Meanwhile, I have a mother, widowed, in her late 80s that I \n     have to travel to Idaho Falls from Blackfoot to help with \n     bills, doctor appointments, grocery shopping, keeping the \n     yard mowed and all the things that go with helping to assist \n     in the care of an elderly parent. She is fairly competent, \n     and I am really lucky, but she is getting weaker and shakier. \n     I worry.\n       Just last month alone, my gas bill went from $100.00 per \n     month to $180.00. This is huge for me. Considering I work for \n     a salary and receive no overtime, I guess you could say I \n     have a `fixed' income. I really cannot get a second job \n     because I really need to be able to leave at a moment's \n     notice if I need to take care of her needs. The gas is \n     actually dipping into my savings I pay myself each month.\n       This has caused a lot of emotional feelings for me. I am \n     torn between where I should be and how much it is going to \n     cost me to get there. These choices should not be weighed \n     between gas prices and a mother in need.\n       I hope something can be done about this. When I purchase \n     gas, I get physically sick in my stomach and I feel angry. My \n     car gets 28 mpg on the freeway, thank goodness. Imagine if I \n     had a truck or something less conservative.\n       Sincerely,\n     Cathy, Blackfoot.\n                                  ____\n\n       The Honorable Senator Crapo: I appreciate the opportunity \n     to share the personal feelings on high fuel costs, and the \n     impact these high energy costs are having on us. I believe \n     that legislative bodies need to get together and ``act'' in a \n     way that will ensure that my children, and theirs, will have \n     a way of life free from most of the stress and concerns \n     concomitant we are struggling with today, in the way of high \n     energy costs. We must execute a well-thought-out plan that \n     does not band-aid the current situation, at the expense of \n     the future. Quite frankly, I would rather pay my share now, \n     if it means my children will have the opportunity to live in \n     a world where they can focus on being all they can be, \n     without fear of making trade-offs between the fuel it takes \n     to get them to work, and the food or health care that they \n     need to survive. Finally, we need to act now (not next \n     session, or the one after that). Election year, or not . . . \n     I will be more prone to vote out candidates that \n     procrastinate on this urgent topic, at the expense of being \n     popular with their constituents in an election year (and I \n     believe that candidates would actually be more popular, if \n     they acted, rather than delayed).\n       These are my positions. I am no authority. I believe a plan \n     like this could be achieved, if we could all learn to work \n     together (particularly the Legislature) and assemble a 20-\n     year plan that alleviates much of our dependence on foreign \n     oil, to wit:\n       Our oil companies are doing just fine, thank you. While I \n     would not be in favor of a windfall tax on oil profits, that \n     would merely be passed along to consumers, in the form of \n     further fuel price increases, I would be in favor of a large \n     tax deduction for increasing refinery capacity so long as an \n     equal investment was made in alternative forms of energy \n     development (wind, solar, seas, geothermal, etc).\n       Establishing legislation that requires all automakers \n     selling cars in the U.S. to develop, by 2018, models of \n     reliable, economical, and efficient electric-based commuter \n     vehicles, enabling local transportation, thus decreasing \n     pollution and allowing consumer cost avoidance for fossil-\n     fuel unless traveling longer distances. This would include \n     fuel-cell, rechargeable, etc. vehicles.\n       Speed up the approval of nuclear power generating permits \n     to ensure we have the generating capacity to begin the shift \n     to electric vehicles.\n       Mandate approval of local option taxes as the Federal \n     level, allowing citizens to tax themselves for transportation \n     plans that reduce CO2 emissions (it is clear our \n     own State Legislature is asleep at the wheel on this \n     subject). Like No Child Left Behind, we have proven it is \n     possible to require state governments to ``act'' in positive \n     ways.\n       Open up ANWR to exploration, drilling, and oil production, \n     along with environment preservation regulations that require \n     ``logical'' and ``thoughtful,'' yet inexpensive ways of \n     minimizing our footprint in this, and all areas (including \n     offshore) that may produce the fuels we need to get to an \n     electric-based commuter mentality. Require environmentalists \n     to ``prove'' the impact, not speculate, and enact the \n     needful, but minimum.\n       Require all oil companies to invest in infrastructure that \n     allows for the delivery of alternative fuels (e.g., hydrogen) \n     in a stepwise, U.S.-wide plan that allows for a complete \n     mapping of these services in the next fifteen years.\n       Provide tax-incentives, or perhaps Federal Grants to \n     companies that can develop technologies that allow for the \n     generation of clean power right in our homes (advanced solar \n     cells, fuel cells, etc.).\n       We need to act now, as the answers are sure to be long in \n     the making. But we also need to take some chances (ANWR) that \n     allow us to make it to the next stage of technological \n     maturity. We need this balance: Current energy exploration \n     and local production along with equal investments in the \n     deployment of new energy source technologies. We also need to \n     enable investments in all the underpinning services and \n     infrastructure that make this future vision come to fruition \n     (alternative fuel delivery infrastructure, home power \n     transfer technology, etc.).\n     Pat, Boise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/08/senate-section/article/S6434-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING TROOPER DAVID SHAWN BLANTON, JR.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to honor the life of North Carolina \nState trooper David Shawn Blanton, Jr., who was tragically killed on \nJune 17 during a routine traffic stop near Canton, NC. David is the \n59th North Carolina State trooper to have been killed in the line of \nduty.\n  David was only 24 years old and was a 2-year veteran of the North \nCarolina Highway Patrol. He was a native of Sylva, NC, and a 2002 \ngraduate of Smoky Mountain High School, where he was a football and \nwrestling star.\n  We are all grateful for David's dedication to protecting the citizens \nof North Carolina. He lived in Cherokee with his wife Michaela, who had \njust given birth to their son Tye 2 weeks prior to his untimely \npassing.\n  David was a member of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indian Tribe \nand the first member of that tribe to serve with the highway patrol. In \naddition to being a State trooper, David volunteered as the junior \nvarsity softball coach at Smoky Mountain High School.\n  Along with his wife Michaela and son Tye, David is survived by his \nfather David S. Blanton Sr., stepmother Jennifer Blanton, mother \nJeanell Youngbird, younger brothers, Jerry R. Blankenship, Jim Kye \nBlankenship, Jesse J. Blanton, and sister Natalie E. Blanton.\n  David's friends, family, fellow troopers, and the people of North \nCarolina are mourning this very tragic loss.\n  I know that there are no words that I can offer to help comfort \nMichaela and other members of the Blanton family, but I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will join me in keeping them in our thoughts \nand prayers.\n  David gave his life in service to our State, and this ultimate \nsacrifice should never be forgotten.\n  I send my deepest condolences to all who had the privilege of knowing \nthis young man who gave his life in service to our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/08/senate-section/article/S6434-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6434-S6435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BARBARA MORGAN\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am proud to announce the return of \nNASA mission specialist, teacher in space Barbara Morgan, not to \nEarth--that was 10 months ago--but to Idaho and Boise State University \nwhere she has been hired in a newly created position that will develop \neducation initiatives in science, math, engineering, and technology. \nBarbara flew on the Shuttle Endeavor, Mission STS-118, from August 8-\n21, 2007. She served as a mission specialist onboard Endeavor, working \nas a robotic arm operator in the\n\n[[Page S6435]]\n\nInternational Space Station assembly mission and conducting a teaching \nlesson from space, of which I was fortunate enough to be a part on the \nground in Boise.\n  Barbara is a teacher by training. In 1985, she was selected to be the \nbackup candidate for the NASA Teacher in Space Program, and trained \nwith the late Christa McAuliffe for 4 months. After the shuttle tragedy \nin 1986, she returned to Idaho and taught second and third grades at \nMcCall-Donnelly Elementary School. She continued to work with NASA's \nEducation Division as the space designee, speaking publicly, designing \ncurriculum, serving on the National Science Foundation's Federal Task \nForce for Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering, and as an \neducation consultant. In 1998, NASA began the Astronaut Educator \nProgram which replaced its Teacher in Space Program and Barbara was \nselected to train as a mission specialist. She began her 2-year \ntraining period that year and, upon completion in 2000, was given \ntechnical duties with NASA. She continued her duties and ongoing \ntraining in preparation for Mission STS-118 last summer.\n  In a preflight interview before STS-118, Barbara's extraordinary \ncommitment to learning was revealed as she recounted of the beginning \nof her pilot training. She came to flight training with no flying \nbackground, and her initial pilot training experience was in a Cessna. \nBeing unfamiliar with the communication language between pilots and air \ntraffic controllers, she went to Radio Shack and bought a radio that \ngave her access to air traffic control so she could listen and become \nfamiliar with the language. In the course of that interview, one of \nBarbara's insights about the basics of learning, be it in a career or \nin school, revealed itself in a fine point about the importance of \n``learning the language.'' She observed that once you master the \n``language,'' be it an actual language or a set of terms used in a \nparticular vocation or field of study, things become much easier. She \nunderstands very well that learning the ``language'' is the pathway to \nsuccess.\n  Barbara has learned many languages, from that of an elementary school \nteacher to that of a pilot and NASA astronaut. Boise State University \nis very fortunate that she will be bringing her science, math, and \nengineering language skills to its students. It has been an honor for \nme to pay tribute to Barbara's remarkable achievements today and in the \npast, and I am certain that there will be many more to come. I offer \nher, Clay, and their children my heartfelt congratulations and an \nenthusiastic ``Welcome home to Idaho!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/08/senate-section/article/S6435-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL GALEN JACKMAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to publicly commend and \ncongratulate MG Galen B. Jackman, U.S. Army, upon his retirement after \nmore than 35 years of military service. During the last 3 years, from \nJuly 2005 through July 2008, Major General Jackman served as the Army \nChief of Legislative Liaison. He was instrumental in improving the \nunderstanding of Members of Congress and staff concerning a wide range \nof Army issues, in particular an understanding of the Army's role in \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the resource requirements for an army \nat war, and the effect of those wars on the Army and its soldiers and \ntheir families. Major General Jackman worked tirelessly to ensure that \nsoldiers and Army civilians had the resources necessary to maintain the \nArmy as the world's preeminent land service. He forged effective \nrelationships with congressional Members and staff, always responding \nquickly and effectively to congressional requests for information and \nassistance, and has been an invaluable advisor to the Secretary and \nChief of Staff of the Army.\n  General Jackman's assignment as Army Chief Legislative Liaison was \nthe capstone to an outstanding career of service to our Nation. Prior \nto assuming this position, Major General Jackman served as the \nCommanding General, U.S. Army Military District of Washington and \nCommander, Joint Force Headquarters-National Capital Region, Fort \nLesley J. McNair, Washington, DC. His other joint assignments include \nservice as the Deputy for Training and Readiness, United States Pacific \nCommand, and Director of Operations, United States Southern Command.\n  Major General Jackman served as the Chief of Staff and Assistant \nDivision Commander, Support, for the 10th Mountain Division, Light, \nFort Drum, NY, deploying with the Division in support of OPERATION \nJOINT FORGE, Bosnia-Herzegovina June 2000 to July 2001.\n  He began his service to our Nation in 1973 as a rifle platoon leader, \nCompany A, 1st Battalion, Airborne, 508th Infantry, 82d Airborne \nDivision, Fort Bragg, NC. His leadership positions include serving as a \nsupport squadron commander in 1st Special Forces Group, Airborne, Fort \nBragg, NC; Commander, 2d Brigade, 7th Infantry Division, Light, Fort \nOrd, CA, and director, Combined Arms and Tactics Directorate, U.S. Army \nInfantry Center and School, Fort Benning. In his numerous leadership \nand command positions throughout his distinguished career, Major \nGeneral Jackman demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the welfare of \nhis soldiers and their families. Throughout his career, he played an \nimportant role in the development of the future officers and leaders of \nthe Army.\n  Major General Jackman holds a master of science degree in procurement \nand contract management from the Florida Institute of Technology and a \nbachelor of arts degree from the University of Nebraska. He is a \ngraduate of the Industrial College of the Armed Forces.\n  His outstanding Service has been recognized with numerous military \nawards including the Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior \nService Medal, with Oak Leaf Cluster; the Legion of Merit, with Oak \nLeaf Cluster; the Defense Meritorious Service Medal; and the \nMeritorious Service Medal, with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters. He proudly wears \nthe Expert Infantryman Badge, the Master Parachutist Badge, the Air \nAssault Badge and the Ranger Tab.\n  Major General Jackman is married to the former Ms. Cathy Dowd. They \nhave two children David, 20, and Patrick, \n18. David will be a senior at Gilford College this fall, while Patrick \nwill attend Virginia Military Institute. I also congratulate them on \ntheir husband's and father's retirement from the Army.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit for green roofs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to provide \na residential and commercial tax credit for the installation of green \nroofs. I am pleased to have my colleague Senator Cantwell join me in \nthis effort by serving as original cosponsor of this bill.\n  The bill creates a tax credit for the installation of green roofs on \nresidential and commercial property. On the residential side, the \ncredit is 30 percent of the cost of installing a green roof, with a cap \nof $2,000. On the commercial side, the credit is 10 percent of the cost \ninstalling a green roof, without a cap. In my home state of Oregon, the \ncity of Portland utilizes green roofs extensively. To date, the city \nhas installed or plans to install over 100 green roofs.\n  Green roofs provide many environmental and cost benefits. One of the \nmore significant benefits provided by green roofs is stormwater \nmanagement and energy savings. When it rains, water washes over roofs, \nstreets, driveways, sidewalks, parking lots, and other surfaces. Rain \nwater picks up pollutants, such as oil, pesticides, metals, chemicals, \nand soil. The polluted stormwater then drains into the storm system \nthat eventually makes it way into our rivers and streams. The \npollutants can endanger water quality of lakes, rivers, streams and \nwaterways, making them unhealthy for people, fish, and wildlife. During \nrainstorms, green roofs act as a sponge, absorbing much of the water \nthat would otherwise run off. The roofs serve as a natural rainwater \nfilter by utilizing the vegetation root system's natural filtering \nprocesses. The benefit of this process increases as the vegetation on \nthe rooftop matures.\n  In addition to the storm water benefits, green roofs also absorb air \npollution, collect airborne particulates, store carbon, provide living \nenvironments that provide habitats for birds, insects and other small \nanimals, reduce outside noise transfer and insulate buildings from high \ntemperatures.\n  I believe that we have a responsibility to encourage efforts to \nconserve our natural resources. Oregon continues to build on a long \nhistory of innovation in environmental policy and practice. We urge our \ncolleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL:\n  S. 3229. A bill to increase the safety of the crew and passengers in \nair ambulances; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to ask for my \ncolleagues' support for the Air Medical Service Safety Improvement Act \nof 2008, a measure that redefines our commitment to improving the \nsafety for the flight crews, flight nurses, and passengers aboard \nemergency air medical service helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.\n  These EMS aviation operations provide an important service to the \npublic by transporting seriously ill patients or donor organs to \nemergency care facilities. Each year, on average, air medical companies \ntransport about 350,000 patients by helicopter and 100,000 by fixed \nwing aircraft.\n  Providing emergency air medical service is dangerous work. \nUnfortunately, we have been reminded of this fact all too many times \nthis year, most recently by the tragic crash in Arizona.\n  I first became involved in the issue of emergency air medical service \nsafety when an EMS helicopter crashed near my hometown in Washington \nstate. On September 29, 2005, an Airlift Northwest EMS transport \nhelicopter crashed into the waters of Puget Sound at Browns Bay, just \nnorth of Edmonds, Washington. On board were pilot Steve Smith, and \nnurses Erin Reed and Lois Suzuki. There were no survivors. Over time, I \nhave communicated with both Erin's mother and sister about their loss.\n  The cause of the crash remains unknown as EMS transport helicopters \nare not required to have a ``black box'' or flight data recorder on \nboard, and only part of the helicopter could be recovered from Puget \nSound. Some in the area think the wind, rain, and heavy fog were to \nblame. Others claim that the helicopter sounded like it was having \nengine trouble.\n  All we do know is that three people dedicated to saving lives were \nlost in the ocean that night. And sadly, their story is not uncommon.\n  According to a study by Johns Hopkins University, one in four medical \nhelicopters will crash during its 15 years of service. In just the last \nsix months, there have been nine medical helicopter crashes and 16 \ndeaths.\n  This alarming epidemic of accidents has opened the eyes of the \nFederal Aviation Administration, National Transportation Safety Board \nand policymakers in recent days. But the recent spike in accidents is \nnot a new trend. In fact, between January 2002 and January 2005, there \nwere 55 crashes of medical helicopters. On January 25, 2006, the NTSB \nreleased a report identifying recurring gaps in safety that must be \naddressed, including: Less stringent requirements for emergency medical \noperations conducted without patients on board; a lack of aviation \nflight risk-evaluation programs; a lack of consistent, comprehensive \nflight dispatch procedures; and no requirements to use technologies \nsuch as terrain awareness and warning systems that have the power to \nenhance flight safety.\n  At my request, Section 508 of S. 1300, a bill to reauthorize the FAA \nincorporated the NTSB recommendations for addressing these gaps. \nSubsequent to that bill's introduction in the spring of 2007, I had the \nopportunity to discuss with stakeholders how to improve upon the \nlanguage. The bill I am introducing today is essentially the amendment \nI filed this May when the FAA reauthorization bill was on the floor. \nGiven the uncertain status of that legislation, and in light of the \nrecent events, I felt the urgency to transform the amendment into \nstand-alone legislation.\n  This bill will implement new procedures and improve standards already \nin place through strengthened safety requirements, comprehensive flight \ndispatch and flight following procedures, improved situation awareness \nof helicopter air crews, and better data available to NTSB \ninvestigators at crash sites.\n  It is time to put black boxes in these helicopters.\n  It is time to require the same safety standards regardless of whether \nor not a patient is on board.\n  It is time to evaluate potential risks before take-off.\n  It is time to improve the situational awareness of air medical flight \ncrews.\n  If not, we are bound to witness more tragedies.\n  I am committed to these changes and I ask my colleagues to lend their \nsupport in making the skies safer for the men and women who dedicate \ntheir lives to getting critically injured patients the medical \nattention they need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 3233. A bill to promote development of a 21st century energy \nsystem to increase United States competitiveness in the world energy \ntechnology marketplace, and for other purposes; to\n\n[[Page S6444]]\n\nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the 21st \nCentury Energy Technology Deployment Act to begin to address our need \nto accelerate the deployment of advanced, clean energy technologies and \nhelp establish the United States as a leader in these technologies that \nwill be in great demand in the coming years.\n  The Energy Committee has had numerous hearings on the challenges we \nface in the coming decades regarding new energy. Meeting our energy \nsecurity needs while diverting from our current pathway towards \ncatastrophic climate change will require significant investment. I'm \nconvinced that making this investment is not only the right thing to do \nfor future generations, but that it will pay real dividends to the U.S. \neconomy if we can position ourselves to lead the rest of the world in \nthis necessary transition.\n  There have been many good proposals advanced to begin our journey \ndown the path towards a more sustainable energy policy. Some of these \nproposals have even been enacted into law through energy bills in 2005 \nand 2007, but I think there is general agreement in this body that much \nremains to be done.\n  The missing ingredient that this bill seeks to supply concerns \ntraversing the so-called ``valley of death.'' This is the part of the \ndevelopment cycle of a new technology when the technology has been \ndemonstrated at a lab or pilot scale and is ready to be demonstrated at \na commercial scale. It is here, we are told, where new technologies, \nand particularly capital-intensive energy technologies, often languish \nfor want of funding. Banks traditionally aim for moderate risk and \npredictable returns and simply have very little incentive to bet on \nunfamiliar technologies with speculative returns. Venture capitalists, \nwho are more comfortable with technology risk, simply can't supply the \nbillions of dollars necessary to push these technologies forward at the \npace we need.\n  This bill can help fill this financing gap between the venture \ncapital community and the banking community and I hope it will act as a \ncatalyst for continuing conversation on this vital topic.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3233\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century Energy \n     Technology Deployment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.
