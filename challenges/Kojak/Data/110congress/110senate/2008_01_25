Mr. President, as I said twice yesterday--and I will just \nsay it briefly this morning--Democrats believe there are a lot of bad \npeople out there and that there should be some form of collecting \ninformation over the telephone. But we believe it should be done in an \norderly way in keeping with our Constitution. It appears, based on \nRepublican actions yesterday, they want no controls whatsoever on the \nPresident. They want exactly what he has been doing now, which is \nviolating the law.\n  Mr. President, we have offered a 2-week extension of the bill, a 30-\nday extension, a 15-month extension. If this bill that we have now \nbefore us is not enacted, it is not because of Democrats, it is because \nthe Republicans, in conjunction with Vice President Cheney and the \nPresident, have made some determination that there should be no FISA \nlegislation.\n  I, frankly, do not think that cloture will be invoked Monday \nafternoon. That being the case, it is virtually legislatively \nimpossible to do anything by February 1. Remember, the House is out of \nsession all but 1 day next week.\n  So the record should be very clear, we believe there are very bad \npeople out there. We believe there should be some way of collecting \ninformation. But we believe, as does the vast majority of the American \npeople, it should be collected in some way that is within the bounds of \nour Constitution.\n\n[[Page S304]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/25/senate-section/article/S304-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me respond briefly.\n  I think it is a little early in the session to begin the finger-\npointing. We have here--I had hoped--a good, sort of bipartisan start \nto the session. The facts are that we have a bill before us, the \nRockefeller-Bond bill, that we know will get a Presidential signature \nand protect the homeland. That is before us. We have an opportunity, on \nMonday, by invoking cloture, to pass a bill that we know will become \nlaw.\n  So I hope we do not sort of get back into the pattern that sort of \nunderscored the early part of the first session of the 110th of just \nsort of endless finger-pointing and game-playing. I filed a cloture \nmotion because I knew this was a bill that would get a signature. This \nis something that could become law. And if the House acted rapidly, it \nwould become law before the deadline--a great bipartisan \naccomplishment.\n  We have that opportunity Monday. I hear my good friend and \ncounterpart saying cloture will not be invoked, so I assume it will not \nbe invoked. But I think that is a great mistake. This would have been a \nwonderful way to begin the session with a high point of bipartisan \ncooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/25/senate-section/article/S304-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S304-S305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Corporal Joshua M. Moore\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a young \nKentuckian who was taken from this world entirely too soon. CPL Joshua \nM. Moore of Lewisburg, KY, was lost in Baghdad while serving our \ncountry. He was 20 years old.\n  In the early morning hours of May 30, 2007, Corporal Moore was \ndriving a humvee when an improvised explosive device set by terrorists \nwent off. The force of a 55-gallon drum of homemade explosives \noverturned the humvee and tragically took Corporal Moore's life.\n  For his valor in uniform, Corporal Moore received numerous medals and \nawards, including the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart. His \nfamily saw him laid to rest in Lewisburg, in Logan County, KY, with \nfull military honors, including a 21-gun salute and a flyover of \nmilitary aircraft.\n  Corporal Moore's funeral service was held at Lewisburg Elementary \nSchool, where Josh had attended years before and where he returned \nevery time he came home on leave to speak to the young students about \nhis life of service as a soldier.\n  This remarkable young man, who did not live to see 21, believed it \nwas important to describe the honor of fighting to defend one's country \nwith the young children in his hometown.\n  ``He has set a good example for the young kids around here. A lot of \nkids looked up to Josh. He will be missed greatly,'' says his mother, \nCarolyn.\n  Josh worried what to say about the reality of war to kids as young as \n7 years old. But his father, Seymore, encouraged him to talk about the \ndedication a soldier must have. He told him to describe the rigorous \nphysical training, the strange new places he saw, and the new friends \nhe made.\n  After Josh would return to Iraq, the students he had met would write \nhim letters to read the next time he came home. ``He sat and read \nthese--every one of these before he went back,'' said Seymore.\n  Surely to Carolyn and Seymore, it seems like just yesterday when Josh \nwas a child himself. When he was 3 years old, Josh found his dad's old \nCub Scout uniform and wore it all the time. He even insisted on wearing \nit in his preschool picture--against his mother's better judgment.\n  After attending Lewisburg Elementary, Josh went on to Lewisburg \nMiddle School and Logan County High School and was a consistently \nstrong student. He played basketball at Lewisburg Middle, became a Babe \nRuth baseball all-star, and made the Logan County High baseball team--\nall despite the fact that, at 5 foot 6, his friends teasingly called \nhim ``Little Moore.''\n  As important as sports were to Josh, however, this young man learned \nearly the importance of patience. When he was almost 16, Josh wanted to \nbuy a new car. His parents offered to help pay up to $500. But Josh had \nhis eye on a neighbor's car, a burgundy Pontiac Grand Am with a $1,500 \npricetag.\n  Carolyn and Seymore told Josh he would have to come up with the rest \nof the money, so he quit high school sports and got a part-time job. \nTwo weeks before his 16th birthday, Josh approached his parents and \nslapped $1,000 onto the coffee table. He said, ``Here is my part. Where \nis yours?'' That Grand Am was his by his 16th birthday.\n  Josh graduated from Logan County High in 2005 and hoped one day to \njoin the Kentucky State Police. But after working for a short time at a \nfactory, one day Josh came home to his family and announced, ``I am the \nproperty of the U.S. Government.''\n  ``They are going to shave your head,'' Josh's mother said.\n  ``They have to leave an inch of hair,'' replied Josh.\n  His parents were nervous for their son and suggested he try a \ndifferent branch of the service. A relative in the Navy offered to \nhelp.\n  But Josh was not interested. ``Josh wanted to be where the action \nwas,'' says Seymore, and to him that meant serving as an infantryman in \nthe U.S. Army. ``No matter what he did,'' Carolyn adds, ``he wanted to \nbe the best.''\n  Josh did his basic training at Fort Benning, GA, and graduated among \nthe top 20 soldiers in his class. Of the many things he learned there, \none was the ability to say when he had been wrong. And in a letter to \nhis mom, Josh admitted, ``I am bald.''\n  Corporal Moore was assigned to C Company, 1st Battalion, 18th \nInfantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, based out of Schweinfurt, \nGermany. In addition to Germany and Iraq, Corporal Moore saw service in \nKuwait.\n  While in the Middle East, a lieutenant asked Josh's commanding \nofficer who his smartest and quickest soldier was, and the officer said \nCorporal Moore, thinking Josh would receive an award. Instead, the \nlieutenant made Josh a radio operator.\n  At first Josh thought he had been demoted. But his old drill sergeant \ntold him this was an honor, as communications were critical to the \nunit. After this pep talk, Josh assumed his new role with relish.\n\n  The lieutenant who selected him later told Josh's family that when \nJosh was away on leave, it was hard on the unit because no one else \ncould meet the high standard he set for the job.\n  This wonderful Kentucky family is in my thoughts and prayers today as \nI recount Josh's story. He is loved and remembered by his mother, \nCarolyn Moore; his father, Jeff ``Seymore'' Moore; his brother, Richard \nPierce; his sisters, Carrie Cantarelli and Ashley Moore; his \ngrandparents, Jeanette Rose and David and Barbara Knight; his \ngirlfriend, Amber Miles; and many other beloved friends and family \nmembers.\n  Corporal Moore's funeral service was held at Lewisburg Elementary \nSchool, the only place in Logan County large enough to hold the \nhundreds--hundreds--who came to pay their final respects.\n  Ronnie Forrest, Josh's pastor for many years, from Lewisburg's Mount \nPleasant Baptist Church, expressed best how this young man inspired so \nmany in his short time on this Earth.\n  This is what he said: Josh ``didn't want to die, he didn't intend to \ndie, but he was willing to lay down his life.'' Pastor Forrest said at \nthe service: ``That's what a hero is.''\n  No words that Mr. Forrest could say, I could say, or anyone could say \nwill fill the void in the hearts of Josh's family and friends. But I \nhope the knowledge that those who knew Josh saw him for what he was--a \nhero--fills them with pride. And I am proud to recount his story for my \nfellow Senators.\n  Today, this Senate expresses its deepest gratitude for CPL Joshua M. \nMoore's service.

Mr. President, we have lost about 4,000 soldiers in Iraq. \nThirty-five thousand have been wounded. About a third of them have been \ngrievously wounded. As we know, about 40 percent of the men and women \ncoming back from Iraq have what is now called--we used to call it, \nafter the Second World War, shell shock. Now they call it post-\ntraumatic stress syndrome.\n  I just wrote a letter to the Nevada parents of a young man who was \nkilled. I have done that lots of times. I was unable to speak to them, \nand that is why I wrote the letter. Most of them I try to visit. But \nthe family has been split up a little bit, and it was not possible for \nme to do that.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can figure out a way to get our troops home \nsoon. General Petraeus said the war cannot be won military, and every \nday that goes by that is proven certainly so. The Iraqi Government has \nnothing to move toward a settlement of this situation. There are far \ntoo many stories like Josh.\n\n  I hope we can work on a bipartisan basis on many matters. We hope, \nfor this package which is coming from the House maybe sometime next \nweek dealing with the stimulus, that we can work on a bipartisan basis. \nFrom all accounts I got yesterday, that, in fact, will be the case. \nSenators Baucus and Grassley, who have jurisdiction of 85 or 90 percent \nof the potential matters that go into the bill, have indicated they are \ngoing to have a bipartisan markup next week, and hopefully we can take \na look at that piece of legislation in a bipartisan way and get it to \nthe President as quickly as possible. There are many other things we \nhave to work on, on a bipartisan basis, and I look forward to that.\n  I say with all due respect to my friend--and he is my friend--the \nRepublican leader, that one thing the President has done and done very \nwell these past years is frighten the American people, and it appears \nwe are entering into another zone of frightening the American people. \nIt started a couple of days ago with the Vice President, and the \nPresident followed him by a day, and we have the State of the Union \ncoming. It is obvious that this FISA bill--which I hope something works \nout so it can be passed, but unless there is a way to amend it, it \ncertainly doesn't appear that it is going to be. The President's State \nof the Union and certainly leading up to it will, again, frighten the \nAmerican people. The best way to take that away is for the President to \nwork with us. Are we asking for the impossible?\n  There have been efforts to amend this FISA legislation. In title I, \nthere are probably five or six amendments we would want to vote on. \nTitle II, which deals with immunity, Senators Dodd and Feingold for a \nlong time have said they wish to have a vote on that. That is not \nunreasonable. Many of us support that. I can't imagine why we can't \nmove forward on that, unless this is something the President wants to \nratchet up so that he has something to frighten the American people \nabout on Monday night when he gives his State of the Union, that we are \nnot protecting the American people. We are protecting the American \npeople, just as this young man, Josh, was, whom the Republican leader \ntalked about. I wrote a letter, as I indicated, to the Gaul family a \ncouple of days ago.\n  We need to enter into a new era of bipartisanship where we are not \nfrightening the American people but we are trying to work with the \nAmerican people, to move out of some of the areas in which we find \nourselves bogged down. I hope this year will allow us to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/25/senate-section/article/S305-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2556\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, just one further observation with \nregard to my friend's remarks.\n  The Bond-Rockefeller bill is exactly the way we ought to be doing our \nbusiness. It came out of the Intelligence Committee 13 to 2. It is \nsupported on a bipartisan basis. It is supported by the President of \nthe United States. We have a product that was carefully negotiated by \nSenator Bond and Senator Rockefeller, approved by the Intelligence \nCommittee 13 to 2, and supported by the President of the United States. \nThat is my definition of a bipartisan accomplishment. Now the question \nis, Can we finish the job and get a signature?\n  This is not about frightening the American people. The American \npeople should be frightened, and remember full well what happened on 9/\n11. They also remember with gratitude that it has not happened again \nfor 6 years. The reason for it, obviously, is we have been on offense, \ngoing after the terrorists where they are, and we have improved our \ndefense.\n  An integral part of protecting the homeland is the measure before us, \ncarefully crafted on a bipartisan basis, supported by the President of \nthe United States. If we want to finish the job and have a bipartisan \naccomplishment that all of us can be proud of, the way to do that is to \npass this bill, send it to the House, urge them to take it up and pass \nit, and send it to the President, who awaits it to affix his signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is no question that Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Bond have worked hard on this legislation. \nAlso, we have had good work from Senator Leahy and Senator Specter of \nthe Judiciary Committee. Senator Rockefeller wants a piece of \nlegislation to pass very badly. He does not support cloture in this \neffort that is going to take place on Monday because he believes the \nbill needs to be changed. Just because there is a bill that comes out \nof committee doesn't mean we shouldn't deal with it here on the floor. \nSenator Rockefeller is not going to support cloture on this bill on \nMonday. It is a decision he made, and he has made it because we have \nnot had the opportunity to do things to this piece of legislation that \nhe believes should happen. It is a rare piece of legislation that comes \nout of one of these major committees that comes to the floor that \ndoesn't require some improvement.\n  So it is simply unfair to say that Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nBond's piece of legislation should go through as if it were written in \nscript on top of some big mountain. It was written in a committee room \nwith a lot of discussion and votes, and some of the amendments passed, \nsome didn't. It came to the floor. We all are happy it came to the \nfloor. But at this time, even Senator Rockefeller believes there should \nbe changes in it, and he will not support cloture, as he told me last \nnight, because he feels it has been handled so poorly by the minority \nhere on the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to address the FISA bill. I also \ncommend our majority and minority leaders on their statements about the \nlives that have been lost by our brave troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I believe there are a couple of comments that are appropriate.\n  Number 1, it was said that General Petraeus said the war is not going \nto be won militarily. That is the key point which General Petraeus has \nbrought to the battle. There is a kinetic and nonkinetic impact of the \ncounterinsurgency strategy that General Petraeus has laid out and that \nis showing such great progress in Iraq.\n  Today, the news is not dominated by Iraq. Those people who have been \ncriticizing it don't talk about it because General Petraeus's strategy \nis working. It is not just the surge; it is the strategy, the \ncounterinsurgency strategy, or COIN, as it is sometimes called. That \ninvolves clearing, holding, and building.\n  There is a real difference between the approach we took right after \nthe fall of Saddam Hussein, which has been haphazardly called the \n``whack a mole'' theory--we would go out, send our troops out, trying \nto keep a small footprint. We would also send our troops out where \nthere was an al-Qaida stronghold and try to suppress them, and then we \nwould leave. The problem is that al-Qaida would come back, and they \nwould take vengeance on anybody thought to have cooperated. That \nstrategy, apparently pushed by those who felt it would be--we wanted to \nmaintain a small footprint and not appear to be taking an occupier's \nrole--was not working.\n  General Petraeus expanded upon the usual doctrines of \ncounterinsurgency, and he brought a new approach beginning over a year \nago. He said: We will send in troops to clear areas, working with the \nIraqi security forces. When they clear an area, they will stay there to \nmaintain security--that is clear--and then hold. And holding involves \nthe U.S. forces working with the Iraqi security forces to train them, \nto provide them intelligence, logistics, medical support, to ensure \nthat they can sustain the peace and the security in the area. Once they \ndo that, then the U.S. Government has come in either with aid in \ndollars or with the work of the troops in the field to help build the \ninfrastructure to provide the services, whether it is health care, \nwhether it is reparations for damages, and show the Iraqi people that \nwe want to turn over that country to the Iraqi security forces to \nmaintain the stability and security which is necessary for the long-\nterm process of establishing a democracy.\n  I was there with a group of my colleagues from the Senate \nIntelligence Committee in early May, and we were seeing the beginnings \nof the effectiveness of that strategy. We went into Al Anbar Province. \nSix months before, it had been regarded as the headquarters of al-\nQaida. They were in control. It was their area. It was a Sunni area. \nThe only way the American troops could get into the capital of Ramadi \nwas to fight their way in, and then they would usually have to \nwithdraw. But on this occasion, four of us went in, in a Cougar, with \nthe commanding general of the region and two marines. We drove into the \ncenter of Ramadi, got out, and walked around Firecracker Corner--so-\ncalled because of the continuing firefights going on there previously--\nand we went to visit the embedded American marines with the Iraqi Army, \nwho had bunked there, and the Iraqi police who were serving that area. \nThey live together, they work together, they train together. You know \nsomething. It was working.\n  We even went out to see the Blue Mosque, one of the holy places for \nthe Sunni in Al Anbar Province, which had been badly hurt by gunfire, \nby artillery and rockets and bombs. The marines had gone in and helped \nrepair and clean up the Blue Mosque, so it was open for worship again.\n  The Iraqis began to understand that we would work with their security \nforces to help them take control of the area, and that is what they \nwere doing. It continued to get better. I know personally from reports \nI had from one marine there, the scout snipers found that by midsummer, \ntheir services were not necessarily needed in Al Anbar because if \nsomebody planted an IED--an improvised explosive device--or a terrorist \ncame to town or somebody set up a vehicle factory to build explosive \nvehicles, the Iraqi Sunni watch told the Iraqi security forces, and \nthey went and took care of it. The Iraqi Sunni police took care of it. \nThis continued to spread throughout Al Anbar.\n  Now, one of the helps--quite honestly, everybody will admit that one \nof the things that made it so easy for us to work with the Sunnis was \nthat al-Qaida had shown their true colors. They are terrorists first, \nsecond, foremost, and last. They went in and they terrorized the \npeople, even the people who at first were cooperating with them because \nthey thought they were Sunni brethren. Well, they were not. They went \nin and had forced marriages, rape, pillage, murder, torture. They \ndisrupted the activities, the business activities of the Iraqi Sunni \nleaders in the area, and they quickly learned that al-Qaida was not \ntheir friend and they needed us there temporarily to help them take \ncontrol of their country. That is what we are doing. It is not done all \nover. There are still areas where we have not been able to provide \nIraqi security forces sufficient training, sufficient personnel to take \ncontrol of the area.\n  Now, the majority leader said: We want to bring our troops home as \nsoon as possible. As one who supported the war, I agree with him \nwholeheartedly. I had a personal stake in it. I wanted to see our \ntroops come home. But as the President said, we need to return on \nsuccess. We need to bring those troops home when they have succeeded in \ntheir missions. because as several men on the ground who have seen \ntheir comrades killed said: We have made too many contributions and too \nmany sacrifices to see a political defeat declared by Congress, forcing \nus to withdraw, so that those contributions and sacrifices will be for \nnothing.\n\n  When you ask the American people do they want to see the troops come \nhome, sure, they do; we all do. But we want them to come home and not \nleave Iraq in chaos and to return on success. That is where the \nAmerican people are. And they are returning on success. The 2/6 Marines \ncleared Al Anbar and came home several weeks early. General Petraeus \nsays more will be coming home. But we have a vital stake in making sure \nIraq does not fall back into chaos and confusion.\n  We have laid the groundwork. There is much more political work to do \nat the national level, but political reconciliation is occurring from \nthe ground up. The Shia in Baghdad are beginning to recognize they must \nprovide financial assistance and support to the Sunnis. Recently, the \nIraqi Parliament passed a reform of the debaathification law, which put \nout of the Government anybody who had been associated with Saddam \nHussein. It was probably a bad idea that our original U.S. coalition \ncommanders had to fire all the Iraqi soldiers and send them home with \nno pay, no jobs but their weapons; to throw out of office all the \nformer Government bureaucrats who worked for Saddam Hussein. They are \ngoing to have to move carefully but quickly to get those people back \nwho know how to make government run.\n  General Petraeus has said that as we continue to build these forces--\nthe forces of peace who can run the Government--we will bring our \ntroops home. We have been in Germany and Korea for decades. We have \nbeen in Kosovo for years. We need to have a minimal presence there, \nprobably for a long time. But the primary responsibility of maintaining \npeace and security in Iraq is being turned over and must be turned over \nto the Iraqi security forces. We can back them up and make sure al-\nQaida doesn't make another run at them, doesn't bring in external \nfighters. These are the ones causing the most trouble, people coming in \nfrom Syria, or Saudi Arabia through Syria, and other areas--the \nterrorists. We have the ability to assist the Iraqi security forces to \ndo that.\n  Why is it so important we leave Iraq secure and stable? Well, Saddam \nHussein was a real threat to us. Even\n\n[[Page S307]]\n\nthough he did not actually have any weapons of mass destruction that we \ncould find, we know he used them. We know he had the ability to restart \nat any time and that he had attempted to begin a nuclear weapons \nprogram. Most of all, he had a country where terrorists were running \nwild. We heard a lot about Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi, of Ansar al-Islam, \nthe infamous butcher who delighted in decapitating people for \ntelevision. His group became al-Qaida in Iraq. Fortunately, we killed \nhim. He and other terrorists were running loose in Iraq. They were \nwaiting to get their hands on weapons of mass destruction.\n  With the decline and decapitation of the Saddam Hussein regime, we \nmade it much less likely the Government was going to provide weapons of \nmass destruction. But that was what the Iraqi survey group said was the \ngreatest danger, that made Iraq far more dangerous than we knew, \nbecause with Saddam Hussein in control, terrorist groups running wild \nin a chaotic country could have provided the weapons of mass \ndestruction the terrorists seek, and continue to seek, to use against \nour allies, our troops abroad and us here at home.\n  If the place falls into chaos, there is likely to be broad-ranging \ngenocide among the parties in Iraq, settling old grievances. That could \nbring other countries into the region, starting a regionwide civil war. \nBut the most important thing is Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, \nhis No. 2 man, said the purpose of their struggle is to establish the \nheadquarters of their caliphate at the land of the two rivers. That is \nIraq, Baghdad and Ramadi. They want to get their hands on the oil \nresources. If they have unfettered access for establishing camps to \nrecruit, train, develop weapons, issue command and control, then we in \nthis Nation are much less safe. Return on success, yes. The 2/6 Marines \nhave come back and others will come back on success. That is the \nstrategy we have now and it is the right one.\n  Mr. President, I needed to say that.\n\n\n                                  FISA\n\n  It is now important to talk about FISA. I am glad we are on the \nfloor. I think, as the majority leader has said, all first-degree \namendments need to be filed by 1 o'clock this afternoon. We are \navailable to do business and we look forward to working with our \ncolleagues to see if we can make this happen in a timely fashion.\n  I believe it is important this morning, for the Record and for the \nbenefit of my colleagues and the American people, to clear up several \nthings mentioned in yesterday's consideration of the FISA bill. When I \nsay ``FISA,'' I mean the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--the act \nthat authorizes the President and the intelligence community to use \nelectronic signals collection to get information on terrorist enemies \nand other threats to the United States.\n\n  First, I will state the obvious. Yesterday, we had a very positive \nresult in the Senate. The Senate Judiciary Committee substitute to the \nSenate Intelligence Committee bill failed on a clear vote. I believe \nthe Members of this body recognized it was a partisan, unworkable, \ninadequate bill. It was written without any consultation with the \nintelligence community or the lawyers who know how FISA works and how \nsignals intelligence is carried out. It was done without the \nparticipation of any of the Republican members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and it failed.\n  Chairman Rockefeller and I have, as has been said, a bipartisan bill \nworked out over a number of months, as the occupant of the chair knows \nso well. We worked long and hard. We didn't always agree, but we came \nto a bill that passed 13 to 2.\n  There were two problems with the bill--a good idea but unworkable as \nintroduced. So we worked with the sponsors of that provision and had a \nvery good idea that we need to protect American citizens, when they are \nabroad, from warrantless surveillance. It took 24, 25 pages to work out \nthe details for it. But I believe that provision we now have in the \nmanagers' amendment, the pending amendment before us on this bill, \naccomplishes the purposes all of us on the committee support.\n  I voted against the original proposal in the committee because I \ndidn't think it was workable, but we have fixed that, and I am proud to \nsupport it.\n  These are the fixes Chairman Rockefeller and I put together, with the \nhelp of Senator Wyden and the occupant of the chair, so we now have a \nfunctional, working amendment. The drafting has been fixed, and I \nbelieve we have a much better bill. We have an improvement over the \noriginal FISA bill and the Protect America Act, which was a necessary \nshort-term extension that allowed the continuation of electronic \nintercepts against foreign targets overseas, without having a court \norder, which was absolutely necessary because the change in the \ntechnology in electronic communications had put too many of the \noverseas collections, which used to be outside the scope of FISA, \nwithin the scope of FISA.\n  The Protect America Act had a lot of nasty things said about it \nyesterday. They were all wrong. What the Protect America Act did not \ndo, however, involves two very important things the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee did. By a 13-to-2 vote, we added the protection for American \ncitizens overseas. It is very important. It added other protections as \nwell. It also said those companies, the carriers that may have worked \nwith the intelligence community in adopting or effectuating the \ncollection of signals intelligence against terrorists planning attacks \nin the United States, should not be sued in civil court. That \nprovision--protecting any private sector entities that cooperated but \nnot Government officials from lawsuits--was necessary to end a string \nof lawsuits brought by opponents of intelligence collection who want to \ndestroy the system, who seek money damages but who really seek to \nharass and drive communication companies out of the business of \ncooperating with intelligence officials.\n  If they are successful, if they can drive and harass and bludgeon \nprivate sector entities from cooperating with intelligence officials, \nthen our country will be significantly less safe. Those of us who have \nbeen on the Intelligence Committee heard the discussion that there are \nthreats that continue to be raised and that this world is still a \ndangerous place. We need to be able to find out what our enemies are \nplanning. We cannot have the entire Nation as fortified as the Capitol \ngrounds and the White House grounds. We have a free and open country. \nOur only hope of being safe is to identify planned terrorist attacks \nbefore they occur.\n  So what we have before us today is a workable, bipartisan bill. It is \nsupported by the Director of National Intelligence. I will refer to \nAdmiral McConnell as the DNI, the head of that agency, and the \nPresident would sign it into law. We started with a solid bipartisan \nupdate to FISA that is needed to protect the country to increase civil \nliberty protections and protections for the privacy rights of \nAmericans. We should now all heed the first law of responsible \nleadership, and that is, first and foremost, do no harm with any \namendments to be considered in the bill.\n  I hope my colleagues will think long and hard before offering \namendments, to make sure they have no unintended consequences and that \nthey do no harm.\n  One good way to do that is to talk with the intelligence community. \nTalk with the office of the DNI, talk with the Department of Justice. \nIf you have a good idea, talk with them. Maybe there is a way your \nobjectives can be achieved without interfering with the ability to \ncollect information. If you don't, if things are offered that would \nsignificantly impair our intelligence community's ability to collect \nthe vitally important intelligence we need to have, then I will have to \noppose it and I will urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  We constructed a delicate, bipartisan compromise that is a good bill. \nI hope we will refrain from trying to deconstruct it or try to make the \nbill worse in any way before final passage. The American people want to \nhave well-regulated intelligence collection that keeps the country \nsafe, and they deserve no less.\n  That brings us to where we are today. Senator Feingold yesterday \noffered an amendment over which the Department of Justice expressed \nreal concerns. I understand those concerns, so I offered a second-\ndegree amendment that gives the Senator from Wisconsin three-quarters \nof what he sought, yet refrains from mandating that the executive \nbranch provide Congress with\n\n[[Page S308]]\n\npleadings containing very sensitive sources and methods submitted to \nthe FISA Court. I will refer to that court as the FISC, the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court.\n  Three months ago in a committee compromise, I agreed to include the \nprovisions of the Senator from Wisconsin in our bill, which calls for \nthe opinions, orders, and decisions of the FISC prospectively, and in \nmy second-degree amendment, I propose to go further and agree with him \nto accept his mandate to require the community to go back 5 years to \ndig up all the past orders and opinions which are of significant \nconsequence but go back and find all those and give them to us.\n  We have received in the Intelligence Committee, on a semiannual \nbasis, the reports of FISC, orders and opinions of significance, and \nthey have been available for review by our staff for each 6-month \nperiod. But we will order them to go back and provide them. I am not \nsure what he is digging for, but I think we are willing to work with \nhim. It will be a burden on the community, but I think that is \ninformation that might arguably be useful to those of us with oversight \nresponsibility.\n  I am not willing to agree to mandating that pleadings be turned over, \nand my second-degree amendment eliminates them from his mandate. It \nalso stipulates that this mandate would be levied with due regard to \nsensitive sources and methods.\n  Even though I believe this mandate for tranches of documents, \ntruckloads perhaps, puts a tremendous burden on officials in the \nDepartment who have already given us semiannual reviews, since now they \nwill have to go back and find, produce, screen, redact, and submit them \nto Congress, I am willing to work with the Senator from Wisconsin and \nothers to include them up to the point of pleadings. I hope this will \nbe viewed as a reasonable compromise.\n  Regrettably, instead of working with me on this issue, the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin attacked my efforts to reach a compromise saying ``a \nridiculous notion and disrespectful of the United States Congress.'' I \nwas accused of ``hiding behind a tragedy in this country to make \narguments that have no merit'' and trying to help the intelligence \ncommunity ``prevent the Members of Congress from seeing the pleadings \nprovided to an article III court.''\n  These insinuations are not only inaccurate, but I believe they come \nclose to violating debate rule XIX of the Senate, which says:\n\n       No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any \n     form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators \n     any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.\n\n  I do not believe the accusations against me were appropriate in the \ndebate. They only underscore the divisive and partisan intentions \nbehind some of the efforts we are seeing on the floor, and I hope we \ncan avoid future such accusations.\n  I will restate for the record my reasons for eliminating pleadings \nfrom the required submission to the intelligence communities. These are \nnot policy documents, policy of which the Intelligence Committee said: \nWe don't like the policy of where you are going. These are not broad \nissues for legislative implementation. They are detailed analyses of \nsources and methods for collecting intelligence. They are submitted to \nthe article III judge sitting at that time as the FISC judge to provide \na basis for a warrant based on probable cause to allow electronic \nsurveillance of persons within the United States, U.S. persons.\n  It is possible those pleadings would include, No. 1, the name or \nother identifying features of the sensitive sources who provided the \nintelligence information they set forth. That could risk getting \nsomebody killed. They could provide the identification and location of \nthe collection facility. They could provide information on the means of \ncollection. They would obviously have to provide information on the \ntarget and other relevant information.\n\n  In the intelligence business, these are the ultimate sources and \nmethods. They are highly classified because, if they were to leak out, \nthere would be very serious harm done to individuals and perhaps even \nlocations where collection occurs.\n  So I believe the intelligence community has a legitimate reason for \nsaying we are not going to share the sources and methods that identify \nthe names of the individuals, the sources. I do not see that is a \nnecessary element of our oversight, to know Joe Doe was the one who \ngave us the information on Ralph Roe and they needed to get the \ninformation through facility X using means Y. That is kept at a closely \ncompartmental level.\n  We have already in the bill that Senator Rockefeller and I have been \nable to forge with great bipartisan support a solid compromise piece of \nlegislation, and that is the model on which we should move ahead.\n  Today we have heard again some accusations that the minority side--my \nside--is stalling this important legislation. A quick review of the \nFISA legislation history over the past year is in order.\n  The President declared he was bringing the surveillance program under \nFISA in January of 2007, 1 year ago. In April of last year, because of \nsome changes in court orders, the DNI asked us to modernize FISA so it \nwould be compatible with new technology. On May 1 of last year, he \ntestified in open session before our committee and again he asked us to \nmodernize FISA. Shortly thereafter, we were informed in the \nIntelligence Committee about the ruling of the FISC that altered the \ncollection ability of that program, to the point where our intelligence \nagencies were shut down with regard to vital intelligence collection \nthat would protect us.\n  What was the response of our Intelligence Committee? Regrettably, \nnothing. We did absolutely nothing. I urged that we act, that we move \nforward on it, but our committee and Congress did nothing.\n  Through May, June, and July of last year, the DNI's pleadings to \nmodernize FISA grew stronger. After he came before our committee in \nMay, he came before Members of the Senate in closed session in our \nconfidential, secure hearing room. Over 40 Members were there, and he \ntold us in July it was absolutely essential we move, that everybody \nsaid it was essential we move. We did not move until the final week, \nand we still did not have a committee hearing.\n  I brought the DNI's bill, the Protect America Act, to the floor on \nWednesday, before we had a vote on it on Friday. There were comments \nyesterday about how partisan and secret and one-sided the negotiations \nwere, but it was not our efforts for the support of the DNI that were \nsecret and one-sided. There were secret negotiations on the majority \nside prior to the passage of the Protect America Act.\n  Several committee chairmen got together, shutting out Republicans and \nshutting out members of the Intelligence Committee from any \nconsideration of their proposals. They were not vetted with the \nDirector of National Intelligence.\n  The DNI has been accused of going back on his word. I managed to get \nin finally at the end of some of those negotiations, and I can tell you \nthat the DNI said he will go back and check with his lawyers on these \nissues. He did not agree to incorporate the changes that were suggested \nand, as suspected, when he viewed some of the proposals, he found they \nwere unworkable.\n  We never saw the bill the committee leaders on the majority side \nproposed to offer until less than an hour before it appeared on the \nSenate floor--before we were voting, actually, when it appeared on the \nSenate floor.\n  During that time, the majority and minority members of the \nIntelligence Committee asked me for more information about the Protect \nAmerica Act. I had a session in my office for members of the committee, \nbipartisan, going over with the DNI what the details of the Protect \nAmerica Act were.\n  Fortunately, on a bipartisan basis, we approved the Protect America \nAct. It was a stopgap. It was meant to serve for 6 months, but it got \nus back in the business of collecting vital signals intelligence. That \nis where we needed to be. We were not there.\n  That was on August 3. Fortunately, on August 4, the House passed the \nbill, and on August 5, the President signed it, and we were back in \nbusiness collecting information on new targets who were coming up on \nour screen.\n  Because of the need to add a 6-month sunset, which I agreed with all \nparties on both sides was a good idea, that 6-month sunset expires in 1 \nmore week.\n\n[[Page S309]]\n\nIt expires next Friday. Knowing that this law would soon expire, when \nthe Senate returned from the August recess in September, the \nIntelligence Committee began working on a new FISA bill, and after 6 \nweeks of constant work, deliberations, compromise, extensive \ndiscussions among staff, with staff, the members, with the DNI--and the \noccupant of the chair knows how much time and effort went into that--we \nproduced the carefully crafted compromised legislation before us today \non a 13-to-2 vote out of the committee.\n  This is a model for the law we should pass in the Senate, a \nbipartisan product. The majority leader tried to bring up this bill in \nDecember before the recess, and I commend him for it. But majority \nSenators filibustered the bill.\n  Make no mistake about it, the majority stalled FISA last month and \nfilibustered the bill. At that time, the majority leader made a \ncommendable plea to his colleagues. He stated any amendment offered to \nthis bill, in view of its delicate nature and the bipartisan compromise \nit represents, should be required to meet a 60-vote threshold to clear \nany procedural hurdles in the Senate. This would also ensure it \nremained a bipartisan product.\n  If we look at the history of the important legislation we passed, it \npassed this past year with 60 votes--60 votes--to ensure there will be \na bipartisan bill. Neither party can pass something alone, without \nbipartisan compromise--getting 60 votes. The Protect America Act \nrequired 60 votes: That is how it was brought to the floor. The \npartisan majority committee leader's bill came to the floor with a 60-\nvote requirement and it failed. We got the Protect America Act by \nmeeting the 60-vote threshold.\n\n  Sixty votes, for those who may be following this elsewhere, is what \nis needed to invoke cloture to shut off a filibuster, but it is a good \nprinciple when you have a very contentious, important, and technical \nbill.\n  I commended the majority leader for his leadership and agree \nwholeheartedly with him now. In fact, if he were able to follow through \nwith that offer now, then we would have already passed FISA last night. \nThe fact is there is a majority of Senators who will not give their \nconsent for such an agreement. They would prefer to deconstruct the \nSenate Intelligence Committee compromise and, by simple majority vote, \ntransform the bill before us into a partisan product, thus gutting the \nbipartisan support--and the DNI's support, I would add--in this \nimportant legislation. That is little bit shortsighted, I believe.\n  If a majority can be mustered to undo the important compromises \nworked out with the intelligence community, with the DNI, you can go \nthrough the act of passing the bill, but it is not going to be signed, \nand the monkey is going to be back on our back. We have an opportunity \nto pass a bill here that can be signed into law to keep our country \nsafe. If we want to be in the situation where we were last summer, \nwhere our intelligence community was effectively deaf and blind to \nterrorist threats, then go ahead and tear up this bill, take it apart, \nleave it with no support from the intelligence community. And, by \ndefinition, if it is not supported by the intelligence community, it \nwill not be signed into law by the President.\n  I am asking that we go back to the procedure we followed before in \npassing the Protect America Act, that we used in passing other \nimportant pieces of legislation, and make it a bipartisan effort. The \npeople of this country are crying out for bipartisanship. We got the \nProtect America Act on a bipartisan basis. We passed a bill out of the \nSenate committee that far exceeded the 60-percent test. We need to deal \nwith this bill under the same rules. Gutting the bill with a bare \nmajority, and plurality, as could happen under the current situation, \nis a bad approach. I say to my colleagues that if they can agree to a \n60-vote threshold for all amendments offered, then we can start voting \non any and all of them right now, and we will go through them. There \nare some very important amendments, and there are very good arguments \nfor those amendments. I hope my arguments on the other side are better. \nBut we have to deal with this on a 60-vote basis. What I am not willing \nto do right now, and our minority leader is not and our side of the \naisle is not, is to allow this bipartisan product to be dismantled on \nthe Senate floor by partisan efforts that make FISA unworkable, loses \nthe DNI's support because it won't work, and thus the President's \nsignature. It makes for good politics but it fails to protect America.\n  If the majority will work with us, then we are happy to have any and \nall amendments. I know the leaders may still come up with an agreement \nof that sort, but barring that, I don't see a way around this because \nwe are not going to accept, by majority vote, a jumbled-up structure \nthat leaves the intelligence community without the ability effectively, \nefficiently, and within proper constitutional and statutory \nrestrictions to collect the intelligence we need to keep this country \nsafe. We have to have a good bill. We have incorporated far more \nprotections in the Senate substitute than have ever been in FISA \nbefore, and I think those of us on the Intelligence Committee, the \noccupant of the chair, can take great credit for protections we have \nadded.\n  National security is not red or white, it is red, white, and blue. \nThe blues and the reds need to work together on this, passing a product \nthe DNI supports so the President will sign it into law. Anything else \nand we are not helping the country. We are ready to consider \namendments; we simply don't want to see the bill destroyed through \npartisan ploys.\n  Mr. President, seeing no other Senators present, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I would inquire as to what the pending \nbusiness is before the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. S. 2248, the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Amendments Act.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Chair, and I rise to support the managers' \namendment on this piece of legislation as proposed by Chairman \nRockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond. This is the result of a bipartisan \ndiscussion which included the Office of Director of National \nIntelligence and the Department of Justice. I commend Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Bond on drafting this complicated yet critical \npiece of legislation.\n  The Senate has had a healthy debate while considering the Judiciary \nCommittee's substitute amendment. I was pleased to see a majority of \nthe Senate reject that bill, and I hope the Senate can now move past \nthat flawed bill rather than offering a number of amendments which \ncontain fragments of it. There is no benefit to rehashing the same \npoints in the Senate bill that was just handily tabled versus the \nRockefeller-Bond compromise piece of legislation that came out of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee.\n  The Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Agency, \nand the Department of Justice have stated their opposition to a number \nof proposed amendments which were part of the failed Judiciary \nCommittee's substitute. The DNI has made it clear he would recommend to \nthe President that he veto this legislation if it does not contain \nimmunity for communication carriers, and rightly so. Some Members \noffered amendments to strike title II from the managers' amendment or \nto substitute the Government as the defendant in these lawsuits.\n  But substitution will not give the carriers protection, nor will it \nprotect our national security. The plaintiffs can still seek documents \nand other evidence from them through the discovery process at trial. \nThis risks exposing our intelligence sources and methods, and there is \nsimply no doubt about that fact.\n  The Government can assert the states secrets privilege, but the \nongoing litigation has shown that courts reject this theory. Even the \nFISA Court, which operates in secret and handles classified \ninformation, is not suited to handle these cases. The FISA Court \nprimarily reviews ex parte requests and was not meant to hear regular \ntrials.\n\n[[Page S310]]\n\nThe members of the FISA Court are sitting district court judges and \nhave their own full dockets.\n  The risk of unnecessarily exposing some of our most sensitive \ncollection if litigation continues is too great. The best remedy is to \nprovide immunity to the telecommunication providers as the managers' \namendment does. Other amendments propose unnecessary additions to \nprovisions already included in the managers' amendment. For example, \nthe managers' amendment contains a 6-year sunset and an exclusivity \nprovision. Yet amendments have been offered to make this legislation \nexpire in 2 years or 4 years.\n  Additionally, an amendment has been offered to state that absent some \nother expressed order from Congress, FISA and title XVIII are the \nexclusive means to conduct electronic surveillance. This would require \nCongress to pass a law authorizing the President to conduct electronic \nsurveillance after an attack on our country.\n  What if Congress were not able to meet, let alone agree on language \nauthorizing electronic surveillance after an attack on our country? \nThis amendment ignores longstanding debate regarding article I and \narticle II powers, a debate the courts have dodged time and again. I \nsupport the bipartisan language in the managers' amendment which \nmaintains the status quo of this important constitutional question.\n  Finally, an amendment has been offered requiring an audit of the \nterrorist surveillance program. As I stated earlier in comments \nyesterday, the Intelligence Committee has conducted a thorough review \nof this program over many months, which included testimony, extensive \ndocument reviews, and even trips out to our intelligence agencies to \nwitness how this program is operated.\n  I understand that sometimes partisanship impedes action in Congress. \nBut I do not recall when some of my colleagues have had such little \nfaith in the bipartisan findings and conclusions of a committee in this \nbody.\n  This amendment disregards the committee's finding and asks for yet \nanother retrospective review of this program. This is not only \nduplicative, but it is unnecessary. The Protect America Act expires a \nweek from today; the threat from al-Qaida will not expire a week from \ntoday.\n  It is now time for Congress to act and to fix FISA so our \nintelligence community has the tools it needs to do its job in a very \nprofessional manner and gather information necessary to protect our \nnational security.\n  Protecting our national security is in the interest of all Americans, \nand Congress should seek to ensure that our Nation is protected fully. \nThe members of the intelligence community say the managers' amendment \ncontains many tools they need to protect our country. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the managers' amendment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/25/senate-section/article/S310-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I had earlier this morning intended to spend \na few minutes talking about the stimulus package that was at least \nagreed to between the leadership of the other body and the \nadministration, a matter that will be coming here and the Senate will \nhave an opportunity to express its will on that matter.\n  But I wanted to speak on it for a moment, at least as Chairman of the \nSenate Banking Committee that will have at least a small part of that \ndiscussion, because of the inclusion of the FHA proposals as well as \nthe loan limits within the GSEs, which I commend the administration for \nincluding. These are critical elements.\n  We must, of course, deal with people's problems. But is something \nelse again to deal with the problems that have caused people's \nproblems. In my view, the deeper problem is the foreclosure crisis. \nThat is the underlying issue, in my view, and therefore to have dealt \nwith a short-term stimulus package that did not include some measures \nand steps that would address the housing issue and the foreclosure \nissue would have been shortsighted. So I was pleased to see that in \naddition with some rebates and refundable tax assistance, even to those \nwho have very limited incomes, as well as assistance to those with \nyoung children and families. All are wonderful ideas.\n  I know Senator Baucus, who will have the bulk of the responsibility \nin the Finance Committee for dealing with this, along with others who \nwant to add elements of dealing with such things as unemployment \ninsurance or food stamps or low-income energy assistance and the like, \nwill have some additional thoughts on this short-term package. But I \nfelt it was important to express some optimism about the direction it \nis going in and to note how important it is for consumers and investors \nto begin to have their confidence restored.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/25/senate-section/article/S310-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S310-S317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FISA\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this morning to continue the debate \nand discussion on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Let me \nunderscore the point that Majority Leader Reid and others have made. I \nlistened carefully to the comments of Senator McConnell, the \ndistinguished Republican leader.\n\n  I have served in this body for more than a quarter of a century now, \nand it is unfortunate that we seem to have come to a point where not as \nmuch is happening as should be happening, in my view.\n  I brought committee products to the floor on many occasions, and I am \nsort of envious of the remarks of the Senator from Kentucky--because as \na committee chairman, I love nothing more than to bring a product out \nof my committee. Many times I brought them out with unanimous votes, \nonly to have to spend days here on the floor as amendment after \namendment was being offered to change, in some cases dramatically, the \nsubstance of our bill, which we had worked on for weeks and months and \nyears in some cases.\n  So it is a new idea here to just accept committee product and say the \nother 90 or 85 Members should respect the work of our colleagues, and \nacknowledge that and pass the legislation as if we had all had some \ninput here. That is unique and, I suppose, an idea that most of us \nwould like to embrace at one point or another. But this is the Senate. \nThis is not an operation that runs by fiat.\n  This institution has an historic responsibility. In this institution, \nevery single Member has the opportunity to express themselves, not only \nrhetorically for unlimited amounts of time, but also with the ability \nto contribute to the policy products we frame. To suggest that other \nMembers, including members of a committee that had commensurate \njurisdiction, the Judiciary Committee, ought to be excluded from adding \ntheir thoughts and ideas, is ridiculous. Even members of both \nCommittees, Judiciary and Intelligence, are excluded, such as Senator \nFeingold. It was his amendment, as a member of both of these \ncommittees, that the Republican leadership would not even consider \ndebating or acknowledging with a vote. So that is unique in any regard. \nAnyone who has observed this institution for more than an hour--or \nless--understands how this works.\n  So the idea that we should accept this bill because the President \nwill sign it, is nice to hear, but I have been around long enough to \nknow that Presidents will sign things they did not think they would in \ntime, and particularly if we can add some thoughts that Members have.\n  I do not want to dwell on the procedural aspects of all of this, but \nI wanted to underscore the point that Senator Reid, our leader, the \nmajority leader, made this morning, on the unique idea that Members who \nhave substantive ideas and thoughts and amendments should somehow stick \nthem back in their pockets, accept the product of the Intelligence \nCommittee and go home, because the President will sign that bill. I \nwill be anxious to raise the argument in future dates when I bring a \nbill to the floor and I find that the Republican leadership is going to \noffer some amendments to my\n\n[[Page S311]]\n\nideas, reminding them of their eloquence in suggesting a different \napproach to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  Last night, we saw into the heart of the minority's priorities. Since \nlast month, day after day, opponents of retroactive immunity have been \nwarning about its underlying motive: shutting up the President's \ncritics. Pass immunity, we have said, and the debate will be shut down, \nthe critics will be shut up, and the actions of the President's favored \ncorporations will be shut in the dark for good.\n  Last night, we saw the mindset of the minority. Several of my \nDemocratic colleagues have brought to the floor their carefully \nprepared amendments, many of which do their part to right the balance \nbetween security and civil liberties.\n  The Cardin amendment, which would allow us to revisit the bill in 4 \nyears instead of 6, not exactly a frightening proposal. It would be a \nsimple debate; we could decide if he's right or wrong--make your case \neither way. I happen to believe he is right. Amendments from Senator \nFeingold prohibiting the dangerous and possibly unconstitutional \npractice of reverse targeting and bulk collection. The Leahy amendment, \nrequiring the inspectors general of the Director of National \nIntelligence and the Department of Justice and the National Security \nAgency to investigate possible illegal domestic spying. The Feinstein-\nNelson amendment allowing the FISA Court to determine whether immunity \nshould apply to the telecommunications companies; and several more \namendments as well.\n  These are all very serious amendments. The Presiding Officer himself \nhas one of these amendments. Some of them I support, others I would \nprobably end up opposing. Nonetheless, I acknowledge the seriousness of \ntheir proposals.\n  I am concerned, however, about amendments that expand the authority \nof the FISA Court beyond what Congress intended when it originally \npassed FISA. While I respect the motives behind such proposals, \nCongress needs time to fully consider their implications.\n  Further, I am concerned that such proposals put excessive power in \nthe hands of a secret court whose members are all appointed by one \nindividual. In other words, I am concerned this is yet another \nconcentration of power, the implications of which we don't fully \nunderstand and ought to consider carefully. Yes, secrecy is necessary \nat times in the life of every nation. But it is a bedrock principle \nthat democracy should always err on the side of less secrecy. For that \nreason I believe cases against the telecoms are best handled in our \nstandard Federal courts--which, by the way, have shown time and time \nagain that they know how to protect State secrets.\n  None of that is the real issue this morning. Whether you agree with \nany of these proposals or not, each amendment deserves consideration. \nSenators are not entitled to see their amendments agreed to, but they \nare entitled to this: a good-faith debate, honest criticism, and, \nultimately, a vote on their ideas. Last evening, they didn't get that. \nOur Republican colleagues, assuming they would lose those votes, \neffectively shut down the work of the United States Senate. In the \nwords of the cliche, they have taken their ball and run home.\n  I don't think that is far off base, in seeing in this egregious \nshutdown a parallel to retroactive immunity itself. Both attitudes \nprivilege power over deliberation, over consensus, over honest \nargument. Like immunity, pulling these amendments down shows a contempt \nfor honest debate and a willingness to settle issues in the dark, in \nthe back rooms, rather than in the open, where the law lives, where the \nAmerican people can see it.\n  President Bush wants to shut down the courts whose rulings he doesn't \nlike. Last night, Senate Republicans showed when they don't like the \noutcome of a debate, they shut down that as well. It is one thing for a \nPresident to express that kind of contempt for the process of \nlegislation. It is yet another for the coequal Members of this \nlegislative branch to express it themselves.\n  I have spoken repeatedly about the rule of law. The rule of law is \nnot some abstract idea. It is here with us. It is what makes this body \nrun and has for more than two centuries. It means we hear each other \nout. We do it in the open. And while the minority gets its voice, its \nright to strenuously object, the majority ultimately rules. Standing \nfor the rule of law anywhere means standing for it everywhere--in our \ncourts and in the Senate.\n  The circumstances are different, of course, but the heart of the \nmatter is the same. Last evening, I believe the Republican Party \nforfeited its claim to good faith on this issue. They are left to stake \ntheir case on fear. Whether that be enough, the next few days will \ntell.\n  But I want to talk about the issue of the underlying bill, the \nsubstance of it. As my colleagues here know, I care deeply and \npassionately about several aspects of this bill. Again, I have great \nrespect for the work it takes to strike the balance between the need \nfor have surveillance of those terrorists who would do us great harm, \nand the protection of civil liberties, rights, and the rule of law. It \nis not an easy balance. I will be the first to acknowledge that the \ntension between those two goals has been an ongoing tension since the \nfounding of this Republic. It is not just new since 9/11. It goes back \nto the very first days of our Republic.\n  In fact, James Madison spoke eloquently about the tensions in civil \nliberties and rights and, with a great deal of prescience, recognized \nthat it is usually threats from outside our country that have the most \ninfluence on endangering the rights and liberties we embrace at home. \nHe acknowledged that more than two centuries ago.\n  So the debate we are engaged in today is a historic one, historic in \nthe sense that it has been ongoing. No Member of this Chamber wants to \nsacrifice the security of our country, and my hope is that no Member of \nthis body wants to sacrifice our liberties and rights either. I want to \nbelieve that very deeply. While we are debating how best to do that, my \nfear is that we are about to adopt legislation that will deviate from a \n30-year history of actually achieving that sense of balance, by and \nlarge with the almost unanimous support of Members who have served here \nduring that 30-year period.\n\n  I spoke yesterday about a crime that may have been committed against \nmillions of innocent Americans: their phone calls, their faxes, their \ne-mails, every word listened to, copied down by Government bureaucrats \ninto a massive database. I spoke about how our largest \ntelecommunications companies leapt at the chance to betray the privacy \nand the trust of their own customers. That spying didn't happen in a \npanic or short-term emergency, not for a week, a month, or even a year. \nIt went on relentlessly for more than 5 years. If the press had not \nexposed it, it would be going on at this very hour. This was not a \nquestion where a program started up and someone realized they had done \nsomething wrong, shut it down, and we discovered it later. This program \nhas been ongoing and would have been ongoing arguably for years had the \nNew York Times and a whistleblower not stepped forward to acknowledge \nits existence.\n  We saw how President Bush responded when this was exposed--not by \napologizing, not even by making his best case before our courts, but by \nasking for a congressional coverup: retroactive immunity. He asked us \nto do it on trust. There are classified documents, he says, that prove \nhis case beyond a shadow of a doubt, but, of course, we are not allowed \nto see them. I have served in this body for 27 years, and I am not \nallowed to see these documents! Neither are the majority of my \ncolleagues.\n  And when we resist his urge to be a law unto himself, how does he \nrespond? With fear. When we question him, he says we are failing to \nkeep the American people safe.\n  Shame on the President and shame on these scare tactics.\n  I have promised to fight those tactics with all the power any one \nSenator can muster, and I am here today to keep that promise. For \nseveral months I have listened to the building frustration over this \nimmunity and this administration's campaign of lawlessness. I have seen \nit in person, in mail, online--the passion, the eloquence of average \ncitizens who are just fed up with day after day, week after week,\n\n[[Page S312]]\n\nmonth after month, year after year of this administration, in one case \nafter another, trampling all over the basic rights of American \ncitizens. They have inspired me more than they know, these citizens who \nhave spoken up.\n  But almost every time telecom immunity comes up, there is the \ninevitable question: What is the big deal? Why are so many people \nspending so much energy to keep a few lawsuits from going forward?\n  Because this is about far more than the telecom industry. This is \nabout a choice that will define America--the rule of law or the rule of \nmen. It is about this Government's practice of waterboarding, a \ntechnique invented by the Spanish Inquisition, perfected by the Khmer \nRouge, and in between banned--originally banned for excessive cruelty \neven by the Gestapo.\n  It is about the Military Commissions Act, a bill that gave President \nBush the power to designate any individual he wants as an unlawful \nenemy combatant, hold him indefinitely, and take away that individual's \nright to habeas corpus, the centuries-old right to challenge your \ndetention.\n  It is about the CIA destroying evidence of harsh interrogation--or, \nas some would call it, torture.\n  It is about the Vice President raising secrecy to an art form.\n  The members of his energy task force? None of your business, we are \ntold.\n  His location? Undisclosed.\n  The names of his staff? Confidential.\n  The visitor log for his office? Shredded by the Secret Service.\n  The list of papers he has declassified? Classified.\n  It is about the Justice Department turning our Nation's highest law \nenforcement offices into a patronage plum and turning the impartial \nwork of indictments and trials into the machinations of politics.\n  It is about Alberto Gonzales coming before Congress to give testimony \nthat was at best wrong and at worst perjury.\n  It is about Michael Mukasey coming before the Senate and defending \nthe President's power to break the law.\n  It is about extraordinary renditions and secret prisons.\n  It is about Maher Arar, the Canadian computer programmer who was \narrested by American agents, flown to Syria, held for some 300 days in \na cell 3 feet wide, and then cleared of all wrongdoing.\n  It is about all of that. We are deceiving ourselves when we talk \nabout the torture issue or habeas issue or the U.S. attorneys issue or \nthe extraordinary rendition issue or the secrecy issue. As if each one \nwere an isolated case! As if each one were an accident! We have let \noutrage upon outrage upon outrage slide with nothing more than a \npromise to stop the next one.\n  There is only one issue here--only one--the law issue. Attack the \nPresident's contempt for the law at any point, and it will be wounded \nat all points. That is why I am here today. I am speaking for the \nAmerican people's right to know what the President and the telecoms did \nto them. But more than that, I am speaking against the President's \nconviction that he is the law. Strike it at any point, with courage, \nand it will wither.\n  That is the big deal. That is why immunity matters--dangerous in \nitself but even worse in all it represents. No more. No more. This far, \nMr. President, but no further.\n  More and more Americans are rejecting the false choice that has come \nto define this administration: security or liberty but never, ever \nboth. It speaks volumes about the President's estimation of the \nAmerican people that he expects them to accept that choice.\n  The truth, I would say, is that shielding corporations from lawsuits \ndoes absolutely nothing for our security. I challenge the President to \nprove otherwise. I challenge him to show us how putting these companies \nabove the law makes us safer by one iota. That, I am convinced, he \ncannot do.\n  The truth is that a working balance between security and liberty has \nalready been struck. It has been settled for decades. For three \ndecades, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has prevented \nexecutive lawbreaking and protected Americans, and that balance stands \ntoday. In the wake of the Watergate scandal, the Senate convened the \nChurch Committee, a panel of distinguished Members, Republicans and \nDemocrats, determined to investigate executive abuses of power. \nUnsurprisingly, they found that when Congress and the courts substitute \n``trust me'' for real and true oversight, massive law breaking can \nresult. They found evidence of U.S. Army spying on the civilian \npopulation, Federal dossiers on citizens' political activities, a CIA \nand FBI program that opened hundreds of thousands of Americans' letters \nwithout warning or warrant.\n  In sum, Americans had sustained a severe blow to their fourth \namendment right to be ``secure in their persons, houses, papers, and \neffects against unreasonable searches and seizures.'' But at the same \ntime, the Senators of the Church Committee understood that surveillance \nneeded to go forward to protect the American people. Surveillance \nitself is not the problem: unchecked, unregulated, unwarranted \nsurveillance was. What surveillance needed, in a word, was legitimacy. \nIn America, as the Founders understood, power becomes legitimate when \nit is shared; when Congress and the courts check the attitude which so \noften crops up in the executive branch: If the President does it, it is \nnot illegal.\n  The Church Committee's final report, ``Intelligence Activities and \nthe Rights of Americans,'' puts the case powerfully. Let me quote, if I \ncan, from that report. The Church Committee--Republicans and \nDemocrats--said:\n\n       The critical question before the Committee was to determine \n     how the fundamental liberties of the people can be maintained \n     in the course of the Government's effort to protect their \n     security. The delicate balance between these basic goals of \n     our system of government is often difficult to strike, but it \n     can, and must, be achieved.\n       We reject the view that the traditional American principles \n     of justice and fair play have no place in our struggle \n     against the enemies of freedom. Moreover, our investigation \n     has established that the targets of intelligence activity \n     have ranged far beyond persons who could properly be \n     characterized as enemies of freedom. . . .\n\n  The report further states:\n\n       We have seen segments of our Government, in their attitudes \n     and action, adopt tactics unworthy of a democracy, and \n     occasionally reminiscent of the tactics of totalitarian \n     regimes.\n       We have seen a consistent pattern in which programs \n     initiated with limited goals, such as preventing criminal \n     violence or identifying foreign spies, were expanded to what \n     witnesses characterized as ``vacuum cleaners,'' sweeping in \n     information about lawful activities of American citizens.\n\n  The Senators concluded:\n\n       Unless new and tighter controls are established by \n     legislation, domestic intelligence activities threaten to \n     undermine our democratic society and fundamentally alter its \n     nature.\n\n  That report is more than 30 years old. But couldn't those words have \nbeen written this morning? We share so much with the Senators--\nRepublicans and Democrats--who wrote them. We share a nation under \ngrave threat--in their case, from communism and nuclear annihilation; \nin ours, from international terrorism. We share, as well, the threat of \na domestic spying regime that, however good its intentions, finally \nwent too far.\n  Senators in my lifetime have already faced this problem, and I \nbelieve their solution stands: The power to invade privacy must be used \nsparingly, guarded jealously, and shared equally between all three \nbranches--all three branches of Government.\n  Three decades ago, Congress embodied that solution in the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. FISA confirmed the President's \npower to conduct surveillance of international conversations involving \nanyone in the United States, provided that the Federal FISA Court \nissued a warrant, ensuring that wiretapping was aimed at safeguarding \nour security, and nothing else.\n  The President's own Director of National Intelligence, Mike \nMcConnell, explained the rationale in an interview this summer: The \nUnited States, he said: ``did not want to allow [the intelligence \ncommunity] to conduct . . . electronic surveillance of Americans for \nforeign intelligence unless you had a warrant, so that was required.''\n  As originally written in 1978, and as amended many times over the \nlast three decades, FISA has accomplished its mission. It has been a \nvaluable tool--a tremendously valuable tool--for conducting \nsurveillance of terrorists and those who would harm our country.\n\n[[Page S313]]\n\n  Every time Presidents have come to Congress openly to ask for more \nleeway under FISA, Congress has worked with them; Democrats and \nRepublicans have negotiated; and together, Congress and the President \nhave struck a balance that safeguards America while doing its utmost to \nprotect privacy.\n  This summer, Congress made a technical correction to FISA, enabling \nthe President to wiretap, without a warrant, conversations between two \nforeign agents, even if those conversations are routed through American \ncomputers. For other reasons, I felt this summer's legislation went a \nbit too far, and I opposed it. But the point is that Congress once \nagain proved its willingness to work with the President on FISA.\n  Shouldn't that be enough?\n  Just this past October and November, as we have seen, the Senate \nIntelligence and Judiciary Committees worked with the President to \nfurther refine FISA and ensure that, in a true emergency, the FISA \nCourt could do nothing to slow down intelligence gathering.\n  Shouldn't that be enough?\n  And as for the FISA Court? Between 1978 and 2004, according to the \nWashington Post, the FISA Court approved 18,748 warrants--18,748 \nwarrants. It rejected five, between 1978 and 2004. Let me repeat the \nnumbers. They granted 18,748 warrants, and rejected 5 of them over that \nalmost 30-year period.\n  The FISA Court has sided with the executive 99.9 percent of the time.\n  Shouldn't that be enough? One would think so. Is anything lacking? \nHave we forgotten something? Isn't all of this enough to keep us safe?\n  It took three decades, three branches of government, four Presidents, \nand 12 Congresses to patiently, painstakingly build up that machinery. \nIt only took one President to tear it down. Generations of leaders \nhanded over to President Bush a system that brought security under the \nlaw, a system primed to bless nearly any eavesdropping he could \npossibly conceive or think of. And he responded: No, thank you; I'd \nrather break the law.\n  He ignored not just a Federal court but a secret Federal court; not \njust a secret Federal court but a secret Federal court prepared to sign \noff on his actions 99.9 percent of the time. And he still has not given \nus a good reason why. He still has not shown how his lawbreaking makes \nus safer.\n  So I am left to conclude that, to this President, this is not about \nsecurity. It is about power: power in itself, power for itself.\n  I make that point not to change the subject, but because I believe it \nsolves a mystery. That is: Why is retroactive immunity so vital to this \nPresident? The answer, I believe, is that immunity means secrecy; and \nsecrecy, to this administration, means power.\n  It is no coincidence that the man who declared ``if the president \ndoes it, it's not illegal''--Richard Nixon--was the same man who raised \nexecutive secrecy to an art form in an earlier generation. The Senators \nof the Church Committee expressed succinctly the deep flaw in the \nNixonian executive. I quote from them: ``Abuse thrives on secrecy.'' \nAnd in the exhaustive catalog of their report, they proved it.\n  This administration shares a similar level of secrecy, and a similar \nlevel of abuse, I would add. Its push for immunity is no different. \nSecrecy is at its center. We find proof in their original version of \nretroactive immunity. Remember, this was their idea: a proposal not \njust to protect the telecoms but everyone involved in the wiretapping \nprogram. That is what they sought of the Intelligence Committee. \nEveryone involved in that program was to be protected. In their \noriginal proposal, that is, they wanted to immunize themselves.\n  Think about that. It speaks to their fear and, perhaps, their guilt: \ntheir guilt that they had broken the law, and their fear that in the \nyears to come they would be found liable or convicted. They knew better \nthan anyone else what they had done. They must have had good reason to \nbe afraid.\n  Thankfully, immunity for the Executive is not part of the bill before \nus. But the original proposal--the original proposal--to immunize \neveryone involved ought to be instructive to Members here. Why did they \nseek such broad authority to immunize every individual? Why? What was \nbehind that proposal? This is, and always has been, a self-preservation \nbill.\n  Otherwise, why not have the trial to get it over with? If the \nPresident believes what he says, the corporations would win in a walk. \nAfter all, in the administration's telling, the telecoms were ordered \nto help the President spy without a warrant, and they patriotically \ncomplied.\n  Read Justice Robert Jackson's briefs after Nuremberg. The 21 \ndefendants at Nuremberg made that case, that they were only complying \nwith orders they were given. And the court in the Nuremberg trials, in \n1945, rejected that argument. Robert Jackson reminded us, in subsequent \ndecisions he handed down as a Supreme Court Justice, that that \nargument, ``we were ordered to do it,'' is not a legitimate defense \nwhen you know what you are doing is wrong.\n  And when you hear the President's story, ignore for a moment that in \nAmerica we obey the laws, not the President's orders. Ignore that the \ntelecoms were not unanimous; one, Qwest, wanted to see the legal basis \nfor the order. They never received it, of course, and so they refused \nto comply. Ignore that a judge presiding over the case ruled that--and \nI quote--``AT cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in \nits position could have believed that the alleged domestic dragnet was \nlegal.''\n  Ignore all of that. If the order the telecoms received was legally \nbinding, they have an easy case to prove. The corporations only need to \nshow a judge the authority and the assurances they were given, and they \nwill be in and out of court in five minutes.\n  If the telecoms are as defensible as the President says, why doesn't \nthe President let them defend themselves? If the case is so easy to \nmake, why doesn't he let them make it?\n  It can't be that he is afraid of leaks. The Federal court system has \ndealt for decades with the most delicate national security matters, \nbuilding up expertise in protecting classified information behind \nclosed doors--ex parte, in camera. We can expect no less in these \ncases, as well.\n  No intelligence sources need to be compromised. No state secrets need \nto be exposed. And after litigation at both the district court and \ncircuit court level, no state secrets have been exposed.\n  In fact, Federal District Court Judge Vaughan Walker, a Republican \nappointee, I might add, has already ruled that the issue can go to \ntrial without putting state secrets in jeopardy. Judge Walker \nreasonably pointed out that the existence of the President's \nsurveillance program is hardly a secret at all. I quote from him. He \nstated:\n\n       The government has [already] disclosed the general contours \n     of the ``terrorist surveillance program,'' which requires the \n     assistance of a telecommunications provider.\n\n  That is from Judge Walker. In his opinion, Judge Walker argued that \neven when it is reasonably grounded:\n\n     the state secrets privilege [still] has its limits. While the \n     court recognizes and respects the executive's constitutional \n     duty to protect the nation from threats, the court also takes \n     seriously its constitutional duty to adjudicate the disputes \n     that come before it. To defer to a blanket assertion of \n     secrecy here would be to abdicate that duty, particularly \n     because the very subject matter of this litigation has been \n     so publicly aired.\n\n  That is Republican appointee Vaughan Walker speaking to the \nadministration. He further goes on to say:\n\n       The compromise between liberty and security remains a \n     difficult one. But dismissing this case at the outset would \n     sacrifice liberty for no apparent enhancement of security.\n\n  That ought to be the epitaph of this administration: sacrificing \nliberty for no apparent enhancement of security. Worse than selling our \nsoul, we are giving it away for free.\n  The President is equally wrong, I would suggest, to claim that \nfailing to grant this retroactive immunity will make the telecoms less \nlikely to cooperate with surveillance in the future. The truth is that \nsince the 1970s, FISA has compelled telecommunications companies to \ncooperate with surveillance when it is warranted. And what is more, it \nimmunizes them. It has done that for more than 25 years.\n  So cooperation in warranted wiretapping is not at stake today. \nCollusion in warrantless wiretapping is. And the warrant makes all the \ndifference,\n\n[[Page S314]]\n\nbecause it is precisely the court's blessing that brings Presidential \npower under the rule of law.\n  In sum, we know that giving the telecoms their day in court--giving \nthe American people their day in court--would not jeopardize an ounce \nof our security. The conclusion, I again repeat, is clear: The only \nthing that stands to be exposed if these cases go to trial is the \nextent of the President's lawbreaking, of the administration's \nlawbreaking. That, he will keep from the light of a courtroom at all \ncosts.\n  This is a self-preservation bill. And given the lack of compelling \nalternatives, I can only conclude that self-preservation--secrecy for \nsecrecy's sake--explains the President's vehemence.\n  Well, you might say, he will be gone in a year. Why not let the \nsecrets die with this administration and start afresh? Why take up all \nthe time on this matter?\n  Because those secrets never rightfully belonged to him. They belong \nto history, to our successors in this Chamber, to every one of us. \nThirty years after the Church Committee, history repeated itself. If \nthose who come after us are to prevent it from repeating again, they \nneed the full truth. We need to set an unmistakable precedent. \nDetermining guilt or innocence belongs to the courts, not to 51 \nSenators who may carry the day by a vote here, or the President, for \nthat matter--that is what the courts are for. Lawless spying will no \nlonger be tolerated. And, most of all, the truth is no one's private \nproperty.\n  Which brings us, unfortunately, to economics. Because once the \narguments from state secrets and patriotic duty are exhausted, \nimmunity's defenders make their last stand as amateur economists.\n  Here is how Mike McConnell put it:\n\n       If you play out the suits at the value they're claimed, it \n     would bankrupt these companies. So . . . we have to provide \n     liability protection to these private sector entities.\n\n  To begin with, that is a clear exaggeration. We are talking about \nsome of the wealthiest, most successful companies in America. Let me \nquote an article from Dow Jones MarketWatch. The headline reads: \n``AT's third-quarter profit rises 41.5 percent.'' I will quote the \narticle:\n\n       AT, Inc. on Tuesday said third-quarter earnings rose 41.5 \n     percent, boosted by the acquisition of BellSouth and the \n     addition of 2 million net wireless customers. . . . Net \n     income totaled $3.6 billion . . . compared with $2.17 . . . a \n     year ago.\n\n  I should note that AT has posted these record profits at the same \ntime of this very public litigation.\n  Now, granted, that is only one quarter, and I understand that AT's \nmost recent earnings aren't as large as the ones I have just quoted; \nbut I think the point still stands. A company of that size, capable of \nposting a $3 billion quarter, couldn't be completely wiped out by \nanything but the most exorbitant and unlikely judgment.\n  To assume that the telecoms would lose and that their judges would \nhand down such backbreaking penalties is already taking several leaps. \nThe point, after all, has never been to financially cripple our \ntelecommunications industry; the point is to bring checks and balances \nback to domestic spying. Setting that precedent would hardly require a \ncrippling judgment.\n  It is much more troubling, though, that the Director of National \nIntelligence has begun talking like a stockbroker, pronouncing on \n``liability protection for private sector entities.'' How does that \neven begin to be relevant to letting the case go forward? Since when \ndid we throw out entire lawsuits because the defendant stood to lose \ntoo much?\n  Translate the point into plain English, and here is what Admiral \nMcConnell is arguing: Some corporations are too rich to be sued. Even \nbringing money into the equation puts wealth above justice, above due \nprocess. I have rarely in public life heard an argument as venal as \nthis one.\n  But this administration would apparently rather protect the telecoms \nthan the American people. In one breath, it can speak about national \nsecurity and bottom lines. Approve immunity, and Congress will state \nclearly: The richer you are, the more successful you are, the more \nlawless you are entitled to be. A suit against you is a danger to the \nRepublic. So at the rock bottom of its justifications, the \nadministration is essentially arguing that immunity can be bought.\n  The truth is exactly the opposite, in my view. The larger the \ncorporation, the greater potential for abuse. Not that success should \nmake a company suspect at all. Companies grow large and essential to \nour economy because they are excellent at what they do. I simply mean \nthat size and wealth open the realm of possibilities for abuse far \nbeyond the scope of the individual. After all, if everything alleged is \ntrue, the President and the telecoms have engineered one of the most \nmassive violations of privacy in American history. A violation such as \nthat would be inconceivable without the size and resources of a \ncorporate behemoth behind it.\n  If reasonable search and seizure means opening up a drug dealer's \napartment, the telecoms' alleged actions would be the equivalent of \nstrip-searching everyone in the building, ransacking their bedrooms, \nand prying up all the floorboards. That is the massive scale we are \ntalking about, and that massive scale is precisely why no corporation \nmust be above the law.\n  Ultimately, that is all I am asking--not a verdict of guilty or \ninnocent. I have my own views, but I don't have a right to pronounce \nthose views. That is why there is something called the third branch of \nGovernment. It is called the courts--the courts. A simple majority of \nthis body doesn't get the right to decide the guilt or innocence in \nthis particular case. But when the day in court comes, I have \nabsolutely no investment in the verdict either way. Just as it would be \nabsurd for me to declare the telecoms clearly guilty, it would be \nequally absurd to close the case today without a decision. But their \nday in court, as far as I am concerned, is everything.\n  Why? Because surveillance demands and deserves legitimacy, and the \nsurest way to throw legitimacy away is to leave all of these questions \nhanging.\n  Few things are as vital to our national security as giving domestic \nsurveillance the legitimacy it deserves and needs to sustain public \nsupport. Because ``the threat to America is not going to expire.'' \n``Staying a step ahead of the terrorists who want to attack us'' is \n``essential to keeping America safe.'' In the end, ``Congress and the \nPresident have no higher responsibility than protecting the American \npeople from enemies who attacked our country and who want to do it \nagain.''\n  Those aren't my words; they are George Bush's words. He says all of \nthis, yet he says he will veto the entire bill--this vital bill, this \nbill which is essential to protecting our very lives--all to keep a few \ncorporations safe from lawsuits.\n  There, at last, as honest as you will ever hear them, are this \nPresident's true priorities: secrecy over safety, favors over fairness. \nMarry those priorities to a contempt for the rule of law, and the \nresults have been devastating. I don't have to repeat them. They aren't \nsecret anymore.\n  No, Mr. President we can't go back. We can't un-pass the Military \nCommissions Act. We can't un-destroy the CIA's interrogation tapes. We \ncan't un-speak Alberto Gonzales's disgraceful testimony. We can't un-\ntorture those who have been apprehended and held wrongfully. We can't \nundo all this administration has done in the last 6 years for the cause \nof lawlessness and fear.\n  But we can do this: We can vote down this immunity. We can do this: \nWe can grab hold of the one thread left to us here and pull until the \nwhole garment unravels. We can start here.\n  And why not here? Why not today?\n  Why not provide for the protections we need, the surveillance we \nneed, but without this grant of immunity? It is unwarranted, it is \nunneeded, it is unfair, it is wrong, and it is dangerous.\n  So, on Monday, I hope my colleagues will reject the motion on \ncloture, allow these amendments to go forward, allow us to have a \ndebate and a discussion, and then send a clean bill to the President--\none that enhances our security and protects our civil liberties.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that when I finish with my \nremarks, the Senator from Texas be recognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Republican Retreat\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from \nConnecticut, welcome back. We are glad to have him here. He has \ntraveled some roads that I know pretty well. We have missed some of his \nvigor and passion.\n  Sometimes the American people say they don't like to see us engage in \npartisan bickering, and I am going to say something about that in just \na minute. But what I think they do like to see us do, if I may say so, \nis what the Senator from Connecticut was doing just then and what the \nSenator from Arizona did on Friday: They were debating the balance of \neach American individual's right to liberty versus each American \nindividual's right to security--coming to different conclusions but \nhaving a serious discussion about an issue that affects every single \nAmerican in this country. That is what the people expect of the Senate.\n  I come to a different conclusion than he does. We are moving to vote \non cloture on a bill on Monday that has come out of the Intelligence \nCommittee by a bipartisan majority of 13 to 2. But this is the kind of \ndebate the Senate ought to have, and I am glad I got to hear his speech \neven though I disagree with much of it.\n  The Republican Senators gathered in a retreat at the Library of \nCongress on Wednesday. This is something we do each year, and the \nDemocratic side does it each year as well. We think about our \nresponsibilities, and we look forward to the future. Many of our \nMembers have said to me that this was one of our best days of retreat. \nIn the first place, it was very well attended: 44 out of 49 of us were \nthere, and 3 of those absent were campaigning in Florida, and 1 was \nill. So we had virtually perfect attendance. Most of those attending \nspoke and participated and made proposals. Every single Republican \nSenator with whom I have talked since that meeting on Wednesday has \ntold me he or she felt rejuvenated and looks forward to this year. I \nbelieve the reason for that is because of the way we conducted the day.\n  It takes me back to what I just said a moment ago. Unless we are \ntone-deaf, I think we can hear what the American people are saying to \nus, especially through the Presidential campaign, which is that they \nare tired of the way we are doing business in Washington, DC, and they \nwant us to change it. They want us to take the playpen politics and \nmove it off the Senate floor and put it in the national committees or \nin the nursery where it belongs, and spend our time on big issues that \naffect our country--maybe in vigorous debates of the kind Senator Dodd \nand Senator Kyl would have on the intelligence bill, but spend our time \non the serious issues facing our country. Then, after we have had our \ndebate, work across the aisle to get a result.\n  There are only two reasons to work across the aisle to get a result. \nOne is, it is the right thing to do for our country. This is our job, \nand that is why they pay us our salaries. That is why they sent us \nhere. No. 2, if you can count, it takes 60 votes to get anything \nmeaningful done in the Senate. So if you want to get a result, you have \nto work across party lines because neither side has more than 60 votes.\n  So what we Republicans did on Wednesday was say this: We have heard \nthe talk that this is a Presidential year and we may get nothing done \nin Congress, and we reject that.\n  Our leader said--Mitch McConnell--on Tuesday when he spoke:\n\n       Republicans are eager to get to work on the unfinished \n     business from last year. We are determined to address the \n     other issues that have become more pressing or pronounced \n     since we last stood here. We have had a presidential election \n     in this country every 4 years since 1788 we won't use this \n     one as an excuse to put off the people's business for another \n     day.\n\n  So there is no excuse for Congress to take this year off, given the \nserious issues facing our country. We want to change the way Washington \ndoes business, and we know how to do it; that is, get down to work on \nserious issues facing our country, propose specific solutions that \nsolve problems, and then work across the aisle to get a result. We are \nnot here to do bad things to Democrats; we are here to try to do good \nthings for our country.\n  That was the spirit of our retreat on Wednesday. I believe that is \nthe way most Members on the other side feel. The more of that we do, \nthe better. I would submit the approval rating of the Congress and of \nWashington, DC, will gradually go up if we were to do that.\n  Let me say a word about exactly what we talked about on Wednesday--\nthe kind of approach that one can expect from Republican Senators this \nyear.\n  First, of course, is that we are here and ready to go to work on \nthese specific solutions based on Republican principles, and we are \neither looking for bipartisan support or already have bipartisan \nsupport on many issues. Of course, to begin with, we know Americans are \nhurting and anxious because of the housing slump, because of gasoline \nprices, because of rising health care costs, and we are ready to work \nwith the House and the President, across the aisle, to find the \nappropriate action to take to try to avoid an economic slowdown.\n  I imagine the Senate will have some of its own views about its \nproposals when the House brings its proposal here. But we want a \nresult. I, for one, would like to see--and I believe most of my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle would like to see--a proposal that \ngrows the economy and not the Government. But we will have a debate \nabout that. That is not partisan bickering; that is the Senate in its \nfinest tradition addressing an issue that is central to every single \nfamily in this country.\n  We know we need to intercept the communications of terrorists so we \ncan keep our country safe from attack. We know when we do that, we have \nto carefully balance each of our right to liberty versus each of our \nright to security.\n  Samuel Huntington, the Harvard professor, once wrote--he was \nPresident of the American Political Science Association--that most of \nour politics is about conflicts between principles or among principles \nwith which almost all of us agree. That is important to Americans \nbecause what unifies us, other than our common language, is these few \nprinciples, security and liberty being two.\n  Republicans support the Rockefeller-Bond bipartisan proposal which \npassed 13 to 2 by the Intelligence Committee. We want to make sure \nthose companies which help us defend ourselves aren't penalized for \nhelping to make the country secure, while at the same time protecting \nindividual liberties.\n  We know there are 47 million Americans who don't have health \ninsurance, and Republican Senators said in our retreat on Wednesday \nthat we are ready to go to work this year to make sure every American \nis insured. Some say put it off a year. Well, perhaps we can't get it \nall done in 2008, but we can surely start. Senator Byrd and Senator \nDeMint and Senator Bennett and Senator Corker, among others, spoke at \nour retreat on this issue. We would like to get going now. We could \nbegin with the Small Business Health Insurance Act, which would permit \nsmall companies to pool their resources and offer more health insurance \nat a lower cost to their employees. That would be a beginning.\n  Many of us on the Republican side have sponsored a bipartisan bill--\none of two or three that have the same general approach to reforming \nthe Tax Code, to put cash in the hands of American families and \nindividuals so they can afford to buy their own private insurance, \nputting together four words that usually don't go together: ``universal \naccess'' and ``private insurance.'' Those are based on principles we \nRepublicans agree with: free market and equal opportunity. We know on \nthis side of the aisle--and I suspect many over on that side know as \nwell; I know they do--if we don't do something about the runaway growth \nof Medicare and Medicaid--entitlement spending, in other words--we will \nbankrupt our country. Every year that we wait to deal with that is a \nyear that makes the solution harder.\n  So Senator Gregg, at our retreat, talked about his proposal with \nSenator\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\nConrad, a Democratic Senator, to create a base-closing-task-force-type \ntask force for the sole purpose of recommending to the Congress a way \nto control entitlement spending and force an up-or-down vote on that. \nThat is the principle of limited government. That is a principle that \nmost Republicans and a proposal that many Democrats can support.\n  We know there is a great force in Washington, DC, to spend more \nmoney, to issue more regulations and rules, and there are almost no \ncountervailing forces to spend less money, repeal rules, and revise \nregulations. So Senators Domenici, Isakson, and Sessions, among others, \nhave proposed an idea to change our budgeting and appropriations \nprocess from 1 year to 2 years. That may help us get appropriations \nbills done on time so we can save money in our contracting in the \nDefense Department and Department of Transportation, for example. But \nmore important to me, and to many on this side of the aisle, it would \ncreate a countervailing force of oversight so that every other year we \nwould spend most of our time on oversight, meaning we could review, \nrepeal, and change and improve laws, regulations, and rules that have \nbeen in place for a long time.\n  We want to keep jobs from going overseas, and we believe we know how \nto do it. Last year, we worked with Senator Bingaman and others on the \nother side to pass the America COMPETES Act. This is an extraordinary \nresponse to our challenge to keep our brain power advantage so we can \nkeep our jobs, in competition with China and India. Senator Hutchison \nhas been a leader on this issue. She, with Senator Bingaman, began the \neffort to fully fund advanced placement courses so more children could \ntake those courses. So we are ready--many on this side of the aisle--to \nimplement the advanced placement provisions in the America COMPETES \nAct. That will help 1.5 million children to have those opportunities.\n  We are ready to implement the provision that would put 10,000 more \nmath and science teachers in our classrooms. Many of us are ready to \nimplement the recommendation that we pin a green card to every single \nforeign student legally here and who graduates from an American \nuniversity in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. Some \nproposals ought to be bipartisan, but they are not--or at least they \nweren't. I made one, and we talked about this for a while on Wednesday.\n  In order to encourage unity in this country, we need a common \nlanguage. That seems to be common sense. Therefore, we ought to pass a \nlaw making it clear that the Federal Government should not be suing the \nSalvation Army, telling them they cannot require employees to speak \nEnglish on the job. We got it through the Senate and to the House, \nwhere the Speaker stopped it. Now Senator Conrad has joined in support, \nas have Senators McConnell, Byrd, Landrieu, and Nelson of Nebraska. So \nnow we have a bipartisan approach on another important issue.\n  We talked about the idea and the problem of the number of rural women \nin this country who are pregnant and cannot get the proper prenatal \nhealth care. OB/GYN doctors are leaving rural areas because runaway \nmalpractice lawsuits are running malpractice insurance over $100,000 a \nyear. So the pregnant women are having to drive 70 miles to Memphis or \nother big cities to see a doctor and get the prenatal health care they \nneed and to have the baby. We have proposals to stop it in the way \nTexas and Mississippi did. We invite bipartisan proposals on that.\n  Mr. President, the Republican agenda will emerge over time. What I \nwould like to say to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and \nto the American people is, we want to change the way Washington does \nbusiness, and we believe we know how. The way is to stand up every \nsingle day and week with new specific proposals on real issues and have \na debate where one is needed. Let Senator Dodd and Senator Kyl have a \nprincipled argument about security versus liberty. That is in the \nfinest tradition. Let's cut out the playpen politics. Let's don't have \nthat, and let's earn back the confidence of the American people by \ndealing with specific solutions. That is what you are going to hear \nfrom Republican Senators.\n  No sooner had I heard some encouraging remarks from the majority \nleader, out comes this release from the Senate leadership and majority \nleader Harry Reid:\n\n       For immediate release. Democratic policy experts discuss \n     President Bush's legacy of broken promises.\n\n  That was announced. This is playpen politics. I am sure we do it here \nsometimes, but I will do my best as the Republican conference chairman \nto make the political reward for this playpen politics so low that this \nkind of release and activity is moved into the nursery school where it \nbelongs, over to the national committee where it belongs, whether it is \nthe Democratic playpen or the Republican playpen, and that we devote \nourselves to the issues facing our country.\n  How can we help the economy? How can we help every American be \ninsured? How can we stop the terrorists? How can we implement the \nAmerica COMPETES Act? Those are the debates we ought to have. I hope \nthat is clear to the American people and to our colleagues. We are \nlooking forward to this year. Republicans are ready for change in the \nway we do business in Washington. The people of this country are ready \nfor that, too. I look forward to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I express my gratitude to Senator \nAlexander, my colleague from Tennessee, for his comments and for his \nleadership. We decided it would be helpful to come to the floor and \ntalk a little bit about the retreat that Senator Alexander laid out and \nour reasons for believing that it is important that we not take the \nyear off just because it is a Presidential election. I think Senator \nMcConnell most recently pointed out that we have had elections in this \ncountry every 2 years since 1788. So if we are going to use that as an \nexcuse for not getting things done, we will never get anything done. We \nhave a lot of important issues we need to address, and we will.\n  The month or so that we were in recess, from the Wednesday before \nChristmas until we came back the day after Martin Luther King's \nnational holiday, I enjoyed being at home in Texas. As always, I \ntraveled around the State and talked to a lot of people. But I also \nlistened. What I heard from my constituents is the same thing I bet \nvirtually every single Senator heard, and that is that people are sick \nand tired of the bickering and partisanship. They are sick and tired of \nseeing Congress not solving problems that only Congress can solve. \nFrankly, they are beginning to feel more and more like Congress is \nirrelevant to their daily lives. I think that is what accounts for the \nhistorically low approval rating we have seen of the Congress in the \nlast year.\n  The problem is--and the occupant of the chair knows as well as I do--\nthat I don't think the public differentiates between Republicans and \nDemocrats when they give Congress a low approval rating, by and large. \nI think it is up to us, working together, to try to elevate that low \napproval rating by doing what our constituents expect us to do, and \nthat is to work together when we can, without sacrificing our basic \nprinciples.\n  Let me say a word about that. Lest anybody confuse what Senator \nAlexander and I are saying, that we are somehow taking leave of our \nprinciples, that is absolutely not true. In Washington, I usually tell \nfolks that we have Democrats in Texas and we have Republicans in Texas. \nThey are all pretty much conservative by national standards, Washington \nstandards. But the fact is, my constituents expect for me to get \nsomething done. But that is not done by sacrificing principles. I do \nthink we have important differences, and I think those should be \ndebated, and then we should vote. We should be held accountable in the \nnext election for our votes and for what we have done or not done.\n  I think there is an important difference between standing on your \nprinciples and then looking for common ground to try to come together \nand solve problems. I agree with what the Senator from Tennessee said. \nWe all know it is a fact of life in the Senate\n\n[[Page S317]]\n\nthat you cannot get anything done without bipartisan support. Our 60-\nvote rule for cloture to close off debate in order to have an up-or-\ndown vote requires it. So why not recognize that, sure, we can say no, \nno, no, but occasionally I think we ought to look for an opportunity to \nsay yes where it doesn't sacrifice our principles, but it does find \ncommon ground to try to get things done on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  I have constituents who asked me, as recently as last night: Don't \nyou find life in the Senate and in Washington and in the Congress \nfrustrating? Many say I could never do what you do because I would be \nso frustrated by it. I think there is plenty of opportunity for \nfrustration, if we dwell on that. But I prefer to look at the \nopportunities for making life better for the American people and for \noffering solutions on the difficult issues that confront us. To me, \nthat is what I get up and come to work for. That is why I enjoy being \nin the Senate. I believe it gives me a chance, as one American, to do \nwhat I can to try to make life better and to make a difference. It is \nnot about sacrificing principles. It is doing what we said in the \npreamble to the Constitution when we said:\n\n       We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the \n     general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity. . . .\n\n  We said that in 1787, in a document that was ratified by all of the \nStates by 1790. That should be our goal still today--to be true to that \nstatement of principle about what our goals are as a nation.\n  The Senator from Tennessee did go through a number of concrete \nproposals and talked about what our alternative will be to the \nproposals being made on the other side of the aisle. Again, I agree \nwith him, that the American people don't expect us to come here and \nsplit the difference on everything in order to come up with an \nagreement if they believe that outcome is devoid of principle or \nsacrifices fundamental values. There are differences between the \nparties. Those differences ought to be reflected in a dignified and \ncivilized and respectful debate that highlights those differences, and \nthen we have a vote on those different points of view. We will either \npass legislation or not based on that vote. But I think it will be \nacting in the greatest tradition of the Senate, and in a way that our \nconstituents back home earnestly wish we would act and, unfortunately, \nin a way that we have not always acted.\n  I have to believe all Members of this body want to see our economy as \nstrong as it can possibly be going forward. They want to see that our \nNation is secure and our defense remains the best in the world; that \nall Americans have access to quality health care; that taxpayers not be \ncompelled to foot the bill for wasteful Washington spending. I have to \nbelieve that all of our constituents, and indeed all Members of the \nSenate, believe that we need a sustainable energy policy that allows us \nto turn away from our over-reliance on imported oil and gas from \ndangerous parts of the world.\n  I think, as Senator Alexander pointed out, principled differences on \nimportant legislation need to be debated in the Senate and voted on and \nresolved rather than be left without a solution and unaddressed.\n  We do have an opportunity, I believe, this new year as we have come \nback not just to say no, no, no, to every idea that is offered on the \nfloor but to say: Here are our alternative solutions to the problems \nthat confront America.\n  Mr. President, you will be hearing us on the floor of the Senate on a \nweekly basis not only addressing legislation offered by the majority--\nand, of course, it is the majority leader's prerogative to set the \nagenda to call up bills; we will not be able to do that as Members of \nthe minority--but what you will hear from us is a principled proposal \nto solve the problems that confront America on each of the big issues \nthis Nation wants us to address and wants us to expend our very best \nefforts to try to solve.\n  I am delighted we have seen a sort of renewed enthusiasm for finding \nsolutions in a principled way. I agree with the Senator from Tennessee, \nthe retreat we had I thought was one of the most hopeful retreats I \nhave ever participated in as a Member of the Senate because I think \nwhat we saw is a recommitment to try to solve problems, to avoid the \npartisan bickering and the divisiveness that has resulted in the \nhistorically lower approval rating of Congress and which turns off so \nmany of our constituents.\n  Of course, as we all know, as elected officials, if we do not respond \nto our employer and try to address the concerns our employer has--and \nour employers are our constituents--then our employers may look for \nsomebody else to do the job in the next election.\n  It is up to us to be responsive to those concerns, and I think \nwithout sacrificing principles, by staying true to those values we \nbrought with us but looking for common ground. That is the art in our \njob, and it is more art than science. I have said it before and I will \nsay it again, I think compromise for compromise's sake is overrated \nbecause if all compromise means is sacrificing your principles in order \nto get a problem behind you, I don't think you have done your job. \nDoing your job means standing on your principles but looking for common \nground, consistent with those principles, to solve problems. There is \nplenty of common ground to find if we will work a little bit harder and \na little bit more in earnest to try to find it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask that the pending amendment be \nset aside so I may call up amendment No. 3905.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I guess I would like to start by \nsaying I appreciate very much the sentiments that were recently \nexpressed by the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Texas, who \nis my friend who served with me as attorney general at the same time in \nour respective States, Texas and Rhode Island. I ask them to let me \nknow when that new approach will begin because I am, frankly, not \nseeing much of it in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nprocedures we are going through on the floor. I confess, I am a new \nMember of this body, and I do not understand why.\n  We heard Senator Dodd, the very distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, who has served in this body for 27 years, describe how \nimportant this Chamber is and that it is the right of Senators to \ndebate matters, not for the sake of ventilating themselves but toward \nactually getting a vote on a real amendment on a matter of real \nsignificance.\n  We had one vote on a committee amendment. Not one Senator has \nachieved getting a vote, and we are on a very short timeframe. I may be \nnew, but I will tell you that in the 1 year I have served, I have \npresided a great\n\n[[Page S318]]\n\ndeal. The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Minnesota, and I have \nboth spent a lot of time in that chair. It is a wonderful place to sit, \nand you get a great view and a great education as to what goes on in \nthe Chamber.\n  I can recall over and over hearing my colleagues on the Republican \nside of the aisle, as mad as they could be, complaining bitterly \nbecause the majority had offered them only 10 amendments on a bill or \nonly 20 amendments on a bill. I cannot get one called up.\n  Let me first say, this is an important issue. On the one hand, we \nhave to deal with perhaps the greatest danger our country faces at this \nmoment, which is the threat that comes from international terrorism, \nand we have at the same time to deal with one of the basic principles \nof our Government--freedom, freedom from, among other things, \nGovernment surveillance, unless it is done properly and by the law.\n  This is not some new idea. It goes back to the Bill of Rights, where \nthe very Founders of this country mandated that before the Government \ncould intrude into the persons, places, houses, and effects of \nAmericans, they had to get permission from a court.\n\n  The balance between freedom and security is an important one, a \nhistoric one. So this is no minor issue on which to avoid real debate, \nand the amendments are important ones. The amendments involve the \nimmunity issue about which Senator Dodd spoke so passionately. This is \na very important issue.\n  As I see it, we have some cleaning up to do in this body as a result \nof a real mess the Bush administration left us. They could have gotten \na court order, and we know perfectly well that if a court order had \nbeen obtained, there would be no issue of immunity for us to address. A \ncompany following a court order is protected. End of story. They \ncouldn't be troubled to get a court order to protect these companies \nthey are so concerned about now. But you do not necessarily need a \ncourt order. You can actually get a certification from the appropriate \nGovernment official using language this Congress has provided, and it \nwill also provide protection to companies that cooperate in Government \nsurveillance, as long as they have been notified properly through the \ncertification process.\n  One would think the litigation would be over, if that certification \nprocess had been complied with. It would be a slam dunk. Which raises \nthe logical conclusion that for some reason, the Government did not \ncomply with the certification process. I don't know why they did that. \nI don't know if anybody else knows why they did that. It could be being \nobtuse and stubborn and insisting it had to be done under the \nPresident's unitary article II authority that they purposefully, \ndeliberately failed to follow the certification process to prove that \npoint they wanted to prove.\n  If that is the case, they have walked these phone companies into all \nthis concern we now have to address for no purpose whatsoever. But now \nwe do have to address the problem. No matter how they got into it, we \nhave this problem to address, and it is not an easy problem.\n\n  One side says: Well, blanket immunity. Well, that is fine, but you \nare taking away rights and due process of people who are in court right \nnow. A judge has looked at this case and he didn't throw it out. There \nis nothing to suggest that the litigation going on right now is not \nentirely legitimate. So if we do that, we are taking away real rights \nof real Americans that are currently in play right now before a court.\n  I don't know of a time the Congress has ever done that. As a former \nprosecutor, like the Presiding Officer, the very notion that it is the \nlegislature's job to go into ongoing legitimate litigation and make \ndecisions about who should win and who should lose seems to me a \nspectacular trespass over the doctrine of separation of powers. I hope \nmy colleagues in this body who are in the Federalist Society would be \nconcerned about this separation of powers.\n  On the other hand, we could strip the legislation of its immunity \nentirely and leave the companies in the litigation. That is not a great \nsolution either. There is a problem with that solution. The problem \nwith that solution is that the Bush administration has bound and gagged \nthe company defendants--instructed them they may not defend themselves. \nSo here you have legitimate American corporations in legitimate \nlitigation being told by the Government that they may not speak, they \nmay not answer, they may not defend themselves. That doesn't seem like \na great outcome either.\n  Well, an amendment I wish to offer, the one I just tried to call up, \nproposes a potential solution. If the Government is going to tell them \nthey can't defend themselves, then in all decency shouldn't the \nGovernment step in for them and say: OK, we are going to bind you and \nwe are going to gag you in this ring of litigation combat, but we are \ngoing to step in for you and not leave you unable to defend yourself? \nIsn't that the most decent, basic thing you could expect the Government \nto do? That is what this amendment would do. It would substitute the \nGovernment for the defendant corporations that the Government has bound \nand gagged in this litigation--muzzled.\n  It would do another thing: It would make sure that a court decided \nthat these companies had in fact acted in good faith before they were \ngiven that relief. They have told us they have acted in good faith, but \nwe are a legislature. Good faith is a finding the courts make. We are \nnot judges. We haven't heard from all sides. We haven't had hearings, \nsuch as a court would have to get to the bottom of this.\n  There is an easy way to do it. You let the FISA Court, which has the \nsecrecy necessary to get to the bottom of this, make the determination, \nthe fundamental determination: Did these companies, in fact, act in \ngood faith? That is a basic point of entry. We have all assumed it to \nbe true, but it is not our job as Members of Congress to decide on the \ngood faith of an individual litigant in a matter that is before a \ncourt.\n  I think this is a very legitimate amendment. It may not be germane \npostcloture. It may never come up as a result of this. Maybe it is just \nthe new Senator. Poor kid, all this work on these bills. Doesn't he \nknow the merits don't matter around here? Maybe it is a situation \nrelated to me not knowing my way around here yet. But I don't think so. \nBecause Senator Feinstein, who has been here for a very long time, who \nis very distinguished, who is one of the most bipartisan Senators in \nthis Chamber, if not the most bipartisan Senator in this Chamber, has a \nvery similar piece of legislation. She has taken the good faith test in \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and picked it out as a \nseparate, solitary piece of legislation, and she is pursuing that. That \namendment can't be called up either.\n  You could say: Well, maybe it is because I am a Democrat; they are \nshutting down all the Democrats. But my amendment is cosponsored by \nArlen Specter, the very distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, who \nhas been the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. It is the Specter-\nWhitehouse amendment. I don't see how you could have a better \ncredential, a better bipartisan credential than to have the Republican \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee as the cosponsor of the amendment. \nAnd yet we can't call it up, and because of the cloture motion that has \nbeen filed, it may never be called up.\n  I think we are doing serious work, and I think we should get votes on \nthese amendments. I know some of my colleagues have said: Well, you \nshould defer to the committee bill. The committee bill was so good, it \nwas bipartisan, it passed 13 to 2. Well, I was in that committee. Yes, \nit passed 13 to 2, but an awful lot of us said in our remarks on that \nbill that we passed it out of that committee in order to work on it \nfurther in the Judiciary Committee and in order to move amendments on \nthe floor. It did not pass with a 13-to-2 vote of Senators saying this \nis ready to go to the President; this is ready to clear the Senate. It \npassed on a 13-to-2 vote of Senators who knew that the bill was going \nto the Judiciary Committee and who knew that the bill was going to the \nfloor and had reason to expect the ordinary courtesies of this body to \nbe able to offer amendments would be honored.\n  In fact, the amendment I tried to offer yesterday that was objected \nto, that I can't call up, I raised in the Intelligence Committee. I was \ntold by the executive branch officials there--and I should say that \nthroughout this process I hope nobody would challenge how\n\n[[Page S319]]\n\ncarefully my office has worked with the administration to get these \nthings right, to get technical language worked through properly--I was \ntold by the executive branch officials that the way I had written the \namendment caused technical difficulties. So I didn't pursue it in the \nIntelligence Committee. I withdrew it, noting that we would work \nthrough the technical difficulties and then bring it up again later on.\n  Nobody said then, oh, Senator Whitehouse, there is going to be no \nlater on; the committee vote is all you will get. Nobody said that. \nBecause that would violate the history and traditions of the Senate, \nbecause it would be wrong, and because it wasn't the program. It wasn't \nthe plan at the time. I feel it has been represented to me that these \namendments would be voted on, and I feel that representation has been \ndishonored by the procedure we are in right now.\n  I want to read something. I prepared remarks in the event that this \namendment was going to go in. Of course, I thought it was going to go \nin. I had the Republican former chairman of the Judiciary Committee as \na cosponsor and it addresses the biggest question in this legislation. \nIt provides a potential resolution of the conflict between the two \narguments. Why on Earth would it not be something that I would be able \nto exercise my traditional right to raise on the floor? So I planned \nahead and I wrote remarks for that occasion. Here is what I wrote at \nthe very end of the remarks.\n\n       Madam President, whether this amendment passes or fails, I \n     would like to say that it is the product of a truly \n     commendable process. Everybody here knows the old saw that \n     the making of law is like the making of sausage. You might \n     like the results, but you don't want to see what goes into \n     making it. Not so here. This amendment and Senator \n     Feinstein's are the results of many hours of thoughtful, \n     bipartisan consideration, hard work by Senators and their \n     staffs, reasoned and respectful committee debate, and what I \n     am sure will be thorough debate on the floor.\n\n  Those are the remarks I wrote. And I have to say right now, those \nwords taste like ashes in my mouth. I hope the spirit that Senator \nAlexander and Senator Cornyn brought to the floor a moment ago will \nbegin to animate the FISA debate, and that legitimate--and I believe my \nRepublican colleagues will concede these are legitimate--and sincere--\nand I believe my Republican colleagues will concede these are sincere--\nand important amendments have a chance to be raised and debated and \nvoted on here on the floor of the Senate.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, first, I express my admiration for the \nSenator from Rhode Island. The hard work he has put in on the Senate \nIntelligence Committee and the experience he brings to that committee \nis very important. We have worked with him on many issues that we were \nable to accomplish in the committee. I agree with his assertion that we \nneed to balance freedom and security. That is one of the heavy \nresponsibilities we have in the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  He talks about an amendment he has presented on a bipartisan basis, \nand he and his Republican cosponsor feel very strongly about it. I \nwould be happy at the appropriate time to have debate and a vote on \nthis very important measure. But I also happen to agree with the Senate \nmajority leader, who said back in December that the issues before us on \nthis FISA bill are so important that we must ensure they have a 60-vote \nmargin for passage, the same vote that would have to occur if we were \nto overcome a filibuster. That will ensure that there will be no \nfilibuster of the bill.\n  We filed cloture to make sure we could go forward with the bill. We \nare waiting to see how that works out. But the measures, as I have \nstated earlier--and the proponent of this amendment had the distinct \nmisfortune to be in the chair when I addressed this earlier today--but \nfor my colleagues, I would say that we have before us a very carefully \ncrafted bipartisan compromise to improve the FISA, Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, significantly and to ensure that it can work to keep \nour country safe.\n  Passing these measures on a 60-vote margin is nothing new. When I \nbrought the Protect America Act to the floor on August 3, I brought it \non an agreement that we had to have 60 votes to pass it, because it is \na very important bill. And I assume that this bill, which I hope will \npass, will have to pass with 60 votes.\n  I think it is a reasonable proposition to say that a 60-vote \nthreshold must be achieved to ensure there is bipartisan agreement on \nsomething that is this important to our security and our freedom.\n  Now, my colleague raised the question about why the immediate \ninterception of foreign intelligence did not go forward right after 9/\n11, when the President determined there must be interception of \ntelephone and other electronic transmissions coming from foreign \nterrorists abroad into the United States.\n  I am told the administration met with the Gang of 8, leaders of the \nHouse and Senate and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. They \nwere faced with the problems that arose when the court order occurred \nin the spring of last year, saying the existing FISA law did not permit \ninterception of communications coming through the way--coming the way \nby which they now come, through cable and wire.\n  Previously, collections occurred routinely against foreign sources by \nradio wave. And there were minimization procedures. But the FISA Court \nwas not involved. Because of the change in technology, as the order of \nthe court indicated last spring, FISA applied to collection of most of \nthe foreign terrorist communications, whether they were coming into the \nUnited States or into other areas.\n  We were advised by the commanding general, Special Operations Command \nGeneral McCrystal, that the limitations of FISA in April and May and \nJune and July prevented our intelligence authorities from collecting \nvital signals information on communications among terrorists in the \nbattlefield, putting our troops at risk.\n  He begged and pleaded to get it done. Well, despite the begging and \npleading to get it done, you have seen how long it takes us to get FISA \nchanged. As I understand the conversations held in the aftermath of 9/\n11, when we knew there were other attacks being planned and we needed \nto get control of them, there was general agreement among the parties, \nlegislative and executive, that we could not afford to try to take the \ntime to try to change FISA, to make it work with the new electronic \nsignals means of communication in time to stop further terrorist \nattacks.\n  How long has it taken to get FISA passed? Well, the Director of \nNational Intelligence sent up a bill in April pointing out that the old \nFISA law did not permit collection of foreign signals intelligence from \nknown terrorist targets abroad. He sent it up in April. He testified \nbefore our committee in May. He came to the Senate and had a hearing in \nour classified room telling leaders of both parties how important and \nhow sensitive it was.\n  Another month passed. Nothing happened. He came back with a short-\nterm extension that had to have a 6-month sunset on it. We passed that. \nWe passed that with a 60-vote margin. That has become standard for any \ncontroversial and important legislation coming before this body, which \nis applied not only in FISA but many other circumstances.\n  So we got a 6-month extension. Now, we are still debating whether to \nhave a slightly longer extension of the FISA bill. We reported the bill \non a bipartisan 13-to-2 majority in October. It sat for 2 months. The \nmajority leader tried to bring it up, but he was filibustered from \nbringing it up.\n  We are now at the end of January, when the Protect America Act \nexpires on February 1. We need to move forward to get this bill passed. \nWe need to move forward as promptly as we can. But we need to move \nforward on the same ground rules by which other major legislation and \nwhich the Protect America Act came to the floor; that is, a 60-vote \nmargin to ensure there is bipartisan agreement on something as \nimportant as the freedom and security framed by the FISA debate.\n  Let me add a word or two about the FISA Court. I had thought the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island was going to offer an amendment \non assessing compliance and toss that to the FISA Court. Well, the FISA \nCourt, or FISC as we call it, was created in 1978\n\n[[Page S320]]\n\nto issue orders for domestic surveillance on particular targets.\n  Congress specifically left foreign surveillance activities to the \nexecutive branch and to the intelligence community. The FISA Court, \nthey are article III judges who are called in from time to time to make \nthe judgments of probable cause for issuing warrants. They have \nexpertise in issuing warrants for surveillance on a domestic basis.\n  The bill before us gives them that responsibility, as did the other \nFISA, the old FISA, for issuing those orders for people or facilities \nin the United States. The old one said ``facilities in the United \nStates.''\n  Well, that court is not set up to deal with foreign intelligence \nsurveillance. As I quoted yesterday, the court's own words said--and \nthis is the December 11, In re: Motion for Court Records. The court \nstated that: The FISA Court judges are not expected to or desire to \nbecome experts in foreign intelligence activities and do not make \nsubstantive judgments on the propriety or need for a particular \nsurveillance. Even if a typical FISA judge has more expertise in \nnational security matters than a typical district court judge, that \nexpertise would still not equal that of the executive branch which is \nconstitutionally entrusted with protecting national security.\n  So I expect we will get to the point where we will be debating the \ndistinguished Senator's assessing compliance amendment. But he has \nbrought today the substitution amendment.\n  I have already explained why we could not get through signals \ncollection immediately after 9/11 if we had gone to the old FISA. How \nmany months would it have taken? Well, the leaders who apparently spoke \nwith the intelligence community and the White House said they did not \nwant to highlight the fact that we were going to be listening in and \nthey did not think it would work quickly.\n  The intelligence committee has carefully assessed the orders which \nwere given to the telecommunications carriers which may or may not have \nparticipated in the Terrorist Surveillance Program. And they were \nbased, yes, they were based largely on article II.\n  The FISC has already indicated nothing Congress can do can extinguish \nthe President's authority under article II, but Congress also passed \nthe authorization for use of military force, which was a counterbalance \nin the weighing of the constitutional arguments of article II with the \nprovisions of the FISA law.\n  I have reviewed the Attorney General's findings, the Department of \nJustice findings. I have read the authorizations and the directives. It \nis clear to me, and clear to others, most of the others who have \nreviewed it, they were clearly acting under the color of law.\n\n  I happen to think they were right. You can make an argument that \nmaybe they were not right. But the carriers that may have participated \nwere not in a position to challenge those. They got a lawful order from \nthe head of the intelligence community, based on authorization from the \nPresident, in a manner cleared by the Department of Justice. Under \nthose circumstances, I believe it would not only have been unpatriotic, \nbut it would have been willful for the carriers to refuse to \nparticipate. Yet they are being sued.\n  I think the suits are designed to cripple our intelligence community. \nThere are not going to be significant judgments awarded no matter what \nthey say because anybody who was intercepted would have to come in to \ncourt and say they were intercepted and prove harm. I really question \nwhether they can do that. But under the substitution argument, the \ndisaster to our intelligence operations is clear, as is the damage to \nthe reputation and the business of any carriers which may have \nparticipated.\n  Back in 2006, right after the disclosure of this and the terrorist \nfinance tracking measure, when the newspapers carried it, television \ncarried it, terrorist leaders--very bright people--abroad learned of \nit, communicated about it on their own communications, and those \ncommunications, I was told in the field, went down significantly.\n  So I asked General Hayden, at his confirmation hearing to be head of \nCIA, how badly these disclosures hurt us. And he said at the time that \nwe are applying the Darwinian theory to terrorists; we are only \ncapturing dummies. The more we disclose about the workings of our \nintelligence intercept capabilities, the more those whom we would \ntarget know how to avoid them. And they are taking steps; they know too \nmuch about it. Any further disclosures would further complicate and \ndamage the collection capabilities of our intelligence community.\n  Moreover, the damage to the reputation of the carriers would be \nsignificant. The damage would occur likely in exposing the carriers--\ntheir employees and their facilities--to terrorist activities or \nvigilante activities. It would destroy their business reputation, cause \nuntold harm in the United States, and probably effectively curtail \ntheir ability to operate overseas. If they are put out of operation or \nif they are limited in their operations, then the intelligence \ncommunity loses a substantial means of acquiring the intelligence we \nneed.\n  So when this bill comes up--I expect it will come up, but I believe \nit must come up under a 60-vote rule or we are going to go through the \nnormal process of getting to 60 votes, and we will never get anywhere. \nI think both sides of the aisle should recognize that. I will be happy \nto make these arguments.\n  I know my colleague from Rhode Island is a very skilled lawyer, a \nvery effective debater. He will present his arguments, I will present \nmy arguments, and there will be others who will join with us. So while \nI would love to get on with the debate and votes, we are not going to \ngo there until we resolve the question of whether there is a 60-vote \nmargin.\n  So I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I appreciate very much the arguments \nmade by the very distinguished Senator from Missouri, who is also the \nvice chairman of the Intelligence Committee and possesses great \nexperience in this area. My point, though, is that all these arguments \nare for naught if the simple courtesy of a Senator being allowed to \nvote on his amendment is not honored.\n  This particular amendment being nongermane postcloture means it may \nvery well be squeezed out by the procedural devices the Republican \nleader has applied. So my simple question is, if I may ask it through \nthe Chair to the distinguished Senator from Missouri, the Republican \nmanager of this bill, can we assure Senator Specter and myself that \nthis amendment will, at the appropriate time in this legislation, \nreceive a vote?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I am happy to respond as soon as we go \nback to the normal means of proceeding on FISA matters, establishing a \n60-vote threshold, which is the standard I had to meet to bring the \nProtect America Act to the floor. I would certainly expect that his \namendment would be brought up, fully discussed, and debated. This is \none of the major issues we have to decide. But we have to decide it on \na 60-vote point of order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/25/senate-section/article/S320-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Madam President, we are talking about FISA we use a lot \nof acronyms in Washington, DC, unfortunately--the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act. It is a complicated subject, and one, if people have \nbeen watching the debate, that is also controversial. There is a lot of \npassion about this subject. We have people standing up and saying: None \nof this should be disclosed. We should not be talking about this. This \nis about the ability to protect our country against terrorists. Of \ncourse, we have to listen into communications and intercept \ncommunications. It is the only way to find out if there are terrorist \nacts being plotted by terrorist groups, and so on. There is that kind \nof thing.\n  There are concerns on the other side by people who say: Wait a \nsecond.\n\n[[Page S321]]\n\nThere is something called a Constitution in this country. There is a \nright to privacy, a right to expect that the Government will not be \nspying on American citizens without cause.\n  This is a very controversial and difficult subject. Frankly, nearly \neveryone, with the possible exception of the chairman and ranking \nmember or maybe one or two others on the Intelligence Committee, knows \nvery little about that which we are discussing.\n  Let me put up a photograph of a door. This is a door in San \nFrancisco, CA, a rather unremarkable photograph of a door. This is a \ndoor that is in AT's central offices in San Francisco. A courageous \nemployee of AT named Mark Klein, who had been with the company for 22 \nyears, blew the whistle on what was happening behind this door. \nAccording to Mark Klein, the National Security Agency had connected \nfiber optic cables to AT's circuits through which the National \nSecurity Agency could essentially monitor all of the data crossing the \nInternet. Here is what Mr. Klein had to say went on behind this door:\n\n       It appears the [National Security Agency] is capable of \n     conducting what amounts to vacuum-cleaner surveillance of all \n     the data crossing the Internet--whether that be people's e-\n     mail, web surfing, or any other data.\n\n  The description of what was happening at this one telephone company \nin this one location in San Francisco was this: the intercepting of \ncommunications at the AT Folsom Street facility, millions, perhaps \nbillions of communications from ordinary Americans coming into and \nthrough the facility, which would normally have been the case for a \ntelephone company, and a splitter being used, according to the \ndiscussion by Mark Klein, splitting off all of this conversation into \nan NSA-controlled room, to be eventually evaluated with sophisticated \nprogramming, and then going back out in order to complete the \ncommunication. So you have effectively a copy of everything that is \nhappening going through with a splitter to a secret room.\n  When this became public, when a whistleblower working for the company \nsaid, here is what is happening, there was an unbelievable outcry on \nboth sides. Some people said: What on Earth is happening? We have \nsecret rooms in which the National Security Agency is running all this \ndata and all this information through and spying on American citizens? \nOthers said: What is going on? Who on Earth would have decided they \nshould disclose this publicly? They are going to alert the terrorists \nto what we are doing. We had both sides aghast that this was disclosed. \nIt is important to say that, initially, almost no one in an official \ncapacity was willing to admit to this. Finally, it was admitted, yes, \nthere was a program. The President said: Yes, there is a program--\nspeaking, apparently, of just this program; we don't know of other \nprograms that exist or may exist, but this program existed without our \nknowledge. The President indicated this program existed because we are \ngoing after the bad guys, and we have a right to do that. And we did \nthis program because the process that had been set up because of abuses \nwith respect to eavesdropping and spying on American citizens decades \nago, that process was way too cumbersome, took far too much time, and \nwe needed to streamline that. That is a paraphrase. But there was an \nadmission that this program existed and no additional legal authority \nneeded to empower the President to do it.\n  So that is where we are. Most of us don't know the full extent of \nthis program at all. In fact, my understanding is that rooms like this \nexist in other parts of the country with other telephone companies \nwhere splitters are used to move data to separate rooms and data is \nevaluated.\n  This whole process comes from several decades ago when something \ncalled the FISA Court was set up, a court to evaluate the questions \nabout when it is legal and appropriate and when the Government is able \nto intercept communications. The FISA Court was established for the \nvery purpose of trying to make the judgment about when it is \nappropriate to go after the bad guys and how to protect our civil \nliberties at the same time.\n  The FISA Court was an outgrowth of concern by the Congress when we \ndiscovered that there was a time in this country when we had the \nNational Security Agency running secret projects called Shamrock and \nMinaret to gather both international communications and also domestic \ncommunications. Project Shamrock actually started during the Second \nWorld War when major communications companies of the day gave the \nFederal Government access to all of their international traffic. One \ncan imagine, in the fight against the Nazis and the Japanese Imperial \nArmy, the desire for international communications to evaluate things \nthat might threaten this country's security. But the Shamrock program \nthen, as we know, changed over time.\n  At first the goal was to intercept international telegrams relating \nto foreign targets. Then, soon the Government began to intercept \ntelegrams of U.S. citizens. By the time there were hearings held in the \nCongress, the National Security Agency was intercepting and analyzing \nabout 150,000 messages per month.\n\n  Data from Project Shamrock was then used for another project code \nnamed Project Minaret, which we now know spied on perceived political \nopponents of the then-administration of Richard Nixon. Under this \nprogram the NSA added Vietnam war protesters to its watch list. After \nthere was a march on the Pentagon, the Army requested that they add \nantiwar protesters. The list included people such as folk singer Joan \nBaez and civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. We just \ncelebrated within the week the Federal holiday celebrating the birthday \nof Martin Luther King, Jr. Yet it was not too many decades ago that Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr., was under surveillance by his own Government.\n  The Congress passed its findings, when it did investigative hearings, \nand the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act created the FISA Court.\n  Here is the experience with the FISA Courts. Between 1975 and 2006, \nthere were 2,990 warrants issued by the FISA Court. Only five were \ndenied. What that suggests is that it is not too difficult to get \napproval by the FISA Court for surveillance. But the President and Mr. \nMcConnell, the head of our intelligence agency, have indicated that \nthere has been a problem.\n  For example, Mr. McConnell cited the capture of three American \nsoldiers who were later killed in Iraq. Right after they were captured \nthere was a period of time when it was critically important to be able \nto intercept communications in Iraq, and they were encumbered at a time \nwhen it was critical to find out who held these soldiers.\n  That is not accurate, and the head of intelligence would have known \nthat. I don't know why he represented that. There is a period of time \nwhen in an emergency situation, you can begin surveillance without \nhaving to go to FISA. You have to go FISA after that period of time, \nbut you are given an opportunity for emergency surveillance even before \nyou get the approval or even before you go to the FISA Court.\n  What we have learned, however, through all of this process is from a \nDecember 2005 report in the newspapers. President Bush had authorized \nthe National Security Agency to eavesdrop without warrants inside the \nUnited States which bypassed the entire FISA Court system. It turns out \nthat most of the large telephone companies in this country had gone \nalong with the administration's request for that activity.\n  We are told that the administration, Attorney General Gonzales, and \nothers furnished the telephone companies with some sort of letter, a \ncertification of sorts. We don't know what that letter was, however, \nbecause the administration, citing the State Secrets Act, refuses to \nallow that to be disclosed.\n  I think if they provide certification to a telephone company--and the \ntelephone company relies on that--by officers of the Federal \nGovernment, in good faith, let's have that disclosed. Why should we \nwonder about the actions of a telephone company? If, in fact, you have \nan Attorney General of the United States who is certifying, let's find \nout what this administration did. Let's find out how they did it. Let's \nnot have them tell us you cannot even see what was provided to a \ntelephone company in terms of certification. That, in my judgment, does \nnot pass the red face test.\n  I hope very much we will begin to learn at some point what this \nadministration has done, when they did it, and\n\n[[Page S322]]\n\nwhat the consequences of it are. This issue of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act has become a political football by this \nadministration. The last time we debated this, some while ago, it was \nquite clear that the politics of it were viewed as wonderful politics \nby the other side and by the White House. But this ought not be about \npolitics at all. This ought to be about two issues, both of which are \ncritically important: One is protecting this country's interests, yes, \ngiving us a chance to make sure we understand what the terrorists are \ndoing, how to foil terrorist attempts to injure this country--it is \nabout that; and that is very important--but it is also about civil \nliberties and protecting the rights of the American people at the same \ntime.\n  We thought we had done that by putting together the FISA Court. We \nthought we had done that by establishing a procedure that needed to be \nfollowed. We now understand the President, with his lawyers, says those \nlaws do not matter. There is in the Constitution, they say, something \nabout the powers of the Commander in Chief, and he can do whatever he \nwants. That is a pretty dangerous interpretation of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  We debate this in so much ignorance because almost no one knows what \nthis administration has done, and they are preventing us from knowing \nas much as we should know, in most cases, by claiming protection under \nthe State Secrets Act, and not even allowing the release of the letter \nthat was provided to the telephone companies that cooperated that \ndescribes to them the legal authority for doing so.\n  I think there is much to be learned here, much we need to know. I \nthink it is very important, as we reach an agreement on the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act--and we should because it is an important \ncircumstance by which we need, in certain cases, when we believe there \nis information being passed from terrorist to terrorist, and so on--if \nthose communications are being run through this country, we need to be \nable to intercept and interpret what is happening--but it is critically \nimportant we not allow a kind of an approach to this where there is no \noversight, there is no check.\n  We have a government of checks and balances. What the President and \nhis people seem to be saying to us is: We are not interested in checks \nand balances. We have the authority in the Constitution, as we \ninterpret it, and that means it exceeds every law you can pass. We are \ngoing to do what we want to do. And if you don't like it, tough luck. \nAnd if you don't like it, by the way, what we will say to the American \npeople is you are not willing to stand up for the security of this \ncountry.\n  It is outrageous. It is dragging this issue smack-dab in the middle \nof their little political balloon. But this is a much more important \nprocess than that. We need to do this, and we need to get it right in \norder to protect America. We need to do this, and we need to get it \nright in order to protect the interests of the American people as \nwell--and that interest of privacy and that interest of making sure \nthat ``big brother government'' is not running all of your telephone \ncalls and all of your e-mails and all of your information through its \ndrift net to find out what you are saying and what you are doing and \nwho you are talking to.\n  That is not what I understand to be the best interests of this \ncountry or the guarantees that exist in the Constitution for the \nAmerican people. That is why this is worth an important controversy and \nan important fight. It is why it is for us to take enough time to get \nit right. This is a big issue. We do a lot of things on the floor of \nthe Senate that are not so big--not big issues. They are smaller issues \nin consequence. This issue is about freedom and liberty and the \nguarantees given the American people in the Constitution. It is about \nwhether there is a check on Presidential power that assumes they have \nthe power that exceeds all other laws. If we do not have that kind of \ncheck and balance in this Government, then we have bigger problems than \nI thought.\n  So I only wanted to say, with respect to this issue, we do not know \nmuch about it. We know at this point that behind this door, as shown on \nthis chart--behind this door--exists information split off what is \ncalled a splitter from the main line. Massive amounts of information \ncome into it--in this case, it was AT it could have been other \ntelephone companies--it is split off, and then all of it is evaluated \nto find out: Is there something there that is suspicious? It is not the \nway America has ever worked, and not the way it should work.\n  So the more we know, I think the more we will be able to better \nunderstand how to do two things at once: protect our country against \nterrorists, and protect the civil liberties of the American people. \nBoth are important. At least there is one group of people in this \npolitical system of ours that believes the first is far more important \nthan the second. They are wrong. They are both important, and both \nworth standing up for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/25/senate-section/article/S322-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S322-S324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I want to talk for a few moments about \nthe so-called stimulus package we are assembling to help our economy. \nWhat I want to say, first of all, is we have an economy that is a \nremarkable engine. This little spot on the planet--the United States of \nAmerica--is quite an unbelievable economic engine. It has provided \nbounties and benefits to a group of people that exceed that provided to \nalmost anybody else on this planet.\n  But we have run into some real problems. We now find ourselves in the \nyear 2008 where we have a stock market that is wildly gyrating up and \ndown. We see these dramatic swings in the stock market. That is a \nreflection of a substantial amount of concern and nervousness about \nwhat is happening in the economy and where we are heading.\n  In the last several decades we have morphed into a global economy. I \nhave never questioned that. I have always questioned why the rules have \nnot kept up. But the global economy is a different kind of economy for \nus. We are now told by those who wanted to create their own set of \nrules that the American people should compete with folks who work in \nShenzhen, China, for 20 and 30 cents an hour making bicycles and little \nred wagons. There is downward pressure on income in this country. There \nis great concern by the American people about the loss of jobs and the \nloss of benefits. So there is a lot happening that is of great concern.\n  In addition to these dramatic yo-yo swings in the stock market that \nreflect widespread concern about the economy--we have at the same time \nsome real fundamental structural problems in the economy. Because it \nappears the economy is now weak, we have more people unemployed. We \nhave fewer housing starts. We have a whole range of issues that \ndemonstrate a serious economic problem: a slowdown certainly, a \nrecession very likely. Because of that, we are told there needs to be \nsome short-term stimulus to provide a spark to help crank up this \neconomy again.\n  Well, we always talk about that in an economic slowdown. We have put \neconomic stabilizers in place over a long period of time--two to three \nto four decades--that have been very helpful in moderating the \nrecessions we have had. Normally speaking, the recessions we have had \nhave been shallower recessions because of economic stabilizers that \nhave been put in place. But that does not mean you will not ever have \nrecessions.\n  We might be in a recession now. So the Federal Reserve Board decided, \nearlier this week, cuts interest rates by 75 basis points. That was a \nbig, bold, dramatic move by the Fed. These people wear gray suits and \ndo not do anything very boldly, but this week they decided: Man, we are \ngoing to do something bold--so three-quarters of a percent interest \nrate cut.\n  It is expected, then, in monetary policy--having been moved by the \nFed earlier this week--in fiscal policy our responsibility in Congress \nis to do something as well. So we in the Congress are putting together \na fiscal policy approach. That approach is a stimulus package.\n  Well, the stimulus package would typically be some sort of tax rebate \nto people, perhaps some investment tax incentives to stimulate capital \nacquisition by businesses.\n  The House and the White House have moved now to agree on something \nthat\n\n[[Page S323]]\n\nis going to come to us from the House of Representatives. I think that \nis good news. It has been a long time since we have seen much \ncooperation from the White House. I think it is good news this week. \nThe Fed moved. The White House is interested in an agreement. So we are \ngoing to have a stimulus package. I think the sooner the better. We \nneed to tell the American people we are moving. I also want to say this \nabout a stimulus package. I think there are two steps to it. One is \nshorter term--rebates for individuals, incentives for business \ninvestments, and so on--but, second, and I think very important, is to \nunderstand one of the quick ways to put people back to work and also to \ninvest in America's future, to help build America, is in \ninfrastructure: roads and bridges and dams and all the things that have \nbeen deteriorating.\n  We are so far behind in infrastructure. If we are going to be a world \nclass economic power, we need to invest in infrastructure. We can do \nthat and should do that as also part of a second step in a package to \nstimulate this economy.\n  Having said that, let me make a couple other points. If all we do is \ngenuflect about a stimulus package, and then we step back and say, \n``Well, we are out of breath now. We have done that''--if that is all \nwe do, this country is in deep trouble.\n  Let me describe what I think the significant causes of our trouble \nare. No. 1, we have a President who says, through his Vice President: \nDeficits don't matter. Well, of course he is wrong.\n  Paul O'Neill, the first Secretary of the Treasury under the Bush \nadministration, and one of the real straight shooters in this town--\nhe's a guy I liked; he said it the way he felt it and thought it, and \nyou could believe him--Paul O'Neill, conservative Republican Secretary \nof the Treasury--well, he got fired. Do you know why he got fired? \nBecause Dick Cheney came into his office and, according to the things I \nhave read, said: Deficits don't matter. Don't you understand? Deficits \ndon't matter.\n  Well, Paul O'Neill did not believe that for a minute. Because he did \nnot believe that, he was not part of the team, and he got fired.\n  Deficits do matter. This administration inherited a budget surplus of \nwell over $200 billion a year and has turned it around into a huge \nbudget deficit. This administration has added over $3 trillion to the \ndebt. It ran into a recession, a terrorist attack, a war in \nAfghanistan, a war in Iraq, and now a subprime loan scandal.\n  Some of us stood on the floor of the Senate and said: Mr. President, \ndon't push this issue of giving huge tax cuts on expected surpluses \nthat are going to occur but have not yet occurred. What if something \nhappens? The President said: Not on your life. We are going forward \nwith my plan.\n  He pushed it through this Congress. I did not support it. But the \nresult was big budget surpluses were turned into record budget \ndeficits, because now we had all these unexpected circumstances happen.\n  Well, the President said: We are going to fight a war, but we are \ngoing to send soldiers to Iraq and Afghanistan and we are not going to \npay for it. We are going to send soldiers abroad to fight, but we are \nnot going to ask anybody to pay for it. We will add it to the debt. So \na little over two-thirds of a trillion dollars has been added to the \nFederal debt.\n  Last year, the President sent us a request saying: I want $196 \nbillion over and above that which I have asked for the Defense \nDepartment as an emergency. I want none of it paid for, and I want it \nnow: $196 billion. That is $16 billion a month, $4 billion a week, and \nI don't want to pay for any of it, he said.\n  This is a reckless fiscal policy that has been running this country \ninto a ditch. Now you add to that fiscal policy from this \nadministration--which is supposed to be a conservative administration--\nyou add to that the trade deficit. The trade deficit is $2 billion a \nday, every single day, 7 days a week. Every single day, we import $2 \nbillion more than we export--over $700 billion a year in trade deficit.\n  We are not only shipping our money overseas, which then gives the \nChinese and the Japanese the opportunity and responsibility to finance \nour debt, but they then begin to buy a fair amount of our country. We \nhave just seen it in recent weeks. Citigroup went to Singapore for \n$12.5 billion. GE Plastics got $11.6 billion from the Saudis. Dow \nChemical got $9.5 billion from Kuwait. Citigroup needed more money; \nthey got $7.5 billion from United Arab Emirates. Where do you think \nthey got this money? They got it from us, with these huge trade \ndeficits. So we have a trade deficit that is well above $700 billion a \nyear.\n\n  I know the administration says: Well, the budget deficit is $200 \nbillion, $300 billion. That is not true at all. It is if you take away \nthe Social Security surplus and misuse it, and continue with fiscal \npolicies that are not paid for. We are going to add roughly $600 \nbillion to the federal debt in this fiscal year. So $600 billion in \nbudget deficit, $700 billion in trade deficit, and you are talking $1.3 \ntrillion or roughly 10 percent of the economy this country will \nborrower in 1 year. That is unbelievable. There are people who are \ndrunk who think they are invisible. Well, I am not suggesting we are \ndrunk here in the Congress. However, I am saying that both the \nPresident and the Congress seem to think we are invisible in terms of \nour public policies. The rest of the world sees what is happening--that \nour trade deficit and budget policies are way out of control.\n  Now add to those two things one other element: the subprime housing \nloan scandal that comes because federal regulators were asleep and too \ncozy because they didn't want to regulate those they were supposed to \nregulate. So we had a bunch of high flyers and hot shots who took off--\nmany of them have now been fired but went out the door with $100 \nmillion or $200 million, and what they were doing was providing and \nselling, through high pressure sales techniques, mortgage loans to \npeople who could never possibly repay them. The refrain--if you saw it \non your television set or heard it on your car radio, as many people \ndid--you wondered: How could this be? The refrain on the television \nadvertising was hey, you know something? If you have bad credit, come \nto us. If you have filed bankruptcy, come to us. If you can't make your \nhouse payments, come to us. We have a loan for you. Do you want to cut \nyour loan payment every month? Do you have bad credit? Come to us. We \nwant to give you a loan. All over this country you heard that sort of \nrefrain. Well, guess what: This was mortgage brokers. It was mortgage \nbanks. It was a bunch of high-flying folks who not only were putting \nout bad mortgages, but then they were doing as they did in the old \nmeat-packing plants when they put sawdust in sausage. You took bad \nmortgages and good ones, mixed them up, put them in a case and sliced \nthem and securitized it all and put them all in hedge funds. Soon \nnobody knew what they had, but they were grinning from ear to ear \nbecause they had high returns, high yields, and high fees on the \norigination of these securities. It turns out a lot of them were bad \nsecurities and nobody even knows who has them. Nobody knows which ones \nare bad. But 3 years after the loan is put out and the interest rate is \nreset, we discover that loans were given to people who couldn't \npossibly pay them. Then we discover that those who purchased them and \nthose who sold them can no longer claim they are good assets. They file \nfor bankruptcy. So we have all of this going on.\n  Now, there is another thing that is happening at exactly the same \ntime and is also causing great danger to our economy. Even as this \nsubprime loan mortgage scandal is happening, we have the growth of \nhedge funds and derivatives, and they too are outside of the purview of \nregulators. With respect to the subprime mortgage loans, we had \nregulators who were asleep or dead from the neck up. They wanted to \nserve here, but didn't like Government, and didn't want to do anything. \nThat is what happened there. On hedge funds, Senator Feinstein and I \nand others have been on the floor for years saying: We have to regulate \nhedge funds. We have to understand what is happening with derivatives.\n  Well, guess what. If you go into a casino in Las Vegas, you are going \nto lose what is in your back pocket in most cases. Well, sometimes you \nmight be able to sign for a loan, but in most cases you only lose that \nwhich you have. Hedge funds are unregulated, No.\n\n[[Page S324]]\n\n1, and, No. 2, have unbelievable amounts of leverage, unbelievable \nborrowing.\n  A reasonably new derivative called credit default swaps have a \nnotional amount of $43 trillion. I said $26 trillion earlier this week. \nThat was the end of 2006. In 2007, the notional amount of credit \ndefault swaps, which most people would believe to be a foreign \nlanguage, was $43 trillion. It is not a foreign language at all. These \nare sophisticated financial instruments that represent an unbelievable \namount of speculation that in my judgment put this country's economy at \ngreat risk.\n  So we have budget deficits that are way out of control, and a trade \ndeficit that is an outrage. We also have regulators who have no \ninterest in regulating, allowing the subprime mortgage loan scandal, \nand hedge funds that we have had an aggressive fight on the floor \nabout. We have the administration and others who are not interested in \nhaving any regulation of hedge funds, are unconcerned about what kind \nof liability exists with derivatives, and ignore the problem of this \nunbelievable leverage. If we don't deal with those four areas, we can \nstimulate forever. We can come here in the morning and stimulate every \nday on the floor of the Senate, if you like. It is not going to solve \nwhat is wrong with this country. If you don't put the foundation in \norder, if you don't lay the bricks right in the foundation, there is no \nstructure you can build above it that is going to withstand the kind of \nproblems that exist internally in this economy.\n  This country is too good a country for us to decide not to care about \nfixing these problems. President Bush came to the Congress and said: I \nam a conservative. Well, there is nothing conservative about an \nadministration that runs up this sort of red ink. We are drowning in \nred ink. There is nothing conservative about an administration that has \nregulators who have decided they don't have any interest in regulating. \nIt doesn't matter what the subject is: unsafe toys from China, you name \nit. We have regulators who are apparently collecting a Government \npaycheck and don't have the foggiest interest in regulating. That is \nhow the scandal of subprime mortgage loans has happened and that has \ncaused great injury to our country. It is also what is happening as a \nresult of those who are preventing us from knowing what is going on \nwith hedge funds and derivatives, which can cause a much greater level \nof damage than even the subprime mortgage loan scandal.\n\n  As I said, most Americans wouldn't have heard or know very little \nabout credit default swaps and would hardly know what it means. These \nnumbers are in the trillions. Hedge funds are about $1.2 trillion of \nour economy. People say: Well, that is not so much. Gosh, there is $9 \ntrillion in mutual funds, there is roughly $40 trillion of stocks and \nbonds out there. Mr. President, $1.2 trillion in hedge funds. Hedge \nfunds conduct one-half of the daily trades on the New York Stock \nExchange. Think of that. One-half of the trades by hedge funds. In \naddition to the $1.2 trillion, you have unbelievable amounts of \nleverage.\n  So I think we face a lot of big challenges. If I didn't have great \nhope for the future, I wouldn't want to get up and come to work in the \nmorning. But I have a great reservoir of hope. I believe we can fix \nthese things. But we need leadership from the White House. We need to \nwork together here. We need to understand that it is not just about \nstimulating a short-term response; this is about fixing the foundation \nand setting things right. I think it was Thomas Wolf who talked about \nan indestructible belief, a quenchless hope, a boundless optimism. I \nhave all of that. But we have to start now and understand what we need \nto do to put this country back on track toward a better and brighter \nfuture, one that grows and provides opportunities for all Americans.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I make a point of order that \na quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Could the Senator withhold the quorum call?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be glad to withhold the quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/25/senate-section/article/S324-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S324-S326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               RECESSION\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I commend our colleague from North Dakota \nfor highlighting some of the challenges we face economically. He did it \nin a very compelling way, as he always does. We are grateful for his \nleadership on these issues.\n  I stood before the Senate a couple of days ago and talked about the \nfact that we have a war in Iraq that we cannot forget about. In fact, \nif you listen to some of the news, you would think there are only one \nor two issues we have to worry about, but the war continues to be a \ncentral issue for the American people. We also have to be very \nconcerned, as Senator Dorgan and others have reminded us, about the \neconomy.\n  I was asked recently by a reporter--a couple of different reporters, \nactually--who said to me very simply--or asked me, I should say, very \nsimply the question: Are we in recession? I answered them without \nblinking, without even stopping to think, because I know it is the \ntruth, and the answer is yes, we are in a recession. I don't care \nabout, nor do I need to wait, for some academic dissertation or some \neconomist to tell us what is the textbook definition of a recession. We \nare in a recession. We have to do something about it. I think it is as \nplain as could be.\n  So what do we do about this recession? How do we respond to it? Thank \ngoodness, there is a lot of bipartisanship on this issue, both parties \ncoming together to try to do something about it. But I think we have to \ndescribe for people in Washington what this means for real people. I \nwill talk about it in the context of Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania \nfamilies, by way of highlighting this issue. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record two pages I am going to be referring to from \nthe Joint Economic Committee, Pennsylvania Economic Snapshot, dated \nJanuary 23, 2008.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Over the past seven years, the Bush economy has made it \n     more difficult for most Americans to get ahead. Under the \n     current Administration, the basic goals of the American \n     dream--raising a family, owning a home, paying for college, \n     saving for retirement--have become intimidating hurdles for \n     hardworking people. Slow growth in families' wages has been \n     compounded by double-digit cost increases for health care, \n     energy, and college tuition. Democrats are fighting for a new \n     direction in economic policy, aimed at restoring broad-based \n     growth, reducing the high costs of health care and energy, \n     improving retirement security, and increasing prosperity for \n     all Americans.\n\n\n   Real Household Income Has Stagnated; Job Creation Has Been Abysmal\n\n       Pennsylvania's Median Household Income Increased By Only \n     1.3 Percent Since 2000. In Pennsylvania, real median \n     household income averaged $48,148 over the 2005-2006 period, \n     compared with $47,524 over the 1999-2000 period. Despite \n     strong gains in productivity, workers' wages are only \n     marginally higher than they were 25 years ago, and \n     nationally, the inflation-adjusted income of a typical \n     American household fell by $962, or 2.0 percent, to $48,201 \n     between 2000 and 2006.\n       Pennsylvania's Job Growth Under the Current Administration \n     Lags Far Behind Previous Presidents. The current president is \n     competing with his father for the worst job creation record \n     of any president since Herbert Hoover. Since taking office in \n     January 2001, only 6 million jobs have been created, as \n     compared with 20.8 million new jobs created during the \n     Clinton administration at the same point in time. In \n     Pennsylvania, only 101,900 new jobs have been created since \n     Bush took office--or 1,200 new jobs per month--as compared \n     with a total of 528,900 new jobs under Clinton--or 6,400 per \n     month. In particular, the manufacturing sector has been hit \n     hard by the economy under the current Administration, with \n     payrolls nationwide declining by 3.2 million jobs between \n     January 2001 and December 2007, and by 202,000 in \n     Pennsylvania over the same period.\n\n\n          Families Are Feeling the Squeeze of Rising Expenses\n\n       Rising Energy Costs Lead to Higher Gas and Home Heating \n     Prices for Pennsylvania Residents. Rising energy costs are \n     making it more difficult for Pennsylvania families to stretch \n     their household budgets. In January 2001, the average retail \n     price per gallon of gasoline in Pennsylvania was $1.43. The \n     average gas price per gallon is $3.15 as of January 18, 2008. \n     When adjusted for inflation, this represents an increase of \n     86 percent. At the same time, this winter is expected to hit \n     Pennsylvania families hard, as average home heating costs \n     have risen by 18.9 percent per household from $1,216 to \n     $1,447 in the past year.\n       Health Care Premiums Rose 45.8 Percent in Pennsylvania \n     Since 2000. In 2005, the average\n\n[[Page S325]]\n\n     inflation-adjusted health care premium for family coverage in \n     Pennsylvania was $11,470, a 45.8 percent increase from 2000, \n     while the average premium for individual coverage was $4,332, \n     an increase of 50.0 percent since 2000. Nationwide, the \n     inflation-adjusted average monthly premium for family health \n     coverage in the United States rose by 39.7 percent from 2000 \n     to 2005, even as real median household income declined by 2.7 \n     percent over the same period.\n       Pennsylvania College Tuition Rose 32.5 Percent Since 1999. \n     Pennsylvania parents of college age students have also been \n     hard hit under the current Administration, as inflation-\n     adjusted tuition for Pennsylvania's four-year public colleges \n     increased 32.5 percent between the 1999-2000 and 2005-2006 \n     school years to $8,994 per year. With that $2,208 increase \n     over just six years, Pennsylvania families are finding it \n     more and more difficult to afford to send their children \n     to college, and they are not alone. Nationally, public \n     college tuition has risen at more than double the rate of \n     inflation in recent years. Between the 1999-2000 and 2005-\n     2006 academic years, average inflation-adjusted tuition \n     and fees at U.S. public colleges and universities \n     increased by 36.3 percent.\n       Child Care Costs For Two-Child Families Averaged $1,273 Per \n     Month in Pennsylvania. Child care continues to be a hefty \n     burden on the budgets of Pennsylvania parents, with \n     inflation-adjusted monthly care for an infant averaging $689, \n     and monthly care for two children averaging $1,273.\n\n\n The Housing Crisis Is Eroding Home Wealth, Hurting the Broader Economy\n\n       The Subprime Mortgage Crisis Is Impacting All Pennsylvania \n     Homeowners. Under the Bush administration's watch, \n     unregulated mortgage originators were given financial \n     incentives to sell risky, unaffordable subprime mortgages to \n     vulnerable borrowers. As these adjustable rate mortgages \n     reset to higher rates, the number of families unable to \n     afford their payments and threatened with foreclosure is \n     skyrocketing. In Pennsylvania, mortgages in delinquency have \n     increased from 81,900 in the third quarter of 2005 to 121,100 \n     in the third quarter of 2007. According to a recent report \n     published by the Joint Economic Committee (JEC), the number \n     of subprime foreclosures in Pennsylvania will total 45,500 \n     between third quarter 2007 and the end of 2009.\n       High Foreclosure Rates Drag Down Neighboring Property \n     Values and Household Wealth. The mortgage foreclosure crisis \n     will have severe costs for Pennsylvania homeowners, not only \n     in direct costs, but in its effect on home values and \n     declining property taxes. According to the JEC, subprime \n     mortgage-related foreclosures will cost Pennsylvania $2.46 \n     billion over the second half of 2007 through the end of 2009. \n     Nationally, the expected economic costs of forecast \n     foreclosures total nearly $104 billion. Moreover, these \n     numbers do not include the larger effects that the \n     foreclosure crisis may have on the economy. Home prices, \n     which drove up consumer spending when they rose earlier this \n     decade, are in decline now, and consumers may begin to draw \n     back on spending, negatively impacting GDP growth.\n\n\n            The Economic Cost of the Iraq War Is Staggering\n\n       The Iraq War Will Cost $36,900 Per Pennsylvania Household. \n     According to the JEC's recent report, the direct and indirect \n     costs of the Iraq War will be massive, especially if the Bush \n     administration continues to keep large numbers of troops \n     there. Even assuming significant force reductions, the cost \n     of the Iraq War will total $107 billion for Pennsylvania \n     taxpayers by 2017; the total cost to the country will be an \n     estimated $2.8 trillion.\n\n\n                   Poverty Remains Persistently High\n\n       In Pennsylvania, 1.4 million Residents Were Living in \n     Poverty Over Last Two Years. In Pennsylvania, 1.4 million \n     residents were living below the poverty line during the 2005-\n     2006 period, an increase of 28.8 percent over the 1999-2000 \n     period. Unfortunately, this problem is not confined to the \n     adult population as 17 percent of Pennsylvania's children are \n     living below the poverty line. Nationally, 12.3 percent of \n     Americans were living in poverty as of 2006.\n\n\n              The Ranks of the Uninsured Continue to Grow\n\n       Over Last Two Years, 1.2 million Pennsylvania Residents Had \n     No Health Insurance. A growing number of Pennsylvania \n     residents are living without health insurance. During the \n     2005-2006 period, an average of 1.2 million Pennsylvania \n     residents--9.9 percent of the state's population--had no \n     health insurance; this was 274,000 more than during the 1999-\n     2000 period. Furthermore, 7.4 percent of Pennsylvania's \n     children had no health insurance. Across the country, the \n     number of Americans without health insurance totals 47 \n     million, up 8.6 million since the current Administration took \n     office.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I want you to know I will not read these \ntwo pages, but I want to highlight a couple of data points in this \nsummary--two pages, four or five highlights.\n  First, delinquencies, mortgage delinquencies, are up from the third \nquarter of 2005 to the third quarter of 2007, up by some 40,000 \nmortgages, just in Pennsylvania. Then, stretching back over a couple of \nyears, we look at gas prices. From January of 2001 forward, up 86 \npercent, gas prices in Pennsylvania; home heating costs, in 1 year--1 \nyear--up 18.9 percent; health insurance for families. If you look at it \nover a 5-year period, 2000 to 2005, health care premiums for families \nare up 45.8 percent. And one more: Childcare costs per month for two \nchildren, which is the case for a lot of families, childcare costs per \nmonth for two children is averaging $1,273.\n  That is just in one State and a couple of highlights. We could go on \nand on, but I won't.\n  There are the economic realities for Pennsylvania families, and we \ncould add more to that list. So when a reporter or anyone else asks me, \nAre we in a recession, my answer is, You bet we are. A lot of families \nin Pennsylvania and across the country think we have been in a \nrecession, or their families have been in a kind of recession for years \nnow--not just since the holidays, not just in the last year, but for \nmany years. So I think the data is compelling and overwhelming and \nirrefutable.\n  But let's think about it even more broadly. In terms of health care, \nFamilies USA did a report this past November--again, just in \nPennsylvania--and they have done it for a lot of States, but \nPennsylvania was the first one they announced. I will read one sentence \nfrom a long report, one sentence from this report by Families USA on \nthe issue of health care. I think one sentence tells the story. During \nthis same period that they referred to earlier in the report, meaning \n2000 to 2007, during that 7-year period:\n\n       The average worker's share of annual family premiums rose \n     from $1,656 to $3,281, an increase of more than 98 percent.\n\n  What they are saying in that one sentence is that in the State of \nPennsylvania, over that 7-year period of time, the workers' share of \nannual family premiums went up 98 percent--98 percent in one State, the \nworkers' share on health care. I don't even need to refer to the rest \nof the report. That tells the story.\n  So that is all the information. That is all the data. But what do we \ndo with it? We saw in the news today and yesterday that there has been \nan agreement of sorts that has been brought about on the economy, and I \nthink we should all be encouraged by the fact that the President and \nthe Congress are working together on a stimulus package. But what does \nthat mean, and what are the elements of it? I won't go into all of it, \nbut I think one thing we have to be guided by--and we have heard over \nand over again this sound bite in Washington, but we should say it \nagain. These are not my words. We have all quoted these, but they \nsummarize it pretty well: Whatever stimulus package we have in place \nfor the American people has to be timely, has to be temporary, and has \nto be targeted. Another way to say that is we have to put in place \npolicies for the stimulus that we know will work.\n  I want to refer to a chart here that tells that story pretty well. We \nhave seen this chart before, but it bears repeating. Other Members of \nthe Senate have used it. The targeted stimulus proposals, the ones that \ndeliver far more bang for the buck. It is very simple: What do you get \nfor a buck in stimulus expenditure?\n  We know this from the data. This isn't some Democratic operative; \nthis is what Mark Zandi from economy.com put forth: food stamps, spend \na dollar and get $1.73 back; unemployment, spend a dollar in stimulus, \nget $1.64 back. States are in a fiscal mess. We won't go into that, but \nif you spend a dollar, you get $1.36 back in return. Then it goes down \nfrom pay, with payroll tax rebates and temporary income tax. We know \nthat expending tax cuts for the wealthy, which is on the table right \nnow, doesn't work. We know what works.\n  We have to make sure, in my judgment, that if we put together a \nbipartisan stimulus package--and we still have to work on this in the \nSenate--that we invest in strategies that will work, not what we would \nlike to do or hope to do or not what one side or the other believes is \na good idea. We have to invest in strategies that work: Food stamps, \nnot just because it helps individual Americans and their families, but \nwe know by investing in that strategy, they will spend the money \nquickly. We need people to spend money very rapidly to dig us out of \nthe hole we are in. Food stamps, unemployment benefits, and aid to the \nStates--we have to\n\n[[Page S326]]\n\nprovide investments in strategies that will work.\n  Another thing we have to do is make sure that when we are dealing \nwith the housing crisis, we spend dollars and have strategies that lead \nto help in the short run. I was one of three Senators who put in the \nbudget $180 million for counseling. It is not some far-reaching plan to \ndeal with the subprime crisis; it is dollars right now. In fact, the \ndollars for counseling would get dollars into the hands of nonprofit \ngroups in the country to help families out of this next month, so to \nspeak. Those dollars--$180 million--will begin being spent in March. \nThat will work. Those counselors are experts. They are certified, and \nthey know how to work with families. We have to invest in that.\n  I will conclude with this thought. If you walked through the streets \nof New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, I don't think many people would \nbe scratching their heads and wondering whether that was a category 5 \nhurricane or a category 4. It didn't matter; it was devastating. I \ndon't think we ought to wonder whether an economist tells us we are in \na recession. We are in a recession.\n  We know something about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. When all \nof the reporting was done, when that horrific nightmare engulfed so \nmany families, who were washed out of their homes and their hopes and \ndreams were gone, I think we learned a lot from what didn't happen \nbefore the hurricane.\n  We know as Americans that devastation doesn't always come with the \nawful swiftness of a hurricane. Sometimes it happens much more \ngradually, over time, when you don't make the right decision and \nprioritize and when you don't make the right investments. We are not \ndoing that right now. We are not making the investments we should make \nin children in the dawn of their lives. We are not making an investment \nin fiscal responsibility to the extent we should. We are not investing \nin our infrastructure. Maybe all of those decisions can lead to a kind \nof slower moving Katrina or slower moving hurricane, which is an \neconomic hurricane, or a devastating hurricane that dashes the hopes \nand dreams of children and their families.\n  So when we make a decision about what will be in the stimulus package \nto help people in the short run, we also have to get to work on a long-\nterm strategy for economic growth, investing in our children, and \nmaking sure families can grow. I am concerned about how we are doing \nthat or not doing it in Washington. We should learn from the horrific \nnightmare that was Hurricane Katrina. We should learn from, frankly, \ninformation such as this that tells us what will work in the short run \nto get us out of this mess and stimulate the economy and get dollars in \nthe hands of Americans who will spend the dollars, which will jump-\nstart or jolt our economy. I think we can come together and do that. I \ndon't think what we have seen so far gets us to that point.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity to talk about these issues. I know \nthey are central not just to Pennsylvania and our families but in \nStates such as Minnesota and other States across this country. We have \na lot more work to do to get the stimulus package right to help our \neconomy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/25/senate-section/article/S326-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S326-S328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   Lance Corporal Cameron M. Babcock\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier from Plymouth, \nIN. LCpl Cameron Babcock, 19 years old, died January 20th at Twentynine \nPalms Marine Base in California. Lance Corporal Babcock was killed as \nthe result of a firearms accident in his barracks. Cameron was a \ncommitted soldier and servant to his country.\n  Cameron was a 2006 graduate of Plymouth High School and was a gifted \nmusician. He played the trumpet in the Big Red Marching Band and was a \nmember of the Plymouth High School Advanced Jazz Band. In 2005, he \ncompeted at the State Jazz Festival in LaPorte with the Advanced Jazz \nBand. He was also a member of the Wind Ensemble, comprised of some of \nthe school's top music students. Cameron also played the guitar and \nenjoyed four-wheeling.\n  After graduation, Cameron fulfilled a lifelong goal by enlisting in \nthe Marines, telling his family it was what he had always hoped to do. \nHe was promoted to private first class after boot camp and was a \nrifleman in the infantry. With his assignment to Kilo Company, 3rd \nBattalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, Cameron served an \nexemplary tour in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was a \ndecorated soldier and received numerous awards during his tour in Iraq \nincluding the National Defense Service Medal, the Iraqi Campaign Medal, \nthe Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Combat Action Ribbon, \nthe Sea Service Deployment Ribbon and the Certificate of Commendation.\n  Cameron was awaiting his second tour of duty in Iraq when he died. He \nis survived by his parents, Jeffery and Ann Smith Babcock; his sisters \nKailey, Abigail, and Hope Babcock; and his brother, Samuel Babcock. The \nBabcock family resides in Plymouth.\n  Today, I join Cameron's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Cameron. Today and always, Cameron will be \nremembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true \nAmerican hero, and we honor the example he set in serving his country.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of LCpl Cameron M. Babcock in the \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Cameron's can find comfort in the words of the \nprophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the \nLord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Cameron.\n\n\n                        Major Andrew J. Olmsted \n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise today in honor of MAJ Andrew \nOlmsted, who was killed on January 3 in an attack near Sadiyah, Iraq. \nMajor Olmsted was assigned to the 1st Brigade of the 1st Infantry \nDivision out of Fort Riley, KS, but he and his wife, Amanda Wilson, \nlived together in Colorado Springs, CO. Andrew was 37 years old. He was \nthe first American casualty in Iraq of 2008.\n  Major Olmsted was a proud soldier whose sense of duty took him to \nIraq--whose commitment to his fellow soldiers earned him their deepest \nrespect--and whose compassion put him in the line of fire the day he \ndied.\n  Andrew was also an exceptionally talented writer. He shared his \nexperiences and perspectives in Iraq with the world on blogs, including \none he wrote for the Rocky Mountain News entitled ``From the Front \nLines.'' The thousands of readers who followed Andrew's deployment had \nthe privilege of his frank, thoughtful, stirring, and often humorous \ntake on the war, the Army, and politics.\n  For a writer and reporter as gifted as Andrew, it is hard to find the \nwords to properly honor his life and his sacrifice. I would rather let \nhim speak for himself and reflect on his memory by sharing with my \ncolleagues portions of Major Olmsted's final posting. He asked a friend \nto post this on his blog in the event of his death. In its eloquence, \npower, humor, and tragedy, it is one small way in which we may remember \nthe mark that Andrew made on our world:\n\n       This is an entry I would have preferred not to have \n     published, but there are limits to what we can control in \n     life, and apparently I have passed one of those limits. . . .\n       What I don't want this to be is a chance for me, or anyone \n     else, to be maudlin. I'm dead. That sucks, at least for me \n     and my family and friends. But all the tears in the world \n     aren't going to bring me back, so I would prefer that people \n     remember the good things about me rather than mourning my \n     loss. (If it turns out a specific number of tears will, in \n     fact, bring me back to life, then by all means, break out the \n     onions.)\n       I had a pretty good life, as I noted above. Sure, all \n     things being equal I would have preferred to have more time, \n     but I have no business complaining with all the good fortune \n     I've enjoyed in my life. So if you're up for\n\n[[Page S327]]\n\n     that, put on a little 80s music (preferably vintage 1980-\n     1984), grab a Coke and have a drink with me. If you have it, \n     throw ``Freedom Isn't Free'' from the Team America soundtrack \n     in; if you can't laugh at that song, I think you need to \n     lighten up a little. I'm dead, but if you're reading this, \n     you're not, so take a moment to enjoy that happy fact. . . .\n       I suppose I should speak to the circumstances of my death. \n     It would be nice to believe that I died leading men in \n     battle, preferably saving their lives at the cost of my own. \n     More likely I was caught by a marksman or an IED. But if \n     there is an afterlife, I'm telling anyone who asks that I \n     went down surrounded by hundreds of insurgents defending a \n     village composed solely of innocent women and children. It'll \n     be our little secret, ok?\n       I do ask (not that I'm in a position to enforce this) that \n     no one try to use my death to further their political \n     purposes. I went to Iraq and did what I did for my reasons, \n     not yours. My life isn't a chit to be used to bludgeon people \n     to silence on either side. If you think the U.S. should stay \n     in Iraq, don't drag me into it by claiming that somehow my \n     death demands us staying in Iraq. If you think the U.S. ought \n     to get out tomorrow, don't cite my name as an example of \n     someone's life who was wasted by our mission in Iraq. I have \n     my own opinions about what we should do about Iraq, but since \n     I'm not around to expound on them I'd prefer others not try \n     and use me as some kind of moral capital to support a \n     position I probably didn't support. Further, this is tough \n     enough on my family without their having to see my picture \n     being used in some rally or my name being cited for some \n     political purpose. You can fight political battles without \n     hurting my family, and I'd prefer that you did so.\n       On a similar note, while you're free to think whatever you \n     like about my life and death, if you think I wasted my life, \n     I'll tell you you're wrong. We're all going to die of \n     something. I died doing a job I loved. When your time comes, \n     I hope you are as fortunate as I was. . . .\n       Those who know me through my writings on the Internet over \n     the past five-plus years probably have wondered at times \n     about my chosen profession. While I am not a Libertarian, I \n     certainly hold strongly individualistic beliefs. Yet I have \n     spent my life in a profession that is not generally known for \n     rugged individualism. Worse, I volunteered to return to \n     active duty knowing that the choice would almost certainly \n     lead me to Iraq. The simple explanation might be that I was \n     simply stupid, and certainly I make no bones about having \n     done some dumb things in my life, but I don't think this can \n     be chalked up to stupidity. Maybe I was inconsistent in my \n     beliefs; there are few people who adhere religiously to the \n     doctrines of their chosen philosophy, whatever that may be. \n     But I don't think that was the case in this instance either.\n       As passionate as I am about personal freedom, I don't buy \n     the claims of anarchists that humanity would be just fine \n     without any government at all. There are too many people in \n     the world who believe that they know best how people should \n     live their lives, and many of them are more than willing to \n     use force to impose those beliefs on others. A world without \n     government simply wouldn't last very long; as soon as it was \n     established, strongmen would immediately spring up to \n     establish their fiefdoms. So there is a need for government \n     to protect the people's rights. And one of the fundamental \n     tools to do that is an army that can prevent outside agencies \n     from imposing their rules on a society. A lot of people will \n     protest that argument by noting that the people we are \n     fighting in Iraq are unlikely to threaten the rights of the \n     average American. That's certainly true; while our enemies \n     would certainly like to wreak great levels of havoc on our \n     society, the fact is they're not likely to succeed. But that \n     doesn't mean there isn't still a need for an army (setting \n     aside debates regarding whether ours is the right size at the \n     moment). Americans are fortunate that we don't have to worry \n     too much about people coming to try and overthrow us, but \n     part of the reason we don't have to worry about that is \n     because we have an army that is stopping anyone who would \n     try.\n       Soldiers cannot have the option of opting out of missions \n     because they don't agree with them: that violates the social \n     contract. The duly-elected American government decided to go \n     to war in Iraq. (Even if you maintain President Bush was not \n     properly elected, Congress voted for war as well.) As a \n     soldier, I have a duty to obey the orders of the President of \n     the United States as long as they are constitutional. I can \n     no more opt out of missions I disagree with than I can ignore \n     laws I think are improper. I do not consider it a violation \n     of my individual rights to have gone to Iraq on orders \n     because I raised my right hand and volunteered to join the \n     army. Whether or not this mission was a good one, my \n     participation in it was an affirmation of something I \n     consider quite necessary to society. So if nothing else, I \n     gave my life for a pretty important principle; I can (if \n     you'll pardon the pun) live with that. . . .\n       I write this in part, admittedly, because I would like to \n     think that there's at least a little something out there to \n     remember me by. Granted, this site will eventually vanish, \n     being ephemeral in a very real sense of the word, but at \n     least for a time it can serve as a tiny record of my \n     contributions to the world. But on a larger scale, for those \n     who knew me well enough to be saddened by my death, \n     especially for those who haven't known anyone else lost to \n     this war, perhaps my death can serve as a small reminder of \n     the costs of war. Regardless of the merits of this war, or of \n     any war, I think that many of us in America have forgotten \n     that war means death and suffering in wholesale lots. A \n     decision that for most of us in America was academic, whether \n     or not to go to war in Iraq, had very real consequences for \n     hundreds of thousands of people. Yet I was as guilty as \n     anyone of minimizing those very real consequences in lieu of \n     a cold discussion of theoretical merits of war and peace. Now \n     I'm facing some very real consequences of that decision; who \n     says life doesn't have a sense of humor? . . .\n       But for those who knew me and feel this pain, I think it's \n     a good thing to realize that this pain has been felt by \n     thousands and thousands (probably millions, actually) of \n     other people all over the world. That is part of the cost of \n     war, any war, no matter how justified. If everyone who feels \n     this pain keeps that in mind the next time we have to decide \n     whether or not war is a good idea, perhaps it will help us to \n     make a more informed decision. Because it is pretty clear \n     that the average American would not have supported the Iraq \n     War had they known the costs going in. I am far too cynical \n     to believe that any future debate over war will be any less \n     vitriolic or emotional, but perhaps a few more people will \n     realize just what those costs can be the next time.\n       This may be a contradiction of my above call to keep \n     politics out of my death, but I hope not. Sometimes going to \n     war is the right idea. I think we've drawn that line too far \n     in the direction of war rather than peace, but I'm a soldier \n     and I know that sometimes you have to fight if you're to hold \n     onto what you hold dear. But in making that decision, I \n     believe we understate the costs of war; when we make the \n     decision to fight, we make the decision to kill, and that \n     means lives and families destroyed. Mine now falls into that \n     category; the next time the question of war or peace comes \n     up, if you knew me at least you can understand a bit more \n     just what it is you're deciding to do, and whether or not \n     those costs are worth it.\n       ``This is true love. You think this happens every day?''--\n     Westley, The Princess Bride\n       ``Good night, my love, the brightest star in my sky.''--\n     John Sheridan, Babylon 5\n       This is the hardest part. While I certainly have no desire \n     to die, at this point I no longer have any worries. That is \n     not true of the woman who made my life something to enjoy \n     rather than something merely to survive. She put up with all \n     of my faults, and they are myriad, she endured separations \n     again and again . . . I cannot imagine being more fortunate \n     in love than I have been with Amanda. Now she has to go on \n     without me, and while a cynic might observe she's better off, \n     I know that this is a terrible burden I have placed on her, \n     and I would give almost anything if she would not have to \n     bear it. It seems that is not an option. I cannot imagine \n     anything more painful than that, and if there is an \n     afterlife, this is a pain I'll bear forever.\n       I wasn't the greatest husband. I could have done so much \n     more, a realization that, as it so often does, comes too late \n     to matter. But I cherished every day I was married to Amanda. \n     When everything else in my life seemed dark, she was always \n     there to light the darkness. It is difficult to imagine my \n     life being worth living without her having been in it. I hope \n     and pray that she goes on without me and enjoys her life as \n     much as she deserves. I can think of no one more deserving of \n     happiness than her.\n       ``I will see you again, in the place where no shadows \n     fall.''--Ambassador Delenn, Babylon 5\n       I don't know if there is an afterlife; I tend to doubt it, \n     to be perfectly honest. But if there is any way possible, \n     Amanda, then I will live up to Delenn's words, somehow, some \n     way. I love you.\n\n  Mr. President, our thoughts and prayers are with Amanda, Andrew's \nparents, and all of his family. May they soon find comfort and respite \nfrom their grief. May we always remember Andrew for his life, service, \nand sacrifice. And may countless others have the blessing of reading \nhis words.\n\n\n                   Staff Sergeant Justin R. Whiting \n\n  Madam President, I rise today to honor the memory of SSG Justin R. \nWhiting, a Green Beret with the 3rd Battalion, 5th Special Forces \nGroup, out of Fort Campbell, KY. On January 19, Sergeant Whiting was \nleading a convoy through the streets of Mosul, Iraq, when a bomb \nexploded near his vehicle. He was killed at 27 years old.\n  Sergeant Whiting was born in Belton, TX, but at a young age moved to \nHancock, NY, where he developed a love for the great outdoors. Justin \nwas an avid hunter who reveled in the rugged landscape near the \nDelaware River.\n  Those who knew him describe Sergeant Whiting as an adventurer. It was \nthis virtue, coupled with his deep-seated love for his country, which \nled him to join the Army just 2 months after his high school \ngraduation.\n  In the Army, he chose the most difficult path he could pursue, that \nof becoming a Green Beret. The Special\n\n[[Page S328]]\n\nForces soldiers I know are the pride of our country. All at once, they \nare soldiers, intelligence officers, diplomats, tacticians, linguists, \ntrainers, and advisors. They are at the tip of the spear of our \nnational defense. The Green Beret that they wear, said President \nKennedy, is ``a symbol of excellence, a badge of courage, a mark of \ndistinction in the fight for freedom.''\n  Sergeant Whiting was on his third tour in Iraq, on a mission to help \nbring security and stability to a region torn by violence and tragedy. \nEvery day, he and his unit put themselves in harm's way to give Iraqi \ncitizens a chance at a society governed by the rule of law, free from \nthe threats of sectarian strife, terrorism, or autocratic rule. He \nserved bravely and was highly decorated. Among many other honors, he \nearned the Bronze Star, one of the highest awards given for combat \nservice, for his bravery and selflessness.\n  For those of us who did not know Justin personally, it is difficult \nto know what inspired his extraordinary sense of duty or what fueled \nhis courage on the battlefield. Alexander Hamilton, a Founding Father \nand an Army officer, explained that ``There is a certain enthusiasm in \nliberty that makes human nature rise above itself in acts of bravery \nand heroism.'' I imagine that Justin found his strength in many \nsources--friends, family, and fellow soldiers--but I imagine that he, \ntoo, was motivated by an enthusiasm for liberty and a passion for \njustice. In his life, he consistently chose the path that was most \nchallenging so that he could offer our country his highest service. He \nwas a true patriot.\n  To Justin's mother, Estelline, to his father, Randall, to his sister, \nAmanda, and to his brother, Nathan, our thoughts and prayers are with \nyou. I hope that in time, your grief will be assuaged by the pride you \nmust feel in Justin's service and by the honor he bestowed upon his \ncountry. May we never forget his service and his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/25/senate-section/article/S328-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/25/senate-section/article/S328-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/25/senate-section/article/S328-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2556.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nincrease the level of earnings under which no individual who is blind \nis determined to have demonstrated an ability to engage in substantial \ngainful activity for purposes of determining disability; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nArizona, Senator John McCain, to reintroduce legislation that we've \nsponsored in the past, the Blind Persons' Earnings Fairness Act of \n2008. This legislation would restore the 20-year link between the \nearnings limits under Social Security for blind people and senior \ncitizens. Restoring this connection would have a tremendous impact on \nthe lives of many blind people, helping them become more self-\nsufficient and productive members of society and giving them the chance \nto live fuller lives.\n   Today there are nearly 1.3 million Americans who are blind, with \n75,000 more becoming blind each year. With today's technology, blind \nand visually-impaired individuals can do just about anything. Blind \npeople today are employed as farmers, lawyers, secretaries, nurses, \nmanagers, childcare workers, social workers, teachers, librarians, \nstockbrokers, accountants, and journalists, among many other things. \nUnfortunately the unemployment rate among the blind is still at an \nunconscionable 74 percent. The Federal Government should do all within \nits power to facilitate and encourage the blind and visually-impaired \nto enter the workforce. A variety of public and private initiatives \nhave been launched over the years to provide the technologies and \nassistance necessary to educate and employ the blind at the same level \nas their sighted peers. For example, the National Federation of the \nBlind, NFB, has created an institute to utilize technological \nadvancements for the blind in an effort to promote employment of the \nblind throughout the Nation. The NFB helps employers provide adaptive \ntechnology, consultation, and training so that they can better \naccommodate the needs of blind and visually-impaired employees. Now the \nchallenge goes beyond giving the blind the tools to compete in the \nworkforce, now we need to give hem the freedom to do so without fear of \nlosing their essential Social Security benefits.\n  In 1996, Congress passed the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act, \nwhich broke the longstanding linkage between the treatment of blind \npeople and seniors under Social Security. This allowed the earnings \nlimit to be raised for seniors at a far faster rate than for the blind. \nAs a result, the earnings limit for blind people has not kept up with \nmodern day costs and earnings. So, blind people do not have the \nopportunity to increase their earnings without jeopardizing their \nSocial Security benefits. In 2008, that limit was at $18,840. If a \nblind individual earns more than that, his or her Social Security \nbenefits are not protected.\n   The purpose of the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act was to allow \nseniors to continue contributing to society as productive workers while \nstill receiving needed social security benefits. Historically, the \nearnings test treatment of seniors and blind people was identical under \nTitle II of the Social Security Act. With this legislation, we seek to \nrestore that connection and do the same for the blind population of \nAmerica as we have done for the seniors. We must provide blind people \nthe same opportunity to be productive and contribute to their own \nstability. We must not discourage these individuals from working within \nan unreasonably low earnings limit.\n  The current earnings test provides a disincentive for the blind \npopulation, many of whom are working age and capable of productive \nwork. Work provides one of the fundamental ways individuals express \ntheir talents and allows them to make a contribution to society and to \ntheir loved ones. Blind individuals face constant hurdles when it comes \nto employment. Parents, teachers, or counselors may tell them they \ncan't do it. Employers sometimes don't even give them the opportunity \nto try. But blind people and others with severe visual impairments take \ngreat pride in being able to work, just like the rest of us. They are \nlikely to respond favorably to an increase in the earnings test because \nthey want to work. We don't want to leave in place yet another hurdle \nto employment for blind individuals with the Social Security earnings \ntest. By allowing those\n\n[[Page S331]]\n\nwith visual impairments to work more without penalty, we would increase \nboth their tax contribution and their purchasing power. By doing so we \nwould also bring additional funds into the Social Security trust fund \nand the Federal Treasury.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this important \nlegislation to restore the fair and equal treatment for the blind \ncitizens of America. The Blind Persons' Earnings Act of 2008 will \nprovide the blind population with the same freedom and opportunities as \nour Nation's seniors and the rest of the citizens of this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2559\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join many of my \ncolleagues in submitting a resolution recognizing January 2008 as \nNational Mentoring Month.\n  We all know the extraordinary help and support that a good mentor can \ngive to a child. High-quality mentoring programs can make all the \ndifference to students in need. They can reduce negative outcomes, and \nhelp keep children on track. They can reduce drug and substance abuse \nand delinquency. They can enable students to stay in school instead of \ndropping out.\n  By promoting such positive outcomes, mentors enable students to \nobtain the skills they need to succeed in school and in life. They \nimprove academic achievement, and they also improve self-esteem and \nsocial and communications skills.\n  National Mentoring Month is an opportunity to recognize and commend \nthe many mentors across the country who are doing their part. It is \nalso an opportunity to raise awareness about the real value of \nmentoring, and encourage more adults to become mentors. Experts \nestimate that nearly 18 million young students could benefit from being \nmatched with a mentor, but only about 3 million of these youth are in \nsuch a relationship today. Fifteen million youth need a mentor--but \nthey do not have one.\n  Mentoring a young person doesn't just pay off for the youth; it can \nbe beneficial for the mentor as well. For the past 12 years, I have \nparticipated in the Everybody Wins Program at Brent Elementary School \nnear the Capitol. Once a week during the school year, I spend an hour \nwith an elementary school student. We read together, share stories, and \nlearn from each other. This year, my first reading partner is finishing \nhigh school, and next year she will be starting college. She has stayed \nin touch, and it has been amazing to see her grow.\n   Robert Kennedy often spoke of the ripples of hope that people send \nforth each time they act to help others.

Res. 431\n\n       Whereas on December 27, 2007, Kenyan citizens went \n     peacefully to the polls to elect a new parliament and a new \n     President and signaled their commitment to democracy by \n     turning out in large numbers, and in some instances waiting \n     in long lines to vote;\n       Whereas election observers reported serious irregularities \n     and a lack of transparency that, combined with the \n     implausibility of the margin of victory, and the swearing in \n     of the Party of National Unity presidential candidate Mwai \n     Kibaki with undue haste, all serve to undermine the \n     credibility of the presidential election results;\n       Whereas the Government of Kenya imposed a ban on live media \n     broadcasts that day, and shortly after the election results \n     were announced, in contravention of Kenyan law, the \n     Government also announced a blanket ban on public assembly \n     and gave police the authority to use lethal force;\n       Whereas subsequent to declaring Mr. Kibaki the winner, the \n     head of the Election Commission of Kenya (ECK) stated that he \n     did not know who won the presidential election;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the election announcement, \n     significant violence began and continues to flare;\n       Whereas on January 1, 2008, 4 commissioners on the ECK \n     issued a statement which\n\n[[Page S333]]\n\n     called for a judicial review and tallying of the vote;\n       Whereas the head of the European Union Election Observation \n     Mission stated that ``[l]ack of transparency, as well as a \n     number of verified irregularities. . . cast doubt on the \n     accuracy of the results of the presidential election as \n     announced by the ECK'' and called for an international audit \n     of the results;\n       Whereas the Attorney General of Kenya has called for an \n     independent investigation of the tallying of votes and for \n     the votes to be retallied;\n       Whereas observers from the East African Community have \n     called for an investigation into irregularities during the \n     tallying process and for those responsible for such \n     irregularities to be held accountable;\n       Whereas some estimates indicate that at least 700 people \n     have died and as many as 250,000 have been displaced as a \n     result of this violence, which continues;\n       Whereas the economic cost to Kenya of the violence and \n     civil unrest in the wake of the disputed polls is estimated \n     at $1,000,000,000;\n       Whereas the Assistant Secretary of State for African \n     Affairs traveled to Nairobi in an attempt to mediate between \n     the 2 leading presidential candidates and has stated that \n     ``serious flaws in the vote tallying process damaged the \n     credibility of the process'' and that the United States \n     should not ``conduct business as usual'' in Kenya; and\n       Whereas Kenya has been a valuable strategic, political, \n     diplomatic, and economic partner to those in the subregion, \n     region, and to the United States and has been 1 of the major \n     recipients of United States foreign assistance in sub-Saharan \n     Africa for decades: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the Kenyan people for their commitment to \n     democracy and respect for the democratic process, as \n     evidenced by the high voter turnout and peaceful voting on \n     election day;\n       (2) strongly condemns the violence in Kenya;\n       (3) urges all politicians and political parties to \n     immediately desist from the reactivation, support, and use of \n     militia organizations that are ethnic-based or otherwise \n     constituted;\n       (4) calls on the 2 leading presidential candidates to--\n       (A) engage in an internationally brokered dialogue, which \n     results in a new political dispensation that is supported by \n     Kenyan civil society; and\n       (B) respect the will of the Kenyan people;\n       (5) simultaneously--\n       (A) supports a call for electoral justice in Kenya, \n     including a thorough and credible independent audit of \n     election results with the possibility, depending on what is \n     discovered, of a recount or retallying of votes, or a rerun \n     of the presidential elections within a specified time period; \n     and\n       (B) encourages any political settlement to take into \n     account these recommendations;\n       (6) calls on Kenyan security forces to refrain from use of \n     excessive force and respect the human rights of Kenyan \n     citizens;\n       (7) calls for those who are found guilty of committing \n     human rights violations to be held accountable for their \n     actions;\n       (8) calls for an immediate end to the restrictions on the \n     media, and on the rights of peaceful assembly and \n     association;\n       (9) condemns threats to civil society leaders and human \n     rights activists who are working towards a peaceful, just, \n     and equitable political solution to the current electoral \n     crisis;\n       (10) holds all political actors in Kenya responsible for \n     the safety and security of civil society leaders and human \n     rights advocates;\n       (11) calls on the international community, United Nations \n     aid organizations, and all neighboring countries to provide \n     assistance to Kenyan refugees who have fled in search of \n     greater security;\n       (12) encourages others in the international community to \n     work together and use all diplomatic means at their disposal \n     to persuade relevant political actors to commit to a peaceful \n     resolution to the current crisis; and\n       (13) urges the President of the United States to--\n       (A) support diplomatic efforts to facilitate a dialogue \n     between leaders of the Party of National Unity, the Orange \n     Democratic Movement, and other relevant actors;\n       (B) consider the imposition of personal sanctions, \n     including a travel ban and asset freeze on leaders in the \n     Party of National Unity, the Orange Democratic Movement, and \n     other relevant actors who refuse to engage in meaningful \n     dialogue to end the current crisis; and\n       (C) conduct a review of current United States aid to Kenya \n     for the purpose of restricting all nonessential assistance to \n     Kenya, unless all parties are able to establish a peaceful, \n     political resolution to the current crisis, which is credible \n     with the Kenyan people.\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3919.
