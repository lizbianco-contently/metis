This weekend, the American people spent another $80-plus \nmillion in Iraq. That is $400 million on Saturday, $400 million on \nSunday, and $400 million-plus today. The month of February came to a \nclose. Another $12 billion was spent in Iraq, all $12 billion of it \nborrowed. Yet for the hundreds of billions we have borrowed and spent \nin Iraq already, the violence continues. This morning brought news of \ntwo car bombs in Baghdad killing dozens. A grave was discovered where \n14 council volunteers were found dead.\n  Dealing with housing, Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz said this \nweekend that these billions upon billions spent in Iraq are largely \nresponsible for the economic troubles here at home. Last week, \nDemocrats in Congress attempted to help families impacted by the eye of \nthe economic storm, the housing crisis.\n  Yet as we watched the Dow tumble--and tumble it did Friday by almost \n4 percent, and oil closed above $100; one time it went above $103 a \nbarrel for the first time in history--Republicans blocked our ability \nto try to move forward on the housing crisis. They could have chosen \nthe side of families at risk to lose their homes to foreclosure and all \nAmericans adversely affected by the housing crisis.\n  Over the weekend, I ran into a man of great respect. He told me a \ncouple of years ago that he could see a housing crisis looming. He \nlives in the distinguished Presiding Officer's State; he lives, in \nfact, in northern Virginia. He mentioned to me that in Fairfax County, \nthere are 5,000 homes in foreclosures now. A year ago there were 200. \nHe said there would be more than that but the clerk of the court is so\n\n[[Page S1438]]\n\noverwhelmed with work that there are hundreds and hundreds of others \nwaiting to be listed as being foreclosed upon.\n\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle could have chosen the side \nof families at risk. Instead they chose the side of President Bush, the \nside of big business. As the Republicans block and stall, people \ncontinue to suffer. We need to help them, and we in the majority remain \nready to do so.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to join Democrats in a bipartisan \neffort to get people the help they need and get our economy working \nagain.\n  Before I brought this bill up, I extended the olive branch to my \ndistinguished friend, the Republican leader: five amendments on each \nside. We simply were thwarted every time from moving to the bill. I had \nminority members come up to me and say: Well, why did you fill the \ntree?\n  Those words never came out of my mouth ever as it dealt with the \nhousing matter. I would hope, as I conversed with Senator Dodd late \nFriday evening, that he and my friend, Richard Shelby, the Senator from \nAlabama, the ranking member on the Housing Committee, can maybe come up \nwith amendments that the Republicans want to offer on this bill.\n  We believe, in fairness to the American people, it should be related \nto housing. As we know, the Republicans came out with their own \nstimulus package: lower taxes, tort reform, things of that nature, that \nhave nothing much to do with housing reform. But we are willing to work \nwith members of the minority to come up with a housing package. We are \ngoing to have to do it quite soon, because we are now trying to move to \nconsumer product safety.\n  If we have some kind of a deal, I am sure we could work out something \nto move to this bill and spend a few days on it, because next week we \nhave to go to the budget. That is statutory. We need to do that. That \nbill will be reported out of the committee on Thursday and then we need \nto move to that probably by Tuesday of next week, complete it.\n  As I recall, there is 50 hours of statutory time under the Budget \nAct, and then at the end we will run into the overwhelmingly unpopular \nvote-athon where people can offer amendments to their heart's content. \nIt takes a lot of time to work our way through that.\n  We have two of our more experienced Senators, Senators Judd Gregg and \nKent Conrad, the chairman and ranking member of their committee, and \nthey are going to try to come up with a more condensed version of this \nto cut down the time significantly and maybe even limit the number of \namendments. We have heard that before. But with two men who have so \nmuch experience with this legislation, I hope so.\n  Less than 2 weeks ago, Congress sent the intelligence authorization \nbill to the President's desk with overwhelming bipartisan support. Our \ncountry has been without an intelligence authorization bill for 3 \nyears. That certainly is long enough.\n  Our bipartisan bill will strengthen intelligence capabilities to \nfight terrorists more effectively and keep our cities and towns safer. \nOur bill includes provisions to restore proper congressional oversight \nto the work of our intelligence community, and it includes another \nsimple yet crucial provision that all intelligence professionals across \nall agencies of the U.S. Government must adhere to one standard of \ninterrogation. Torture techniques, including sexual humiliation, \nelectric shocks, electric burns, burns generally, with cigarettes, for \nexample, mock execution, deprivation of food and medical care, and, of \ncourse, waterboarding are un-American, no ifs, ands, or buts about \nthis.\n  There is little more precious to America than our moral authority. \nWith moral authority, we have negotiated peace treaties, ended wars, \nand kept the American people out of harm's way. Our loss of moral \nauthority may be remembered as the most damaging aspect of the Bush \nyears.\n  Outrage at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo led the world to question \nAmerica's commitment to human rights and our moral authority. President \nBush has made it clear that America does not torture. Instead, he says \nwe cannot be telling our enemies our interrogation techniques.\n  I strongly disagree. We should be telling those who seek to harm us \nthat no matter what they do, they will never make us sacrifice the \nvalues that lie at our core. There is no gray area when it comes to \ntorture. It is a moral absolute, and our answer must be absolutely not.\n  When Republicans and Democrats joined together to overwhelmingly pass \nthe torture ban in the intelligence bill, our message was very clear: \nThe damage this President has done to our moral standing in the world \nis not irreversible. It can be restored. We cannot wait for a new \nPresident to begin.\n  The bill now rests on the President's desk. The decision is in his \nhands. Will he continue to assert our country's right to do wrong or \nwill he join the overwhelming bipartisan majority of Congress and the \nAmerican people by signing the torture ban?\n  Reports indicate we should expect a veto. But as the President makes \nhis decision, perhaps he should listen to what is written in the \nmilitary interrogation guideline handbook:\n\n       Use of torture by U.S. personnel would bring discredit upon \n     the U.S. and its armed forces while undermining domestic and \n     international support for the war effort. It could also place \n     U.S. and allied personnel in enemy hands at greater risk of \n     abuse.\n\n  Every time President Bush has sought to continue his failed strategy \nin Iraq, he has said that generals on the ground, not politicians, \nshould be making war decisions. He has called upon us often to heed the \nwords of General Petraeus. What has General Petraeus said on the \nquestion of torture?\n\n       Some may argue that we would be more effective if we \n     sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain \n     information from the enemy. They would be wrong. Beyond the \n     basic fact that such acts are illegal, history shows that \n     they are also frequently neither useful nor necessary.\n\n  We now call upon President Bush to heed the words of General \nPetraeus, along with dozens and dozens of retired generals, bipartisan \nmilitary experts, and the will of the American people by signing the \ntorture ban.\n  As I indicated, we are on the consumer product safety legislation \nthis afternoon. This is an important part of America's agenda, \nespecially based on what happened right before Christmas last year--\nreforming the Consumer Product Safety Commission to make sure that the \ntoys and other products our families use are safe--not only toys but \nother products.\n\n  Last year, more than 20 million dangerous toys were recalled. We all \nheard the terrible news of toys tainted with lead paint from overseas \nreaching our children, or of children having their intestines literally \ntorn apart due to unsafe magnets in toys.\n  Every parent has a right to know that the toys they give their \nchildren will not cause them harm. Yet the Government agency \nresponsible for ensuring toy safety, the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, was employing one person, working in a dilapidated \nfacility, to test toys before they were sold across the country.\n  The $400-plus million a day we are spending in Iraq speaks volumes. \nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission was employing only one person, \nworking in a dilapidated facility to test toys before they were sold to \nparents all across the country. That is outrageous and the tragic \nconsequences are plain to see. Children died from ingesting toxins \nfound in imported toys.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that 27,000 deaths \nand 33 million injuries per year stem from the consumer products under \nits use and regulation; 27,000 deaths, 33 million injuries each year. \nWe cannot prevent every injury. We can do far better than what we have \ndone.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act is bipartisan. It \nprovides comprehensive reforms to restore confidence that the \nGovernment is doing its most basic task, helping to ensure that the \nAmerican people are shielded from avoidable harm.\n  The bill requires third-party safety testing and a comprehensive ban \nof lead in children's products. The legislation helps prevent deadly \nimports from entering our Nation's borders and increases the \nCommission's resources, staff, and facility.\n  The legislation helps ensure that information on unsafe products is \nmade available more widely and quickly and\n\n[[Page S1439]]\n\nthat when an unsafe product is recalled it is actually pulled from the \nshelves and not sold to unsuspecting families.\n  These provisions will help give parents the confidence to know that \nchildren are safe and reduce the risk of injury and death for all \nAmericans. That is why every major consumer advocacy organization in \nthe Nation supports this bill.\n  I hope my colleagues, my Republican colleagues, will follow suit by \nquickly agreeing to allow us to move to this bill. It is a shame we \nhaven't been able to do it now and work today on amendments relating to \nit. We should debate it, do amendments, and move forward as quickly as \npossible and send it to the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1439-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week the Senate squandered an \nopportunity to bring timely help to homeowners rather than propose a \nbipartisan plan targeted at those most in need. Our friends on the \nother side proposed a plan that would have helped some by increasing \nmonthly mortgage payments on everyone else who owns a home. They \nchecked the political box, knowing their plan wouldn't have broad \nbipartisan support. Then we walked away from the problem, leaving it \nunaddressed. It is my hope this week to bring our friends back to the \ntable so the two parties can work together on addressing a crisis that \ndid not go away over the weekend. America's economy is indeed slowing. \nA lot of families are struggling, and we need to work together without \nany more political posturing to help families most in need without \nharming other families or our long-term economic health.\n  Last week, Republicans proposed a variety of measures aimed, first of \nall, at helping those who need it most. The Treasury Department is \nalready working on a number of major lenders to see what can be done by \nkeeping certain mortgages from driving families from their homes. \nRepublicans support these efforts to help families, not bailouts for \nbanks and speculators who are losing money on a bad financial bet.\n  Many families that are making their payments on time are worried \nabout the value of their properties going down, or of the crime rate \ngoing up in places where the foreclosure rate is high. To help them, \nRepublicans are proposing a major tax credit for people who buy \nforeclosed homes in hard-hit areas, provided they intend to live in \nthem.\n  State and local housing financing agencies are well-positioned to \nhelp families that are on the verge of foreclosure. That is why the \nBush administration has proposed that State and local entities issue \n$10 billion in tax exempt bonds and then use the proceeds to refinance \nmortgages that are most at risk.\n  The centerpiece of the Democrat plan to aid struggling homeowners is \nto let bankruptcy judges refinance the terms of their mortgages. This, \nas I have indicated and as the Chicago Tribune editorialized over the \nweekend, might temporarily help some. But it would also lead to higher \nmonthly mortgage payments for everyone else.\n  In California, where the housing crisis is most acute, mortgages for \nfamilies that are making their monthly payments on time would \npotentially go up by nearly $4,000 a year. Homeowners in New York and \nsome other States would potentially see payments go up by nearly \n$3,000. Homeowners in Oldham County, KY--to bring it home to my State--\nwould see their monthly payments go up $2,100 a year.\n  It is not fair to penalize those who do make their payments in an \neffort to help those who can't. This is a principle Republicans are \nproud to defend.\n  Republicans believe the best way to ensure the long-term economic \nwell-being of all homeowners and to create new opportunities for future \nhomeowners is to stimulate the economy, help people keep their jobs, \nand to help workers keep more of what they earn.\n  That is why, in this economy, the Senate should act quickly to remove \nany fear that families have about paying the looming AMT tax. We know \nwe will patch the loophole that puts this target on the backs of \nmillions of middle-class taxpayers. Let us reject the political \nposturing and patch it now, without raising taxes, so families have one \nless thing to worry about.\n  In this economy, the Senate should also remove any uncertainty about \nthe future status of tax credits that have helped millions of American \nfamilies over the last few years.\n  We should extend the child tax credit which saves 44 million families \nan average of about $2,500 annually.\n  We should extend a ban on the marriage penalty so young couples don't \nget hit with a tax just for wanting to start a family.\n  We should extend the research and development tax credit, which is \none of the most effective tools we have in keeping America at the \nleading edge of technology and in creating and retaining high-paying, \nhigh-quality jobs.\n  We should extend renewable energy and energy efficiency tax credits, \nwhich are a proven incentive for increasing the use of wind, solar, \nbiomass, and other alternative forms of energy and a sure way to lower \nour dependence on foreign sources of energy. And we should do this too \nwithout raising taxes.\n  Next week, as we debate the budget resolution, we will see very \nclearly the vision our friends on the other side have for America's \neconomy--a vision of higher taxes, so Washington can spend more of \nAmericans' tax dollars, more regulation, and more litigation.\n  At a time of economic uncertainty, this approach would be a grave \nmistake. In the coming weeks, Republicans will offer a different vision \nbased on a strategy for maintaining our Nation's long-term economic \nstrength and competitiveness.\n  This is a debate we obviously are anxious to have.\n  Hopefully, as the majority leader indicated, we will have an \nopportunity to revisit the housing issue with some kind of agreement \nthat is fair to both sides and gives us an opportunity to actually \naccomplish something in this important area.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, you can't bring back to the table someone \nwho never left. My friend, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, \nsays he would hope we would come back to the table. We never left.\n  Procedurally, we have a unique situation here where you have to move \nto proceed to a piece of legislation. In years past, it was fairly \neasy, just move toward it, and then you got into a position at that \ntime where you started legislating. If people wanted to offer \namendments, they would do that. But since we have gotten into the \nmajority, the Republicans basically have prevented us from doing that.\n  Our legislation is so concise and direct, so easy to understand. The \nPresident has tried to work through the Treasury Department. They have \ncome up with a couple things that deal with less than 3 percent of the \npeople in trouble, less than 3 percent, and it is all voluntary.\n  Our legislation has five issues. Our plan helps families keep their \nhomes by increasing preforeclosure counseling funds. What does this \nmean? We, in our last legislation, put $200 million in that legislation \nto allow people to have counselors. They help a great deal. The reason \nwe did that, in a time of foreclosure, panic around this country, the \nPresident cut funds, for example, in Nevada, for these nonprofit \ncounselors, by 70 percent. You should be increasing them. He cut them. \nThat money is gone. Our legislation calls for more money to keep people \nin their homes so they can have some counseling.\n  Our legislation expands refinancing opportunities for homeowners \nstuck in bad loans. President Bush, in his State of the Union Message, \ncalled for a proposal to allow a process to go forward where you would \nhave bonds to work on homes that were being foreclosed upon and homes \nthat would soon be foreclosed upon. We support that. That is in our \nbill.\n  Our legislation provides funds to help the highest need communities \npurchase and rehabilitate foreclosed properties, CDBG moneys going to \nthese communities that really need to do something about these homes.\n\n[[Page S1440]]\n\n  Our legislation helps families avoid foreclosure in the future by \nimproving loan disclosures and transparency during the original loan \nfinancing process--something Jack Reed has advocated for some time.\n  Finally, it amends the Bankruptcy Code to allow home loans on a \nprimary residence to be modified, only in certain circumstances with \nvery strict guidelines.\n  Those are the five things. If the minority was serious about doing \nsomething with this legislation, they could offer amendments. If they \ndon't like the bankruptcy provision, which they profess not to, let \nthem move to strike it, let them move to modify it in some way. If they \ndon't like any of these other four provisions--money for counselors, \nmaking it more transparent--let them offer amendments to strike them. I \ncan't advocate strongly enough that if they don't like what we have, \nthey can move to change it.\n  I have people on my side who would like to improve our bill. We can \noffer amendments. As I said, we can offer three, five on each side. It \nseems fair. But sadly, when the press conference was held last week on \nthe Republicans' proposal to take care of the housing crisis, they want \nto lower taxes and they want to have tort reform.\n  To talk about our budget expending more taxpayers' dollars, we need \nonly go back and look at how I started my remarks today. Today, we will \nspend $400 million on the war in Iraq, borrowed money. We don't have \nenough money under the present standard to have more than one person \nlooking at the consumer safety commission--toys, for example, that come \ninto this country. So we are willing to work. We are willing to \nlegislate. It has been extremely difficult with 72 filibusters so far \nthis Congress. But maybe today will bring a new day. Maybe we can move \nto the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which is a bipartisan piece \nof legislation, by the way. I would hope after that we don't have to \nuse up the 30 hours. We can start this afternoon offering amendments on \nthis legislation, doing opening statements. But maybe if we spend a \ncouple days on this legislation, we can spend the rest of the week--if \nthe Republicans finally decide what they want to do on the housing \nstimulus package--and finish that before we start the budget battle \nnext week.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Washington Post just this morning--\nand I think we can all stipulate the Washington Post is not exactly a \nmouthpiece for Republicans or conservatism--began their editorial \nrelated to the housing issue this way:\n\n       It's much easier to identify well-intentioned housing \n     policy proposals that might make a situation worse than to \n     craft ones that will help. An example is the Democratic plan.\n\n  This is the Washington Post this morning taking a look at the \nproposal my good friend, the majority leader, discussed extolling the \nvirtues of.\n  Now, look, there is a great opportunity to make matters worse. A good \nway to avoid that is to continue the discussions we can have not \nactually out here on the floor but the kind of discussions we have \nevery day about a process for getting some kind of bipartisan approach \non this bill.\n  I noted with interest that my good friend, the majority leader, the \nother day had his chart up with 72 filibusters on it. He is setting a \nrecord of his own, voting to cut off debate the first day a bill or \nresolution reaches the floor more than any previous majority leader, \nRepublican or Democrat. During the first session of the 110th Congress, \nSenator Reid filed cloture on the same day a bill or resolution was \nintroduced nine times. This is three times more than Majority Leaders \nFrist, Daschle, Lott, Mitchell, and Byrd ever did in a first session of \nCongress and nine times more than in the first session of the 109th \nCongress.\n  Among these 72 Republican filibusters--and I guess, by the way, the \nvote this afternoon, which is probably going to be close to unanimous, \nwill also make the list of filibusters and make it 73--includes \nDemocratic filibusters--for example, Senator Dodd's filibuster of the \nFISA bill last year; Democrats' filibuster of the McConnell-Stevens \ntroop funding bill last November; Democrats' filibuster of Judge Leslie \nSouthwick. Cloture motions that were filed by Republicans in an effort \nto end Democratic obstruction are also included. In fact, on more than \nhalf of the 72 Republican filibusters, Senate Democrats either voted to \nfilibuster or voted with Republicans. On five of the filibusters, the \nvote was unanimous. On four of the filibusters, Democrats nearly \nunanimously voted against cloture themselves. Half the votes described \nas filibusters were actually successful votes where cloture was invoked \nand the bill was actually moved forward.\n  So if we are going to talk about this kind of thing, we at least need \nto get our facts right. Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but \nthey are not entitled to their own sets of facts. Those are the facts \nrelated to times in which we have had cloture votes in this 110th \nCongress.\n  So, Mr. President, back on the issue of housing, I think the best way \nforward, obviously--even though the Washington Post this morning is \nsuggesting maybe we should delay for a while and see whether the \nadministration's efforts produce some positive results--I think the \nbest way forward in the Senate, as always, is to sit down and talk \nabout some kind of process for going forward. I think the majority \nleader and I can do that as we do every day on every issue. I would \nlook forward to having further discussions with him on how we might go \nforward and maybe come up with a bipartisan housing bill that will \nactually improve the situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the 72 filibusters are Republican \nfilibusters, not Democratic holds of any kind, like Southwick, like \nFISA.\n  I would say this: Of course, Democrats voted many times with \nRepublicans to invoke cloture on motions to proceed. We had no choice. \nThe purpose of the filibusters on motions to proceed is to slow things \ndown here. Once cloture is invoked, then they wait for 30 hours, and we \ncan try to do something else after that.\n  Now, I am told--I learned right here today--that it will be near \nunanimous that people vote to go forward on consumer product safety. \nWhy couldn't we have, Friday, avoided this vote and just moved to the \nbill today? That is what has ordinarily been done in the past. The \nreason we hold the record for moving forward on cloture is because we \nhave had so many objections on so many things, such as the motion to \nproceed, which has caused us to waste huge amounts of time.\n  Now, as to the merits of the Washington Post and various newspapers, \nMr. President, we have newspapers all over the country, including the \nNew York Times, which say we should do something on housing. They even \nsupport our provision dealing with changing the Bankruptcy Code to help \npeople who are in such a desperate situation.\n  So if the Republicans want to do something on the housing crisis, we \nare ready to work with them. If they want to do something on consumer \nproduct safety, why don't we start legislating and by consent move to \nit right now. We can avoid the vote this afternoon. We do not need the \nvote this afternoon. We should not have had to file cloture on it in \nthe first place. It is a tremendous delay. We could have legislated on \nthis Friday afternoon, all day Monday morning.\n  We are willing to work with the minority. I hope there is a new day, \nthat we do not have to go through all these procedural hurdles every \ntime. But we have had no opportunity to legislate the old-fashioned way \nhere because every step of the way has been procedurally blocked. That \nis why it has been necessary that we file cloture 72 times on \nRepublican filibusters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1440-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I think all of us \nshould be very slow to try to move toward a stimulus package, in that \nour past efforts, to me, have lacked the kind of credibility necessary \nin these difficult times.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1441-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1441-S1442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COLOMBIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I actually rise today to talk about the \nColombia Free Trade Agreement. I had the tremendous opportunity this \nweekend to travel to Colombia and spend time in Medellin with our \nSecretary of Commerce, our Secretary of Labor, the head of our SBA, Mr. \nSteve Preston, and also a bipartisan group of congressional Members.\n  Mr. President, I know you realize that just this last week, this body \npassed, on a voice vote, the Andean Trade Preference Agreement, which \nallows Colombia, along with other South American countries, to actually \nsend goods into this country tariff free. Let me say that one more \ntime. Last week, by voice vote, unanimously, this body agreed to extend \nthe Andean Trade Preference Agreement that was first put in place in \n1991 that allows Colombian companies to ship into this country tariff-\nfree products for sale in our country.\n  The Colombia Free Trade Agreement would actually allow American \ncompanies--American companies, which employ Americans--to ship goods \ninto Colombia. It is amazing to me we have not been able to vote on \nthis agreement. I realize this has actually been used as a leverage \npoint, if you will, by some of the major unions in our country to \nleverage us into maybe doing some other things.\n  I realize the other body, on the other side of the building, is the \nbody that needs to take up this agreement. But I think most people \nrealize what is taking place at this point in time.\n  I would like to go back in history and cause the American people to \nremember that Plan Colombia, where we, as a country, have invested $5.7 \nbillion into the country of Colombia, is something that has been done \non a bipartisan basis. This was started under President Clinton with a \ncountry that had a very fragile existence due to security, due to \nnarcotics. It was something that was put in place to help our country \nbe more secure. This has been carried through with the Bush \nadministration.\n\n  Mr. President, I have to tell you, it has been incredible the \nprogress that has taken place in Colombia, especially since the year \n2002, under President Uribe's leadership. During that period of time, \nthe country has become far more secure.\n  We were in a city that just a decade ago we would not have been able \nto travel to. Economic growth has continued; 32,000 members of \nparamilitary groups have actually put down their arms and come back \ninto civil society in this country.\n  So we are at a point in time where this country has made tremendous \nstrides. This country has made remarkable progress. They focused on \nhuman rights. Just in February of last year, they set up special \nprosecutors to focus on violence as it relates to union officials and \nhave made tremendous progress.\n  As a matter of fact, today in Colombia, a place where union officials \nin the past had to worry about their safety, it is actually safer--by \nvirtue of violence against union officials--it is safer to be a union \nofficial than it is another member of society: a teacher or someone \nelse.\n  It makes no sense for any of us in this body to not want the Colombia \nFree Trade Agreement to come into existence because today they are able \nto sell products into our country tariff free, but we are not able to \nsell products into their country. If this trade agreement were to come \nabout, Colombia would actually be held to international labor \nstandards. So, in fact, the plight of labor there would be lessened. As \na matter of fact, to have American companies playing a role in Colombia \nwould also be something that would enhance human rights.\n  Over the weekend, a leader of one of the terrorist groups, FARC, \nwhich has wreaked havoc on the citizens there, was killed. It was \nsomething that was done certainly to create even more security there. \nWe have seen the reaction today and yesterday of the leader of \nVenezuela, who has 4,000 to 6,000 troops on the Colombian border--in \nessence, a threat to that country.\n  Colombia has been a friend of our country for many years. They had \npeople fighting side by side with us in the Korean war. They have been \nloyal friends. They have lived up to what we have asked them to do and \nare making even greater progress in some cases than we ever expected. \nThis is about us honoring our friendships. This is about us honoring \nour commitments.\n  I will just say, as it relates to my own State, we have increased \ntrade with Colombia, even under the arrangements that we have now where \nour companies have to pay tariffs on goods going into their country. In \nmy own State, we would increase tremendously the amount of agricultural \nexports going into Colombia if this agreement were passed.\n  In conclusion, we have an ally in South America, an ally that is \nunder immediate threat today but is under continual threat from \ncountries nearby that harbor terrorists who commit terrorist acts \nagainst their country.\n  We have worked with them for years and have invested $5.7 billion or \n$5.8 billion into that country. Trade, we know, is a stabilizing \nfactor. Right now, I think all of us understand that the leadership of \nthe AFL-CIO and other organizations by virtue of their political \nrelationships have been able to keep this treaty from passing, from \nbeing a part of our agreement with Colombia.\n  I think it is important for all of us to understand the negative \nimpact that is having on our own States. As I mentioned earlier, \nfarmers in my own State would benefit tremendously. Manufacturers of \nequipment would benefit tremendously. Chemical and pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers would benefit tremendously. The fact is, in 2006, our \ntrade with Colombia in my own State was up 49 percent, even with these \ntariffs in place.\n  So I hope the leadership of the body across the Hall will very soon \nallow the Members of that body to vote their conscience on this \nparticular trade agreement; to not have a vote where they, in essence, \ndirect people to vote against this agreement but allow people to vote \nfor it because this is good for people all across America as it relates \nto employment. It is good for Colombia in that it shows that they are, \nin fact, our friend. It is good for our national security.\n  It is important for us to have in South America allies who think like \nwe think and want to see democracy flourish, who want to see free \ntrade, who want to see relationships with our people.\n\n  I think at this critical time, especially with the turmoil that is \nexisting in that part of the world, it is important for us to pass this \nColombia Free Trade Agreement.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for allowing me to express my views today. \nI hope we, as a body, will have the opportunity to pass this bill in \nthe near future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Tennessee \nfor bringing up this very important issue. We know from what has \nhappened in Colombia in just the last 2 days that it is so important \nour country help them in every way as they struggle to get rid of the \ndrug trafficking and trade that has plagued\n\n[[Page S1442]]\n\ntheir country for so long. Free trade would be an excellent way for our \ncountry to help them build their economy and keep their democracy alive \nand stable.\n  So I say thank the Senator from Tennessee for talking about that \nissue, which is very appropriate at this particular time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1442-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1442-S1443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 439, the \nnomination of Mark Filip; that the nomination be confirmed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements \nrelating to the nomination be printed in the Record; that the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate resume \nlegislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:\n\n\n                         DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n\n       Mark R. Filip, of Illinois, to be Deputy Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is Mukasey's chief deputy. We have been \ntrying to get this nomination cleared for quite a long time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we continue the process of rebuilding \nthe integrity and independence of the Justice Department by confirming \nthe nomination of Mark R. Filip to be the new Deputy Attorney General, \nthe number two position at the Department of Justice, who acts as the \nAttorney General in the absence of the Attorney General.\n  Regrettably, this important nomination has been stalled for over a \nmonth due to the bad faith of the Bush-Cheney administration in failing \nto process Democratic recommendations to independent boards and \ncommissions, and Senate Republicans' rejection of up-or-down votes on \nnominations to the Federal Election Commission.\n  I commend the majority leader for his efforts to resolve this \nimpasse. I also thank him for agreeing with me to allow the Filip \nnomination to proceed at this time. It is a demonstration of good faith \non his part and I thank him. I strongly support the majority leader in \nhis efforts to make progress by calling up Judge Filip's nomination \ntoday.\n  A little more than a year ago, the Judiciary Committee began its \noversight efforts for the 110th Congress. Over the next 9 months, our \nefforts revealed a Department of Justice gone awry. The leadership \ncrisis came more and more into view as Senator Specter and I led a \nbipartisan group of concerned Senators to consider the U.S. attorney \nfiring scandal, a confrontation over the legality of the \nadministration's warrantless wiretapping program, the untoward \npolitical influence of the White House at the Department of Justice, \nand the secret legal memos excusing all manner of excess.\n  This crisis of leadership has taken a heavy toll on the tradition of \nindependence that has long guided the Justice Department and provided \nit with safe harbor from political interference. It shook the \nconfidence of the American people. Through bipartisan efforts among \nthose from both sides of the aisle who care about Federal law \nenforcement and the Department of Justice, we joined together to press \nfor accountability that resulted in a change in leadership at the \nDepartment, with the resignations of the Attorney General and many \nhigh-ranking Department officials--including then-Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Paul McNulty, whose successor we consider today.\n  The tired, partisan accusations the President engaged in at the White \nHouse recently, in which he used Republican Senators and nominees as \npolitical props, are belied by the facts. They are about as accurate as \nwhen President Bush ascribed Attorney General Gonzales' resignation to \nsupposed ``unfair treatment'' and suggested ``his good name'' was \n``dragged through the mud for political reasons.'' The U.S. attorney \nfiring scandal was of the administration's own making. It decimated \nmorale at the Department of Justice. A good way to help restore the \nJustice Department would be for this administration to acknowledge its \nwrongdoing.\n  We need a new Deputy Attorney General. We need someone who \nunderstands that the responsibilities and duties of that office are not \nto act as a validator for the administration, or as the chief defense \nlawyer for the White House. We are reminded by the examples of Elliot \nRichardson and William Ruckelshaus from the Watergate era--and more \nrecently the examples of James Comey, Jack Goldsmith, and Alberto \nMora--that law enforcement officials must enforce the law without fear \nor favor to their benefactors at the White House. We have now seen what \nhappens when the rule of law plays second fiddle to a President's \nagenda and the partisan desires of political operatives.\n  The truth is that it was the President who deferred the critical work \nof restoring the Department's independence and credibility by delaying \nthis nomination for half a year. This administration knew from at least \nMay 14, 2007, when Mr. McNulty announced that he was resigning, and \nshould have known for weeks before, that there was to be a vacancy in \nthe important position of Deputy Attorney General. Yet even after the \nformer Deputy announced his resignation and proceeded to resign months \nlater, the administration failed to work with the Senate to fill this \nvital position.\n  The President did not nominate Judge Filip until last December. I \nannounced that the Judiciary Committee would hold a hearing less than 2 \nweeks later, before Congress adjourned for the year, immediately upon \nreceiving the necessary background materials from the White House. The \ncommittee moved as expeditiously as possible and we reported out Judge \nFilip's nomination at our first executive business meeting of the 2008 \nsession.\n  What is being ignored by the President and Senate Republicans as they \nplay to a vocal segment of their Republican base is that we have worked \nhard to make progress and restore the leadership of the Department of \nJustice. In the last few months, we have confirmed a new Attorney \nGeneral, and held hearings for the number two and number three \npositions at the Department of Justice, as well as for several other \nhigh-ranking Justice Department spots.\n  It is vital that we ensure that we have a functioning, independent \nJustice Department. A month ago, the Judiciary Committee held our first \noversight hearing of the new session and the first with new Attorney \nGeneral Michael Mukasey. We will hold another oversight hearing this \nweek with FBI Director Mueller. These are more steps forward in our \nefforts to lift the veil of White House secrecy, restore checks and \nbalances to our Government, and begin to repair the damage this \nadministration inflicted on the Department, our Constitution, and \nfundamental American values.\n  We continue to press for accountability even as we learn startling \nnew revelations about the extent to which some will go to avoid \naccountability, undermine oversight, and stonewall the truth. We find \nshifting answers on issues including the admission that the CIA used \nwaterboarding on detainees in reliance on the advice of the Department \nof Justice; the destruction of White House e-mails required by law to \nbe preserved; and the CIA's destruction of videotapes of detainee \ninterrogations not shared with the 9/11 Commission, Congress or the \ncourts. The only constant is the demand for immunity and \nunaccountability among those in the administration. This White House \ncontinues to stonewall the legitimate needs for information articulated \nby the Judiciary Committee and others in the Congress, and \ncontemptuously to refuse to appear when summoned by congressional \nsubpoena.\n  In spite of the administration's lack of cooperation, the Senate is \nmoving forward with the confirmation of Judge Filip today. In spite of \nthe partisan, political display at the White House last month, staged \nwhile a convention of right-wing activists were in town, we are \nproceeding today.\n  With Judge Filip's confirmation, we will have confirmed 23 executive \nnominations, including the confirmations of nine U.S. attorneys, four \nU.S. marshals, and the top two positions at the Justice Department so \nfar this Congress.\n  We could be in a position to make even more progress if the \nRepublican\n\n[[Page S1443]]\n\nmembers of the Judiciary Committee would work with us in considering \nthe nominations of this Republican President. We have had the \nnominations of Kevin O'Connor to be Associate Attorney General, the \nnumber three position at the Department, and Gregory G. Katsas, to be \nAssistant Attorney General of the Civil Division, on our agenda since \nthe middle of February. Three weeks ago, I placed the O'Connor and \nKatsas nominations on the committee's agenda but Republican members of \nour committee did not show up to make a quorum at that meeting or at \nour meeting last week. I adjourned both our February 14 and February 28 \nmeetings for lack of a quorum. At the first meeting, only one \nRepublican Senator was present. At the latter, the ranking member chose \nto leave. I hope we will be able to act on those nominations this week.\n  Of course, we could have made even more progress had the White House \nsent us timely nominations to fill the remaining executive branch \nvacancies with nominees who will restore the independence of Federal \nlaw enforcement. There are now 19 districts across the country with \nacting or interim U.S. attorneys instead of Senate-confirmed, \npresidentially appointed U.S. attorneys, and for which the \nadministration has still failed to send the Senate a nomination. For \nmore than a year I have been talking publicly about the need to name \nU.S. attorneys to fill these vacancies to no avail and urging the \nPresident to work with the Senate.\n  I was disappointed but not surprised to see the administration return \nto tired political attacks. What better time than right now, when the \neconomy is slipping farther off the tracks, when the President's budget \nshows record annual triple-digit deficits, when al-Qaida is stronger \nand more virulent than ever, according to General Hayden and Director \nMcConnell, and with Osama bin Laden still at large, when gas prices and \nunemployment are rising, and a mortgage crisis grips many parts of the \ncountry. I wish the President would put aside his partisan playbook and \nwork with us.\n  I trust that Mark Filip understands that the duty of the Deputy \nAttorney General is to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law not \nto work to circumvent it. Both the President and the Nation are best \nserved by a Justice Department that provides sound advice and takes \nresponsible action, without regard to political considerations--not one \nthat develops legalistic loopholes to serve the ends of a particular \nadministration.\n  I congratulate Judge Filip and his family on his confirmation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1443-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today because it is the 172nd \nanniversary of Texas Independence Day.\n  I wish to take a moment to read a letter that is such an important \npart of the history of Texas. It is the letter of William Barrett \nTravis from the Alamo. This is a tradition I have continued that was \nstarted by my colleague and friend, Senator John Tower, to commemorate \nTexas Independence Day every year, which is March 2. Now, of course, \nMarch 2 was yesterday, which is Sunday, so I always try to do it as \nclose to March 2 as I can, as Senator Tower did when he was serving in \nthis body.\n\n  The Texas Declaration of Independence was a document that was signed \nby, among others, my own great, great grandfather, Charles S. Taylor, \nas well as his great friend, Thomas Rusk, who became one of the first \ntwo Senators from Texas and whose seat I hold today. They both hailed \nfrom Nacogdoches, which is the oldest town in Texas. It is the town \nwhere my mother grew up and where my great, great grandfather was a \ndelegate to the convention that declared independence from Mexico for \nthe territory that was Texas. It is a historic time for Texas. We \ncelebrate Texas Independence Day every single year because we know \nfighting for freedom has made a difference in what Texas is. We love \nour history. We fought for freedom and we were a republic, an \nindependent nation for 10 years. Then, we came into the United States \nunder a treaty as a State.\n  The defense of the Alamo by 189 courageous men, who were outnumbered \n10 to 1, was a key battle in the Texas revolution. The sacrifice of COL \nWilliam Barrett Travis and his men made possible GEN Sam Houston's \nultimate victory at San Jacinto, which secured independence for Texas. \nThat is where Santa Anna, the general in charge of the Mexican Army, \nformally surrendered and that was end of the fight for Texas \nindependence.\n  Colonel Travis wrote to his countrymen a letter asking for \nreinforcements:\n\n       Fellow citizens and compatriots: I am besieged by a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have \n     sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man--the enemy has demanded a surrender \n     at discretion; otherwise, the garrison is to be put to the \n     sword if the fort is taken. I have answered the demands with \n     a cannon shot and our flag still waves proudly from the wall. \n     I shall never surrender or retreat.\n       Then, I call on you in the name of liberty, of patriotism \n     and of everything dear to the American character, to come to \n     our aid with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving \n     reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to 3,000 or \n     4,000 in 4 or 5 days. If this call is neglected, I am \n     determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like \n     a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor and \n     that of his country--victory or death.\n       William Barrett Travis, LT. COL. Commander.\n\n  That was the letter he wrote from the Alamo. He did not get \nreinforcements. Those brave 189 men did, in fact, fight against what is \nestimated to be 4,000 or 5,000 Mexican soldiers, but they held long \nenough for GEN Sam Houston to muster his strength and add to his Army. \nThen, about a month later, in April, the San Jacinto battle did take \nplace against the Mexican Army and Santa Anna surrendered. So it was an \nimportant part in Texas history which we value and celebrate very \nthoroughly every March 2nd. I will continue the tradition of Senator \nTower as long as I am in the Senate, and I hope it can continue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1443-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1443-S1446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORTGAGE CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week we had a debate on the floor of \nthe Senate about three different measures. The frustration was that at \nthe end of the week, nothing happened. Now a lot of people who watch C-\nSPAN and observe the Senate in session wonder if anything ever happens. \nIt seems as though there are a lot of gaps in activity here--so-called \nquorum calls--that seem to go on and on and on, and then you switch to \nanother channel. Of course, if you are a Member of the Senate, there is \na frustration about this if you came here and believed part of your job \nis to try to solve problems facing this country.\n  Early in the week, we tried to start a debate on the policy on the \nwar in Iraq. It was an important debate. It is one we have tried to \ninitiate many times over. Under the way the Senate rules are written, \nthe minority party--the Republican Party--can ``filibuster'' is what \nthey call it around here, which means stretch out the debate until \nthere is no end in sight, and then you file what is called a cloture \nmotion to close down the debate to get to a vote, but you need 60 votes \nto close down the debate. So these cloture motions to stop filibusters \nare brought to the floor, and if you don't have 60 Senators who will \nsay close down the debate and get to a vote, you have to move to \nsomething else. The filibuster worked. Last week, three times the \nRepublicans had successful filibusters, stopping us from debating a \nchange in the policy in the war in Iraq to start to bring American \nsoldiers home.\n  Then, the second vote was a report from the Bush administration on \nthe progress that is being made to capture Osama bin Laden and to stop \nworldwide terrorism. They filibustered that too. They didn't want the \nadministration to report.\n  Then came the housing bill to deal with the mortgage crisis around \nAmerica, and we had six very sound and good ideas to try to deal with \nit. They filibustered that, too, and they stopped it. What \na frustration. At the end of\n\n[[Page S1444]]\n\nthe week, to say we spent all this time--30 hours between each vote, \nincidentally--and nothing happened. Frankly, if we were being paid on \nthe basis of productivity here, none of us deserve a paycheck for last \nweek because we did nothing. There were a few inspiring speeches on the \nfloor, but nothing happened.\n\n  Well, the problem, of course, is the issues we addressed last week \nare still issues this week and will be for a long time to come. The war \nin Iraq is still claiming American lives. We are perilously close--\nsadly close--to 4,000 American soldiers who will have died in a war \nthat has lasted longer than World War II, a war that is going into its \nsixth year, a war that has cost us 4,000 American lives, 25,000 or more \nAmerican soldiers seriously injured, and by the end of this President's \nterm, $1 trillion. We are spending $10 billion to $15 billion a month \non this war. We have this budget that comes along, but we don't have \nenough money for medical research at the National Institutes of Health. \nWe don't have enough money to fund No Child Left Behind so that the \nschools can improve their standards. We don't have money to expand \nhealth insurance coverage for uninsured children in America, but we \nhave enough money to spend $10 billion to $15 billion a month \nindefinitely on this war in Iraq. Is that worth a debate? Is it worth \nit for Senators on both sides of the issue, both sides of the aisle to \nstand up and say where they stand and to vote? I think that is why we \nare here. If it isn't, then I have missed something completely. I am \nhonored to be representing the great State of Illinois, and I don't \nbelieve for a minute that my views are the views of everybody in that \nState. When I cast a vote or make a speech, I go back home and people \nultimately make a judgment as to whether I should continue to represent \nthem.\n  This Senate has now become dysfunctional. This Senate is now wrapped \nup in filibusters. Last year, the Republican minority in the Senate \ninitiated 62 filibusters--62 filibusters in 1 year. It was an all-time \nrecord. The record before that was 62 filibusters in 2 years. They \ndoubled the record number--the rate of the record number of filibusters \nin the history of the Senate. Why? To avoid a vote; to avoid votes on \nissues that may be used against you in a campaign. Please.\n  My good friend, the late Congressman from Oklahoma, Mike Synar, used \nto say: If you don't want to fight fires, don't be a firefighter. If \nyou don't want to stop crime, don't be a policeman, and if you don't \nwant to vote on tough issues, don't run for Congress. I agree with him. \nI don't like facing tough votes, but it is a part of the job. You ought \nto at least have enough confidence in your beliefs to cast that vote \nand go home and explain it.\n  But the Republican side of the aisle is now trying to insulate their \nMembers from even casting tough votes. Is it any wonder the national \napproval rating of Congress is so low after last week, the Republican \nstrategy of filibuster after filibuster after filibuster and at the end \nof the week nothing happened.\n  One of the last things we debated is the housing crisis. I wish to \ntell my colleagues, if you read the newspapers over the weekend and \nthis morning, we are whistling past the graveyard as a nation. Our \neconomy is in serious trouble. I would not use the word ``recession'' \nbecause the recession is, by tight definition, two negative quarters of \nbusiness growth. We have not had that. I hope we don't. But everyone \nknows the economy is in trouble. It is obvious from the unemployment \nstatistics. It is obvious in the disparity of income, where some \nexecutive of a major company can make more money in 10 minutes than a \nworker who works all year in a factory. It is obvious in all the jobs \nwe have lost in this country, good-paying factory jobs, now shipped \noverseas. For those who remain, ask the people working there about the \ncost of their health insurance. It goes up every year and covers less. \nAsk them about their pension plan: Oh, it used to be a good one for my \ndad, but I am in a new group of employees and ours is not so good. That \nis the reality of the economy today.\n  But at the heart of our economic problem is the housing crisis: 2.2 \nmillion Americans will face foreclosure in the few years--2.2 million \nsubprime mortgagers who put a mortgage on their home and now they can't \nmake the payment when the adjustable rate mortgages change. In the old \ndays, you signed up for a 25- or 30-year mortgage and the interest rate \nand term of the mortgage and monthly payments were predictable: \nprincipal and interest. You knew what you were going to face. Not \ntoday. Under subprime mortgages, the mortgage banking industry came in \nwith the most exotic products you could imagine: interest only \nmortgages, mortgages where you pay a little bit now and it changes \nlater on. It became almost impossible to follow. Sadly, a lot of people \nsigned up for mortgages they didn't understand, or that they were \ndeceived into signing. I don't know if you have ever gone through a \nreal estate closing--I have a few times in my life. I went through a \nlot of them as a lawyer. You know what they hand you at closing, that \nstack of papers, they shove it right in front of you and the banker or \nthe realtor, whoever happens to be in the room, says: Well, you need to \nsign all these forms, you and your wife need to sign them.\n  What are they?\n  Oh, Federal forms, Truth in Lending, all of these things; the State \nrequires them, the Federal Government.\n  So you turn the pages and sign and sign and sign, and then they say: \nFine, OK. Thank you very much. You can move into the house next week.\n  You often wonder--I know I have--has anybody ever read those? Do you \nknow what is in there?\n  Do you know what happened to a lot of people? They ended up going \nthrough closings and signing up for mortgages that were downright \nunfair. Many of them were deceived into signing up for mortgages which, \nfrankly, I think were predatory, unfair, and a blight on the mortgage \nbanking industry. That is why so many of them are so-called \n``underwater'' now. Companies and banks are writing off so many of \nthese loans because they were luring people into circumstances that \nweren't possible, and people ended up losing their homes.\n  What happens when 2.2 million homeowners, out of a population of 300 \nmillion people, lose their homes? You think: It doesn't sound like \nmuch, 2.2 million. If a person in your neighborhood files for \nforeclosure or bankruptcy because they are going to lose their home, it \naffects the value of your home, even if you are paying your mortgage \nevery single month. Do you know why? Because the value of your home is \nbased on the average sales price in the area. If the neighbor's house \ndown the street went up for auction because of a foreclosure and sold \nbelow fair market value, it drags your property value down. One out of \nthree homeowners in America now making their mortgage payments \ndutifully will see the values of their home go down through no fault of \ntheir own. The most important asset in your life for most families is \ndiminishing in value because of the mortgage foreclosure crisis.\n  So what does the administration say we should do about this national \neconomic crisis? Not nearly enough. The most forward-looking proposal \nfrom the Bush administration could affect 3 percent of the people \nfacing foreclosure. Three out of one hundred might be helped by their \napproach. That isn't enough. Until we turn this housing crisis around, \nthis economy will not turn around. I think that gets to the heart of \nit.\n  So here is what our bill says. Our bill says we are going to put more \nmortgage counselors out on the street. If you can't make your mortgage \npayment, it doesn't do you any good to hide in a cave. Eventually, they \nare going to catch up with you. Reach out and talk to somebody you can \ntrust. That is what the mortgage counselors are all about.\n  Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island has a provision which I think is so \nsimplistic and straightforward it makes eminent sense. When you sit \ndown at that real estate closing, there ought to be a cover sheet right \nin front of you and it ought to say: You are borrowing X number of \ndollars. You are going to pay X interest rate. That interest rate in 2 \nyears may change to X. Your monthly payment now is X. Your monthly \npayment then will be Y. There is a penalty or there is no penalty for\n\n[[Page S1445]]\n\nprepaying your mortgage. Five pieces of information: none of which are \nthat hard to come up with, but at least as a buyer, right there in \nfront of you, are the basics. You know what you are getting into. \nSenator Reed of Rhode Island put that in our package, our housing \npackage.\n  Well, maybe that would have passed but for one provision. The \nPresident announced last week he would veto our housing bill because of \na provision I added to it. I wish to take a minute to explain it.\n  I think it really gets to the heart of this debate. If you listen to \nthe Presidential campaign, it is all about who controls this place and \nthe House of Representatives. Is it a special interest lobbyist out in \nthe hallway, well dressed and well paid, or will it be the voters and \nthe people in this country? That is the fundamental question of this \nPresidential campaign.\n  Why is Congress tied up in knots and failing to do anything? Who \ncontrols Congress? Whom does Congress answer to? That is the debate \ngoing on across America now. Boy, you would not hear much about it in \nthis Chamber. Why? Because the Mortgage Bankers Association came out \nagainst my provision and said defeat this bill because of this \nprovision.\n  Let me tell you what it does. About a third of the people facing \nforeclosure will end up in bankruptcy court. They will go to chapter \n13, which is an effort to try to work it out, where you say: Here is my \nincome, my assets, and my debts; is there any way I can make payments \nand keep my home and do these things? The court then looks at it and \nbrings in all the creditors and tries to work out a package deal so you \ncan stay in your home, through chapter 13, and get through it.\n  Now, if you are facing hard times and foreclosure on your vacation \ncondo, the court could sit down and work out the terms of your \nmortgage--in terms of the length, how much you will pay, and the \ninterest rate you will pay. If you have a farm or ranch, the court can \ndo the same thing and work out the terms to see if maybe it can work, \nif a package can be put together that lets you keep your properties. \nBut the law specifically prohibits the bankruptcy court from modifying \nthe terms of the mortgage on your home--vacation condo, yes; farm, yes; \nranch, yes; but your home, no. Why is that? It is because the law was \nwritten 20 years ago that says they cannot touch it.\n  Well, we change that law. We allow the court, under specific \ncircumstances, to modify your home mortgage. Let me tell you the \nconditions.\n  First, it only applies to people currently holding a mortgage, not \nprospective, and it is not changing the law forever.\n  Second, it only applies to those with subprime mortgages, the ones \nwith the serious problems.\n  Third, it only applies to those who can qualify to go into bankruptcy \ncourt. Most people cannot get into bankruptcy court because you have to \nprove that your debts are more than your income.\n  Fourth, when they modify the mortgage, they cannot go below the fair \nmarket value of the property. If the property goes into foreclosure and \nthe bank ends up owning it and they sell it at auction, almost never do \nthey get fair market value for it. We say that the fair market value is \nthe bottom line as to what that mortgage can be modified to. We also \nsay the interest rate will be the prime rate plus a premium for risk. \nSo we look at the interest rate.\n  We add another provision. Say you bought the home for $500,000 and it \nis worth $450,000 now. They can work out an agreement in bankruptcy \nthat you can stay in the home and pay the mortgage on $450,000. Then, \nin 2, 3, or 4 years, as the value goes back up to $500,000, that \ndifference goes to the bank, not to the individual. So they are \nprotected on the upside by that provision and on the downside by fair \nmarket value.\n  The mortgage banking industry opposes this. They won on the floor of \nthe Senate last week. Only one Republican had the courage to vote with \nus for this change. Every other Republican Senator voted no. So if \nthere is any question about a scorecard, the mortgage bankers who, \nincidentally, got us into this mess with the subprime mortgages and \nwho, in many instances, deceived people into mortgages that were \ntotally unfair to them and their families, these mortgage bankers \nprevailed. The housing stimulus package failed.\n  I hope we can return to this, and I hope we can do it this week. The \nproblem is still there. Sunday, the Chicago Tribune editorialized \nagainst my bankruptcy provision and said this is going to raise \ninterest rates across the board; that the industry is going to raise \ninterest rates because if they have to face the prospect of modifying \ntheir mortgages, they are going to have to raise interest rates.\n  So I did a little calculation. If 600,000 people go into bankruptcy, \non the upside, and we have about 120 million homeowners in America, \nthat is one-half of 1 percent of those who would be affected by it.\n  So I don't think their fear-mongering is going to work. Sadly, they \ncarried the day last Friday. We have to try again. There is not another \nprovision in this housing stimulus that will reach as many people--even \n600,000--as the provision I have described.\n  I see that the Senator from Pennsylvania is anxious to speak. I will \nwrap up in just a minute.\n  This situation with this provision is very important. When I asked \nthe industry, ``Why do you oppose this?'' do you know what they tell \nme? The ``sanctity'' of the contract. Well, I will tell you, if \nsanctity means holiness, there is nothing holy about the subprime \nmortgages I have been told about or about a subprime mortgage that a \nperson signed up for. For example, a poor lady who is retired, age 65, \nwas lured in by some television ad and had papers pushed in front of \nher at closing. She was told she could save her home if she signed this \npackage. There is nothing holy about what happened to the woman in \nPeoria, IL, who, after her husband faced a fatal illness, had to get \ninto a one-story home so he didn't have to climb stairs. Some adviser \nalong the way convinced her to consolidate all of her debt into her new \nhome with an adjustable rate mortgage, and her monthly payments doubled \nto the point where she cannot now stay in there. There is nothing holy \nabout the mortgage that the couple from Cleveland faced, who came to \nsee us last week. They are both hard-working people, and they are about \nto lose their home outside of Cleveland. They thought they were doing \nthe right thing. In the fine print, it said that the mortgage interest \nrate can never go down, it can only go up. They didn't know that. This \npoor man is a maintenance supervisor. Who told him the real terms of \nthe mortgage? The sanctity of the contract. The holiness of the \ncontract.\n  I will tell you, our job here is to make sure people in America are \ntreated fairly; that big companies, whether they are mortgage banks or \ncorporations, are held to a standard of conduct that recognizes \ncivility, ethics, and moral conduct. What we have seen in this subprime \nmortgage mess--sure, there has been wrongdoing on both sides, but \noverwhelmingly a lot of people have been deceived into losing their \nhomes.\n  The mortgage bankers won the first round last week. Congratulations. \nHats off to them. They clearly have sway over the Congress at this \nmoment. But I hope that changes. I hope some people in the Senate will \nreflect on this and really try to do something about the housing crisis \nand to get our economy back on its feet.\n   I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had been advised that I would have 30 \nminutes in morning business. I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 30 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Before the Senator from Illinois leaves the floor, I had \ncome to the floor to talk about the confirmation of judges, but while \nthe Senator from Illinois is still on the floor and has spoken on a \nsubject he and I have been working on for some time, I would appreciate \nit if he would wait just a few minutes while I engage him in some \ndialog and debate and try to deal with the issue on which we have been \nworking.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to.\n\n[[Page S1446]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois has proposed \nlegislation that would authorize bankruptcy courts to reduce the \nprincipal value of mortgages--so-called ``cram down''. I have \nintroduced legislation that would authorize bankruptcy courts to reduce \nthe interest rates on variable rate mortgages. I have taken the \nposition I have because I believe giving bankruptcy courts the \nauthority the Senator from Illinois has advocated for would have a \nserious, disruptive effect, discouraging lenders from loaning money for \nhome mortgages. I am not alone in that view. Congress expressed that \nview when it expressly barred bankruptcy courts from modifying \nmortgages. Justice Stevens noted this in Nobleman v. American Savings, \nwhen he said the following:\n\n       At first blush, it seems somewhat strange that the \n     Bankruptcy Code should provide less protection to an \n     individual's interest in retaining possession of his or her \n     home than of other assets. The anomaly is, however, explained \n     by the legislative history indicating that favorable \n     treatment of residential mortgages was intended to encourage \n     the flow of capital into the home lending market.\n\n  That is to say, in essence, that if bankruptcy courts could modify \nmortgages, lenders would issue fewer mortgages in the future, a serious \ndisadvantage to Americans who want to buy homes down the road.\n  It is this concern that led me to introduce legislation that would \nallow bankruptcy courts to modify mortgages in a very limited way. My \nbill focuses on the problem by allowing bankruptcy judges to modify \ninterest rates on mortgages where the rate has increased dramatically. \nThe number of these types of mortgages has increased substantially in \nrecent years. In 2001, adjustable rate mortgages accounted for 16 \npercent of all home loans. By 2006, this share had increased to 45 \npercent.\n  The Senator from Illinois has characterized my legislation in \nsomewhat uncomplimentary terms, to put it mildly. He said:\n\n       Specter's language is worse than useless. It's \n     counterproductive. It creates the image of action and \n     response and it does nothing.\n\n  Worse than useless. That is very tough talk, but let's examine what \nthe facts are. The facts are that the rate of delinquency and \nforeclosure on adjustable rate mortgages has been very considerable, in \ncontrast with what has happened on fixed rate mortgages. As payments on \nadjustable rate mortgages have reset, many homeowners have had their \nmonthly payment increase substantially. On average, a $1,200 monthly \nmortgage payment has increased by $250 to $300. Among homeowners with \nsubprime adjustable rate mortgages, the percentage that was either 90 \ndays past due or in foreclosure has more than doubled from 6.5 percent \nin the second quarter of 2006 to 15.6 percent in the third quarter of \n2007. The percentage of homeowners with prime adjustable rate mortgages \nwho are either 90 days past due or in foreclosure has more than \ntripled, from less than 1 percent in the second quarter of 2006 to 3.12 \npercent in the third quarter of 2007.\n  Contrast this with delinquencies and foreclosures among homeowners \nwith fixed rate mortgages. The percentage of homeowners with fixed rate \nmortgages who are either 90 days past due or in foreclosure has \nincreased only slightly from 5.72 percent in the second quarter of 2006 \nto 6.61 percent in the third quarter of 2007. Similarly, among \nhomeowners with prime fixed rate mortgages, the percentage who are \neither 90 days past due or in foreclosure has only increased from .63 \npercent to .83 percent.\n  The point of all this is that adjustable rate mortgages have created \nan enormous problem for many homeowners. But that has not occurred \nwhere there are fixed rate mortgages. So it hardly seems to me that \nArlen Specter's language is ``worse than useless.''\n  It hardly seems that my proposal is counterproductive or that it \ncreates the image of action and response but does nothing.\n  The fact is, it attacks the very core of the serious we face today \nproblem. On one point the Senator from Illinois and I agree--we have a \nvery serious problem. I wish to see this Senate address it. The fact is \nwe could use some constructive work around here. May the Record show \nthe Senator from Illinois nods in agreement. So we have quite a few \npoints here that are not totally Arlen Specter useless.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Senator a question through the Chair?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I don't mind the presumption if the Senator will use his \nmicrophone.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is not turned on. Now it is turned on. I wish to \nrespond through the Chair and not take anything away from Senator \nSpecter's time; that any time I use be taken from me. I will be very \nbrief.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will finish in less time than the Senator from \nIllinois used when he said he was about to finish. I only wish to say \nthat I hope we will take it up in the Judiciary Committee this week and \nreport it out of Committee, which is what ought to be done before it \ncomes to the floor. Then perhaps we will have more time for an extended \ndebate.\n  I will be glad to hear the response from the Senator from Illinois.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nhis effort to cooperate and with me.\n  First, he is concerned about the impact on interest rates if my \nbankruptcy provision goes through. Understand, it only applies to a \nfixed, finite, limited group of adjustable rate mortgagees who are \nfacing foreclosure and going to bankruptcy court. The up-side estimate \nis 600,000. I think more realistically 400,000, 500,000 would qualify.\n  To suggest we are changing the policy of mortgages in America and \nwill precipitate higher interest rates for all Americans from this \npoint forward does not apply. We are dealing with a specific emergency, \na specific crisis, and a specific response.\n  I will readily concede with some humility that my remarks were harsh \nand perhaps strong in relation to the Senator's amendment. But I will \ntell him why I felt that way and why I reacted that way.\n  There is one point in his amendment that he has not said on the \nfloor. He gives the bank the last word. The bank makes the decision \nwhether the mortgage is going to be changed. As long as the bank has \nthe last word, nothing is going to happen. There is not a thing that \nbank cannot already do today in renegotiating the terms of the \nmortgage, and they are not doing it.\n  I have said to the Senator from Pennsylvania that I think that is the \ncritical element, the critical difference in our approach. I believe \nthe bankruptcy court should have the last word. The Senator from \nPennsylvania believes the mortgage bankers should always have the last \nword. I don't think that is a reasonable way to approach it.\n  In terms of the number of adjustable rate mortgages, they are the \nproblem. Six years ago, some estimated that about one out of twelve \nfaced foreclosure. Today the estimate is one out of two. Clearly, the \nproblem needs to be addressed. I tried to narrow my amendment so it \naddresses those now, it does not have a long tail to it, and does not \ngive the bank the last word.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the conclusive response to the argument \nby the Senator from Illinois is that my bill allows the court to reduce \nthe principal on a mortgage--a so-called cram down--if the bank agrees \nand if it is indicated by the facts. What the Senator from Illinois \nfailed to note is that my bill gives full leeway to bankruptcy courts \nto adjust interest rates--which the Senator from Illinois has already \nacknowledged is the real problem.\n  Under current law, the court does not have the power to reduce the \nprincipal on a mortgage. So I added the provision that if the lender \nwere in agreement, and if it makes sense in many cases this option will \ncost less than foreclosing--then extend the authority to court to make \nthat adjustment.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains of the 30 minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 21\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1446-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1446-S1451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JUDICIAL CONFIRMATION PROCESS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, during the past 20 years, we have seen a \nvery serious deterioration in the processes in the Senate on the \nconfirmation of Federal judges. Without a broad sweep of historical \nreference, I believe it has been a very low point in the confirmation \nof Federal judges since the beginning of the Republic, but in order to \nsay that with absolute certainty, there would have to be a very intense \nhistorical survey undertaken.\n  It is plain that since the last 2 years of President Reagan's \nadministration until the present day, the confirmation process has \nbroken down whenever the White House has been controlled by one party \nand the Senate controlled by the other party. In the last 2 years of \nthe Reagan administration, the judicial confirmation process broke \ndown. In the 4 years of the administration of President George H. W. \nBush, the confirmation process was riveted with partisanship. When \nRepublicans gained control of the Senate starting in January of 1995, \nduring the last 6 years of the administration of President Clinton, the \nRepublican Senate retaliated, and more than retaliated; it exacerbated \nthe problem. Then, when the administration of President George W. Bush \ncame, the Democrats were in control for about a year and a half of that \nprocess. Again, the process was stymied. Then it got even worse. Then, \neven though the Republicans had gained control of the Senate, after the \n2002 elections, there were filibusters, which were very destructive to \nthe Senate. Then, there was a very serious challenge to the filibuster \nrule. The Democrats were filibustering President Bush's nominees and \nRepublicans responded with a so-called constitutional or nuclear option \nto change the filibuster rule to reduce the number from 60 to 51.\n\n  During the course of these battles, with one side raising the ante \nand the other side raising the ante, exacerbating the controversy, I \nwas willing to cross party lines and support the nominees of President \nClinton who were qualified. For example, I crossed party lines to \nsupport Judge Marsha Berzon who was confirmed to the Ninth Circuit on \nMarch 9, 2000, and Judge Timothy Dyk who was confirmed to the Federal \nCircuit on May 24, 2000. I supported Judge Richard Paez who was \nconfirmed to the Ninth Circuit on March 9, 2000, and Judge H. Lee \nSarokin who was confirmed to the Third Circuit on October 4, 1994. \nSimilarly, I supported President Clinton's nomination of Judge Gerard \nLynch who was confirmed to the District Court for the Southern District \nof New York on May 24, 2000.\n  I also supported other controversial, nonjudicial confirmations such \nas Lani Guinier to be Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights \nDivision of the Justice Department and the subsequent nomination of \nBill Lann Lee for the same position. I was willing to cross party lines \nand support the nominees of the Democratic President. Now, I believe \nthe Republican caucus is correct. In order to determine which caucus is \nto prevail, I believe the American people are going to have to be \ninformed as to what is going on. It is a picture, which I submit \nrequires correction.\n  Comparing the statistics on the confirmation of President Clinton's \nnominees versus President Bush's nominees shows a significant \ndisparity. In the last 2 years of President Clinton's term, President \nClinton was successful in confirming 15 circuit nominees and 57 \ndistrict court nominees, while President Bush has been successful in \nconfirming only 6 circuit court nominees and 34 district court \nnominees.\n  Looking at the total of 8 years, there is, again, a great disparity. \nIn President Clinton's 8 years, 65 circuit judges were confirmed and \n305 district judges. During the full two terms up to the present time \nwith President Bush, 57 circuit judges have been confirmed and 237 \ndistrict court judges have been confirmed.\n  It is not just a matter of statistics, it is a matter of very \nsubstantial impact on the public, a very substantial impact on the \ncourts, and a matter of very significant unfairness to the nominees \nthemselves.\n  It is impossible with any other statistical analysis to draw any firm \nconclusions because the years overlap. Senator Leahy and I have already \nexchanged extensive, candidly argumentative correspondence, and he has \nmade some points, but a close analysis shows that is not the case. When \nhe cites the confirmations in the year 2007, for example, his figures \nlook good because 13 of the judges were held over from the preceding \n109th Congress. So, if those 13 are extracted, it is not the kind of a \npicture that would show the statistical battle as tilting in his favor. \nBut, I believe it goes much further than the statistics. It goes to \nwhat is happening day in and day out in the Federal courts.\n  There recently was extended publicity given to the Exxon Valdez case. \nThe situation first arose in 1989 when 11 million gallons of crude oil \nwere spilled in Alaska. The district court acted on the matter in 1994. \nThe case is just now coming to the Supreme Court of the United States, \nwhich heard argument last week. In the interim, some 8,000 plaintiffs \nhave died.\n  In the text of the letter which I have sent to Senator Leahy and \nwhich will be included in the Congressional Record, there are the \ndesignations of areas where there are judicial emergencies. ``Judicial \nemergencies'' means that there is an insufficient number of judges to \nhandle the backlog of cases in the courts. That means the people who \nhave gone to court to sue for damages in a personal injury case or to \nsue for defective automobiles or to sue for negligently formulated \nmedicines are delayed. The adage is well established in our lexicon \nthat justice delayed is justice denied. I shall not elaborate in the \nlimited amount of time I have on the many circuits and district courts \nwhere they face judicial emergencies because well-qualified judges have \nnot been confirmed. Here again, I can mention only a few. But one \nnominee, Peter Keisler, whose nomination to the District of Columbia \nCircuit Court has been pending in Committee for more than 20 months, is \na man who graduated magna cum laude from Yale, then graduated from Yale \nLaw School, and was editor of the Yale Law Journal. Editorials in the \nLos Angeles Times and the Washington Post have called for confirmation \nof Mr. Keisler, calling him a ``moderate conservative'' and a ``highly \nqualified nominee'' who ``certainly warrants confirmation.''\n\n  Robert Conrad, nominated to the Fourth Circuit, is nominated to fill \na judicial emergency and has been pending over 220 days. He is rated \nunanimously well qualified and graduated magna cum laude from Clemson \nUniversity. An editorial in the Charlotte Observer stated it is \n``outrageous'' that the Judiciary Committee has not held a hearing on \nJudge Conrad, calling him a ``well-qualified judge who only 3 years ago \nreceived unanimous Senate confirmation,'' and who ``was appointed by \nDemocratic Attorney General Janet Reno to head the Justice Department's \nCampaign Task Force.'' He is a former prosecutor and distinguished \ndistrict court judge who was picked by the Attorney General of the \nopposite party to head a very important campaign finance task force.\n  Nominee Rod Rosenstein for the Fourth Circuit has been pending for \nover 100 days. The American Bar Association rated him unanimously well \nqualified. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, summa cum \nlaude and Harvard Law School, cum laude. Two editorials in The \nWashington Post urged Senate confirmation of Mr. Rosenstein, and one \nstated:\n\n       ``Blocking Mr. Rosenstein's confirmation hearing would \n     elevate ideology and ego above substance and merit, and it \n     would unfairly penalize a man who people on both sides of \n     this question agree is well qualified for a judgeship.''\n\n  I think that statement by The Washington Post is as good a \ncharacterization as you can find. The conduct of the Senate today is \nelevating ideology and ego above substance. So I would urge my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to extend their hands across \nthe aisle, as I did on so many occasions during President Clinton's \ntenure in office. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n\n[[Page S1448]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Eight minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 7 minutes 58 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. The current presidential race \nprovides the Senate with a unique opportunity to come to grips with the \nconfirmation process of Federal judges and to make some very \nfundamental commitments and very fundamental changes to our process.\n  We are in the midst of a Presidential campaign, and I think it is \nfair to say the outcome is uncertain. It has fluctuated tremendously on \nboth nomination pictures. But, this is a time, with the outcome \nuncertain, when neither side of the aisle would know who will gain an \nadvantage; we would not know whose ox was being gored. It is a time, \nstarting in the next Congress--if we can't act now, and my fundamental \nplea is that we act at the present time--we ought not to wait 11 \nmonths, until January 20, 2009. This is a unique time to tackle the \nproblem for the future.\n  On April 1, 2004, I offered S. Res. 327, and I now offer the \nsubstance of that resolution again. The whereas clauses of the \nresolution recited a distressing array of facts similar to what we have \nat the present time, with filibusters by the Democrats and with the \nretaliatory prospect of changing the filibuster rule. The resolution \ncalled for establishing a timetable for hearings of nominees for \ndistrict courts and courts of appeal and the Supreme Court to occur \nwithin 30 days after the names of such nominees have been submitted to \nthe Senate by the President and then to establish a timetable for \naction by the full committee within 30 days after the hearings and for \nreporting out nominees to the full Senate. And then to have a timetable \nfor the full Senate to act within 90 days, with a provision for \nreasonable extension of times, upon agreement of the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and the ranking member or the majority leader and \nthe minority leader to extend the time.\n  This resolution would establish procedures which would guarantee that \nthe confirmation of judges would go back to the good old days, where \nyou took a look at the person's academic credentials, you took a look \nat the person's professional background, you interviewed the \nindividual, you had an FBI background check, and the person didn't have \nto pass some ideological purity test. Or, the individual did not have \nto pass a test such as what Judge Southwick was subjected to on this \nfloor for months and months and months.\n  It was particularly egregious in the case of Judge Southwick. Judge \nSouthwick was a distinguished Mississippi State appellate court judge. \nHe was nominated for the Fifth Circuit, and he had an extraordinary \nrecord, more than 10 years on the State court bench--more than 70 \nopinions. Objections were raised to two lines in two concurring \nopinions. Judge Southwick left the bench and went to Iraq and served \nfor months in the Judge Advocate General's Corps. He was interviewed by \nmany people of the Senate, and his confirmation hung on a thread until \na courageous Senator from the other side of the aisle crossed party \nlines and led the way to get a few votes from the Democrats.\n  You don't have to be a profile in courage to support a judge such as \nJudge Southwick, and you don't have to be a profile in courage to \nsupport a nominee such as Rod Rosenstein or Peter Keisler or Robert \nConrad or the others who were enumerated in my letter--some 10 circuit \ncourt judges and 18 district court judges.\n  I wish to quote a very respectable authority in my concluding \ncomment. A man who has served in the Senate since he was elected from \nVermont in 1974, twice chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and this is \nwhat the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, had to say \non October 5, 2000.\n\n       This year, the Judiciary Committee reported only three \n     nominees to the Court of Appeals all year.\n\n  This is the last year of President Clinton's administration.\n\n       We denied a committee vote to two outstanding nominees who \n     succeeded in getting hearings. I hope we can look again and \n     ask ourselves objectively, without any partisanship: Can we \n     not do better on judges?\n\n  This is Senator Leahy. Going on.\n\n       I quoted Governor George Bush--\n\n  He was in the campaign process at that time in the 2000 election. \nSenator Leahy says:\n\n       I quoted Governor George Bush on the floor a couple of days \n     ago. I said I agreed with him. On nominations he said we \n     should vote them up or down within 60 days. If you don't want \n     the person, vote against them. The Republican Party should \n     have no fear of that. They have the majority in this body. \n     They could vote against them if they want, but have the vote. \n     Either vote for them or vote against them. Don't leave people \n     such as Helene White and Bonnie Campbell, people such as \n     this, just hanging forever without even getting a rollcall \n     vote. That is wrong. It is not a responsible way and \n     besmirches the Senate, this body, that I love so much.\n\n  Senator Leahy, you were right on October 5, 2000, and you are right \non March 3, 2008.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                February 29, 2008.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Patrick: I write in the hope that you and I can work \n     out an accommodation on the confirmation of federal judges \n     without our respective caucuses coming to an impasse. Without \n     going into an elaborate history on the confirmation of \n     federal judges, the essence of the situation is that 15 \n     circuit judges and 57 district court judges were confirmed in \n     the last two years of President Clinton's Administration, \n     compared to 6 circuit court and 34 district court judges for \n     President Bush in 2007-2008. That means there must be \n     confirmations or at least up-or-down votes on 9 additional \n     circuit and 23 district court judges to equal President \n     Clinton's record.\n       President Bush is even farther behind President Clinton in \n     total confirmations when contrasting their entire terms, \n     since President Clinton confirmed 65 circuit court and 305 \n     district court judges while President Bush has so far \n     confirmed only 57 circuit and 237 district court judges. In \n     addition, thus far in the 110th Congress, only 5 of President \n     Bush's circuit court nominees have been granted hearings. By \n     this date in President Clinton's final two years in office, \n     the Committee had held hearings for 10 circuit court \n     nominees. Until the hearing for Ms. Catharina Haynes on \n     February 21, 2008, we had not had a circuit court hearing \n     since September 25, 2007, some 5 months ago.\n       While there have been many hotly contested issues in the \n     Senate in recent years, the most bitter controversies have \n     involved federal judicial nominations. In 2005, the battle \n     over judges reached a high point, or low point, with the \n     Republican caucus threatening to employ the ``nuclear \n     option'' to combat the Democrats' filibusters. In my \n     judgment, in the past twenty years, there has been a great \n     deal of blame split evenly between both sides.\n       As the record shows, I dissented from the Republican \n     caucus's position by casting key votes in favor of several \n     circuit court nominees, including controversial nominees such \n     as Judge Marsha Berzon, who was confirmed to the Ninth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals on March 9, 2000, Judge Timothy Dyk, \n     who was confirmed to the Federal Circuit on May 24, 2000, \n     Judge Richard Paez, who was confirmed to the Ninth Circuit on \n     March 9, 2000, and Judge H. Lee Sarokin, who was confirmed to \n     the Third Circuit on October 4, 1994. Similarly, I supported \n     President Clinton's nomination of Judge Gerard Lynch, who was \n     confirmed to the District Court for the Southern District of \n     New York by a vote of 63-36 on May 24, 2000. I also supported \n     other controversial non-judicial confirmations such as Lani \n     Guinier to be Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights \n     Division of the justice Department and the subsequent \n     nomination of Bill Lann Lee for the same position.\n       Now I believe that my caucus is correct in insisting on up-\n     or-down votes on nominees with extraordinary records, \n     including several who are nominated to fill seats deemed \n     judicial emergencies. A listing of these nominees with their \n     superb qualifications proves the point:\n\n\n                         Circuit Court Nominees\n\n       Nominee: Peter D. Keisler, of MD, to the D.C.

I know you offered to postpone that hearing for a \n     relatively brief period of time, but a formal, written \n     request for a postponement would only have provided more \n     grist for the argument mill on these issues. I was prepared \n     to cancel my previously scheduled work in Pennsylvania to \n     attend the Haynes hearing until Senator John Warner, who was \n     in Washington, agreed to attend.\n       Given the uncertainty of who the next President will be, \n     now would be a good time to change the confirmation process \n     to guarantee prompt action on nominees with up-or-down votes. \n     I again urge you to work for me to establish a schedule for \n     prompt consideration of all currently pending judicial \n     nominees and ensure they receive up-or-down votes in \n     Committee and on the Senate floor. I have shared this letter \n     with the other Republican members of the Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to commend the ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee for his comments, which I first watched from my \noffice and then came to the floor.\n  I can recall, and I believe the Senator from Pennsylvania mentioned \nthis, the Berzon and Paez nominations at the end of the Clinton \nadministration, where there was a lot of discontent on the Republican \nside of the aisle--strong feeling that these nominees were \nideologically unacceptable. I remember then-majority leader in the \nSenate, Senator Lott, saying: We don't want to set the precedent that \nthe ideological leanings of these nominees will deny them an up-or-down \nvote.\n  I, similar to Senator Specter and Senator Lott, voted for cloture on \nthose nominations, not to kill them but to move them forward. It was a \nvery important decision on the part of then-Majority Leader Lott to \nprevent, to the maximum extent possible, the kind of meltdown that \nseems to have occurred in this Congress to which Senator Specter was \nreferring.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, the majority leader, Senator Reid, \nand I discussed the need for the Senate to have a fair, less-\ncontentious confirmation process. To his credit, I think that is his \nview and his goal. We have made some progress on circuit court \nnominations last year. We didn't match President Clinton's number from \nthe first session of his last Congress, but we came close. Now, we had \none notable bump along the way and Senator Specter referred to that and \nthat was the nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick. But we were able to \nget him through, thanks to, as Senator Specter pointed out, the \ncourageous decision on the part of particularly one Senator on the \nother side. It was good for the institution that we did that.\n  Unfortunately, the prospect of turning the page on judicial \nnominations, a goal which I think all but the hardiest partisans share, \nhas taken a wrong turn. Despite the best efforts of Senator Specter and \nothers, progress has all but ground to a halt. There have been no--I \nrepeat, no--judicial confirmations so far this year--not one. There has \nbeen only one hearing on a circuit court nominee since September of \nlast year.\n  Let me say that again. So far this year, the second session of the \n110th Congress, not a single judicial confirmation--not one. With \nregard to circuit court nominees, only one hearing since September of \nlast year.\n  It is puzzling why progress has almost totally stopped. Some like to \nblame the President, but as the ranking member, Senator Specter, has \nnoted, there are several circuit court nominees who have been pending \nfor hundreds of days who have yet to receive a simple hearing--a \nhearing--let alone a committee or floor vote. In addition, many of \nthese nominees satisfy most or all the chairman's specific criteria for \nprompt consideration. They have strong home State support--check the \nbox on that--they fill judicial emergencies, and they have good or \noutstanding ABA ratings.\n  All these nominees Senator Specter referred to meet all those \ncriteria. So it is puzzling why it is taking so long to move them. I \nhope the committee is not slow-walking these nominees based upon \ndecade-old grievances, both real and imagined. That might be \nemotionally satisfying, but it will set a precedent that will serve us \nill, regardless of who is in the White House and which party controls \nthe Senate next year.\n  So I would hope our Democratic colleagues resist the desire by some \nto drag us into the judicial confirmation brinkmanship and establish a \nprecedent they will regret. I hope they will treat these nominees \nfairly, before it is too late.\n  Again, I wish to particularly commend Senator Specter, our Republican \nleader on the Judiciary Committee, for pointing this out. He has \nexcellent credentials to make this point because he made similar \narguments when there was a Republican Senate and a Democratic President \nwhen he felt Members on our side of the aisle were being dilatory in \nproviding fair consideration.\n\n[[Page S1451]]\n\n  We know what the standard is. Each of the last three Presidents have \nended their tenures in office with the opposite party in control of the \nSenate. We know that.\n  We know that the average number of circuit court judges appointed in \nthe last 2 years of each of these three Presidents, when the opposite \nparty controlled the Senate, was 17. We know the low end of that was \nPresident Clinton with 15. Right now, we have six. Even meeting the low \nthreshold of President Clinton is a long way away.\n  Senator Specter has pointed out a way to meet that standard by \nreporting out of committee and confirming people who meet all of the \ncriteria that have been specified by the chairman of the committee.\n  I commend Senator Specter for his comments. I hope they will be \nheeded by people on both sides of the aisle here in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 2663, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to consider Calendar No. 582, S. 2636, a \n     bill to reform the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \n     provide greater protection for children's products, to \n     improve the screening of noncompliant consumer products, to \n     improve the effectiveness of consumer product recall \n     programs.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 5:30 p.m. shall be equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, this is a historic day for the Senate \nbecause we have the opportunity, starting today, to consider the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission Reauthorization Act.\n  What I would like to do, if I may, is, when Senator Stevens of Alaska \ncomes--apparently he has an urgent, pressing need, and he cannot stay \nfor what would have normally been his allotted time. I would like to \nallow him to use his time--I think it is about 10 minutes or so--to \nspeak, and we will cross that bridge when he walks in.\n  For most Americans, when they hear the term ``CPSC,'' they think of \nsome sort of alphabet-soup Federal agency. They do not really \nunderstand what it does, why it exists, or why it is important.\n  In fact, I had that same reaction back when I was the attorney \ngeneral of my State. I was out playing in my front yard with my kids, \nand my kids had some toys, and they were called Star Wars Lightsabers. \nThey are like flashlights, but they look like a lightsaber. They were \nout there playing around, and one of my neighbors came up and said: \nWait a minute, I think those have been recalled. Well, I did not know \nwhether they had been recalled. She did not know for sure. I asked her, \nand she said: Well, I think I saw something on television about that, \nbut I am not sure.\n  Well, one thing led to another. It was very hard for me to figure out \nwhether my children's toys had been recalled. So through a process at \nthe State Attorney General's Office in Arkansas, we established a Web \nsite called childproductsafety.com, which had the goal of making it \neasier for parents like me and grandparents to go to one Web site and \nfind all the recalled children's products that are out there. All we \nreally did was link to the CPSC Web site. But that gave me my first \nexperience with working with the CPSC, and it was through that process \nthat I began to understand how important they are and why we need a \nvery strong and capable Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n  To reinforce this, last year I became the chair of the Subcommittee \non Consumer Affairs as part of the Commerce Committee. When I looked at \nall of the various consumer issues--and there are many we can focus \non--I decided that the subcommittee's top priority should be to \nreauthorize the CPSC. The reason I did that is because in 2006 we had \nseen a record number of recalls. We began working on this, and we \nrealized that because of the changes in the marketplace, because the \nU.S. marketplace had changed a lot because of imports--and a lot of \nother changes going on in the marketplace--we realized the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission had not kept up with the times. So we made a \nconcerted effort to get the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nreauthorized.\n  We started that about a year ago, had a few hearings, and then, over \nthe summer of last year, we began to see the toy recalls. I may have it \nwrong, but I think it was the Chicago Tribune which had the first \nstory. But after that, a series of national news stories came out--\ntelevision, radio, newspaper, and other media like the Internet and \nnews magazines--to talk about the record number of toy recalls from \nlast year.\n  In fact, if you look at the Consumer Product Safety Commission, every \nyear they think there are about 28,200 deaths and about 33.6 million \ninjuries from the products the CPSC overseas. They oversee 15,000 types \nof products. So when you see big numbers such as this, you have to \nunderstand that these numbers cover almost every product in the \nAmerican marketplace, with a few exceptions. There are a few things in \nthe automotive world and a few other things that it does not cover, but \nby and large, consumer products are covered by the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission.\n\n  We saw this again last year. We saw a record number of recalls. We \nthought 2006 was a bad year, but 2007 was even worse. What we are \nseeing now is we are seeing an escalating effect. We are seeing more \nand more products being recalled all the time.\n  So let me give a very quick background, again, for a lot of the \nstaffers watching in their offices and for the Senators who have not \nyet made up their mind on how they are going to approach this Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission legislation and maybe some amendments. Let me \ngive a few minutes of background to talk about why we are here today \nand what role the CPSC plays and why it is so important to Americans \nall over this great country.\n  First, let me say that the CPSC was established in the 1970s. They \nhave done a good job. In fact, I wish to praise the employees at CPSC, \nbecause what you have seen in the last few years is a dwindling budget. \nIt has either been flatlined or they have had cuts. You have seen the \nstaff there shrink over time.\n  Let me give you the CPSC overview that they have on their Web site. \nIt says:\n\n       The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with \n     protecting the public from unreasonable risks of serious \n     injury or death from more than 15,000 types of consumer \n     products under the agency's jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, \n     and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the \n     Nation more than $800 billion annually.\n\n  Let me read that again for those folks who are watching in their \noffices here.\n\n       Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product \n     incidents cost the Nation more than $800 billion annually. \n     The CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families \n     from products that pose fire, electrical, chemical, or \n     mechanical hazard or could injure children. The CPSC's work \n     to ensure the safety of consumer products, such as toys, \n     cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters, and household \n     chemicals. . . .\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera.\n  The CPSC is a very important agency, and it is one that, \nunfortunately, Congress and the White House over the last several years \nhave neglected. It is very important that we reauthorize the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission. It is long overdue and has not been done \nsince 1990 in a major way. There was a little reauthorization in 1992, \nbut\n\n[[Page S1452]]\n\nthis is 18 years in the making. And we have seen a lot of changes in \nthe American marketplace in the last 18 years.\n  Another thing I would like to mention is the personnel at the CPSC. \nWhen the CPSC was in its early days in 1977, they had 900 employees, \nfull-time employees, at the CPSC. Today, they have 420. So this agency \nis less than half the size it used to be. That is a problem. Again, \nespecially considering the changes in the marketplace, that is a \nserious problem. But the approach taken in our legislation, S. 2663, is \nnot just to throw money or to throw people at a problem but actually to \nrestructure the agency and retool the agency so it can be smarter and \nmore effective from top to bottom.\n  One of the problems, one of the challenges we have with the CPSC \nright now is the matter of a quorum. Back in the old days, back in the \n1970s when the CPSC was set up, there were five Commissioners. \nSomewhere along the line, that got changed to three Commissioners. \nToday, there are only two Commissioners at the CPSC--only two \nCommissioners--and they have a statute that says that after a certain \ntime, they cannot function with two Commissioners. So last year, we had \nto get a provision added to the law to allow them to function with just \ntwo Commissioners. This bill contains that same provision, but also I \nthink this bill makes a very important change; that is, it returns the \nCPSC to the five-member Commission it used to be.\n  Why is that important? Think about the number of products this \nCommission oversees. In some ways, I think it is a little bit like the \nFederal Trade Commission or the Federal Communications Commission or \nsome of these other Commissions that have a lot of jurisdiction. What \nit is, when you have five members, they are able to generally \nspecialize in various areas. When you talk to Commissioners on those \nother Commissions, they think that is very important. And when I have \ntalked to former CPSC Commissioners, they think it is doing a great \ndisservice to the country to only have three Commissioners. When you \nonly have three, everyone has to be a generalist and you do not have \nenough manpower to specialize in everything.\n  One of the things this bill does is fix that problem. It fixes the \nimmediate quorum problem until the full five Commissioners of the CPSC \ncan be reappointed, but it also fixes the long-term problem of having \nthree Commissioners versus five Commissioners.\n  The next thing I wanted to mention is there is, in our bill, in \nsection 10, a very important provision that is a major innovation and a \nmajor improvement over existing law, and that is third-party \ncertification for children's products. In other words, if this law \npasses, we are going to set up the situation where children's products \nwill have to be certified by a third party. This is something which has \nworked in other contexts--that is, generally speaking, most industries. \nI am not saying every single company, but most like this innovation.\n  The goal here is to keep these dangerous products off our shores if \nthey are made overseas and certainly keep them off our shelves by \npreventing any need for recall in the first place. If you have third-\nparty certification, you would hope you would see fewer and fewer \nrecalls over time.\n  I see my colleague from Alaska has walked in, and as I understand it, \nhe has some constraints on his schedule today. So I will be glad to sit \ndown and hear from him.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank Senator Pryor very much. I am involved in a \nseries of classified briefings with Senator Inouye, but I did want to \nmake these comments.\n  Mr. President, this measure provides greatly needed resources and \nimproved enforcement authority for the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission. And this bill has come a long way throughout this whole \nprocess. I thank Senators Pryor and Inouye for allowing me to work so \nclosely with them to negotiate this bill. I consider it to be a solid \nand fair compromise position.\n  One of the favorite parts, I believe, of being a Senator is when we \nhave a chance to improve the lives of children. This bill contains \nseveral important provisions to improve toy safety. When a child \nunwraps a gift on his or her birthday, the surprise should be what the \ntoy is, not whether the toy is unsafe. It should not have dangerous \nsubstances or unsafe parts. Under this bill, children's products would \nrequire certification that they meet all applicable safety standards. \nAlso, the testing and certification process would be strengthened to \nensure the integrity of the testing.\n  Today, toys are not purchased the way they used to be. E-commerce \nallows Alaskans and many people throughout rural States the opportunity \nto find many products that are not on the shelves in rural towns. But \nit can be difficult for a parent to judge a product based on the \nmanufacturer's description or photo of a child's toy. This bill would \nmandate that all Internet Web sites are labeled so that consumers are \ninformed of any choking hazards or toys that are not suitable for \nchildren under 3 years of age.\n  There is another provision that has been included at my request, that \nI think is very important to my home state of Alaska, and also to the \nmillions of Americans who use all-terrain vehicles, ATVs, every day for \nwork and recreation. With the popularity of the ATVs, many domestic and \nforeign manufacturers are producing more of these vehicles in an effort \nto meet increased consumer demand, and many of the new market entrants \nare from China or Taiwan. The ATV provision in the bill would require \nall persons who market and sell ATVs in the United States to meet the \nsame stringent safety requirements that are currently followed by major \nATV manufacturers producing in the United States. The provisions also \nwould preserve the authority of the CPSC to establish additional \nmandatory ATV safety rules through the normal rulemaking process.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Pryor, and our chairman, Senator \nInouye, for working so diligently on this legislation. It has been a \nprivilege to work with them to craft a piece of legislation that will \nhelp protect the public from dangerous products and return consumer \nconfidence in the marketplace. I look forward to working with them in \nthe Senate to try to get this bill to conference with the House, so we \ncan send it to the President. This is a needed bill.\n  I have called the attention of the Senate to the ATV problem several \ntimes previously this session. I am happy this provision is included in \nthe bill.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, again, I want to give a special thanks to \nSenator Stevens because he really has helped make this bill bipartisan \nand make it possible that we could actually pass this bill, hopefully, \nthis week. So, I say to Senator Stevens, thank you for all that you \nhave done to make this legislation better.\n  Let me get back, if I may, to the bill itself. What I am trying to \ndo, a lot of it is for the staff, or folks who are watching in their \noffices, and people around the country so they can understand what we \nare trying to accomplish. I want to run through the provisions of this \nbill. It is rather lengthy, but I will try to give an abbreviated, \nhighlighted reel of what is in this bill.\n  A few moments ago we talked about third party verification for toys. \nThis toy, the Thomas and Friends Railway Toys, in some ways became \nalmost a poster child for the problem. It had lead. These are toys \ndesigned specifically for young children, little toddlers, and little \nkids. You know how children do. They put things in their mouths or \nscratch on them or crawl all over them. No telling where they end up. \nThe fact that you see lead in so many toys today is a great concern.\n  We are trying to fix that. I mentioned one of the major innovations \nof this legislation is the third party certification. The other thing \nwe want to do is put tracking label information on the toys. We have \nall been there. As parents we have had dolls or whatever the case may \nbe. We like the doll; the doll is passed down from one child to \nanother, maybe from a grandparent, a neighbor, who knows what it may \nbe. But there is really no identifying information on that doll. So \nthis bill makes sure that as practical as it can be, we are going to \nput that identifying information on it.\n  I mentioned the Star Wars lightsabers a few moments ago. You\n\n[[Page S1453]]\n\ncan go on the Internet right now or to a toy store, and there are \nprobably 10 or 20 different varieties of those lightsabers. So if they \ndid a recall, it is important that there is something on there, some \nbatch number or some ID number that parents and grandparents can know \nand, in fact, daycare can know when those toys should be taken away \nfrom their children.\n  Another major improvement is the corrective action plans. Some people \nmight call these voluntary recalls. Sometimes they do end up in \nvoluntary recalls--not always. But the importance of the corrective \naction plan is that as it stands today, basically under current law--I \nbelieve it is fair to say--it is up to the manufacturer to come up with \na plan. Under this bill, if this bill were to pass and become law, that \nshifts, and it means the Consumer Product Safety Commission lays out \nthe parameters of that action plan. That is a very important shift in \nresponsibility.\n  Believe it or not, with a lot of these products that come onto our \nshores today, we have no idea who makes them. Right now it is not clear \nwhether the CPSC even has the authority to ask the question about who \nactually makes the product, in many cases a toy. This bill fixes that. \nWe also go through a long list of prohibitive acts. Some of those are \njust clarifications. Sometimes we make it clear in the law that it is \nunlawful to sell or distribute a product that has been recalled. Right \nnow there is no law on the books that says it is unlawful to do that. \nIt clarifies that. We go through a long list of things that you can't \ndo. For example, you can't take a recall product and dump it on Third \nWorld markets. You can't take a recall product and send it over to \nDollar Stores. You can't just willy-nilly go out and sell it on the \nInternet.\n\n  We have a list of prohibited acts. These are commonsense acts. These \nare acts that will save lives if this law is implemented.\n  We also enhance the penalties over what they are today. Again, the \npenalty section is a little complicated. Under current law, our fix \ntherefore is a little bit complicated. I don't want to spend a lot of \ntime on it today. But the committee bill actually had a $100 million \ncivil penalty. We have chopped that down now with a bipartisan \ncompromise to $10 million, plus an additional $10 million if there are \naggravated circumstances. We doubt that will be triggered very often, \nbut we think it is important for the CPSC to have that added ability to \nenhance that penalty, to go after the really egregious behavior, maybe \nrepeat offenders, maybe people who are just absolutely thumbing their \nnose at U.S. law.\n  Sharing information with Federal, State, local, and foreign \ngovernments is very important. Again, we believe the information \nsharing is good. We have talked about stove piping when it comes to \nintelligence, when it comes to homeland security, when it comes to DOD. \nWe have talked about the stove piping and how unhelpful that can be. We \nfeel the same way about this type of information. We need to share this \ninformation and make it available to State governments, local \ngovernments, foreign governments, et cetera.\n  We also have a financial responsibility provision in this law. Again, \nthis is a big improvement over current law. What we do with financial \nresponsibility is under certain circumstances a company may have to \nhave an escrow where they put certain dollars in or they have proof of \ninsurance or they provide some sort of security. Again, I don't think \nthe CPSC will require that all the time, but we give them that \nauthority because right now they don't have it.\n  We also are asking the GAO to do a study and get back to Congress \nabout injuries to minority children. There is anecdotal evidence that \nthese defective and unsafe products disproportionately harm minority \nchildren. We don't have the facts to know that for sure, but there is \nsome anecdotal evidence to that effect. We want to make sure GAO takes \na good look at that and lets us know.\n  There are a lot of other miscellaneous provisions in here. I will not \nspend too much time on these, but there is a provision about child \nresistant portable gasoline containers. We have seen this problem all \nover the country for a long time. There is not a national standard. \nMost people are surprised to know that. We want to have one standard \nthat is a good standard, and this bill takes care of that. We want a \ntoy safety standard. There is not even a toy safety standard on the \nbooks. There is one in the private sector that industry has agreed to. \nWe want to codify it. We want to make sure we have a strong toy safety \nstandard.\n  All-terrain vehicles, Senator Stevens mentioned something he has been \nworking on a long time, and so have I, as part of the Commerce \nCommittee. There is a garage door standard. Right now almost all garage \ndoors--it is not required in most States--have two mechanisms for \nsafety. One is like a laser beam mechanism, and the other is a motor; \nthat if it feels too much pressure, it will stop or go back up. That is \nnot required. We want to make sure on the Federal level all the new \ngarage doors have those two safety mechanisms because we believe that \nwill save lives.\n  I can go through a lot of other issues with regard to this \nlegislation. Let me cover three of the issues that have been somewhat \ncontroversial. I want everybody to hear what I am saying about these \ncontroversial issues because we have found common ground. We have found \nthe commonsense solution to some issues that had been very \ncontroversial and very negatively received as this bill came out of \ncommittee, but we have made major changes to these three areas.\n  First is the database. The goal is to have more transparency in the \nsystem. I will talk about this in the upcoming days. But we are trying \nto fix a real-life problem that has caused a lot of injuries. That is, \nthere are many examples of when a product is dangerous, and that \nproduct is being sold in stores, people are buying it, people are using \nit, but the CPSC is in negotiations or discussions with the company, \nthat product has been identified as dangerous, but the public doesn't \nknow about it. We are trying to provide the transparency. The public \nhas a right to know. So we have been working on this for a year. We \nhave come up with this database idea. We have put a lot of parameters \naround it. If it is not true information or not accurate, it can be \npulled off, and the companies are able to list an explanation. We don't \nidentify the people, so you would not be able to use this, for example, \nwhere trial lawyers could go out and troll around and find new \nplaintiffs. We have tried to build in safeguards around this to take \nthe objections away. But at the end of the day, if someone has a better \nidea on how to increase this transparency, we would love to hear about \nit. So far the best thing we have been able to come up with is this \ndatabase.\n  The second controversial provision--and it was very controversial \nwhen it came out of committee--is this State attorneys general \nprovision. I am a former State attorney general, so the AG provision is \nnot going to cause me as much heartburn because I have lived through \nthat for 4 years. I know how the State AGs work, and I know how \ndiligent and careful they are. They have to manage their resources as \nwell. But we have done two major things to the provision that came out \nof the committee.\n  First, we make sure--and we write it into the statute. We make sure \nthe State attorneys general have to follow what the CPSC does. They \ncan't get out in front of the CPSC. We are not going to have 51 \ndifferent standards out there. They follow what the CPSC does. We made \nthat very clear in the statute. The second thing is, we limited the \nState AGs to injunctive relief only.\n  So the situation that would be the most common would be that the CPSC \ndoes a recall, 6 months later in a State, whatever State it may be, \nthey notice these recall products start to end up in the Dollar Store. \nWell, the CPSC has moved on. They are working on other things now. They \ndon't have the resources or the time to deal with that. But the State \nmight. If it is important enough for a State AG, he can get an \ninjunction and make sure those products come off the shelf. These are \nproducts already identified as dangerous. We are not letting the States \nget out in front of the CPSC on this issue. They are following the \nCPSC. It is limited only to injunctive relief. We believe we have found \nthe balance there.\n\n[[Page S1454]]\n\n  The last thing I want to talk about in terms of the controversial \nparts of this legislation that have changed substantially since we have \ncome out of committee is the whistleblower provision. The goal is to \nmake sure people are not punished for doing the right thing. If an \nemployee finds something his company is doing and he actually tells the \nCPSC about it and he later gets fired, we want to make sure he has some \nwhistleblower protections such as in other areas of Federal law. We \ntook this provision from a transportation act, the STAA, that the \nSenate passed not too long ago. So it is based on existing law. We have \nsome statistics on how it should really work. So I want to encourage my \ncolleagues to look at that.\n\n  Mr. President, how am I doing on time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 28 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. PRYOR. OK. Mr. President, let me speak just for another couple \nminutes. I see a couple colleagues coming in the Chamber to talk.\n  There has been a little bit of discussion about the House bill. \nAgain, I want to thank our House colleagues for working hard down the \nhall here in getting a bipartisan bill. We have a bipartisan bill. But \nI think there are three fundamental differences between their bill and \nour bill.\n  One, our bill has more transparency. I think that is good. I think \nthat is something we, the Senate, should insist on.\n  Second, our bill has more enforcement. We are able to get these \nproducts off shelves quicker and able to make sure they stay off \nshelves more so than the House bill.\n  Third, our bill is more comprehensive reform. I have gone through a \nlong list of items on how our bill has a lot of comprehensive reform in \nit.\n  I think our bill should stand. I understand there are some people who \nmight be interested in looking at the House bill and some of those \nprovisions, but I think when you lay them down side by side you will \nsee the Senate bill is stronger because it is more transparent, there \nis more enforcement, and it is more comprehensive.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I will be glad to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the great Senator from \nArkansas for his leadership on this issue and handling the whole \npackage having to do with the Consumer Product Safety Commission. He is \nthe chairman of that subcommittee in the Commerce Committee. He has \ndone an excellent job. He has crafted together all the ideas.\n  The one little idea this Senator contributed is the requirement of \nindependent testing of the products when they come out of these foreign \ncountries because of the experience we had with China in which they had \nall these tainted toys that were coming in and hurting our children \nbecause they did not have any independent testing. It was like the fox \nguarding the hen house. You cannot put a fox in there and know that the \nhens are going to be safe unless you have someone who is independent to \nsee that those items that are coming from another country are, in fact, \nsafe.\n  I thank the Senator for the leadership he has given us and reaching \nout and melding a number of these ideas: the increased staff, the \nincreased spending--which the CPSC Acting Chairman even said she did \nnot want, of all things--and the independent testing, the standards. I \nexpress my appreciation to the Senator.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Minnesota is \ngoing to speak next, but I would ask the manager of the bill if he \nwould be willing to enter into a unanimous consent agreement where it \nwould just sequence our statements on this bill so that I would follow \nthe Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nReform Act of 2007 represents some of the most sweeping reforms we have \nseen in consumer product safety laws in 16 years. In fact, the Wall \nStreet Journal called it ``the most significant consumer safety \nlegislation in a generation.''\n  I am proud to be a member of the Commerce Committee that passed this \nlegislation under the leadership of Chairman Inouye, Senator Stevens, \nand Consumer Subcommittee Chairman Pryor, and with the help of Senator \nBill Nelson and Senator Durbin. I thank all the Senators for their help \non this bill.\n  I am pleased this legislation contains two key bills that I drafted. \nThe first bans lead in children's toys, and the second makes it easier \nfor parents to identify toys once they have been recalled.\n  This bill is not just a matter of implementing consumer safety laws \nand regulations, it is a matter of protecting consumers from harmful \nproducts. This bill is a matter of saving the lives of children. We \nhave seen children who have died from lead paint or choking on toys. It \nmeans saving lives like that of a little boy named Jarnelle from \nMinnesota, who died after swallowing a charm that was 100 percent lead. \nThat is how I got interested in this bill.\n  This bill is a matter of helping parents to understand toy recall \nprocedures and making it easier to identify toys that are not safe. It \nis a matter of keeping consumers informed about whether products are \nsafe and where the products are from. It is getting serious about \nconsumer safety.\n\n  This is a good bill, a comprehensive bill, and a necessary bill. With \nthe bipartisan help of our Senate colleagues, we can pass a meaningful \nconsumer safety bill that gives the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nthe tools to do their job and also sets clear and unequivocal standards \nfor consumer products in this country.\n  It is clear that the current system we have in place is broken. It is \nbroken for the most vulnerable consumers: the children in this country. \nIt needs to be fixed.\n  In 2007, nearly 29 million toys and pieces of children's jewelry were \nrecalled--29 million. They were recalled because they were found to be \ndangerous and, in some cases, deadly for children.\n  As a mother and as a former prosecutor and now as a Senator, I find \nit totally unacceptable that toxic toys are on our shores and in our \nstores. When I first got involved in this issue last June, my 12-year-\nold daughter was not that excited because it involved things such as \nSpongeBob SquarePants. But when the Barbies started to be recalled, she \ncame into the kitchen and said: Mom, this is getting serious.\n  As we all know, the Consumer Product Safety Commission's last \nauthorization expired in 1992, and its statutes have not been updated \nsince 1990. Not surprisingly, the marketplace has changed greatly in 16 \nyears, and this summer we saw firsthand how ill-equipped the Commission \nis to deal with the increased number of imports coming into this \ncountry from other countries that clearly do not have the same safety \nstandards as our country.\n  Today, the Commission is a shadow of its former self, although the \nnumber of imports has tripled--tripled--in recent years. As the number \nof recalls is increasing by the millions, the number of Commission \nstaff and inspectors at the Consumer Product Safety Commission has \ndropped by more than half. So you see a tripling of the imports while \nyou see the Commission staff being cut in half. At the same time, you \nsee an enormous increase in the number of recalls.\n  Let's look first at the number of staff. Well, it dropped by more \nthan half, falling from a high in 1980 of 978 to 393 today. At the same \ntime, the number of total recalls in 1980 was 681,300. In 2007, the \nnumber of toy recalls alone was over 28 million. So you go from 680,000 \nto 28 million at the same time you cut your staff in half. In total, \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission has only about 100 field \ninvestigators and compliance personnel nationwide.\n  This legislation we are proposing today more than doubles the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission's budget authorization by the year \n2015.\n\n[[Page S1455]]\n\n  We now know that this past year the Commission had only one official \ntoy inspector--pictures of his office have been shown in newspapers \naround this country--one toy inspector to ensure the safety of $22 \nbillion worth of toys. His name is Bob, and he just retired. This bill \nprovides some needed help to increase the CPSC inspection, research, \nand regulation staff. It puts 50 more staff at U.S. ports of entry in \nthe next 2 years to inspect toys and products coming into the country.\n  Not only does the bill give necessary funding and staff to the Safety \nCommission, but it gives the Commission the ability, by giving them \nmore tools, to enforce the laws. I think it is shocking for most \nparents when they realize we never had a mandatory ban on lead. We \nnever had a Federal mandatory ban on lead. Instead, we have a voluntary \nguideline for lead. It is this voluntary guideline that is clearly not \nbeing followed as it should which led us to the sad situation we are in \nnow.\n  To me, the focus is simple: We need to get these toxic toys out of \nour children's hands--not just voluntarily, not just as a guideline, \nbut with the force of law. As millions of toys are being pulled from \nstore shelves for fear of lead contamination, it is time to make \ncrystal clear that lead has no place in children's products. This bill \nfinally gives the Consumer Product Safety Commission the enforcement \nmechanisms it needs to do its job.\n  On top of these critical improvements to the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, this bill finally sets standards for lead in children's \ntoys and establishes requirements for recalls and the labeling of toys.\n  As I mentioned at the outset, this past year we saw a record number \nof recalls of children's toys, totaling 29 million pieces of children's \njewelry, toys that were choking hazards or contained deadly amounts of \nlead paint. This is about little kids swallowing jewelry, but it is \nalso about teenagers chewing on jewelry while they are sitting in \nclass--teenage girls not realizing the jewelry is full of lead.\n  For months now, news of recalled toys has dominated our headlines--\nand for parents, this news has been pretty scary.\n  In November 2007, more than 4 million children's craft toys called \nAqua Dots were recalled because they morphed into a dangerous, \ndangerous date rape drug. Now, I had cases as a prosecutor involving \nthat date rape drug. It is nothing to fool around with. Just to think \nthat you have 4 million children with products, when these kids \naccidentally put them in their mouth because they are these little Aqua \nDots that suddenly became a date rape drug and put these kids into a \ncoma. At least two children slipped into comas after swallowing this \ndangerous toy.\n  Another 9 million toys were recalled last year for containing toxic \nlevels of lead. The lead levels in these toys can lead to developmental \ndelays, brain damage, and even death if swallowed.\n  As if the appalling number of recalls this past year is not bad \nenough, these recalls have illuminated other problems with pulling toys \nfrom the store shelves, the daycare center floor, or the drawer under a \nchild's bed.\n  Except for my mother-in-law, I have to say I do not know a lot of \nmothers and grandmothers who keep the packaging that comes with toys. \nSo what happens is, if you get rid of the packaging and there is a \nrecall, you do not really know if the toy is one that should be \nrecalled. It is very hard to tell one Thomas the Train Set from \nanother, one SpongeBob from another, one Barbie doll from another. That \nis what parents have been struggling with.\n  So what this bill does--instead of making parents sort through the \nred caboose and the green car and the blond Barbie and the brunette \nBarbie--what it does is it puts a requirement in place that says the \ndate stamp, the recall stamp, has to be on the packaging because \nsometimes you might be selling the toys on the Internet or it might be \nin a small mom-and-pop grocery store that will not allow for the \ncomputer systems we have in our bigger stores, but it also requires \nthat the date stamp be on the actual toys whenever practical. It is not \ngoing to go on a pick-up stick, but it sure can go on a Thomas the \nTrain Set.\n  This legislation also requires, as I said, that it be on the \npackaging. Again, it is for small retailers and people selling things \non eBay. Big major outlets, such as Target, are able to, once they find \nout that a batch number is on the toy, close down their register so \nthese toys cannot be sold. However, if you are selling on eBay, you \nwant to have that number on the packaging. So that is why our \nlegislation requires that the batch number be not only on the packaging \nbut also the toy itself.\n  The other piece of this bill I drafted addresses some of the most \ndeadly discoveries of this past year.\n  As more and more toys are coming in from other countries such as \nChina with lower safety standards, we are seeing deadly amounts of lead \nsurfacing in children's toys. The people in my State know this well.\n  Two years ago, a 4-year-old boy named Jarnelle Brown went with his \nmom to buy a pair of tennis shoes. He got this pair of tennis shoes, \nand with the tennis shoes came a little charm. She did not buy this \ncharm. She did not ask for this charm. It was given free with a pair of \ntennis shoes. So they bring the shoes home with the charm, and this \nlittle boy is playing with it. He swallowed the charm. He did not die \nfrom swallowing the charm. He did not die from choking on the charm. He \ndied as the lead in this charm seeped into his system one day after one \nday. His airway was not blocked. He just swallowed that lead charm, and \nit went into his stomach. Over a period of days, the lead in this charm \nwent into his system and it went into his bloodstream. Over a period of \ndays, he died. When they tested him, his lead level was three times the \naccepted level. When they tested that charm, that charm from China was \n99 percent lead--a little free charm given to a mom with a pair of \nshoes.\n  This little boy's death is made so much more tragic by the fact that \nit could have been prevented. He should have never been given that \ncharm in the first place. It shouldn't take a child's death to alert us \nto this problem, but now we know it for a fact, and we cannot now sit \nhere and do nothing.\n\n  Parents should have the right to expect that toys are tested and that \nproblems are found before they reach their toy box. The legislation I \noriginally introduced to address this problem, the lead ban, is what is \nincluded in this bill and we are considering on the floor today. It \nbasically says any lead in any children's products shall be treated as \na hazardous substance. It sets a ceiling for trace levels of lead and \nempowers the Consumer Product Safety Commission to lower the ceiling \neven further through rulemaking as science and technology evolve.\n  This was reached after many discussions with toy manufacturers and \nretailers to get a sense that there sometimes are trace levels of lead. \nThat is why we included this in here, to be practical, but allowing as \nscience develops for the Consumer Product Safety Commission to go below \nthat trace level. We see similar trace levels in some State legislation \nthroughout the country. Some of it is different for jewelry than it is \nfor toys, but we have yet to see a mandatory threshold for trace levels \nof lead in the Federal Government.\n  For 30 years we have been aware of the dangers posed to children by \nlead. The science is clear. It is an undisputed fact that lead poisons \nchildren. It shouldn't have taken us this long to take lead out of \ntheir hands and out of their mouths. It is the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission's job to do that. In recent months, it has become all too \nobvious that this commission needs much reform and that reform is long \noverdue.\n  We have seen too many headlines this year to sit around and think \nthis problem is going to solve itself. As a Senator, I feel it is very \nimportant to take this step to protect the safety of our children. When \nI think about that little 4-year-old boy's parents back in Minnesota \nand I think about all of those other kids who have been hurt by these \ntoys--they have no control over these toys. They don't know where they \ncame from.\n  At this moment I say that the time has come to get this bill passed. \nI thank the retailers from Minnesota, including Target as well as Toys \n'R Us. Their CEO testified before the Appropriations Committee and was \nvery positive about moving forward and understood the need to beef up \nthe tools\n\n[[Page S1456]]\n\nthe CPSC has, as well as increasing the resources for that agency. We \ncan beef up this agency that has been languishing for years and that is \na shadow of its former self. We can put the rules in place that make it \neasier for them to do their job. We cannot sit around bemoaning the \nresults anymore; we have to act. We have our opportunity. Our \nopportunity is this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission Reform Act of 2008. I applaud the leadership of \nSenators Pryor, Stevens, and Inouye in this effort to strengthen \nprotection for America's consumers, especially our children. It has \nbeen a pleasure to work with the sponsors of this bill to strengthen \nFederal protections against dangerous toys moving through the global \nsupply chain.\n  We must detect and counter threats to children before, not after, \ntoys reach store shelves so that they don't end up in homes, schools, \nand daycare centers as, unfortunately, they can now.\n  The pressing need for this bill was dramatized last year by numerous \nand significant safety recalls of children's toys. The recalls have \ninvolved some significant threats to life and health. For example, last \nNovember the Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled 200,000 units \nof imported jewelry for children: earrings, charms, and bracelets that \ncontained unsafe levels of lead. Earlier in 2007, the Commission \nrecalled millions of other hazardous toys.\n  The tragic trend continues. CPSC recalls last month included other \nitems that violate lead paint standards or that can burn, poison, or \neven strangle children.\n  The Pryor-Stevens bill takes a comprehensive and thoughtful approach \nto these threats. It authorizes increased staffing and funding for the \nCommission, toughens penalties for safety violations, bans the resale \nof recalled products, requires safety certification of children's \nproducts, and mandates permanent identification markings on the toys \nand other products themselves--not just on their packaging--to make \nsafety recalls more effective. The bill also essentially bans lead from \nchildren's toys.\n  The need for these safeguards and resources became evident through an \ninvestigation by my staff on the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs. In August, I assigned investigators from my staff \nto examine the toy industry, import concerns, and the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission itself. The committee's investigators conducted \nnumerous interviews of manufacturers, representatives of retailers, \nconsumer advocacy groups, Federal regulatory agencies, and other \nexperts. They also conducted port visits and visited a manufacturer's \ntesting lab. What we were attempting to do is to build on the expertise \nthe committee has gained through its work on port security which \nresulted, working in cooperation with the Commerce Committee, in \nlandmark port security legislation in 2006.\n  The Committee's findings confirmed that our current system had \nserious weaknesses. These included that the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission is understaffed and has inadequate resources and authorities \nfor its mission.\n  We also found that voluntary standards can be useful in quickly \naddressing safety concerns, but that they lack the full force of law.\n  We found that the inability to effectively enforce safety standards \nat our ports limits the ability of Federal agencies to stop hazardous \nimported products from entering the American marketplace.\n  The bill before us will remedy these serious weaknesses in our \ncurrent system, especially in the area of product safety standards. Our \ninvestigators found that the current reliance on voluntary safety \nstandards developed by a consensus among the industry, Government, \nconsumer advocates, and other interested parties has both some \nadvantages and some significant limitations. That doesn't mean we \nshould do away with the system of voluntary standards.\n\n  On the plus side, the voluntary standards process, overseen by a \nstandards-setting body, allows safety standards to be developed much \nmore quickly and efficiently than in many governmental regulatory \nprocesses. This was shown in the collaborative response to the reports \nof serious injuries after children ingested powerful magnets that had \ncome loose from toys. There were no safety standards for these \nparticularly powerful magnets for toys, but within a relatively quick \nperiod of time, the consensus process produced new safety standards.\n  By contrast, if the Commission were to go through a formal safety \nregulation, it would have required a detailed notice and comment \nprocess that could have taken years to accomplish. It would have taken \nat least 4 months, and it could have stretched on for years, delaying \nthat protection to our Nation's children. A perfect example of this is \nthe failed effort to formally regulate the lead content standards for \nchildren's jewelry. In numerous other cases, the system of voluntary \nstandards, self-reporting, and collaborative recalls has led to safety \nrecalls before injuries could occur. Despite these achievements, the \nfact is that dangerous toys still arrive at our ports, and far too many \nof them are making their way to retailers' shelves and then on to the \nhomes of American children.\n  Under current law, the Customs and Border Protection Agency has only \nlimited authority to seize dangerous products and to prevent them from \nentering the marketplace. Instead, what happens too often--the standard \nprocess and practice--is that these products are simply turned away and \nthat gives unscrupulous importers an opportunity to try to slip their \ndefective products into the marketplace by simply going to another \nAmerican port. So if they don't succeed at one port and they are turned \naway, what happens in too many cases is the importer simply tries to \nship the defective toys through another port.\n  Our committee's investigation has also underscored the importance of \nimposing standards on global supply chains. With nearly three-quarters \nof toys sold in America being manufactured overseas, promoting toy \nsafety cannot start or stop at our borders. Our investigators heard \nreports that unethical importers can bring products into the United \nStates and then simply disappear by changing their company's name, \naddress, and other information in order to avoid safety regulations. I \nalso note that they can do this to avoid tariffs, import quotas, and \nintellectual property laws as well.\n  Toys from abroad must meet American safety standards. While the \nChinese Government has reportedly tightened its own standards, closed a \nfew factories, and signed a new agreement with the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission on the use of lead point in toys, China has not yet \ndemonstrated that it can adequately enforce this regime. Until then, we \nmust take strong and effective action to prevent Chinese products that \nviolate our safety rules from entering America.\n  Now, of course, we need better consumer product protections \nregardless of a product's origin, but I call special attention to \nimports because of their overwhelming share of our toy market and \nbecause of the special challenges posed by the global supply chain. Our \ncommittee's investigation led me to offer four recommendations, and I \nam very pleased that those four recommendations have been included in \nthe bill before us. Again, I thank Senators Pryor, Stevens, and Inouye \nfor adding my proposals to their bill.\n  First, the language I authored would empower Customs and Border \nProtection to seize and destroy shipments of products that the \nCommission believes pose a threat to consumers and violate safety \nstandards. This is so important. It closes a glaring loophole in the \ncurrent law and would abandon a practice that allows unscrupulous \nimporters to bring their dangerous products in through a different \nport, depending on the Customs and Border Protection officers catching \nit a second time. My provision would ensure that the agency has the \nright to seize and destroy these unsafe toys and other consumer \nproducts.\n  The second provision I authored would establish a database so that \npotentially unsafe products could be identified by the Commission \nbefore they reach our shores. With that information, that cooperation \nbetween the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Customs and \nBorder Protection\n\n[[Page S1457]]\n\nAgency, we can much more effectively target these shipments for further \ninvestigation.\n  Third, I authored a provision that would require the CPSC to develop \na risk assessment tool so we can focus attention on those points in the \nsupply chain where defects and dangers are most likely to occur, be \ndetected, and stopped.\n  Fourth, I drafted a provision that would place an official from the \nConsumer Products Safety Commission at the National Targeting Center \nrun by Customs and Border Protection. That will allow real-time \ninformation to be shared. We can pool the resources, pool the \ninformation we have to identify likely shipments of dangerous products.\n  Mr. President, neither the Consumer Products Safety Commission, nor \nany other Federal agency, no matter how good, can guarantee a \nmarketplace free of all risk. But we can and should strengthen the \nConsumer Products Safety Commission, as this bill would do, and expand \nits authority and provide it with the resources that are necessary to \ndo a good job.\n  The commission needs to continue to work closely with importers, \nretailers, industry associations, and consumer groups to improve \nproduct safety.\n  A safety regime for children's toys will only be effective if \neveryone takes responsibility. But this should not be a detective game \nfor the parents of America. They should be able to rely on Federal \nstandards, enforcement--tough standards to make sure the toys they are \npurchasing for their children are indeed safe.\n  The foundation of this effort must be an effective and efficient \nsystem to help prevent defective and dangerous products for children \nfrom reaching store shelves in the first place.\n  The Consumer Products Safety Commission Reform Act adds important \nprotections for America's children. I support the bill, and I am \npleased that we are now considering it. I think it is going to make a \nreal difference to the safety of America's children.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed on the consumer products \nsafety legislation.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will ask a question. I ask unanimous \nconsent to proceed as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Reserving the right to object, would the time run on the \nRepublican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The understanding is that it will be counted \ntoward Republican time.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                     Northrop Grumman EADS Contract\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, last Friday, the U.S. Air Force announced \nthat the Northrop Grumman EADS team won the contract to assemble our \nmilitary's next generation of air refueling tankers, known as the KC-\n45.\n  This decision awarded the largest acquisition program in the history \nof the Air Force. To have expected controversy not to follow, \nregardless of the winner, would have been a little foolish.\n  What is unfortunate is that the uproar from the losing side is based \nupon mendacity rather than logic and reason. After the announcement, \nsome falsely proclaimed that our military was selling out to a foreign \ncountry; that this award would outsource U.S. jobs; that these planes \nshould be made in America.\n  The facts behind this selection should allay any of my colleagues' \nfears or concerns. Northrop Grumman EADS capable, advanced multimission \ntankers will be made in America by American workers. Any assertion that \nthis award outsources jobs to France is simply false. This award does \nthe exact opposite. It insources jobs here. In Mobile, AL, where the \ntanker will be assembled and modified, 1,500 direct jobs will be \ncreated. Throughout Alabama, 5,000 total jobs will be created.\n  This contract has ramifications well beyond my State's lines. \nFriday's announcement also means that 25,000 additional jobs at over \n230 companies around the United States will be created by the Northrop \nGrumman EADS tanker win. This will result in a $1 billion annual \neconomic impact on the United States.\n  It is also important to note that job creation was not a factor that \nthe Air Force considered in making their selection. The objective of \nthe acquisition by the Air Force was clear from the outset: acquire the \nbest new tanker for the U.S. Air Force.\n  Five factors were used to score the two competing proposals: mission \ncapability, proposal risk, past performance, price, and the Integrated \nFleet Air Refueling Assessment.\n  Mr. President, the Air Force, in a lengthy, full, and open \ncompetition determined that the KC-30 was superior to the KC-767 and is \nthe best tanker to meet the Air Force's needs.\n  The Air Force rated the KC-30 superior in every one of the five \ncategories used to assess the tanker offering.\n  Mr. President, I believe this illustrates that the Air Force made the \nright decision, the right selection, not only for the men and women in \nuniform but for the taxpayer as well. To claim otherwise is simply \nillogical.\n  Additionally, charges have been raised that by awarding a contract to \na team with a foreign company, our national security may be at risk \nbecause the U.S. military would have to rely on foreign suppliers. \nNothing could be further from the truth.\n  The prime contractor of the team that won, Northrop Grumman, is no \nless an American company than its competitor, Boeing. While Northrop's \nproposal uses a European-designed airframe, a close scrutiny of the two \ncompeting proposals shows that both have a relatively similar amount of \nforeign content.\n  Further, this is hardly the first defense program to be awarded to a \nU.S.-European team. In fact, Boeing itself was part of a team that \nrecently won the Army contract for the Joint Cargo Aircraft, an \nItalian-built aircraft that will be assembled in Florida at a Boeing \nfacility.\n  I find it quite ironic that there was no outcry at this award from \nBoeing supporters, even though it would seem that the Joint Cargo \nAircraft Program would likewise ``take American tax dollars and build \nthis plane overseas.''\n  The global environment in which we live makes it virtually impossible \nfor any major military product to be 100 percent American made--\nespecially when our goal is to provide the best equipment for our \nwarfighters.\n  Moreover, U.S. aerospace firms have supplied billions of dollars' \nworth of equipment built by Americans to foreign countries, and they \nstill do.\n\n  As Members of Congress, we are all concerned about U.S. jobs. Yet any \nassertion that this award ``outsources'' jobs to France is simply \nfalse.\n  With this new assembly site in Mobile, AL, this contract will bring \ntens of thousands of jobs into the United States.\n  According to the Department of Commerce, Northrop Grumman will employ \napproximately the same number of American workers on the tanker \ncontract that Boeing would have employed had they won.\n  As John Adams once said: ``Facts are stubborn things.''\n  If the U.S. Air Force and Members of Congress wanted the tanker to be \na job creation program for Boeing, they should have eschewed a \ncompetition and sole-sourced the contract in the first place. But they \ndidn't want that. Instead, the intent was to provide our men and women \nin uniform with the best refueling aircraft in the world at the best \nvalue for the American taxpayer.\n  In the final analysis, that is precisely what the Air Force did.\n  I am very proud to know that the KC-45 American tanker will be built \nby an American company, employing American workers.\n  This decision is great news for the warfighter, the American worker, \nand the U.S. taxpayer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I associate myself with the wise \ncomments of Senator Shelby on this question. I will share a few \nthoughts about where we are in this process. It was a big, long, fair \ncompetition for this new KC-45 tanker aircraft. The Air Force announced \nit last Friday. They announced they had selected Northrop\n\n[[Page S1458]]\n\nGrumman as the lead contractor for the new plane. Northrop plans to \nbuild it in my hometown of Mobile, AL. We could not be prouder. I, at \none point, chaired the Air/Land Subcommittee as we discussed the need \nfor this aircraft. Long before there was any indication that any of it \nwould be built in Alabama, I became convinced that it was a needed \nplane.\n  I will say this to my colleagues who seem to be arguing that it is \nnot an American aircraft: The lead contractor is Northrop Grumman, \nwhich is a Los Angeles/American company. They partnered with EADS, a \nEuropean company.\n  Some have said openly that it is an aircraft that is going to be \nbuilt in Europe. A lot of people probably have heard that. But the \ntruth is, it is going to be built in the United States, in Mobile. I \ncan show you the spot and the place. Old Brookley Air Force Base. They \nhad as many as 40,000 employees. It was closed in 1965. Indeed, the \neconmy of the town of Mobile's was impacted, until the last half dozen \nyears when it has taken off strongly. But in these last 35 or more \nyears, it has genuinely been believed not to have kept up with the rest \nof the country as a result of the closure of that huge base. This will \nbe at that facility.\n  I suggest and state that in reality what we are talking about is the \ninsourcing into America of an aircraft production center that will \nbring 2,500 jobs to our area, 5,000 for the State, and, more \nimportantly, even 25,000 jobs nationwide at 230 different companies \nthat will be involved in the building of this tanker.\n  I just want to say one thing. I think Senator Shelby talked about it. \nI want to say one thing in the beginning, as a recovering former \nlawyer. We had a competition for this aircraft. We had two bidders and, \nto my knowledge, during the time that this bidding process was going \non, no one was saying we should not have competition. No one was saying \nthat because one of the partners was European based--of course, they \nare our allies fundamentally on most issues of importance in the world, \nand our partners in the Joint Strike Fighter, one of our top fighter \naircraft. But nobody said that disqualified Northrop's bid. Do you \nfollow me?\n  So we go through months and months of meetings with the Air Force, \nand with their hard work they developed an objective set of criteria \nand evaluated the aircraft. Nobody was saying that somehow this \nNorthrop team should not be in the game, should not be allowed to bid \nbecause we all know the fact that there was a vigorous competition \nreduced the bids substantially of both companies because they had to be \ncompetitive. If it had been a sole-sourced bid, it would not have been. \nThis was a good thing for us to have had. That is all I am saying.\n  Now, some have hinted that we ought to have politics enter into this \nprocess after 2 years, and the right company didn't win and we ought to \nsomehow overturn that. It is not good sense to me to make that \nargument. Of course, it would not hold up in a court of law. The Air \nForce, rated the aircraft objectively, and they made an objective \ndecision. It was not contested before, and I do not think it will be \nsuccessfully contested now.\n\n  The Northrop aircraft won, according to the Air Force officials, \nbecause it offered the best value to the Government and the best plane \nfor our war fighters. Sue Payton, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, \nsaid during the announcement on Friday:\n\n       Northrop Grumman clearly provided the best value to the \n     Government when you take a look at it, in accordance with the \n     RFP--\n\n  That is request for proposal--\n\n     the five factors that were important to this decision: in \n     mission capability, in proposal risk, in the area of past \n     performance, in cost price, and in something we call an \n     integrated fleet aerial refueling rating.\n\n  She said in each of these categories that when you added up all that, \nthe Northrop Grumman aircraft was, as she said, the best value for the \nGovernment. Isn't that what we pay her to decide?\n  I thank the Air Force for going through this process. There were some \nreal questions about whether there would be fair competition for the \nKC-X. There was some doubt about Northrop's team, whether they would \neven bid if they were not going to have a fair chance. They were all \nassured they were going to have a fair and transparent competition, so \nthe Air Force promised to use objective criteria and to communicate \ncontinuously with the two bidders. In the words of one official:\n\n       The winner will know why he won and the loser why he lost.\n\n  To a degree we have never seen, that I think was followed in this \ncase. John Young, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, \nTechnology, and Logistics, Secretary of Defense Gates' point man for \nthe fairness of the acquisition competition, said yesterday:\n\n       The Air Force did its homework and did it well . . . The \n     Air Force, in my opinion, did an outstanding job.\n\n  Now that the Air Force, in the opinion of many, has run a textbook \nfair competition, the key is for us to get moving on replacing these \ntankers. Most of our tankers were built before 1957. Can you imagine? \nIt is time to recapitalize that fleet with newer and more modern planes \nfor both the safety of our pilots and the effectiveness of our \nmilitary. That is why the KC-45s are the No. 1 budget priority of the \nU.S. Air Force. They have said that for a number of years. This is a \nbig project, but it is critical to the effectiveness of the U.S. Air \nForce in its ability to protect air power at great distances around the \nglobe.\n  I know there has been intense debate, and I know how important this \nprocess has been. But, again, I say no one was objecting to the \ncompetition then, and if you have a competition, shouldn't the one with \nthe best proposal win? The Northrop team clearly provided the best \nvalue, said Sue Payton. It carried more fuel for longer distances, and \nthe fuel is in the wings of these aircraft, not in the main area of the \naircraft, in the fuselage area. In that area, you can carry soldiers, \ncargo, and all kinds of equipment that the war fighter might need. It \ncan supplement substantially our existing airlift capability, and \nNorthrop's team aircraft had more cargo capacity, more fuel load \nability, could carry more soldiers, and could go longer distances. That \nis why, when they calculated it up, when they buy these aircraft, they \nneed 19 fewer of the Northrop team's aircraft than needed if they \nbought the other aircraft, a big savings right there in itself.\n  We are not saying there is anything wrong with the Boeing aircraft, \nthat it is somehow a defective aircraft. It did not meet the needs of \nthe Air Force as well as the other one did.\n  The Air Force has run the most open competition in history. It \nappears it is going to be a model for such competitions in the future.\n  In the days ahead, not too many days from now, the bidders will be \nbrought in to the Air Force, and they will be given a detailed briefing \non exactly why the Air Force reached the decision it did, why one won \nand the other lost, and if the bidder concludes that a protest is \ncalled for, if they find something they think is unfair under the rules \nof bidding, they have every right to appeal and protest. But no such \ndecision has been made to date. I am hopeful the process was conducted \nfairly, as it appears to be, and that no protests will occur.\n  I further note we have a critical need to bring this tanker online. \nMuch more could be said about the importance of the whole replacement \nprocess. I will say we had a fair competition, it appears by all \naccounts. The process went on for months. It was the most open in terms \nof the bidders were told precisely what weaknesses their planes may \nhave or what other strengths they would like to see in a plane and gave \nthem an opportunity to respond in a way that did not blindside them by \nsaying: Sorry, you lost because of one little problem here, and they \nnever told them what that problem was, as we have had in the past. This \nwhole process was much more open, one on one in a way that I think was \nfilled with integrity and a practical goal. The practical goal was to \nallow the Air Force to be in a position to pick the best aircraft they \ncould pick for our Defense Department.\n  I am excited about this, just from our own local interests. I had \nabsolutely no idea how it would come out until the announcement was \nmade. I did ask on several occasions that we have a fair and level \nplaying field. I believe that has occurred. The Air Force has said\n\n[[Page S1459]]\n\nthey clearly believe this is the better aircraft. And if that is their \ndecision, they had no choice honorably to do anything other than make \nthe decision they did.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of the quorum and ask \nthat it be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, we are going to vote in a couple of \nminutes on the motion to proceed to the CPSC--the Consumer Product \nSafety Act--and I want to urge my colleagues to vote for this motion \nand to move to this legislation so that we can consider it over the \nnext couple of days in the Senate.\n  I think the American public saw the record number of product recalls \nlast year, especially in the toy sector but in all sectors of our \neconomy. The people back home understand how important it is for the \nSenate to act on this and act in a way that is responsible and balanced \nand act in a way that is very meaningful.\n  Again, our legislation as compared to the House bill is more \ntransparent, there is more enforcement, and it is more comprehensive \nreform. I thank my House colleagues for doing what they have done and \nalso thank my Senate colleagues, especially Senator Ted Stevens and \nSenator Collins. We have several on our side who have all come together \nto make this a bipartisan bill, and I appreciate the Senate's \nconsideration.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 582, S. 2663, the Consumer Product \n     Safety Commission Reform Act.\n         Harry Reid, John D.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 2663, a bill to reform the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, next week we will be marking up and \nworking on the budget for the Federal Government for fiscal year 2009. \nI wish to take a few minutes to talk a little bit about the budget we \npassed last year and to highlight a few areas of caution where I hope \nwe will not repeat the mistakes this year in the budget we pass like we \ndid in the budget we passed last year.\n  First of all, in the fiscal year 2008 budget, the budget anticipated \nan increase in revenue--which is Washington speak for a tax increase--\nof $736 billion that would be needed in order to meet the demands of \nthat budget. Of course, we all know whom those tax hikes fall on. It is \nthe middle-class families, the farmers, the entrepreneurs, the people \nwe need in this country to remain productive and remain incentivized to \nkeep our economy and job creation humming.\n  Considering the economic situation we are in today, the last thing \nthe Federal Government should do is increase taxes and create a wet \nblanket of deterrence on those very entrepreneurs and people who create \nthe jobs.\n  One example is, last year you will recall that Congress waited until \nthe last possible moment to pass temporary tax relief, relieving the \nmiddle class from the alternative minimum tax--a tax that more and more \nmiddle-class families will soon pay. As a matter of fact, I think this \nis a perfect paradigm for what I have heard here as ``tax schemes \ndesigned to tax only the wealthy.''\n  You will recall that the alternative minimum tax, as originally \nconceived,\n\n[[Page S1460]]\n\nwas designed to tax only 155 taxpayers who were not otherwise paying \nFederal tax. But true to form for Washington, DC, and for, \nunfortunately, the Federal Government, this tax-the-wealthy scheme this \nlast year affected 6 million taxpayers, and because it is not indexed \nfor inflation, would have affected, if Congress had not acted, 23 \nmillion taxpayers--from 155 to 6 million to 23 million. But because \nCongress waited until the last possible moment to pass a 1-year patch \nor relief from the alternative minimum tax for the middle class, \nmillions of taxpayers will see a delay in getting their refunds--money \nthat belongs to them, after all, and not to Uncle Sam.\n  We also saw, unfortunately, in last year's budget an attempt \nrebuffed; a bipartisan vote that would make it more difficult to pass \ntax increases. Last year, I offered an amendment that received a strong \nbipartisan vote that created a 60-vote budget point of order against \nany legislation that raised income taxes. Even though this amendment \nfound broad bipartisan support here in the light of day, behind closed \ndoors in the conference, this amendment was stripped out of the \nconference report and summarily buried.\n  This amendment could have sent a strong message to the taxpayers that \ntheir Federal Government was more interested in ending wasteful \nspending than it was in picking their pockets. Unfortunately, as a \nresult of the summary execution and burial of this amendment behind \nclosed doors in the conference committee, the opposite message was \nsent: that Congress is more interested in getting their hands on the \nhard-earned money taxpayers earn and spending it on bigger and bigger \nGovernment--obviously, the wrong message and one that a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators was unwilling to support in the light of day but, \nunfortunately, the conference, behind closed doors, was willing to \nembrace.\n  American taxpayers got a budget that would have spent $23 billion \nabove the President's request last year. Now, a friend of mine in Texas \nlikes to remind me from time to time how much a billion is because we \nthrow numbers around up here--a million here, a billion there. A \nbillion seconds ago it was 1976. A billion seconds ago it was 1976. We \ndo not even seem to flinch at a budget that Congress passed that \nexceeded the President's request by $23 billion.\n  In fact, over the next 5 years, the majority budgeted $205 billion \nover the President's request. Whatever happened to being good stewards \nof the taxpayers' money and trying to control Government spending so it \ndoes not run amok? Thankfully, we were able to stop this unwarranted \nexpansion, and we were able to remain within the President's top line \nnumber for the current fiscal year. At the last minute, we were able to \ndo that in December.\n  When it comes to entitlement reform--something the majority promised \nto make a top priority when they took power--they did absolutely \nnothing to rein in the $66 trillion long-term entitlement crisis we are \nfacing. It is no secret to anybody in this institution that \nentitlements are quickly eating more and more of the budget and will \ncontinue to gobble up more and more of our economic resources.\n  As a matter of fact, I have in my hand a PowerPoint by the U.S. \nGovernment Accountability Office called ``Saving Our Future Requires \nTough Choices Today,'' pointing out that in 1966, for example, 67 \npercent of the budget was discretionary spending. Today, it is 38 \npercent. That is because of the growth of entitlement spending from 26 \npercent in 1966 to 53 percent of the budget today. Mandatory spending, \ntogether with interest on the debt, amounts to 62 percent of the \nFederal budget today.\n\n  If we do not do anything about it, by the year 2030, this Federal \nGovernment will be unable to fund anything else other than Medicaid, \nMedicare, Social Security, and interest on the debt.\n  So I believe it is very important for us to avoid this fiscal \nmeltdown--as entitlements kick in for the baby boom generation, and in \na way that will make Government unaffordable for our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  This story, as bad as it is, is even worse when you consider the fact \nthat $185 billion in Social Security surpluses is spent for general \nTreasury items today. In other words, we are taking the money wage \nearners are paying into Social Security that is not currently needed to \nmeet the obligations of Social Security and spending it for other \npurposes, making it even more likely that when our children and \ngrandchildren come of age, they will not have any social safety net \navailable to them through Social Security or Medicare.\n  When you look further at this report of the Government Accountability \nOffice, for fiscal year 2006 and 2007 deficits, you see that the \ndeficit increases dramatically. If we do not begin to deal with reining \nin the entitlement spending crisis in this country, it will get nothing \nbut worse.\n  But while the news media tends to focus on deficits on an annual \nbasis, the real crisis is the growing fiscal exposure due to long-term \ncommitments, such as future Social Security benefits, future Medicare \nPart A benefits, future Medicare Part B benefits, future Medicare Part \nD benefits--our prescription drug provisions we passed a couple years \nago. These lead to an ultimate liability for the American taxpayer of \n$52.7 trillion.\n  So I talked about a million dollars. I talked about a billion \ndollars. Now we are talking about trillions of dollars--something that \nis nearly impossible for the human mind to conceive of, the number is \nso big.\n  But let me give you a number you can understand, we can conceive of. \nUnless we deal with the growing entitlement crisis of Medicare and \nSocial Security, not only will they run out of money, but the burden on \neach person in this country--the financial burden--will amount to \n$175,000 a person. So not only will we be unable to pay our young men \nand women who are working today the Social Security and Medicare \nbenefits they should receive when they come of age, we will also burden \nthem with a $175,000-per-person share of the Federal debt in the \nprocess. This is an IOU we will never repay.\n  Of course, if the Federal budget continues to grow in terms of its \nrequirement of paying entitlements--Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security \nand interest on the debt--as I said, by 2030 there will be no money for \nanything else. We would not have the resources for other important \npriorities, including national defense, securing our borders, \nimmigration enforcement, veterans health care, or education.\n  Unfortunately, the budget that passed last year allowed the debt to \nincrease by $2.5 trillion over the next 5 years. In other words, the \nmessage is consistent: We spend now and the next generations pick up \nthe tab later on. I can only beg my colleagues not to follow the \nexample they set last year. We cannot afford to take more money out of \nthe hands of hard-working Americans in order to grease the gears of \nbigger and bigger Government. I fear the next budget will only be more \nof the same. We should not raise taxes on working families and small \nbusinesses. We should not wash our hands, as we did last year, of the \nentitlement tsunami we all know is approaching and threatening to \nengulf us, and we should not allow the debt to continue to grow so that \nthe $175,000 share per person of the debt will continue to get bigger \nand bigger.\n\n  I know we can do better, and we must do better. As the Budget \nCommittee takes up the 2009 budget tomorrow in the committee and on \nThursday when we will actually mark up the budget, and when it comes to \nthe floor next week, I hope all of us will work together to make sure \nwe don't continue to increase taxes and further dampen and soften the \neconomy in a way that hastens a recession rather than avoids it. I hope \nwe will step up and accept the responsibility each of us has to make \nsure we don't spend money today to impose a financial burden on our \nchildren and grandchildren tomorrow. We can do better and we must do \nbetter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1460-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1460-S1462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would apologize for the lack of judicial \nnominations on the Executive Calendar but for the fact that is has been \nthe refusal of Republicans to cooperate this year in reporting out \nnominations that has lead to the current circumstance. The fact is that \nwe concluded last session by confirming each and every judicial \nnomination that was reported out of\n\n[[Page S1461]]\n\nthe Judiciary Committee. None were carried over into this new year. And \ndespite my efforts in February, when the Judiciary Committee held two \nhearings for seven judicial nominees, including a circuit nominee, \nRepublican members of the Judiciary Committee effectively boycotted our \nbusiness meetings in February and obstructed our ability to report \njudicial nominations and high-ranking Justice Department nominations. I \nadjourned both our February 14 and February 28 meetings for lack of a \nquorum. At the first meeting only one Republican Senator was present. \nAt the latter, the ranking member chose to leave.\n  Despite the partisan posturing by the President and Senate \nRepublicans, I have continued to move forward and sought to make \nprogress but, I must admit, my patience is wearing thin. Two weeks ago, \nduring the congressional recess, I chaired our third nominations \nhearing of the year. Included were three judicial nominations, \nincluding that of Catharina Haynes of Texas to be a circuit judge on \nthe Fifth Circuit. I knew that this nomination was important to Senator \nCornyn. So in spite of her participation at the recent partisan \npolitical rally and photo op at the White House, I proceeded with that \npreviously scheduled hearing.\n  Despite urging the President to work with us, 19 current judicial \nvacancies--almost half--have no nominee. In addition, several of the \njudicial nominations we have received do not have the support of their \nhome state Senators. Of the vacancies deemed by the Administrative \nOffice to be judicial emergencies, the President has yet to send us \nnominees for seven of them, more than a third. Of the circuit court \nvacancies, nearly a third are without a nominee and more than half of \nthe current circuit court nominees do not have the support of both home \nState Senators.\n  If this President had worked with the Senators from Michigan, Rhode \nIsland, Maryland, California, New Jersey, and Virginia, we could be in \nposition to make more progress. Instead, we have lost precious time to \nprovocative and controversial nominations like that of Duncan Getchell \nand Claude Allen of Virginia. Those nominations were both withdrawn by \nthe President after months of wasted time and effort. I, again, \nencourage the White House to work with Senators Warner and Webb of \nVirginia to send us consensus nominees for the two Virginia vacancies \non the Fourth Circuit.\n  The Getchell nomination is an example of the President's failure to \nwork with home State Senators to make consensus nominations. President \nBush nominated Duncan Getchell to one of Virginia's Fourth Circuit \nvacancies over the objections of Senator Warner and Senator Webb. They \nhad submitted a list of five recommended nominations, and specifically \nwarned the White House not to nominate Mr. Getchell. As a result, this \nnomination, which was opposed by home state Senators from the start, \nwas one that could not move.\n  The Republican complaints about nominations ring hollow in light of \nthe actual progress we have made. Despite the efforts of the Bush \nadministration to pack the Federal courts and tilt them sharply to the \nright, the Judiciary Committee and the Senate have worked to approve an \noverwhelming majority of President Bush's nominations for lifetime \nappointments to the Federal bench. We have confirmed over 86 percent of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominations, compared to less than 75 percent \nfor President Clinton's nominations.\n  The difference is even more stark when examining nominations to \ninfluential circuit courts, to which nearly three quarters of President \nBush's nominations have been confirmed, compared to just over half of \nPresident Clinton's. That means nearly half of President Clinton's \ncircuit nominations were not confirmed, many of them pocket \nfilibustered with anonymous objections, no hearings, and no \nconsideration. If we stopped now and did not consider another judicial \nnominee all year, we would better the record Republicans established \nwith President Clinton.\n  We confirmed 40 judicial nominees last year, including six nominees \nto the circuit courts. That total was more than were confirmed during \nany of the three preceding years under Republican leadership and more \nthan were confirmed in 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000, when a Republican-\nled Senate was considering President Clinton's nominations. Indeed, in \nthree years that I have chaired the committee, the Senate has confirmed \n140 of President Bush's lifetime appointments to our Federal courts. \nThat compares favorably to the total of 158 confirmations during the \nmore than 4 years that Republicans led the committee during this \nPresidency. If we stopped now and did not consider another judicial \nnominee, we would compare favorably to how Republicans have treated \nthis President's nominees, and we have already improved upon how they \ntreated President Clinton's nominees.\n  If the White House and the Senate Republicans were serious about \nfilling vacancies and not just seeking to score partisan political \npoints, the President would not make nominations opposed by home State \nSenators of both parties. If they were serious about filling vacancies, \nRepublicans would not spend the rest of the Bush Presidency fighting \nover a handful of controversial nominations rather than work with us to \nmake progress. If they were serious about filling vacancies, \nRepublicans on the committee would attend important business meetings \nand help us make a quorum to report these nominations to the Senate.\n  I am surprised that today the ranking member has suggested that \njudicial nominations were ``stymied'' when I first became chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee under this President in 2001. Indeed, during \nthose 17 months, the Senate confirmed 100 judicial nominations. That \npace was never duplicated under either of the Republican chairmen that \nfollowed me. During the 2 years under Senator Specter's chairmanship, \nthe Senate approved 54 confirmations.\n\n  I am surprised that the ranking member is suggesting the Senate \nbypass the committee's process for considering nominations, and is \napparently calling for an end to the role of home State Senators. When \nhe was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter respected \nthe blue slip, which is the means by which home State Senators approve \nor disapprove of a nomination before consideration of the nomination \nproceeds. When he was chairman, he proceeded with hearings on \nnominations that were controversial and were subsequently withdrawn. \nThat took time away from those nominations on which we might have been \nable to make progress together.\n  Requiring the support of home State Senators is a traditional \nmechanism to encourage the White House to engage in meaningful \nconsultation with the Senate. Many of this President's current nominees \ndo not have the support of the home State Senators. That is why his \nnomination of Duncan Getchell was finally withdrawn. That is why the \nnomination of Gene Pratter to the Third Circuit has not been \nconsidered. That is also the current situation for both nominees to the \nThird Circuit, the two current nominees to the Sixth Circuit, a nominee \nto the Fourth Circuit and the nominee to the First Circuit. Of the 11 \ncircuit court nominations that have been pending before the Senate this \nyear, 8 have not had the support of home State Senators. Indeed, more \nthan half of the 28 nominations listed by Senator Specter in his recent \nletter to me do not currently have blue slips signaling support from \nhome State Senators. He knows that. That information is public.\n  This process was abused when the Republican-controlled Senate pocket-\nfilibustered President Clinton's nominees with anonymous holds and no \npublic opposition. One of my first acts when I became chairman in 2001, \nwith a Democratic-led Senate considering President Bush's nominees, was \nto open up the nominations process for the first time, making blue \nslips public for the first time. We have drawn open the curtains on the \nprocess. Republicans, during the Clinton administration, cloaked it in \nsecrecy and, to this day, will not explain their actions. I have not \ntreated this President's nominees in that way. We have considered \nnominations openly and on the record. We have considered nominations I \ndo not support, something that was never done by a Republican chairman.\n  Much of the problem remains with this President and his insistence on\n\n[[Page S1462]]\n\nnominating controversial nominees. I extended another olive branch to \nhim by my letter last November. I have received no response.\n  I had consulted with the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, and we had \nearlier exchanged letters. He knows from my January 22 letter what the \nsituation is. As a former chairman he knows. He knows the history of \nthe Thurmond Rule, by which Republicans, then in the minority, insisted \nthat judicial vacancies in the last year of a President's term remain \nvacant in order to be filled with the nominations of the next \nPresident. He understands the dynamics in the last year of a \nPresident's term. And no modern President has been as divisive as this \nPresident on these issues.\n  The Republican chairman serving during the end of President Clinton's \nterm noted many times that judicial confirmations slow in a President's \nlast year. I do not intend to return more than 60 nominations to this \nWhite House without action, or return 17 circuit court nominations \nwithout action. But much depends on the cooperation of the President \nand Senate Republicans.\n  It is hard to consider partisan complaints about the pace of judicial \nnominations when those same voices criticize me for holding hearings on \njudicial nominations. Damned if I do and damned if I don't. Indeed, \nwhen I went out of my way to hold a hearing for judicial nominations \nduring the last recess period, I was roundly criticized by Republicans. \nIt reminded me of the time in 2001 when I previously chaired a recess \nhearing for another circuit court nominee of this President and I was \ncriticized by a Republican Senator for proceeding expeditiously. It \nonly goes to prove the truth of the saying that around here, when it \ncomes to judicial nominations, no good deed goes unpunished.\n  The record is that during the 1996 session, the last of President \nClinton's first term, the Republican-led Senate confirmed not a single \ncircuit nomination. If we are able to proceed and confirm just one \ncircuit nominee this year, we will better that record.\n  Republicans returned 17 circuit nominations to President Clinton \nwithout action at the end of his presidency. The treatment of President \nClinton's nominees contrasted markedly with that accorded by Democrats \nto the nominations of Presidents Reagan and Bush in the Presidential \nelection years of 1988 and 1992, when nine circuit court nominees were \nconfirmed on average. Regrettably, the Republican Senate reversed that \ncourse in its treatment of President Clinton's circuit court \nnominations, confirming none during the 1996 session and an average of \nonly four in Presidential election years.\n  The Republican Senate chose to stall consideration of circuit \nnominees and maintain vacancies during the Clinton administration. In \nthose years, Senator Hatch justified the slow progress by pointing to \nthe judicial vacancy rate. When the vacancy rate stood at 7.2 percent, \nSenator Hatch declared that ``there is and has been no judicial vacancy \ncrisis'' and that this was a ``rather low percentage of vacancies that \nshows the judiciary is not suffering from an overwhelming number of \nvacancies.'' Because of Republican inaction, the vacancy rate continued \nto rise, reaching nearly 10 percent at the end of President Clinton's \nterm, including 26 circuit vacancies.\n  By contrast, we have helped cut circuit court vacancies across the \ncountry in half, reducing the number to 13 in 2007. In fact, circuit \ncourt vacancies reached a high water mark of 32 early in President \nBush's first term, with a number of retirements by Republican-appointed \njudges. Indeed, the current judicial vacancy rate is around 5 percent. \nThat is half of what it was at the end of President Clinton's term, and \nsignificantly lower than when Senator Hatch described the vacancy rate \nas acceptably low. If we applied Senator Hatch's standard, we would \nhave no more hearings or consideration of any of the remaining \nnominations.\n  Because of the success of the Republicans at stacking the courts and \ntheir success in preventing votes on nominees, the current situation on \nthe circuit courts is that more than 60 percent of active judges were \nappointed by Republican presidents and more than 35 percent were \nappointed by this President. If we did not act on another nominee, \nRepublican presidents' influence over the circuit courts is already out \nof balance.\n  I would rather see us work with the President on the selection of \nnominees that the Senate can proceed to confirm than waste precious \ntime fighting about controversial nominees. That is why I have urged \nthe White House to work with Senators Warner and Webb to send to the \nSenate without delay nominees to the Virginia vacancies on the Fourth \nCircuit. That is why I have urged the White House to work with all \nSenators from States with vacancies on the Federal bench. We may still \nbe able to make progress, but only with the full cooperation of this \nPresident, and Republican Members of this Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1462-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1462-S1463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE POLITICAL CRISIS IN ETHIOPIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the political \nsituation in Ethiopia. The U.S.-Ethiopian partnership is an incredibly \nimportant one--perhaps one of the more significant on the continent \ngiven not only our longstanding history but also the increasingly \nstrategic nature of our cooperation in recent years. Ethiopia sits on \nthe Horn of Africa--perhaps one of the roughest neighborhoods in the \nworld, with Somalia a failed state and likely safe haven for \nterrorists, Eritrea an inaccessible authoritarian regime that \nexacerbates conflicts throughout the region, Sudan a genocidal regime, \nand now Kenya descending into crisis. By contrast, Ethiopia seems \nrelatively stable with its growing economy and robust poverty reduction \nprograms.\n  Indeed, one look at the deteriorating situation on the Horn of Africa \nand it is clear just how essential our relationship with Ethiopia \nreally is. Unfortunately, the Bush administration's approach to \nstrengthening and building bilateral ties with Ethiopia has been \nshortsighted and narrow. As in other parts of the world, the \nadministration's counterterrorism agenda dominates the relationship, \nwhile poor governance and human rights concerns get a pass.\n  Genuine democratic progress in Ethiopia is essential if we are to \nhave a healthy and positive bilateral relationship. We cannot allow a \nmyopic focus on one element of security to obscure our understanding of \nwhat is really occurring in Ethiopia. Rather than place our support in \none man, we must invest in Ethiopia's institutions and its people to \ncreate a stable, sustainable political system. As we are seeing right \nnow in Kenya, political repression breeds deep-seated resentment, which \ncan have destructive and far-reaching consequences. The United States \nand the international community cannot support one policy objective at \nthe expense of all others. To do so not only hurts the credibility of \nAmerica and the viability of our democratic message, but it severely \njeopardizes our national security.\n  I am seriously concerned about the direction Ethiopia is headed--\nrecurringbecause according to many credible accounts, the political \ncrisis that has been quietly growing and deepening over the past few \nyears may be coming to a head. For years, faced with calls for \npolitical or economic reforms, the Ethiopian government has displayed a \ntroubling tendency to react with alarmingly oppressive and \ndisproportionate tactics.\n  For example, in 2003, we received reports of massacres of civilians \nin the Gambella region of Ethiopia, which touched off a wave of \nviolence and destruction that has yet to truly loosen its grip on the \nregion. At that time, hundreds of lives were lost, tens of thousands \nwere displaced, and many homes, schools, and businesses throughout the \narea were destroyed. Credible observers agree that Ethiopian security \nforces were heavily involved in some of the most serious abuses and \nmore than 5 years later no one has been held accountable and there have \nbeen no reparations.\n  The national elections held in May 2005 were a severe step back for \nEthiopia's democratic progress. In advance of the elections, the \nEthiopian Government expelled representatives of the three democracy-\npromotion organizations supported by USAID to assist the Ethiopian \nelection commission, facilitate dialogue among political parties and \nelection authorities, train pollwatchers, and assist civil society in\n\n[[Page S1463]]\n\nthe creation of a code of conduct. This expulsion was the first time in \n20 years that a government has rejected such assistance, and the \norganizations have still not returned to Ethiopia because they do not \nfeel an environment exists where they can truly undertake their \nobjectives.\n  Despite massive controversy surrounding the polls, it is notable that \nopposition parties still won an unprecedented number of parliamentary \nseats. Their pursuit of transparency and democracy was again thwarted, \nhowever, when they tried to register their concerns about the election \nprocess. In one incident, peaceful demonstrations by opposition members \nand their supporters in Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa were met with \ndisproportionate and lethal force that killed more than 30 people and \ninjured over 100. In another incident, the Ethiopian government \narrested thousands of peacefully protesting citizens who took to the \nstreets in support of the opposition.\n  The systemic nature of this crackdown was revealed in credible \nreports coming from the Oromia and Amhara regions that federal police \nwere unacceptably threatening, beating and detaining opposition \nsupporters. Indeed, international human rights groups documented that \nregional authorities were exaggerating their concerns about armed \ninsurgency and ``terrorism'' to try to justify the torture, \nimprisonment and sustained harassment of critics and even ordinary \ncitizens.\n  This tendency to portray political dissent as extremist uprisings has \nbeen repeated more recently with regards to what is being characterized \nby some as a brutal counterinsurgency operation led by Ethiopia's \nmilitary in the Ogaden, a long-neglected region that borders Somalia. \nCertainly I recognize the serious security concerns in this region, \nmade worse by the porous borders of the failed state just a stone's \nthrow away.\n  But it is precisely because Ethiopia is our partner in the fight \nagainst al-Qaida, its affiliates and allies, that I am so concerned \nabout what I understand to be a massive military crackdown that does \nnot differentiate between rebel groups and civilians. While I am sure \nthere are few clean hands when it comes to fighting in the Ogaden \nregion, the reports I have received about the Ethiopian government's \nillicit military tactics and human rights violations are of great \nconcern.\n  I have been hearing similar reports of egregious human rights abuses \nbeing committed in Somalia, about which I am gravely concerned. When I \nvisited Ethiopia just over a year, I urged the Prime Minister not to \nsend his troops into Somalia because I thought it might make \ninstability there worse, not better. Tragically, more than a year \nlater, it seems my worst fears have been realized as tens of thousands \nof people have fled their homes, humanitarian access is at an all time \nlow, and there are numerous reports of increasing brutality towards \ncivilians caught in the crossfire. In the interest of its own domestic \nsecurity, Ethiopia is contributing to increased regional instability.\n  What troubles me most is that the reports of Ethiopia's military \ncoming out of the Ogaden and Mogadishu join a long list of increasingly \nrepressive actions taken by the Ethiopian government. The Bush \nadministration must not turn a blind eye to the aggressive--and \nrecurring--tactics being utilized by one of our key allies to stifle \ndissent.\n  I certainly welcome the role the Bush administration has played in \nhelping to secure the release of many--although not all--of the \nindividuals thrown in jail in the aftermath of the 2005 elections. I \nwelcome the Embassy's engagement with opposition members and their \nefforts to encourage Ethiopian officials to create more political space \nfor alternative views, independent media, and civil society. These are \nall important steps but they do not go far enough.\n  The administration's efforts at backroom diplomacy are not working. I \nunderstand and respect the value of quiet diplomacy, but sometimes we \nreach the point where such a strategy is rendered ineffective--when \nprivate rhetorical commitments are repeatedly broken by unacceptable \npublic actions. For example, recent reports that the Ethiopian \ngovernment is jamming our Voice of America radio broadcasts should be \ncondemned in no uncertain terms, not shrugged off.\n  The Bush administration must live up to its own rhetoric in promoting \ndemocracy and human rights by making it clear that we do not--and will \nnot--tolerate the Ethiopian government's abuses and illegal behavior. \nIt must demonstrate that there are consequences for the repressive and \noften brutal tactics employed by the Ethiopian government, which are \nmoving Ethiopia farther away from--not closer to--the goal of becoming \na legitimate democracy and are increasingly a source of regional \ninstability.\n  I am afraid that the failure of this administration to acknowledge \nthe internal crisis in Ethiopia is emblematic of its narrow-minded \nagenda, which will have repercussions for years to come if not \naddressed immediately. Worse yet, without a balanced U.S. policy that \naddresses both short- and long-term challenges to stability in \nEthiopia, we run the risk of contributing to the groundswell of proxy \nwars rippling across the Horn--whether in Somalia, eastern Sudan, or \neven the Ogaden region. And those wars, in turn, by contributing to \ngreater insecurity on the Horn and providing opportunities for forces \nthat oppose U.S. interests, pose a direct threat to our own national \nsecurity as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1463-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PEACE CORPS WEEK\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice to those of my \ncolleagues who have stood to salute the Peace Corps.\n  The Peace Corps is one of our country's most effective international \ndevelopment programs. Since its inception in 1961, the Peace Corps has \nsent over 190,000 volunteers to 139 developing countries, where they \nhave helped build thousands of schools, health clinics, and small \nbusinesses.\n  Equally as important, the Peace Corps is one of our country's most \nimportant public diplomacy programs. The sight of ordinary Americans \nvolunteering to serve the world's most disadvantaged populations cannot \nhelp but elevate good will toward our country. Fifty-nine volunteers \nfrom my home State of New Mexico are currently serving in countries \nranging from Ukraine and Georgia in Europe, to Malawi and Senegal in \nAfrica, to Peru and Honduras in Central America.\n  Today, I urge the Peace Corps to consider returning to the poorest \ncountry in our own hemisphere. That country is Haiti.\n  According to the U.N. Development Program, over three-quarters of \nHaitians subsist on less than $2 per day and over half on less than $1 \nper day. Haiti is one of the poorest of the poor. The security \nsituation in Haiti was precarious for much of the new century--which is \nwhy the Peace Corps left. But one year ago, a brighter picture emerged. \nThe international community launched a concerted effort to rid Haiti's \nslums of violent gangs. President Rene Preval made real efforts to \npromote political reconciliation in the country. Because of these \nefforts, we have a genuine window of opportunity to make a difference \nin Haiti. But this window will not last forever. In the best tradition \nof the Peace Corps, we Americans should seize this opportunity while we \nhave the chance.\n  I can think of no better way of honoring the Peace Corps than by \ncalling upon it to consider returning to Haiti.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1463-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1463-S1464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN MEMORY OF WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY, JR.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to mark the loss of an outstanding \nAmerican intellect--and, what's more, a decent and a well-loved man. \nWilliam F. Buckley, Jr., died last week at the age of 82. He was found \nat work at his desk, pen in hand--and I don't think he could have \nimagined a more fitting exit.\n  Few thinkers were more prolific than Bill Buckley--his total \ncatalogue amounts to more than 50 books and thousands and thousands of \ncolumns, not to mention his three decades on the pioneering debate \nprogram ``Firing Line.'' Few writers wielded more influence--the entire \nmodern conservative movement honors him as its founder. And few figures \nin our national life earned such admiration-- all the way from Ronald \nReagan, who told Buckley, ``You didn't just part the Red Sea--you \nrolled it back, dried it up and\n\n[[Page S1464]]\n\nleft it exposed, for all the world to see,'' to the many writers, \nactivists, and leaders who counted him as a mentor and inspiration.\n  He was a good friend of my parents, Thomas and Grace Dodd, and one of \nConnecticut's best-known native sons. I was especially proud to see him \nin attendance at the dedication of the Thomas J. Dodd Library in \nStorrs; like my father, Bill Buckley was a dedicated foe of \ntotalitarianism in all its forms.\n  In the wake of his death, tributes have risen from left and right and \nfrom every point in between. Even those who stood against Bill's \nstaunch conservatism respected his intellectual rigor and integrity. In \nthe inaugural issue of National Review, which Bill launched in 1955 at \nthe age of 30, he wrote this: ``Our political economy and our high-\nenergy industry run on large, general principles, on ideas--not by day-\nto-day guess work, expedients and improvisations. Ideas have to go into \nexchange to become or remain operative; and the medium of such exchange \nis the printed word.'' It was that commitment to ideas, to reasoned and \ncourteous debate, that we appreciated most in Bill and that we will \nmiss most.\n  His intellectual honesty spared neither himself nor his friends. When \nhe changed his mind--as he did on civil rights, on Vietnam, and on \nIraq--he did it publicly and forthrightly. And long after the movement \nhe founded took on a life of its own, Bill continued to hold it to his \nhigh standards and to call it to account. In his last years, he wrote: \n``Conservatives pride themselves on resisting change, which is as it \nshould be. But intelligent deference to tradition and stability can \nevolve into intellectual sloth and moral fanaticism, as when \nconservatives simply decline to look up from dogma because the effort \nto raise their heads and reconsider is too great.''\n  Bill resisted dogma, not because it was often wrong but because it \nwas always lazy. He was too energetic for that. And while he pioneered \nnew thinking, worked to rid the conservative movement of xenophobia, \nand even staged a quixotic run for mayor of New York City--asked what \nhe would do if elected, he replied: ``Demand a recount!''--he developed \na one-of-a-kind prose style and public persona. ``I am lapidary but not \neristic when I use big words,'' he said. Those are my thoughts exactly.\n  Bill Buckley lived a full life, devoted to words, to ideas, and to \nhis deeply-held principles. We didn't agree on much. But given his \ngrace, his wit, and his deep erudition, I can think of few people with \nwhom disagreement was so agreeable.\n  I request unanimous consent that the attached article, ``May We Not \nLose His Kind,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 29, 2008]\n\n                        May We Not Lose His Kind\n\n                           (By Peggy Noonan)\n\n       He was sui generis, wasn't he? The complete American \n     original, a national treasure, a man whose energy was a kind \n     of optimism, and whose attitude toward life, even when things \n     seemed to others bleak, was summed up in something he said to \n     a friend: ``Despair is a mortal sin.''\n       I am not sure conservatives feel despair at Bill Buckley's \n     leaving--he was 82 and had done great work in a lifetime \n     filled with pleasure--but I know they, and many others, are \n     sad, and shaken somehow. On Wednesday, after word came that \n     he had left us, in a television studio where I'd gone to try \n     and speak of some of his greatness, a celebrated liberal \n     academic looked at me stricken, and said he'd just heard the \n     news. ``I can't imagine a world without Bill Buckley in it,'' \n     he said. I said, ``Oh, that is exactly it.''\n       It is. What a space he filled.\n       It is commonplace to say that Bill Buckley brought American \n     conservatism into the mainstream. That's not quite how I see \n     it. To me he came along in the middle of the last century and \n     reminded demoralized American conservatism that it existed. \n     That it was real, that it was in fact a majority political \n     entity, and that it was inherently mainstream. This was after \n     the serious drubbing inflicted by Franklin D. Roosevelt and \n     the New Deal and the rise of modern liberalism. Modern \n     liberalism at that point was a real something, a palpable \n     movement formed by FDR and continued by others. Opposing it \n     was . . . what exactly? Robert Taft? The ghost of Calvin \n     Coolidge? Buckley said in effect, Well, there's something \n     known as American conservatism, though it does not even call \n     itself that. It's been calling itself ``voting Republican'' \n     or ``not liking the New Deal.'' But it is a very American \n     approach to life, and it has to do with knowing that the \n     government is not your master, that America is good, that \n     freedom is good and must be defended, and communism is very, \n     very bad.\n       He explained, remoralized, brought together those who saw \n     it as he did, and began the process whereby American \n     conservatism came to know itself again. And he did it \n     primarily through a magazine, which he with no modesty \n     decided was going to be the central and most important organ \n     of resurgent conservatism. National Review would be highly \n     literate, philosophical, witty, of the moment, with an elan, \n     a teasing quality that made you feel you didn't just get a \n     subscription, you joined something. You entered a world of \n     thought.\n       I thought it beautiful and inspiring that he was open to, \n     eager for, friendships from all sides, that even though he \n     cared passionately about political questions, politics was \n     not all, cannot be all, that people can be liked for their \n     essence, for their humor and good nature and intelligence, \n     for their attitude toward life itself. He and his wife, Pat, \n     were friends with lefties and righties, from National Review \n     to the Paris Review. It was moving too that his interests \n     were so broad, that he could go from an appreciation of the \n     metaphors of Norman Mailer to essays on classical music to an \n     extended debate with his beloved friend the actor David Niven \n     on the best brands of peanut butters. When I saw him last he \n     was in a conversation with the historian Paul Johnson on the \n     relative merits of the work of the artist Raeburn.\n       His broad-gaugedness, his refusal to be limited, seemed to \n     me a reflection in part of a central conservative tenet, as \n     famously expressed by Samuel Johnson. ``How small of all that \n     human hearts endure / That part which laws or kings can cause \n     or cure.'' When you have it right about laws and kings, and \n     what life is, then your politics become grounded in the facts \n     of life. And once they are grounded, you don't have to hold \n     to them so desperately. You can relax and have fun. Just \n     because you're serious doesn't mean you're grim.\n       Buckley was a one-man refutation of Hollywood's idea of a \n     conservative. He was rising in the 1950s and early '60s, and \n     Hollywood's idea of a conservative was still Mr. Potter, the \n     nasty old man of ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' who would make a \n     world of grubby Pottersvilles if he could, who cared only \n     about money and the joy of bullying idealists. Bill Buckley's \n     persona, as the first famous conservative of the modern media \n     age, said no to all that. Conservatives are brilliant, \n     capacious, full of delight at the world and full of mischief, \n     too. That's what he was. He upended old cliches.\n       This was no small thing, changing this template. Ronald \n     Reagan was the other who changed it, by being a sunny man, a \n     happy one. They were friends, admired each other, had two \n     separate and complementary roles. Reagan was in the game of \n     winning votes, of persuading, of leading a political movement \n     that catapulted him to two terms as governor of California, \n     the nation's biggest state, at a time when conservatives were \n     seemingly on the defensive but in retrospect were rising to \n     new heights. He would speak to normal people and persuade \n     them of the efficacy of conservative solutions to pressing \n     problems. Buckley's job was not reaching on-the-ground \n     voters, or reaching voters at all, and his attitude toward \n     his abilities in that area was reflected in his merry answer \n     when asked what he would do if he won the mayoralty of New \n     York. ``Demand a recount,'' he famously replied. His role was \n     speaking to those thirsting for a coherent worldview, for an \n     intellectual and moral attitude grounded in truth. He \n     provided intellectual ballast. Inspired in part by him, \n     voters went on to support Reagan. Both could have existed \n     without the other, but Buckley's work would have been less \n     satisfying, less realized, without Reagan and his presidency, \n     and Reagan's leadership would have been more difficult, and \n     also somehow less satisfying, without Buckley.\n       I share here a fear. It is not that the conservative \n     movement is ending, that Bill's death is the period on a long \n     chapter. The house he helped build had--has--many mansions. \n     Conservatism will endure if it is rooted in truth, and in the \n     truths of life. It is.\n       It is rather that with the loss of Bill Buckley we are, as \n     a nation, losing not only a great man. When Jackie Onassis \n     died, a friend of mine who knew her called me and said, with \n     such woe, ``Oh, we are losing her kind.'' He meant the \n     elegant, the cultivated, the refined. I thought of this with \n     Bill's passing, that we are losing his kind--people who were \n     deeply, broadly educated in great universities when they \n     taught deeply and broadly, who held deep views of life and \n     the world and art and all the things that make life more \n     delicious and more meaningful. We have work to do as a \n     culture in bringing up future generations that are so well \n     rounded, so full and so inspiring.\n       Bill Buckley lived a great American life. His heroism was \n     very American--the individualist at work in the world, the \n     defender of great creeds and great beliefs going forth with \n     spirit, style and joy. May we not lose his kind. For now, \n     ``Good night, sweet prince, and flights of angels take thee \n     to thy rest.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1464-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1464-S1465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING MASTER SERGEANT WOODROW WILSON KEEBLE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Master \nSergeant Woodrow Wilson Keeble, a South\n\n[[Page S1465]]\n\nDakota hero, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor at a White \nHouse ceremony this afternoon.\n  Master Sergeant Keeble was born in Waubay, SD, and was a member of \nthe Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate. He served in the Army in both World War II \nand the Korean war, and was highly decorated for his service having \nbeen awarded two Purple Hearts, the Bronze Star, the Silver Star, the \nCombat Infantryman Badge, and the Distinguished Service Cross.\n  The action for which Master Sergeant Keeble was awarded the Medal of \nHonor occurred in October 1951 near Kumsong, North Korea. The accounts \nof his actions that day are truly worthy of a Hollywood movie. Though \nwounded and having fought continually for several days in brutally cold \nweather, Master Sergeant Keeble single-handedly took out three machine \ngun emplacements which had pinned down U.S. troops. As a result, U.S. \ntroops were able to achieve their objective.\n  First Sergeant Joe K. Sagami described the action this way:\n\n       He worked his way down about fifty yards from the ridgeline \n     and flanked the enemy's left pillbox; attacking it with \n     grenades and rifle fire eliminating it. He then retreated to \n     about the point where the First Platoon was holding the \n     unit's first line of defense and worked down about fifty \n     yards from the ridgeline and proceeded to outflank the \n     enemy's right pillbox with grenades eliminating it. Then \n     without hesitation he lobbed a grenade into the back entrance \n     of the middle pillbox and with additional fire eliminated it. \n     He then ordered his First Platoon forward to eliminate what \n     little resistance was left.\n\n  In reading the words of those who fought with Master Sergeant Keeble, \nwhich have been collected by researcher Merry Helm, it is clear that \neveryone loved and respected the man they called Chief. Joseph Marston \nof George Company said, ``What `Chief' accomplished that day was common \nknowledge throughout the whole battalion. He was known for his \nbravery.''\n  When asked about Master Sergeant Keeble, Carl Fetzner, who served in \nSecond Platoon, said:\n\n       Sure I remember him. Nobody could forget him! I had barely \n     gotten to the company when this happened. I didn't know much \n     about what was going on, but I do know SGT Keeble was the \n     finest, most courageous person I ever knew. When we pulled \n     back in reserve--you know when we could go [back from] the \n     lines to clean up, whatever, take a little rest . . . he knew \n     what was going on. He took care of his men, he liked people, \n     and he always did everything he could to help you, especially \n     the new men . . ..\n\n  After the Korean war, Master Sergeant Keeble came home and went to \nwork at the Wahpeton Indian School. He enjoyed making copper sculptures \nand was active in his community. Like so many veterans, he was more \nconcerned about taking care of his family than collecting medals. At \nthe time, few even knew that the members of his own company had \nsubmitted a recommendation that he be awarded a Medal of Honor for his \nbrave action in October 1951.\n  Because the recommendation paperwork had been lost twice, Master \nSergeant Keeble did not receive the honor his fellow soldiers knew he \ndeserved. It all might have been forgotten if the men he served with, \nand later his family and friends, had not kept the issue alive for the \nnext five decades.\n  Master Sergeant Keeble's case was first brought to my attention in \n2002 by his family and members of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate. At that \ntime, I contacted the Secretary of the Army asking that Master Sergeant \nKeeble's case be reconsidered based on the loss of the original \nrecommendation paperwork. The case was bolstered by original documents \nand affidavits that had been saved by those who served with Master \nSergeant Keeble.\n  Though it has taken many years of work by many people, countless \nletters and phone calls, and even legislation passed in May 2007 \nauthorizing the President to act, President Bush recently approved the \nrecommendation and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor to Master \nSergeant Keeble's family this afternoon.\n  I never had the opportunity to meet Master Sergeant Keeble who died \nin 1982, but it has been an honor to get to know more about him by \nworking with his family over the past 6 years. I want to thank his \nfamily and friends, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, and all the people of \nSouth Dakota who have fought to secure this much-deserved honor for \nMaster Sergeant Keeble. I also want to say a special word about his \nwife Blossom, who died last year. I wish we could have gotten Master \nSergeant Keeble this recognition before Blossom passed away, but \nthankfully she knew how close we were to getting this done.\n  At a time when so many young men and women are deployed in dangerous \nplaces in defense of our country, it is important that we honor all of \nthose who have served our nation in uniform. While we owe them a debt \nof gratitude that can never be fully repaid, I am proud that today we \nhave properly thanked a South Dakota hero for his service.\n  I know I join with my colleagues and all South Dakotans in honoring \nMaster Sergeant Keeble for his service to our nation and congratulating \nhis family on receiving his Medal of Honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1465-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1465-S1466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                              NATO SUMMIT\n\n Mr. OBAMA.

NATO's leaders \nmust therefore send an unambiguous message that every country in NATO \nwill do whatever needs to be done to destroy terrorist networks in \nAfghanistan, to prevent the Taliban from returning to power, and to \nbring greater security and well-being to the Afghan people. This will \nrequire adequate numbers of capable military forces and civilian \npersonnel from NATO members and putting more of an Afghan face on \ncounter insurgency operations by providing more training and resources \nto the Afghan National Army and police forces, and by embedding more \nAfghan forces in NATO missions. We must also win long-term public \nsupport through assistance programs that make a difference in the lives \nof the Afghan people, including investments in infrastructure and \neducation; the development of alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers \nto undermine the Taliban and other drug traffickers; and increased \nefforts to combat corruption through safeguards on assistance and \nsupport for the rule of law.\n  Success in Afghanistan will also require the removal of restrictions \nthat some allies have placed on their forces in Afghanistan, which \nhamper the flexibility of commanders on the ground. The mission in \nAfghanistan--legitimized by a United Nations mandate, supported by the \nAfghan people, and endorsed by all NATO members after the United States \nwas attacked is central to NATO's future as a collective security \norganization. Afghanistan presents a test of whether NATO can carry out \nthe crucial missions of the 21st century, and NATO must come together \nto meet that challenge. Now is the time for all NATO allies to recommit \nto this common purpose.\n  The summit must also address the question of the alliance expanding \nmembership. NATO enlargement since the end of the Cold War has helped \nthe countries of Central and Eastern Europe become more stable and \ndemocratic. It has also added to NATO military capability by \nfacilitating contributions from new members to critical missions such \nas Afghanistan.\n  The three current candidates for NATO membership--Albania, Croatia \nand the Republic of Macedonia--have\n\n[[Page S1466]]\n\neach made great strides in consolidating their new democracies. They \nhave reformed their defense establishments, worked to root out \ncorruption, modernized their economies, and contributed to NATO \nsecurity missions in the Balkans and Afghanistan. Responding to these \nefforts with NATO membership at the upcoming summit would add to the \nalliance military capabilities while contributing to stability in the \nBalkans, a region still suffering from the ethnic tensions left behind \nby the bloodshed of the 1990s.\n  Ukraine and Georgia have also been developing their ties with NATO. \nTheir leaders have declared their readiness to advance a NATO \nMembership Action Plan, MAP, to prepare for the rights and obligations \nof membership. They are working to consolidate democratic reforms and \nto undertake new responsibilities in their relationship with the \nAlliance. I welcome the desire and actions of these countries to seek \ncloser ties with NATO and hope that NATO responds favorably to their \nrequest, consistent with its criteria for membership. Whether Ukraine \nand Georgia ultimately join NATO will be a decision for the members of \nthe alliance and the citizens of those countries, after a period of \nopen and democratic debate. But they should receive our help and \nencouragement as they continue to develop ties to Atlantic and European \ninstitutions.\n  NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia. Russia has an \nimportant role to play in European and global affairs and should see \nNATO as a partner, not as a threat. But we should oppose any efforts by \nthe Russian government to intimidate its neighbors or control their \nforeign policies. Russia cannot have a veto over which countries join \nthe alliance. Since the end of the Cold War, Republican and Democratic \nadministrations have supported the independence and sovereignty of all \nthe states of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and we must \ncontinue to do so. President Putin recent threat to point missiles at \nUkraine is simply not the way to promote the peaceful 21st century \nEurope we seek.\n  NATO stands as an example of how the United States can advance \nAmerican national security--and the security of the world--through a \nstrong alliance rooted in shared responsibility and shared values. NATO \nremains a vital asset in America's efforts to anchor democracy and \nstability in Europe and to defend our interests and values all over the \nworld. The Bucharest summit provides an opportunity to advance these \ngoals and to reinforce a vital alliance. NATO's leaders must seize that \nopportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1466-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1466-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting nominations \nwhich were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1466-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 2:27 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 2272.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Hawaii urging the creation of an agreement that results in an \n     economy-wide reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 24\n\n        Whereas, the White House is convening a Major Economies \n     Meeting on Energy Security and Climate Change with seventeen \n     invited countries at the Center for Cultural and Technical \n     Interchange Between East and West, Inc. (East-West Center) on \n     the campus of the University of Hawaii at Manoa on January 30 \n     and 31, 2008, to discuss potential international agreements \n     on global climate change; and\n        Whereas, for more than half a century, researchers have \n     used atmospheric samples taken at the Mauna Loa Observatory \n     on the island of Hawaii to track a steady annual increase in \n     the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and \n     have concluded that concentrations are now higher than they \n     have been in the past eight hundred thousand years; and\n        Whereas, scientific consensus links the anthropogenic \n     increase in greenhouse gases to global climate change; and\n        Whereas, the Fourth Assessment Report of the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicates that \n     global emissions of greenhouse gases need to peak in the next \n     ten to fifteen years and be reduced to levels well below half \n     those in 2000 by the middle of this century in order to \n     stabilize greenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere \n     at the lowest levels assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel \n     on Climate change to date in its scenarios; and\n        Whereas, achieving the lowest levels assessed by the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to date and \n     its corresponding potential damage limitation would \n     require developed countries as a group to reduce emissions \n     in a range of twenty-five to forty per cent below 1990 \n     levels by 2020; and\n       Whereas, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and \n     the signatory nations of the United Nations Framework \n     Convention on Climate Change have recognized the special \n     dangers of climate change to island states, territories, and \n     nations; and\n       Whereas, global climate change is causing rapid melting of \n     ice at both the north and south polar regions, which, in \n     conjunction with thermal expansion due to warmer water \n     temperatures, is leading to a rapid rise in sea level; and\n       Whereas, University of Hawaii experts have demonstrated \n     that a one meter rise in sea level would inundate much of \n     Hawaii's coastline, including the world renowned Waikiki \n     resort area, the Honolulu International Airport's reef \n     runway, the majority of Hawaii's wastewater treatment \n     facilities, many historic sites, and many populated areas, \n     including lands up to a mile away from the existing shoreline \n     in parts of Honolulu; and\n       Whereas, global climate change also threatens Hawaii with \n     stronger hurricanes, prolonged drought, shifting weather \n     patterns, warmer temperatures, shifting micro-climates, \n     increased spread of invasive species, and saltwater intrusion \n     into its aquifers; and\n       Whereas, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide \n     concentrations foster greater carbon dioxide uptake by the \n     world's oceans, leading to ocean acidification and the \n     resultant decreases in reef health and decreases in survival \n     of ocean life that rely on calcium carbonate shells; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii is doing its part to reduce its \n     contribution to global climate change by\n\n[[Page S1467]]\n\n     adopting progressive energy policies that promote the use of \n     clean energy technologies such as wind, solar, wave, and \n     biomass energy; and\n       Whereas, Act 234, Session Laws of Hawaii 2007, placed a \n     binding statewide cap on Hawaii's greenhouse gas emissions by \n     requiring Hawaii to reduce its non-aviation greenhouse gas \n     emissions to their 1990 levels before 2020: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-fourth Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2008, That in \n     recognition of Hawaii's overwhelming vulnerability to global \n     climate change, the President of the United States is urged \n     to use the January 30 and 31, 2008, Major Economies Meeting \n     on Energy Security and Climate Change, which is being hosted \n     in Hawaii, to commit to an economy-wide reduction in \n     greenhouse gas emissions in the United States; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the President of the United States is urged \n     to consent to binding and quantified commitments for the \n     United States under the United Nations Framework Convention \n     on Climate Change that would result in the rapid \n     stabilization and decrease in atmospheric greenhouse gas \n     concentrations; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, members of Hawaii's \n     congressional delegation, and the Secretariat of the United \n     Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n                                  ____\n\n        POM-290. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State \n     of Michigan urging the Congress to establish stricter \n     standards for the drug approval process; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 134\n\n        Whereas, Americans are justifiably concerned about the \n     safety and efficacy of the drugs and medications they take. \n     In recent years, the FDA has received consumer reports of \n     safety concerns and harmful side effects after the use of \n     drugs approved by the FDA. In some cases, the FDA or \n     manufacturer response to these reports has not been timely \n     and consumers continue to risk harm; and\n        Whereas, The FDA is responsible for protecting public \n     health by assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of \n     human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical \n     devices, our nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products \n     that emit radiation. Accountability rests with the FDA to \n     require stringent testing and trials before a drug can be \n     approved for marketing; and\n        Whereas, Incidents of harmful side effects raised concerns \n     that the FDA post-marketing monitoring needs strengthening. \n     Although American drugs are arguably the safest in the world, \n     allegations of detrimental consequences from FDA-approved \n     drugs show that there is room for improvement. Stricter \n     standards for the FDA's investigation and response to \n     consumer reports of harmful side effects should be \n     established to enhance the safety of drugs approved by the \n     FDA and on the market. The FDA must immediately investigate \n     consumer reports of harmful side effects and act quickly to \n     protect the public. In this way, Michigan's tort law and \n     strict FDA standards will ensure that Michigan residents can \n     have confidence in the drugs and medications they take; now, \n     therefore, be it\n        Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the United \n     States Congress and United States Food and Drug \n     Administration to establish stricter standards for the drug \n     approval process; and be it further\n        Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the Commissioner of \n     the United States Food and Drug Administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1467-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S1467, March 3, 2008, under the heading REPORTS OF \nCOMMITTEES, the following appears: ``By Mr. PRYOR, from the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, with an \namendment in the nature of a substitute: S. 602.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to modify \ncertain authorities relating to educational assistance benefits for \nveterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am introducing today the proposed GI Bill \nMiscellaneous Improvements Act of 2008. This measure would make three \nminor but important changes in existing law relating to veterans' \neducational assistance programs.\n  In 2001, Public Law 107-103 established a program of accelerated \npayments for individuals enrolled in high-cost programs of educational \nassistance leading to employment in high technology industry. It is \ngenerally agreed that the intent of that legislation was that payments \nwere to be effective with respect to short, non-degree programs of \neducation. For example, Senate Report 107-86 stated:\n\n       Microsoft, Cisco, and other technical training for \n     certification is offered through training centers, private \n     contractors to community colleges, or by the companies \n     themselves. These courses often last just a few weeks or \n     months, and can cost many thousands of dollars . . .\n       During the Committee's June 28th hearing, Dr. Leo Mackay, \n     Deputy Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     testified that ``providing educational benefits for pursuit \n     of these [technology] courses is fully\n\n[[Page S1469]]\n\n     consonant with MGIB purposes.'' David Tucker, Senior \n     Associate Legislative Director of the Paralyzed Veterans of \n     America, also testified that, ``If the MGIB is to be used not \n     only for recruitment purposes, but also as a means of \n     enabling a veteran to make a smooth transition back to \n     civilian life, then S. 1088 [allowing veterans to use their \n     MGIB benefits in courses leading to certification in \n     technical fields] is a vital means to accomplish these \n     goals.''\n\n  As enacted, however, the payments are made to individuals pursuing \nany courses in the high technology sector including associate and \ndegree programs.\n  The legislation I am introducing would correct this oversight \nprospectively, while holding harmless those individuals who might be \nreceiving accelerated payments for degree programs at this time.\n  Public Law 107-103 also expanded the scope of work that could be \nassigned to individuals participating in VA work study programs. \nSpecifically, it added to acceptable activities certain outreach \nservices programs, activities relating to hospital and domiciliary care \nto veterans in State homes, and activities relating to the \nadministration of national or state veterans' cemeteries.\n  As enacted, this expansion of scope was initially made available \nuntil December 31, 2006. Public Law 109-461 extended the scope \nexpansion until June 30, 2007. Since legislation extending the scope \nexpansion was stalled in Congress, there was a disruption in the \nprovision of these important activities until Public Law 110-157, \nenacted on December 26, 2007, extended this expansion until June 30, \n2010.\n  My proposal would make this activity expansion permanent so that the \nunfortunate disruption that occurred this year will not occur in the \nfuture. I note that this provision does not affect the number of VA \nwork study positions that may be made available. It only addresses the \ntype of activities that may be carried out under the program.\n  Finally, this bill would authorize appropriations for VA payments to \nState Approving Agencies. Under provisions of chapter 36 of title 38, \nU.S. Code, VA contracts for the services of State approving agencies--\nSAAs--for the purpose of approving programs of education at \ninstitutions of higher learning, apprenticeship programs, on-job \ntraining programs, and other programs. SAAs are also tasked with \nassisting VA with various outreach activities to inform eligible VA \nprogram participants of the educational assistance benefits to which \nthey are entitled.\n  Since 1988, VA payment for the services of SAAs has been made only \nout of funds available for readjustment benefits, a mandatory funding \naccount, and has thus been subject to funding caps. Section 3674(a)(4) \nof title 38, U.S. Code, states as follows: ``The total amount made \navailable under this section for any fiscal year may not exceed \n$13,000,000 or, for fiscal year 2007, $19,000,000.'' Thus, under \nexisting law, the cap on the amount of funds that could be made \navailable in fiscal years 2008 and beyond would revert to funding \nlevels applied prior to fiscal year 2000--or a reduction of more than \n32 percent.\n  A provision in S. 1315 that would restore the $19 million cap on \nfunding is currently pending in the Senate, and a $19 million funding \nlevel was provided for through the appropriations process. However, the \nmeasure I am introducing would look beyond this fiscal year and address \nthe needs of the program in the future.\n  By authorizing appropriations for the SAAs, I believe that the \nprogram will be able to justify increases in the current funding level \nbeyond the $19 million level to which they would be restricted for all \nfiscal years going forward. Further, I believe that the current cap on \nfunding, although to some appearing attractive because it seems to \noffer some stability by pulling from the mandatory funding readjustment \nbenefits account, actually offers no such stability as VA could at any \ntime determine that $2 million ``does not exceed'' $19 million.\n  I am committed to seeking an adequate level of funding for the \nimportant activities of the SAAs and believe that this approach would \nassist in achieving that goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 2683\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2683\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reform the housing choice voucher program under \nsection 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce with \nmy colleagues Senators Schumer, Reed, Menendez and Brown, the Section 8 \nVoucher Reform Act of 2008, a bill to improve our Nation's largest \ninitiative to assist low-income families afford housing. Section 8 \nhousing vouchers help 2 million American families--including many \nchildren, seniors and people with disabilities--afford safe, decent and \nstable housing.\n  The current crisis in the U.S. housing market is having ripple \neffects throughout our Nation. Families are losing their homes--both \nhomeowners and renters whose properties are being foreclosed upon. \nThose who can hold onto their homes have seen significant losses in \nequity, and many owe more on their mortgage than the value of their \nhome. This crisis in the housing sector is causing a significant \nslowdown in our economy, and housing assistance will need to be \nstrengthened so families have access to safe, affordable housing.\n  Without housing assistance, many families would lack the stability to \nfind and retain employment, and many children would be unable to \nadequately perform in school because of multiple moves or health \nproblems resulting from inadequate housing.\n  Though millions of families are assisted through housing programs, \nthe need for additional housing opportunities is acute. The Joint \nCenter for Housing Studies found that last year the number of severely \ncost-burdened households, those that pay more than half of their income \ntowards rent, jumped by 1.2 million to a total of 17 million. This is \none in seven U.S. households that struggle to afford housing without \nforegoing other basic needs.\n  Housing vouchers are a successful way to provide stability for \nmillions of Americans. Through this public-private partnership, \nvouchers allow low-\nincome, working Americans to live closer to employment and educational \nopportunities, and nearer to social and familial networks and support.\n  While housing vouchers are a critical tool, the program needs to be \nupdated\n\n[[Page S1470]]\n\nso that additional families can benefit, and so that taxpayer dollars \nare spent more efficiently.\n  The voucher reform bill that I am introducing today will help attract \nadditional private landlords, reduce administrative burdens, and help \nmore families achieve self-sufficiency.\n  This bill creates a stable and efficient formula for allocating \nvoucher funds so that families do not lose their housing. Under this \nformula, housing agencies are encouraged to lower the costs per \nvoucher, helping to create efficiencies in the program and allowing \nmore people to access needed housing opportunities.\n  The bill encourages employment by allowing voucher holders to keep \nmore of their earnings, while ensuring that they pay fair rents. \nSystematic funding is provided for Family Self-Sufficiency coordinators \nso that more families can access this successful program aimed at \nincreasing earnings and saving for homeownership.\n  The bill authorizes 20,000 additional incremental housing vouchers to \nhelp meet the great and growing demand for assistance from low-income \nworking families, seniors, and people with disabilities.\n  Under this bill, administrative burdens are eased, so that housing \nagencies spend less time and funding on paperwork, and more time and \nfunding on assisting families in need. To more effectively use program \nresources, the bill requires unit inspections every 2 years instead of \nannually. While the bill retains the requirement that tenants pay 30 \npercent of their income towards rent, it streamlines and standardizes \nthe calculation of income so that housing agencies can rely on \nstandard, as opposed to individualized, income deductions.\n  This bill will greatly improve the voucher program, and I am pleased \nto be sponsoring this legislation. It has support from more than 80 \nlocal and national groups, including the Lawyers Committee for Civil \nRights Under Law, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the National \nAlliance to End Homelessness.\n  This is a strong and needed bill, and I urge my colleagues to support \nour efforts to provide additional affordable housing opportunities to \nlow-income families all across our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, a \nlist of supporters, and a section-by-section analysis be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2684\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Not later than \n     18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     center shall submit a report to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Financial Services of the House of Representatives, which \n     shall provide recommendations for implementation, specific to \n     programs of the Department, and information and templates \n     that could be made available to all recipients of grants from \n     the Department.\n       (E) Cultural and linguistic competence materials.--The \n     center shall provide information relating to culturally and \n     linguistically competent housing services for populations \n     with limited English proficiency.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     subsection (a).\n       (c) Report.--Not later than the expiration of the 6-month \n     period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     and annually thereafter, the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development shall submit a report regarding its compliance \n     with the requirements under subsection (a) to the Committee \n     on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Financial Services of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 21. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated the amount necessary \n     for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2013 to provide public \n     housing agencies with incremental tenant-based assistance \n     under section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 \n     (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)) sufficient to assist 20,000 incremental \n     dwelling units in each such fiscal year. A preference for \n     allocation of such incremental tenant-based assistance, as \n     part of the competitive process required by section 213(d) of \n     the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. \n     1439(d)), is to be given to (1) preserving affordable \n     housing, including State public housing, and other housing \n     that needs operating support in order to remain affordable, \n     and (2) entities that are providing voucher assistance on a \n     regional basis.\n\n[[Page S1480]]\n\n     SEC. 22.

Short title\n       Short title identifying the bill as the ``Section 8 Voucher \n     Reform Act of 2008.''\n     Section 2. Inspection of dwelling units\n       Makes a number of changes to the inspection requirements \n     for housing units rented to Section 8 voucher holders. \n     Retains the initial inspection requirement, except permits \n     occupancy and payments to be made for up to 30 days if a unit \n     fails inspection as a result only of non-life threatening \n     conditions. In such case, payments must be suspended after 30 \n     days if the deficiencies are not corrected. Also allows a PHA \n     to permit occupancy prior to inspection if another federal \n     program inspection has been made within the preceding 12 \n     months.\n       Properties will be required to be re-inspected at least \n     every two years instead of annually. Permits use of \n     inspections under a federal, state, or local housing \n     assistance program in lieu of a public housing agency (PHA) \n     voucher inspection. Requires a PHA to conduct an interim \n     inspection within 15 days after a tenant notifies the PHA \n     that a unit is out of compliance and within 24 hours in the \n     case of a life threatening condition.\n       If a property fails an inspection and the failure is not \n     corrected within 30 days, the PHA is required to abate \n     assistance for up to 120 days, and the PHA may use abated \n     assistance to repair life-threatening conditions. Requires a \n     PHA to terminate its contract with the owner at the end of \n     the abatement period if the unit is not repaired, and to \n     notify the tenant that they have 120 days to find new housing \n     beginning at the start of the abatement period. Requires that \n     PHAs provide reasonable assistance to the displaced tenant, \n     including the use of up to two months of abated assistance \n     for relocation expenses, and if necessary give the tenant \n     additional time to search for a unit or, at the tenant's \n     option, preference for the next available public housing \n     unit.\n     Section 3. Rent reform and income reviews\n       Recertification. Modifies the annual certification \n     requirement for the Section 8 voucher and project-based \n     assistance programs and for public housing to permit PHAs and \n     owners to recertify fixed-income families every three years. \n     Requires interim recertifications only if annual income \n     increases by $1,000 or more, or at a family's request if its \n     income falls by $1,000 or more.\n       Simplification. Simplifies the rent calculation process for \n     the Section 8 voucher and project-based assistance programs \n     and for public housing so that there is more reliance on \n     standardized deductions. Raises the standard deduction for \n     elderly and disabled families from $400 to $700 a year, and \n     indexes that amount and the $480 dependent standard deduction \n     for inflation in subsequent years. Allows deduction of \n     unreimbursed child care expenses above 5 percent of annual \n     income and raises the threshold for calculating medical and \n     handicapped assistance expense deductions from counting such \n     expenses over 3 percent to over 10 percent of income. \n     Contains administrative simplification provisions, including \n     relieving PHAs of the responsibility to maintain records of \n     HUD-required income exclusions, creating safe harbor for \n     reliance on other governmental income determinations (eg., \n     Medicaid, TANF), and eliminating the need to calculate any \n     imputed return on assets.\n       Work and Education Incentives: To help provide incentives \n     for employment and earnings, a family's prior year's income \n     is used to calculate its rent obligation and the first 10% of \n     the first $9,000 of earned income is excluded from the income \n     calculation. Exempts income of minors (except for heads of \n     households or their spouses) and of adult dependents that are \n     full time students, and exempts grant-in-aid or scholarship \n     amounts used for tuition or books.\n       Impact on Public Housing Revenues. Requires HUD to provide \n     additional public housing operating funds to public housing \n     agencies whose rental income declines by more than one half \n     of a percent as a result of the rent reforms in the bill, \n     subject to the availability of funds. Also requires HUD to \n     submit to Congress, a report identifying and calculating the \n     impact of rent reforms on public housing costs and revenues.\n     Section 4. Eligibility for assistance based on assets and \n         income\n       To better target assistance, prohibits any family from \n     receiving assistance if they have more than $100,000 in net \n     assets or an ownership in a residence suitable for occupancy. \n     Excludes from this a number of assets including homeownership \n     equity accounts and family self-sufficiency accounts, \n     necessary items of personal property, retirement and \n     education savings account assets, and amounts from certain \n     disability-related lawsuits. Also excludes properties owned \n     by victims of domestic violence and properties owned by \n     families making a good faith effort to sell. Allows \n     flexibility by permitting PHAs to elect not to enforce limits \n     for public housing residents, and PHAs and project-based \n     owners may delay eviction or termination of families not \n     meeting asset restrictions for up to six months.\n       Extends the 80% of local area median income limitation that \n     applies to initial occupancy to apply on an ongoing basis \n     (determined at periodic recertification). PHAs and owners may \n     elect not to enforce this income limitation for residents of \n     public housing or project-based Section 8 units, and PHAs and \n     owners may delay eviction or termination for up to six \n     months.\n     Section 5. Targeting vouchers to low income working families\n       To address needs in very-low income areas, allows the \n     higher of 30% of area median income or the national poverty \n     level to be used as the income threshold for extremely-low \n     income families.\n     Section 6. Voucher funding renewal\n       Authorizes such sums as may be necessary for Fiscal Years \n     2009 through 2013 for the renewal of expiring Section 8 \n     vouchers, and for new tenant protection, enhanced vouchers, \n     and other special purpose vouchers.\n       Stabilizes the voucher renewal formula to provide adequate \n     and predictable funding each year. The voucher funding \n     allocation shall be re-calculated each year, based on a PHA's \n     leasing and cost data from the prior calendar year. Such \n     calculation is adjusted for an annual inflation factor as \n     well as the first time renewal of incremental, tenant \n     protection and enhanced vouchers; for vouchers set aside \n     for project-based assistance; for vouchers ported in the \n     prior year; and for such other adjustments as HUD \n     considers appropriate, including adjustments for\n\n[[Page S1481]]\n\n     natural and other major disasters. PHAs are provided \n     incentives to bring down voucher costs by allowing use of \n     vouchers above the authorized level, but overall cost \n     growth is constrained by limiting renewal funding to 103% \n     of their authorized voucher level if reserves were used.\n       To ensure funds are available when there are market or \n     program income fluctuations, PHAs may retain reserves equal \n     to one eighth (12.5%, or \\1/2\\ months) of their annual \n     allocation at the end of 2008, 7.5 percent at the end of \n     2009, and 5% in each succeeding year. To implement the \n     limitation on reserve funds, at the end of each year, HUD is \n     required to reduce a PHA's funding allocation for the \n     following year to offset excess reserves. HUD is required to \n     make available all savings from such offsets to cover \n     increased costs related to portability and family self-\n     sufficiency escrow accounts, and for reallocation to PHAs for \n     increased voucher leasing and to reward good performance. If \n     a PHA has reserves of less than 2%, it can receive an advance \n     of up to 2% in the last three months of a year to cover \n     overages, which it ``repays'' through an offsetting funding \n     reduction in the next year's funding allocation.\n       Provides for proration if overall funding is insufficient \n     to meet nationwide costs, except that enhanced vouchers shall \n     be fully funded. HUD is required to allocate all funds by the \n     later of February 15th or 45 days after enactment of the \n     appropriations bill funding renewals.\n       Tenant protection vouchers\n       Requires HUD to issue tenant protection vouchers, including \n     enhanced vouchers for all public and assisted housing units \n     that are lost (not just those occupied at time of application \n     for such vouchers).\n       Portability\n       Requires PHAs to absorb ported vouchers from other PHAs \n     starting on January 1, 2010, except that agencies are \n     directed to phase in the absorption of the existing backlog \n     of ported vouchers. Permits HUD to limit absorption in excess \n     of a PHA's authorized level if HUD determines that there is \n     insufficient funding. PHAs that absorb ported vouchers \n     receive priority to be awarded excess funds to cover the \n     resulting costs. If funds are inadequate to cover the costs \n     of absorbed portability vouchers, HUD is directed to suspend \n     the absorption requirement after providing 60 days notice to \n     PHAs and the public.\n       Vouchers for people with disabilities\n       HUD is required to develop and issue guidance to ensure \n     that incremental vouchers for disabled families will continue \n     to be provided to such families upon voucher turnover.\n     Section 7. Administrative fees\n       Continues the current practice setting voucher \n     administrative fees based on the number of vouchers in use \n     and retains the Fiscal Year 2003 per unit fee as a baseline \n     (adjusted for inflation) unless HUD establishes a new formula \n     for calculating per unit fees by regulation.\n       Family self sufficiency\n       To assist in administering the successful Family Self \n     Sufficiency Program (FSS), this section provides that voucher \n     administrative fees will include a fee for FSS, based on the \n     number of families being served, subject to performance \n     standards to be established by the Secretary. Provides for \n     proration if insufficient funds are appropriated to meet all \n     costs under this provision, with a priority for funding at \n     least one coordinator at each eligible agency. In addition, \n     this section authorizes $10 million for an evaluation of the \n     effectiveness of FSS programs.\n     Section 8. HOMEOWNERSHIP\n       This section continues the voucher homeownership program \n     and permits voucher funds to be used for a down payment for \n     first-time homebuyers, up to $10,000.\n       Facilitates use of vouchers for the full cost of purchasing \n     manufactured homes sited on leased land, by permitting \n     voucher funds to be used for both the cost of leasing the \n     land plus monthly home purchase costs, including property \n     taxes, insurance, and tenant-paid utilities.\n     Section 9 Performance assessments\n       The section ensures that PHAs are administering their \n     voucher programs effectively by requiring HUD to assess \n     voucher administration. Under this section, assessment must \n     include the quality of units assisted, utilization of \n     allocated funds and authorized vouchers, timeliness and \n     accuracy of reporting to HUD, reasonableness of rent burdens, \n     accurate rent and utility calculations and subsidy payments, \n     effectiveness in carrying out family self-sufficiency \n     activities, timeliness of actions related to landlord \n     participation, and other factors as the HUD Secretary \n     considers appropriate. Assessments must be conducted \n     biannually, with results provided to Congress and the public \n     as well as to PHAs. HUD must establish by regulation the \n     procedures to be followed to bring poor performing agencies \n     into compliance.\n     Section 10. PHA project-based assistance\n       To facilitate housing development, this section increases \n     the maximum project-based voucher contract term from 10 to 15 \n     years to be consistent with the underwriting period for the \n     Low Income Housing Tax Credit program and also provides that \n     rents for project-based vouchers shall not be reduced by \n     virtue of being used in conjunction with Low-Income Housing \n     Tax Credits.\n       This section increases the percentage of vouchers a PHA can \n     project-base from 20% to 25%, with authority to go a further \n     5% higher to serve homeless people. This section also \n     increases the percentage of vouchers that can be project-\n     based in any project (rather than building) to the greater of \n     25 dwelling units or 25% of the units in the project, with \n     authority to go up to 40% in areas where vouchers are hard to \n     use. Maintains an exception to this limitation for units \n     specifically made available for elderly and disabled families \n     or populations with special needs receiving comprehensive \n     services, and adds an exception for single family properties \n     with no more than four dwelling units.\n       Allows a PHA to transfer vouchers and budget authority to \n     other PHAs in the same or adjacent metropolitan areas or \n     counties, to provide project-based assistance that will \n     promote mobility and increase housing and economic \n     opportunities. Directs HUD to encourage such transfers and \n     promptly carry out funding and contract modifications needed \n     to implement them.\n     Section 11. Rent burdens\n       Requires HUD to monitor voucher rent burdens and submit an \n     annual report to Congress on the percentage of families \n     nationwide paying more than 30% and 40% of their adjusted \n     income for rent. Requires HUD to submit an annual report to \n     Congress on the degree to which voucher families of \n     particular racial and ethnic groups are clustered in lower-\n     rent, higher poverty areas, and what can be done to achieve \n     greater geographic distribution.\n       Requires PHAs to make information on local rent burdens and \n     poverty concentrations available to the public. If the \n     percentage of voucher families paying more than 40% of income \n     for rent exceeds 5%, or families of particular racial and \n     ethnic groups are concentrated in higher poverty areas, the \n     PHA must either raise the payment standard or explain why \n     payment standards are not being raised. HUD is required to \n     approve requests to raise payment standards in such \n     circumstances up to 120% of FMR, if the PHA has conducted a \n     thorough review of its payment standards and rent \n     reasonableness procedures and taken a series of other steps \n     to ease rent burdens and expand housing opportunities. As a \n     reasonable accommodation for a person with a disability, a \n     PHA may increase payment standards up to 120% of the FMR \n     without approval from HUD, and HUD may approve requests for \n     payment standards above 120% of the FMR.\n     Section 12. Establishment of fair market rent\n       To ensure that Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are accurate, this \n     section requires separate FMRs for each metropolitan city \n     with over 40,000 rental units and each county (except \n     counties that are located entirely within metropolitan cities \n     with over 40,000 rental units or in the New England states).\n     Section 13. Screening of applicants\n       This section ensures fair decisions about program \n     eligibility by limiting a PHA's elective screening of \n     applicants to criteria that directly relate to an applicant's \n     ability to fulfill the obligations of the lease, while \n     retaining the ability of a PHA to deny eligibility based on \n     criminal background and reasons relating to safety and \n     security. Applicants and current participants are required to \n     be notified of the basis of any determination of \n     ineligibility, and are to be provided an informal hearing to \n     present mitigating circumstances in such cases.\n     Section 14. Enhanced vouchers\n       This section ensures that families can remain in their \n     housing, by providing that families may receive enhanced \n     vouchers in the case of a property prepayment or opt-out even \n     if they reside in oversized units, except that such tenants \n     may be required to move to appropriate sized units and \n     provides that families eligible for enhanced vouchers are not \n     required to requalify under the PHA's selection standards. \n     Directs HUD to issue implementing regulations within six \n     months after the bill is enacted.\n     Section 15. Project-based preservation vouchers\n       Authorizes provision of project-based vouchers in lieu of \n     enhanced vouchers (which are provided as continued housing \n     assistance where an owner prepays a HUD-insured mortgage or \n     upon the termination of a Section 8 contract), at the request \n     of a project owner and a determination by the PHA that the \n     building is economically viable and assisted units in the \n     building will be in significant demand or will further \n     community goals. Families otherwise eligible for enhanced \n     vouchers will be eligible for preservation project-based \n     vouchers. Such preservation project-based vouchers are \n     similar to other project-based voucher assistance except they \n     are not counted against the limit on the share of a PHA's \n     voucher assistance that may be project-based, and are exempt \n     from the limit on the share of units in a building that may \n     be assisted with project-based vouchers.\n     Section 16. Demonstration program waiver authority\n       HUD is authorized to enter into agreements with the Social \n     Security Administration and the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services to allow for participation in state demonstration \n     programs designed to permit persons with significant \n     disabilities to be employed and continue to receive a range \n     of federal benefits. HUD is authorized to permit a partial or \n     complete disregard of increases in earned income for persons \n     participating in any such demonstration for the purpose of\n\n[[Page S1482]]\n\n     calculating rent contributions for housing assisted by \n     Section 8 vouchers.\n     Section 17. Study to identify obstacles to using vouchers in \n         federally subsidized housing projects\n       Requires GAO to conduct a study on what legislative, \n     regulatory and administrative requirements of federal housing \n     programs (HOME, LIHTC), or practices and policies of PHAs or \n     owners present obstacles to the use of vouchers in federally \n     assisted housing.\n     Section 18. Collection of data on tenants in projects \n         receiving tax credits\n       Requires state agencies administering Low-Income Housing \n     Tax Credits to submit annual data to HUD on the \n     characteristics of tenants in each Low-Income Housing Tax \n     Credit project. Instructs state agencies, to the extent \n     feasible, to collect data from owners through existing \n     reporting processes and in a manner that minimizes burdens on \n     property owners and directs HUD to establish standards and \n     definitions for data collection, establish procedures to \n     minimize duplicative reporting requirements for properties \n     assisted under multiple housing programs (in coordination \n     with other federal agencies administering housing programs), \n     provide states with technical assistance establishing data \n     systems, and compile and make publicly available data \n     submitted by states. Authorizes appropriations in Fiscal \n     Years 2009 through 2013 to cover costs to HUD related to data \n     collection.\n     Section 19. Agency authority for utility payments in certain \n         circumstances\n        In cases where an owner fails to make required utility \n     payments, this section authorizes the PHA to use voucher \n     subsidy payments normally due to the owner to pay for \n     continued utility service. Requires a PHA to take reasonable \n     steps to notify the owner before making direct utility \n     payments instead of payments to the owner, except that no \n     prior notification is required in cases where a utility \n     cutoff rendering the unit uninhabitable has occurred or is \n     threatened.\n     Section 20. Access to HUD programs for persons with limited \n         English proficiency\n        To facilitate compliance with the Executive Order \n     requiring program access to people with Limited English \n     Proficiency, this section directs HUD to convene a task force \n     to identify vital documents that need to be translated to \n     improve access to HUD services and make available \n     translations within six months after documents are identified \n     by the task force. Requires HUD to develop and carry out a \n     plan to establish a housing information resource center to \n     provide translations of written materials, provide a toll-\n     free 24 hour interpretation service, and conduct a study of \n     best-practices.\n        Authorizes appropriations to enable HUD to carry out the \n     requirements of this section, and directs HUD to submit a \n     report regarding its compliance within six months after \n     enactment.\n     Section 21. Authorization of appropriations\n        Authorizes appropriations for the amount necessary to \n     provide incremental vouchers for 20,000 families in each year \n     from fiscal year 2009 through 2013, and establishes \n     preferences for receipt of such assistance to preserve \n     affordable housing and for entities that provide voucher \n     assistance on a regional basis.\n     Section 22. Effective date\n        Provides that provisions of the bill take effect on \n     January 1, 2009, except for Sections 3, 4, and 13 (relating \n     to rents, income and asset limitations and fair market rents, \n     which will take effect at the start of fiscal year 2010). \n     Requires that PHAs and owners provide current tenants with \n     notification of the major changes in the bill regarding rent \n     policies and income and asset rules for continuing \n     eligibility as soon as possible after enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1482-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 468--DESIGNATING APRIL 2008 AS ``NATIONAL 9-1-1 \n                           EDUCATION MONTH''\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Mr. Stevens) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 468\n\n       Whereas 9-1-1 is nationally recognized as the number to \n     call in an emergency to receive immediate help from police, \n     fire, emergency medical services, or other appropriate \n     emergency response entities;\n       Whereas, in 1967, the President's Commission on Law \n     Enforcement and Administration of Justice recommended that a \n     ``single number should be established'' nationwide for \n     reporting emergency situations, and other Federal Government \n     agencies and various governmental officials also supported \n     and encouraged the recommendation;\n       Whereas, in 1968, the American Telephone and Telegraph \n     Company (AT) announced that it would establish the digits \n     9-1-1 as the emergency code throughout the United States;\n       Whereas 9-1-1 was designated by Congress as the national \n     emergency call number under the Wireless Communications and \n     Public Safety Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-81; 113 Stat. \n     1286);\n       Whereas section 102 of the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 (47 \n     U.S.C. 942 note) declared an enhanced 9-1-1 system to be ``a \n     high national priority'' and part of ``our Nation's homeland \n     security and public safety'';\n       Whereas it is important that policy makers at all levels of \n     government understand the importance of 9-1-1, how the system \n     works today, and the steps that are needed to modernize the \n     9-1-1 system;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is the connection between the eyes \n     and ears of the public and the emergency response system in \n     the United States and is often the first place emergencies of \n     all magnitudes are reported, making 9-1-1 a significant \n     homeland security asset;\n       Whereas more than 6,000 9-1-1 public safety answering \n     points serve more than 3,000 counties and parishes throughout \n     the United States;\n       Whereas dispatchers at public safety answering points \n     answer more than 200,000,000 9-1-1 calls each year in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas a growing number of 9-1-1 calls are made using \n     wireless and Internet Protocol-based communications services;\n       Whereas a growing segment of the population, including the \n     deaf, hard of hearing, and deaf-blind, and individuals with \n     speech disabilities, are increasingly communicating with \n     nontraditional text, video, and instant messaging \n     communications services and expect those services to be able \n     to connect directly to 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the growth and variety of means of communication, \n     including mobile and Internet Protocol-based systems, impose \n     challenges for accessing 9-1-1 and implementing an enhanced \n     9-1-1 system and require increased education and awareness \n     about the capabilities of different means of communication;\n       Whereas numerous other N-1-1 and 800 number services exist \n     for nonemergency situations, including 2-1-1, 3-1-1, 5-1-1, \n     7-1-1, 8-1-1, poison control centers, and mental health \n     hotlines, and the public needs to be educated on when to use \n     those services in addition to or instead of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas international visitors and immigrants make up an \n     increasing percentage of the United States population each \n     year, and visitors and immigrants may have limited knowledge \n     of our emergency calling system;\n       Whereas people of all ages use 9-1-1 and it is critical to \n     educate those people on the proper use of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas senior citizens are at high risk for needing to \n     access to 9-1-1 and many senior citizens are learning to use \n     new technology;\n       Whereas thousands of 9-1-1 calls are made every year by \n     children properly trained in the use of 9-1-1, which saves \n     lives and underscores the critical importance of training \n     children early in life about 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is often misused, including by the \n     placement of prank and nonemergency calls;\n       Whereas misuse of the 9-1-1 system results in costly and \n     inefficient use of 9-1-1 and emergency response resources and \n     needs to be reduced;\n       Whereas parents, teachers, and all other caregivers need to \n     play an active role in 9-1-1 education for children, but will \n     do so only after being first educated themselves;\n       Whereas there are many avenues for 9-1-1 public education, \n     including safety fairs, school presentations, libraries, \n     churches, businesses, public safety answering point tours or \n     open houses, civic organizations, and senior citizen centers;\n       Whereas children, parents, teachers, and the National \n     Parent Teacher Association contribute importantly to the \n     education of children about the importance of 9-1-1 through \n     targeted outreach efforts to public and private school \n     systems;\n       Whereas we as a Nation should strive to host at least 1 \n     educational event regarding the proper use of 9-1-1 in every \n     school in the country every year; and\n       Whereas programs to promote proper use of 9-1-1 during \n     National 9-1-1 Education Month could include--\n       (1) public awareness events, including conferences and \n     media outreach, training activities for parents, teachers, \n     school administrators, other caregivers and businesses;\n       (2) educational events in schools and other appropriate \n     venues; and\n       (3) production and distribution of information about the 9-\n     1-1 system designed to educate people of all ages on the \n     importance and proper use of 9-1-1; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States deserve the best \n     education regarding the use of 9-1-1: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2008 as ``National 9-1-1 Education \n     Month''; and\n       (2) urges Government officials, parents, teachers, school \n     administrators, caregivers, businesses, nonprofit \n     organizations, and the people of the United States to observe \n     the month with appropriate ceremonies, training events, and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/03/senate-section/article/S1482-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1482-S1483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4087.
