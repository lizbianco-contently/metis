Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business for 60 minutes. The Republicans will control the first \nhalf, the Democrats the second half. Following this period of morning \nbusiness, the Senate will resume postcloture debate on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 6, the Energy bill.\n  We have consent to move to the bill itself after the caucuses end at \n2:15 today. The motion to proceed will be agreed to, and the Senate \nwill begin consideration of the energy legislation. Senators Bingaman, \nDomenici, we understand Boxer and Inhofe and Inouye, or his designee, \nand Stevens, will come and talk about this bill. Hopefully, they will \ndo it this morning to lay the groundwork for this very important piece \nof legislation.\n  As with the competitiveness bill, this is a bipartisan bill. I remind \neveryone, matters that the Energy Committee reports out of their \ncommittee on a bipartisan basis are part of this bill. The same applied \nto Commerce; the same applied to the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee.\n  Those matters the chairmen wanted out of those committees that were \nnot bipartisan are not part of this bill. This is truly a bipartisan \nbill. There will be amendments offered to weaken the bill, to \nstrengthen the bill--of course, the understanding of those words is in \nthe eyes of the beholder.\n  I hope this will be a good, strong debate. I hope people will offer \namendments. We have a limited amount of time to complete a lot of work. \nIf there are long delays, people not offering amendments, I know the \nmanagers will be saying we have to end this some way, and the ``some \nway'' that we are always forced to look at is whether we want to have a \nbipartisan cloture vote on ending debate.\n  Let's have people who want to offer amendments do it as quickly as \npossible. I have asked the managers of the bill, rather than wait \naround for people who say: I don't know if I want a vote on this, we \nneed more time--after there has been a reasonable amount of time \ndiscussing one of these amendments, the managers should move to table \nthe amendment. If it is not tabled, nothing is lost. We need to move \nalong and get this legislation completed as quickly as possible.\n  Gas prices are going down. They have dropped a few cents the last \nweek or two, which is good. The cost of oil coming into this country \nhas gone up. It is now at $67 and people are saying it is going up \nhigher, which will mean there will be an increase at the gas pumps a \nmonth or so after the cost of oil importation increases.\n  Remember, we have an obligation with this legislation. This \nlegislation, which some people say is not strong enough, if it passes, \nwill cut the amount of oil we use per day in this country by 4 million \nbarrels. Think about that, 4 million barrels a day. This is a step in \nthe right direction. I hope we can do this.\n  The setting for this is, among other things, we use 21 million \nbarrels of oil every day. We import 65 percent of that. As I said \nyesterday in illustration of how much this is, it is a ditch 150 feet \ndeep and 11 miles long filled with oil. That is how much we use every \nday.\n\n[[Page S7498]]\n\n  We have an obligation to the American people to lessen our \ndependence, to make that ditch shorter and not nearly as deep.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7498-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a story in today's Los Angeles Times \nstates that the approval rating of Congress is the lowest in a decade. \nThe poll reported in today's Los Angeles Times says 27 percent of \nAmericans approve of how Congress is doing its job, and most see \nbusiness as usual. After Congress has diverted its attention from what \nI consider to be the most important domestic issue confronting the \nNation today; that is, fixing our broken borders and actually enforcing \nour immigration laws, in order to have a vote of no confidence on the \nAttorney General in what is clearly a political exercise rather than \nanything that would produce a meaningful result, we now turn our \nattention to an important issue and one I hope Congress will embrace in \norder to address energy concerns in this country.\n  Of course, we all know--all we have to do is to drive up to fill up \nour gas tank--the price of gasoline has gone through the roof. While it \nis true that Congress can pass laws and Congress can even repeal laws \nthat have been passed by previous Congresses, what Congress cannot do \nis repeal the laws of supply and demand.\n  It is important as we look at this legislation before us that we look \nat whether this legislation is, in fact, designed to fix problems. One \nof the questions I suggest we need to look to is, Does this bill \nincrease supply? In a global economy we know there is going to be more \nand more competition for oil and gasoline. We know we are competing, \nnot only in the United States, but literally with China and India, each \nof which have 1 billion people. Their economies are growing, and the \nnumber of people driving and their economic activity is directly \nrelated to access to a reasonably priced energy supply. We need to look \nto see what we are doing at home to try to increase supply.\n  We all know we are dangerously reliant on imported oil from dangerous \nparts of the world or from places such as Venezuela, governed by the \nlikes of Hugo Chavez. Current energy policy in this country does \nnothing but make our enemies richer. It does nothing but line the \npockets of people like Hugo Chavez or somebody like President \nAhmadinejad in Iran--countries pursuing weapons of mass destruction.\n  We have to eliminate the schizophrenia that has characterized our \nenergy policy in the past and look at what commonsense steps Congress \ncan take in order to improve the supply of oil and gas, preferably from \nour own domestic sources at home, so we are less reliant on these \ndangerous rulers in other parts of the world for the very lifeblood of \nour economy.\n  By any measure, the bill that is now before us is an incomplete bill. \nIt deals nearly exclusively with the demand side of the energy \nequation. While it is worthwhile to aggressively pursue better \nefficiencies and alternative sources of energy to meet our future \nenergy needs, the provisions in this bill fail to address much of our \ncurrent energy needs. It is a matter of simple economics. This bill \nwill do nothing to deal with our current energy needs without \naddressing supply.\n  I fear this bill will also end up being even more expensive for \nconsumers. Both the provisions in the bill and some of the expected \namendments from the majority set up unreasonable mandates for renewable \nand alternative energy sources, which are more expensive. I do not \nquestion our need to produce more of our energy from clean and \nrenewable sources, but I believe the winners and losers should be \ndetermined by the market, not by the Government. Indeed, this bill \ndetermines for Americans which fuels we will use, how much, and at what \ntime. That is the last thing we need the Federal Government to \ndictate--to determine which fuels we will use, how much, and at what \ntime--when public confidence in Congress under this new majority is at \na 10-year low. The last thing we need to do is say: Give us the power \nto determine what fuels you will use, how much, and at what time.\n  I do believe there is great promise in renewable energy. I am proud \nthat my State, Texas, continues its energy leadership. As a traditional \noil and gas State, it now is the largest producer of wind energy in the \ncountry--2,749 megawatts as of last year. We are also the largest \nproducer of biodiesel, an industry that has grown rapidly in just the \nlast few years.\n  It is also unwise to turn away from proven and developing \ntechnologies to meet our Nation's clean air goals. For example, nuclear \nenergy has the lowest impact on the environment, including land, air, \nwater, and wildlife, of any energy source because it does not emit \nharmful gasses. It isolates its waste from the environment and requires \nless area to produce the same amount of electricity as other sources.\n  I wouldn't necessarily hold out other countries as a model for \nAmerica when it comes to their energy policies, but I must say a \ncountry such as France that generates 80 percent of its electricity by \nnuclear power does represent a goal that I think the United States \nought to strive for, particularly when nuclear power is cheap. It is \nconducive of a good environment, and it requires a lot less for us to \nproduce in terms of cost and other collateral issues. I think this is \none area where we clearly ought to be encouraging greater use of \nnuclear power, particularly when it comes to our electricity supply.\n  I want to say a word about coal. Coal should also continue to play an \nimportant role in our energy future. There are clean coal technologies \nbeing developed that could enable us to continue utilizing this \nabundant domestic resource and--this is important--improve air quality. \nCoal is also expected to remain one of the lowest cost fuels available.\n  I do believe with Federal investment in programs such as FutureGen, \nwhich is a $1 billion investment in clean coal-burning technology, we \ncan use this 300-year supply of coal in our country in a way that is \ncompatible with a good environment and allows us to maintain the \ndiversity of our energy sources which are essential to the growth of \nour economy, as well as our national security, from the standpoint of \ndepending less and less on people who are trying to do us harm for the \nvery energy we need.\n  It is ironic at a time that we are engaged in the global war on \nterror that many of the state sponsors of terrorism, many of those \nareas that are in unstable regions of the world, from the standpoint of \nthe global war on terror, are the very ones being enriched by our\n\n[[Page S7499]]\n\ncurrent energy policies, which puts a lot of our domestic resources \nhere at home out of bounds and depends, as I say, too much on imported \noil and gas.\n  It is important to note there are some differences between the \napproaches of those of us in this Chamber on how we achieve that sort \nof energy self-sufficiency in this country, which I believe ought to be \nour goal.\n  It is important that we, as I said a moment ago, increase supply and \nthat we not inadvertently or otherwise create disincentives for those \ncurrently exploring and producing oil and gas. On this side of the \naisle, we support increasing America's energy supplies while reducing \nconsumption.\n  For example, the bill we passed in 2005, under Republican leadership, \nprovided incentives for domestic exploration of potential new natural \nresource supplies and aided the production of affordable domestic \nenergy. Now we are seeing the new majority threaten to overturn several \nof those successful provisions.\n  Then when it comes to trying to increase supply of gasoline in this \ncountry by enhancing capacity of refineries, we have seen those efforts \nblocked by our friends on the other side of the aisle in the last \nCongress. Now the majority leader will be offering a substitute \namendment, we are told, based on S. 1419 to H.R. 6.\n  This amendment by the Democratic majority leader contains some \npositive provisions. But, unfortunately, it is promise that is being \noversold. Very simply, the legislation produces no new energy and may \nactually end up raising prices, not lowering them. The Reid substitute, \nin my opinion, does not produce a viable energy policy for the United \nStates.\n  As a matter of fact, many of the proposals we will hear from the \nother side of the aisle may actually increase energy prices. For \nexample, we are likely to hear a proposal for a 15-percent renewable \nportfolio standard which ignores clean energy sources such as nuclear \npower.\n  This proposal would cost consumers billions of dollars because States \nsimply would not be able to meet it. The majority leader's substitute \namendment will also, it looks like, ignore the need for domestic energy \nsupplies and ignores the problem of refining capacity, which experts \nsay is a leading cause of high gas prices; again, simply a matter of \nsupply and demand.\n  With the static supply not catching up to demand, you are going to \nsee gas prices go up. That is what we have all experienced at the pump. \nThis bill makes no effort to increase domestic production and reduce \nour reliance on foreign oil.\n  This bill also does not pay enough attention to clean alternatives, \nattempting to mandate energy production solely from renewable sources. \nWhile alternative and renewable energy has made a great start in \nreducing our foreign imports needed for energy, it will be decades \nbefore we can produce enough alternative fuels to replace oil and other \ncarbon fuels.\n  It is important we support efforts to increase the use of renewable \nand alternative fuels, but we should not be sold on unrealistic \nproposals that will suggest that somehow, in the short term, we are \ngoing to be able to replace our dependence on oil and gas, particularly \nin the transportation sector, where there is not any other viable \nalternative. It is unrealistic to think we can address our current \ndependance without producing as much of America's energy as we can here \nat home.\n  Overlooking sources of new clean energy demonstrates, once again, we \nare not paying enough attention to our domestic energy supply. Of \ncourse, gas prices are up to record levels, particularly since the new \nmajority took over in November.\n  The Reid substitute does nothing to reduce them. We have seen \ngasoline prices increase almost 50 percent during the last 5 months. \nNow, when our friends on the other side of the aisle were put in \ncontrol in last November's election, the price of gasoline was about \n$2.20 a gallon. Today it averages $3.15 a gallon. The proposals in this \nbill do nothing to reduce high gasoline prices. In fact, some of the \namendments I am told that our friends on the other side of the aisle \nare considering would actually increase energy prices for the \nconsumers.\n  Neither the Federal Trade Commission nor any State agency that has \nexplored the issue has found any evidence that there has actually been \nprice gouging. I am told there will be proposals to prohibit price \ngouging, which is already illegal I might add, but by new and vague \nstandards which are impossible for anybody to determine whether their \nactions are covered, unless perhaps it is too late.\n  This is a diversion from the real energy problems. We all oppose \nprice gouging. I know of no one who supports price gouging. But it is \nimportant we understand we need to find new ways to increase our \ndomestic supply and particularly our refining capacities here at home. \nWe see nothing but roadblocks thrown up every time we introduce \nproposals to try to encourage expansion of refinery capacity, which is \nthe only way we are going to make more gasoline to keep up with the \ndemand and hopefully keep prices down.\n  Now we will see alternatives offered during the course of this debate \nthat will lead to increased domestic production of oil, streamlined \nrefinery processes, and greater investment in research and development \nand clean vehicles. I think this is an important debate.\n  But we need to be careful about what we are doing again to make sure \nwe do not oversell and underdeliver when it comes to energy policy, \nbecause, frankly, I think when it comes to the way the Congress has \napproached our energy needs, it has been more than a little \nschizophrenic. The consequence, I think we can all see, is that \ngasoline prices are too high because refinery capacity is too low. We \nhave actually increased the danger, in terms of our security, by \ncontinuing to rely too much on imported oil and gas from dangerous \nparts of the world, enriching our biggest enemies. At the same time, we \nhave put out of bounds too much of our domestic reserves.\n  So I hope as this debate goes forward, we will have a full \nopportunity to debate amendments and offer constructive solutions to \nthis problem. That is why I think our constituents sent us here. If we \ndo that, then hopefully this poll I mentioned at the outset, reported \nin today's Los Angeles Times that reflects 27 percent of Americans \napprove of the way Congress is doing its job, hopefully those numbers \nwill go up as we produce constructive solutions to the problems that \nconfront the American people and we do the job we are sent here to do \nby our constituents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time is available \nto me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 13 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I listened with interest to the Senator from Texas. I \nwish to discuss basically the same thing, perhaps putting a slightly \ndifferent twist on it. People look at the economics of energy and make \nthis point. They say it costs something like a dollar a barrel to lift \nthe oil in Saudi Arabia. That is the elevating price, a dollar, a \ndollar and a half, whatever. It doesn't sound like very much when oil \nis selling for something like $60 a barrel.\n  They look at the difference between the lifting cost and what we are \npaying, and then they look at the difference between the cost for a \nbarrel of oil and the cost of a gallon of gasoline and they say: \nSomebody is making an awful lot of money here, and there has to be \nsomething wrong. There has to be someone hiding in the weeds who is \nprofiteering off us. If we can find that ``someone'' and stop him from \ndoing the profiteering, then everything would be fine, we would have \nplenty of oil, we would have lower prices at the pump, everything would \nbe fine. There is a conspiracy going on. There is somebody somewhere \nwho needs to be discovered, exposed, and attacked, and then everything \nwill be fine.\n  Well, unfortunately, the real world does not operate like that. In \nthe real world, there are reasons, valid reasons, for prices to be \nwhere they are and for the situation to be as it is. The fundamental \nfact, with respect to retail prices, that people forget, if indeed they \neven know, is this: The retail price is not set on the basis of what it \ncosts to put a gallon of gas into the pump that you go to when you fill \nup your tank; the retail price is set by\n\n[[Page S7500]]\n\nwhat it would cost to replace the gallon of gas once it is gone out of \nthe tank and into your gas tank.\n  That means whoever is setting the price is concerned with \nuncertainties that are there in the marketplace that will determine the \nfuture replacement cost. If there is a geopolitical uncertainty, Iran, \nIraq, unrest in Saudi Arabia, instability in Venezuela, whatever it \nmight be, the marketplace will say: We have to have the uncertainty \nreturn, we have to have a premium on what it would cost to protect us \nagainst the uncertainty because it may well be that supply is suddenly \ndisrupted around the world, and if we are going to have an additional \ngallon of gas in that service station tank in the future, we are going \nto have to pay for that uncertainty there, so we will charge an \nuncertainty premium now.\n  This is the working of the marketplace. As I have said often, and \nexpect to say again, we cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. We \nthink we can. In Congress we keep passing laws that say we are going to \nset prices here and there. But whenever we try, all we do is produce \none of two results. When we try to repeal the law of supply and demand, \nwhen we try to interfere with market forces, we either create a \nshortage or a surplus.\n  When we set the price artificially too high in the market, we create \na surplus, as everybody wants to get in on the very good price, people \nwant to sell for the highest price. We did that in Congress with \nrespect to silver. We wanted to have silver mined in the United States. \nSo the United States said: We are going to pay so much for silver. It \nwas above the price the market would pay. We opened up silver mines, \nthe Government ended up with a huge surplus of silver piling up in \nwarehouses because we set the price higher than the market would put \nit.\n  When we set the price too low, as we have done with gasoline, with \noil windfall profits, set the price too low, then we get a shortage; \nnobody wants to produce for that low price. So we can tell ourselves \nhow wonderful we are. We can say we have the power to set prices by \nlegislation, but if we set them in the wrong places, if we go away from \nwhere the market is, the market either gives you a surplus of things we \ndon't need or we create a shortage.\n  We saw the impact of the shortage during the Carter administration. \nWe all remember the long lines, where we were lined up to get gasoline. \nThere was a shortage. It was artificially created. When Ronald Reagan \nbecame President, he said: No, we are going to let the market work. The \nshortages all went away. The lines went away. Interestingly enough, the \nprices actually came down in many areas of energy as the market then \nresponded to the reality of demand.\n  Our problem now is we do not have sufficient supply to bring the \nprices down. One of the reasons, as the Senator from Texas made clear, \none of the reasons is we do not have the refinery capacity we need. It \nis all very well and good to pump oil out of the ground, but the oil \nyou purchase out of the ground cannot be put into your car. The oil \npumped out of the ground has to be refined into gasoline. If it is not, \nit sits there accumulating until the refinery capacity can be brought \non line.\n\n  We know that very well in Utah. We have a tremendous amount of \nproduction going on in eastern Utah now. As oil is available, it can \ncome out of the ground. At the worldwide prices for oil now, even \nthough it might be more expensive than $1.50, with oil selling at $60 a \nbarrel, $70 a barrel on the international market, there is money to be \nmade. There is oil to be produced in eastern Utah, but it is sitting \nthere. It is not ending up in anybody's gas tank. It is not helping \nbring down the price at the pump. What is the matter? We don't have the \nrefinery capacity to refine that particular kind of oil. There are \nrefineries in Salt Lake City. They are operating at 90 percent capacity \nplus. They are refining oil that comes from Canada, because that \nparticular kind of oil is easier to refine than the oil coming out of \neastern Utah. If we could build a refinery in eastern Utah--and the \neconomics are there to justify it--we could bring down the price of \ngasoline at the pump, because all of that oil would be turned into \ngasoline.\n  So why aren't we building new refineries? The regulations that come \nfrom the Federal Government are restricting refineries. People who own \nrefineries are doing everything they can to expand them. The refinery \ncapacity is up fairly dramatically, but the number of new refineries \nhas not gone up dramatically. We are pushing to have the limit our \nability to refine oil in the refineries we now have.\n  We are still told the real reason prices are up is because there is a \nconspiracy. There is price gouging going on. Last week the Washington \nPost commented on this issue about conspiracy and the people who are \ndeliberately driving up the price of gasoline. If I may quote from the \nWashington Post editorial entitled ``Myths About That $3.18 Per \nGallon'':\n\n       Multiple investigations by the Federal Trade Commission \n     since 2000 have come up, well, dry. Conspiracy theorists say \n     this lack of evidence is proof that the regulators are in bed \n     with the oil companies. But last year, California's Energy \n     Commission undertook its own investigation of a May 2006 \n     price increase--and found no smoking gun indicating market \n     manipulation. Today's high prices are the result of a \n     collision among consumers' increasing demand for gas, the \n     shortage of oil-refining capacity and 50 states with \n     different regulations that make it hard to trade gas across \n     state lines.\n\n  That is the reality. It is a collision of increasing demand for gas, \nstatic oil refining capacity, and different State regulations. We \nshould be dealing with that reality. Why aren't we? Back to the \neditorial:\n\n       So why protect consumers from this vaporous phantom? \n     Politics. More than 80 percent of Americans believe that high \n     gas prices are the result of oil company shenanigans rather \n     than market forces, according to the Opinion Research Corp. \n     So passing legislation against gouging is a bit of theater \n     that allows the political class to avoid the hard work of \n     getting Americans to use less gas.\n\n  We engage in political theater all the time around here--that is our \nbusiness--but occasionally, I would hope we would recognize reality, we \nwould understand the price of gasoline is set by market forces that \nlook at what it will cost to replace that gasoline.\n  I will make a last point. There would be more certainty about what it \nwould cost to replace that gasoline if President Clinton had not vetoed \nlegislation opening ANWR, making that oil available to us for our \ndomestic supply. One of the things that was said at the time was, that \nis so far away in the future, that is 10 years away.\n  Well, it has been more than 10 years since he vetoed that bill. If he \nhad not, we would now have the supply coming down from Alaska, saying \nwe can mitigate the geopolitical uncertainties of oil in foreign \ncountries by having this supply of millions of barrels available in the \nUnited States. The manufacturers of gasoline, refiners of gasoline, \nwould say: We have a stable source of supply here within the United \nStates. We need not charge as high an uncertainty premium as we might \notherwise do.\n  There is no question it would have a significant impact on lowering \ngas prices, if only we had done it. The Congress did it. The President \nvetoed it. Now the leadership of Congress continues to oppose ANWR. One \nof the arguments is: That is more than 10 years away.\n  We did it more than 10 years ago. We need to do it now for the \nadvantage of people 10 years ahead.\n  This is not to denigrate the good things in the Energy bill before \nus. This is not to say conservation is not important. This is not to \nsay alternative sources of energy are not important. But this is to say \nwe need to look at the whole picture and recognize we cannot conserve \nour way into a solution. Just because conservation is a good idea \ndoesn't mean increasing the source of supply is a bad one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the energy \nlegislation that will be the topic of the Senate this week. It is \ncritically important. I congratulate the cochairs of the Energy \nCommittee, particularly Senators Bingaman and Domenici, for the work \nthey have done, along with other committees, including Commerce and the \nEnvironment Committee on which I am privileged to serve.\n  We are dealing with a critical national crisis. In some ways, if we \ncan adopt bipartisan, strong energy security legislation, we will have \ndealt with the most serious challenge facing our country. Because in \ndealing with our\n\n[[Page S7501]]\n\ndependence on foreign sources of oil and reducing that dependence, we \ncan make our economy more secure, protect American consumers from the \npainful price spikes in the cost of gasoline and home heating oil and \nother fuels they have become accustomed to, and that not only drain \nindividual budgets but hurt our national economic growth potential and \nreality.\n  Second, we will make our Nation more secure. Because no matter how \nstrong we are militarily or even economically, if we end up depending \nso much on foreign sources of oil, our independence can be compromised. \nWe cannot tolerate that.\n  Here is the reality. Ninety-seven percent of transportation in the \nUnited States is fueled by oil we buy from a unified global oil market. \nSaudi Arabia holds 20 percent of the world's oil reserves. Iran has 10 \npercent, led by a man who today repeatedly says to crowds in Iran, \nimagine a world without America; 10 percent of the world's oil reserves \nare in Iran. Venezuela, led by a virulently anti-American president, \nholds 6 percent of the world's oil reserves; Russia has 4.5 percent; \nLibya, 3 percent; the United States today has 1.5 percent of the \nworld's oil reserves. We cannot leave our national and economic \nsecurity dependent, therefore, on a resource that lies largely in the \nhands of others, including other nations that are either volatile or \nundemocratic or aligned against the United States.\n  H.R. 6, which combines the work of three or four different \ncommittees, contains many significant provisions that would reduce our \nNation's oil consumption. I truly commend the heads of these \ncommittees, the chairmen and ranking members, for bringing this \nlegislation forward. This may be the only opportunity we have in the \n110th Congress, certainly the only opportunity we will have in this \nfirst year of the 110th session, to confront our energy dependence and \ndeal with it. Therefore, it is very important that we work hard to make \nthis bill as strong as we possibly can and, of course, as bipartisan. \nOur constituents, our Nation just watched the Senate unfortunately \ngrind itself into gridlock over the comprehensive immigration bill. \nLet's not turn that show into a double feature with stalemate over \nenergy security legislation as well, certainly not as prices soar and \nAmerican consumers sour.\n  I want to speak briefly in favor of a bipartisan consensus amendment \nI and others will introduce as part of this debate. I am speaking on \nbehalf of a bipartisan and geographically diverse group of Senators led \nby Senators Bayh, Brownback, Salazar, Coleman, and many others. We will \noffer an amendment to replace the gasoline savings goal of H.R. 6, the \nunderlying legislation, with title I of our so-called DRIVE Act. DRIVE, \nin the strange world of acronyms, stands for Dependence Reduction \nThrough Innovation in Vehicles and Energy. This is the successor to an \nearlier version--which title didn't make a good acronym, but which \ntitle I loved--which was the Set America Free Act, because right now we \nare not free. We are dependent on others for our energy. The DRIVE \nAct's title I, which we will introduce as an amendment, would direct \nthe executive branch of Government to identify within 9 months and to \npublish within 18 months Federal requirements that will achieve a 2.5 \nmillion barrel-per-day reduction in U.S. oil consumption by 2016, a 7 \nmillion barrel-per-day reduction by 2026, and a 10 million barrel-per-\nday reduction by 2031. That is about 50 percent of the per-day oil \nconsumption of the United States today.\n  This amendment would also direct the Office of Management and Budget \nto publish an analysis identifying the oil savings projected to be \nachieved by each requirement to be created and demonstrating that the \nlisted measures will, in the aggregate, achieve the overall specified \noil savings.\n  Finally, the measure includes specific requirements for the executive \nbranch to evaluate, review, and update the action plan so we can \nachieve these critical national goals.\n  The targets for savings in H.R. 6 are expressed in terms of American \ngasoline consumption. The amendment would express them in terms of what \nwe think is a more relevant standard which is overall oil consumption, \nbecause reducing gasoline use can be achieved by increasing the use of \ndiesel which, of course, is also made from oil. So oil consumption \nreduction is, in our opinion, the more appropriate goal for this law, \nand that is why we are going to introduce this as an amendment to H.R. \n6. The gasoline savings goal in H.R. 6 amounts to about a 20-percent \nreduction in projected oil consumption by 2030, 23 years from now. The \noil savings requirement in our amendment amounts to a 35-percent \nreduction in projected oil consumption in 2030. That is a significant \nincrease in reduction and one we can achieve, if we set the goal as \nhigh as it should be, high enough to cut our dependence on foreign oil \nand free America from that dependence.\n  I believe there is broad bipartisan support in the Senate for these \nstronger targets. Indeed, the fuel economy and renewable fuels \nprovisions already found elsewhere in H.R. 6 will themselves go a long \nway toward achieving the stronger targets. The DRIVE amendment's \ncosponsors believe that we need targets that will keep the pressure on \nthe Executive branch to use the authorities Congress has provided to \nachieve robust oil savings.\n  The DRIVE Act has 26 cosponsors, including 6 Republicans. Thus, the \nlanguage of our DRIVE amendment is bipartisan and consensus-based. I \nhope my colleagues will adopt it overwhelmingly.\n  I would like to explain my opposition to an amendment that I \nunderstand will be offered, an amendment that--while intricately \ndrafted--has the sole purpose of opening the Arctic Wildlife Refuge to \noil drilling.\n  Most of my colleagues have been through enough Senate debates over \nthis issue to know that it is highly controversial and deeply divisive. \nI believe that if an Arctic drilling amendment were added to this bill, \nit would prevent Senate passage of otherwise bipartisan legislation \nthat could reshape--but not despoil--our energy landscape.\n  I myself filibustered the last bill to which an Arctic drilling \nprovision was attached.\n  Let me just repeat a fact that I stated at the beginning of my \nremarks: The United States holds just 1.5 percent of the world's oil \nreserves. Oil is a global commodity--like wheat or corn, gold or \ncopper--that essentially has a single world benchmark price.\n  That means we could drain every last drop of oil from U.S. territory, \ndespoiling our last stretches of wilderness in the process, and U.S. \nproduction still would amount to no more than a trickle in the stream \nof global supply.\n  We would do irrevocable damage to our natural heritage without having \nan appreciable effect on the price that Americans pay for oil, and \nwithout reducing our crippling oil addiction by one iota.\n  It is time we face up to the fact that we cannot drill our way out of \nthis problem. The only effective and permanent solution to high gas \nprices--the only effective and permanent solution to energy \ndependence--is to dramatically reduce our oil consumption. H.R. 6 takes \nan impressive step in that direction. The DRIVE amendment would \nlengthen that step to a stride. But adding an Arctic drilling provision \nwould kill the entire enterprise, leaving us in the same, unacceptable \nsituation we find ourselves in now. So I respectfully ask that my \ncolleagues vote ``yes'' on the DRIVE amendment, and ``no'' on any \nmeasure that would open the treasured Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nto drilling.\n  The American people are energized on this issue. Let's not let them \nlook to the Senate and think they have hit a dry well of gridlock.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence of one of my colleagues on the \nfloor who I know wants to speak during this half hour of morning \nbusiness, so I will say, very briefly, we have an opportunity to do \nsomething right for the American people, if we can work across party \nlines--and none of this should be partisan--to get this done.\n  Again I note in that regard, with some regret, some of my colleagues \nhave indicated an intention to once again introduce an amendment that \nwould open the Arctic Wildlife Refuge to oil and drilling. Obviously, \nthey have a right to do so. This has been debated often in the Senate. \nMy only word of caution is I fear such an amendment, if it is attached \nto this\n\n[[Page S7502]]\n\nbill, may doom the overall bill; therefore, we would all lose as a \nresult of it.\n  I say to my colleagues, we have a fresh opportunity here, a kind of \nfresh start. This institution is in need of a bipartisan agreement that \nsolves some real problems, such as the cost of gasoline and home \nheating oil and other fuels the American people are facing. So it is \nnot just that the institution would benefit in its credibility with a \nbipartisan agreement on this critical issue; the country needs us to \nshow leadership on this issue. I am confident, as we begin this debate, \nwe can rise to the opportunity.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later this week, Somalia's fragile \nTransitional Federal Government, also known as the TFG, is expected to \nconvene a National Reconciliation Conference originally intended to \nnegotiate genuine power-sharing arrangements, establish a credible \npolitical process, and prevent Somalia from descending back into chaos \nand lawlessness.\n  Unfortunately, this conference has been postponed again--for the \nthird time. Equally disappointing is the failure of the TFG to take the \ncritical steps needed to broaden its base and ensure genuine \nnegotiations occur when, or if, the conference actually takes place.\n  I have been watching Somalia closely for quite some time and I am \ndeeply concerned that the small window of opportunity we saw earlier \nthis year is closing quickly--if it has not already closed. To date, \nthe power struggle between the Ethiopian-backed TFG and various clan-\nbased and extremist militias in Mogadishu runs parallel to a brutal \ncrackdown by Ethiopian and Somali troops that led to enormous civilian \ndeaths and displacement. The increasing prevalence of suicide bombings \nand other guerilla tactics is a serious setback for Somalis, and for \nour own national security interests on the Horn.\n  The United States should be encouraging and supporting efforts to \nfacilitate a government in Somalia that is widely perceived--internally \nand externally--as legitimate. Unfortunately, this effort is \ncomplicated by the Aministration's flawed and self-defeating approach \nto counterterrorism. By bringing long-term stability to Somalia, we can \nhelp root out global terrorists who thrive on instability and weak or \nfailed governments. Pursuing individual terrorists is not a substitute \nfor addressing the conditions that allow safe havens to persist.\n  There is no quick and easy answer to Somalia's problems. But there \nare a few things we can, and must, do better if Somalia is not to \ndescend further into a bastion of instability with potentially dire \nconsequences for our national security and that country's future. We \nmust redouble our efforts and work with international and regional \ncommunities--and in particular with the Ethiopians--to ensure this \nNational Reconciliation Conference not only occurs, but that it brings \ntogether a broad range of actors to create a framework for a government \nthat is capable and committed to overcoming divisive clan dynamics, \nprotecting human rights, and isolating and eliminating elements of \nextremism.\n  The United States has been forthcoming with financial resources for \nthis conference, as newly appointed Special Envoy to Somalia Ambassador \nJohn Yates recently reported. Indeed, we are supplying half of the \nconference's budget through the United Nations Development Program. \nThese resources are significant, and while I encourage other donors to \nstep up to the plate before it is too late, financial assistance is not \nthe only deficit Somalia's political project faces.\n  Equally worrisome is the lack of consistent messages from the \ninternational community as to what this conference is expected to \nachieve. I am concerned that the focus on getting the conference up and \nrunning--while critical--has nonetheless sidelined the need for it to \nproduce the blueprint--the blueprint--for rebuilding Somalia.\n  Along with appointing a new diplomat and providing substantial funds, \nthis administration, as well as the broader international community, \nneeds to set clear expectations for the TFG to make sure recent history \nin that country is not repeated.\n  It is important to note that these are only the latest efforts to \ncobble together a viable political path for Somalia. Over the past \ndecade, there have been approximately 14 other similar initiatives, all \nof which have failed. If the fragile political space created by the TFG \ncloses, we are going to be stuck back at square one with the same \ndisastrous results we have been dealing with for more than 10 years.\n  The upcoming reconciliation conference is only one benchmark of steps \nforward for the TFG. It is critical that all Somali stakeholders are \nincluded and that they own the process, that international \norganizations are invited to observe and offer advice, and that an \noutcome document laying out a roadmap for a sustained and pervasive \nprocess is produced.\n  Even if this public event meets all these goals--which remains far \nfrom clear--to be truly successful, it must also set the stage for what \nwill be needed down the road, including the restoration of \ninfrastructure and institutions required in a functioning state, the \nprovision of services and security to citizens, and the weaving of \nSomalia's complex social fabric into a viable civil society.\n  The road to peace and security in Somalia is long and riddled with \nobstacles, but we must not stray from the goal. This most recent \npostponement illustrates the consequences of insufficient influence and \ninadequate policy coordination by the U.S. and the international \ncommunity.\n  Accordingly, we must strive to produce a cohesive policy and \neffective action by clarifying our objectives, coordinating closely \nwith our allies, and creating benchmarks with consequences. The United \nStates and others--especially Ethiopia--must use whatever leverage they \nstill possess to demand and work toward demonstrable progress towards a \nsustainable political solution for Somalia.\n  Mr. President, I certainly thank the Senator from Washington for her \ncourtesy in letting me go first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor, like many of my \ncolleagues today, to talk about the direction--I should say new \ndirection--we need in our energy policy. I know the President of the \nUnited States is coming up to meet with my Republican colleagues for \nlunch today and to talk about both immigration and energy policy. I \nhope the President will emphasize how important it is we get an energy \nbill but certainly that we get an energy bill that sets a new direction \nin America.\n  Obviously, the history and strength of our Nation lies in our ability \nto continually invent new ways of doing things. We are great as a \nnation in doing that. Whether it is building the most reliable \nelectricity grid in the world, laying down a massive Interstate System, \nor helping to create the Internet, our people have marched forward in \nnew, breathtaking directions. These achievements have historically \nprovided our Nation with immense prosperity and a quality of life we \nall cherish.\n  The problem is our basic energy and transportation system is 50 to \n100 years old. Today, we are faced with two choices: whether we are \ngoing to continue to operate the energy system that is a relic of the \npast century or we are going to create a new roadmap for the future \nthat will allow Americans to again be global energy leaders. It is that \nsimple.\n  Some will say our energy and transportation system is working fine \nand we should leave it the way it is. We have a lot of special \ninterests swirling around Washington, DC, right now hoping we do not \nmake much progress. But I would say we do not have to look any further \nthan the pocketbook of Americans to know we are feeling severe impacts \non our economy and our environment, and that doing nothing is not an \noption.\n  We are selling out too much in saying we cannot make aggressive \nchange. We are shelling out too much to fill up\n\n[[Page S7503]]\n\nour gas tanks, and our local communities are losing too many jobs. All \nthe while, we sacrifice more and more what is an engine to the U.S. \neconomy; that is, affordable energy supply.\n  We cannot continue to drive forward only looking in the rearview \nmirror and saying we are going to be dependent on foreign oil. We need \nto do better.\n  Over 100 years ago, many of our homes were lit with kerosene. If you \nthink about the early days, we traveled not by automobile but by foot \nor on horseback. Then a new industrial revolution took place, and it \nwas, as the Presiding Officer knows, driven by newly invented coal-\npowered steam engines. It played an incredible part in our country's \nhistory.\n  Then a number of scrappy entrepreneurs came along, people such as \nColonel Drake in Pennsylvania, who drilled the first oil well. \nAmericans went on to capitalize on that new fuel to power our industry \nand provide great mobility for our people in this Nation.\n  Other entrepreneurs, such as Thomas Edison and his colleagues, were \nworking on ways to harness electricity for light, sound, telephones, \nand transportation.\n  Shortly after that, Charles Baker and his daughter switched on the \nfirst electric power generation in the Northwest--something that still \nprovides cheap, affordable electricity to us in the Northwest.\n  Well, today it is time for a set of new, scrappy entrepreneurs, those \nwho are going to lead in industry and help us get ready for a new \nenergy infrastructure, and to take our country in a new direction. \nImprovements and changes are desperately needed to retain our standard \nof living and to make the United States an energy leader again.\n  Just like 100 years ago, these entrepreneurs are working today \nthroughout our Nation. Farmers, such as those in Minnesota, are now \nsupplementing their income from farm products by putting wind \ngeneration on their farms. A California professor is inventing new \ntechnology to enable the manufacture, in any industrial park, of new \nalternative fuel from simple plant material. In Spokane, WA, energy \ninvestors are focused on building a smart electricity grid that is \ngoing to allow consumers to save more.\n  What the Government did at the dawn of the last century was to help \nin the energy transformation. What we need to do today is to enable \nthis energy transformation to take our country in a new direction. We \nneed to embrace the new technologies that keep more energy dollars in \nAmerica's pocketbook. The next chapter in American's energy story needs \nto be less about record oil profits and more about how we are going to \nhelp the American consumer keep energy dollars here in America and grow \nthe American economy.\n  It is time Congress and the Federal Government start leading. The \nlonger we put up with the status quo, the farther and farther behind \nour people and businesses are going to fall, and the more \nunconscionable the profits oil companies and foreign interests make, \nthe more challenging it is for the United States environmentally, \ninternationally, and economically. America's goal--here on the floor of \nthe Senate, our role as a Government entity--should be to set the goals \nwhere our Nation needs to go and how our constituents will benefit.\n  We should not pick technology winners or losers, but we should make \nsure there is a level playing field so there is new investment in \nenergy strategies. We are here to put those elements in place that will \nhelp catapult America into being an energy leader.\n  I know many of my colleagues have talked about energy independence. \nBut we are talking about keeping energy dollars in America's \npocketbook. I say that because so many Americans are feeling the price \nat the pump. Right now, they are feeling that price at the pump because \nAmerica spends $291 billion per year on importing foreign oil. Over 60 \npercent of our total consumption is coming from foreign sources, and \nthat is only going to increase.\n  The production of 36 billion gallons of biofuels by 2022 would help \nus reduce foreign imports by over 1 million barrels a day. That is why \nthis underlying legislation is so important.\n\n  But what should our goal be? Our goal should be a 20-percent \nreduction in gasoline consumption by 2017. That is what this underlying \nbill gets at, and that would help consumers achieve a $2.50-per-barrel \nreduction in world oil prices because the United States would get into \nthe homegrown fuel business. But we have to do more than just \nalternative fuel; we have to become more fuel efficient. That is why \nthis legislation is so important, because it would actually help us \nsave $25 billion annually to consumers from raising the fuel efficiency \nstandard of automobiles from the current 25 miles per gallon today to \n35 miles per gallon.\n  I know this will be one of the most contentious votes on the Senate \nfloor: whether we have the will to raise fuel efficiency standards for \nour entire automobile fleet in the United States. But it is the fuel \nefficiency that will help deliver America that $25 billion in annual \nsavings to consumers and help us achieve that 20 percent savings in \nforeign oil consumption.\n  We need to keep putting more energy dollars into America's pocketbook \nby other means of efficiencies. The efficiencies in this legislation \npush for standards for appliances, to help make a smart electricity \ngrid that will help us in delivering distributed generation; that is, \ngeneration closer to home, so we are not building a new powerplant and \ntransporting that energy supply across several States or across \nsections of America but, instead, getting generation built and \ndelivered in the closest areas to the consumers. Smart electricity \ngrids and efficient technology will help us save $12 billion in \nimproved efficiency for the U.S. household, which will save U.S. \nconsumers about $100.\n  These are important improvements. They may not sound like the sexiest \nparts of our energy package, but there are real dollars and real \nsavings here for America in the long run. If we just take what \nCalifornia did as a State over the last several years--they, by \nmandating building codes and energy efficiency, reduced their energy \nconsumption by about 20 percent and have one of the best energy \nefficiency systems in the Nation, and we in the Federal Government \nshould follow.\n  We should follow as a Federal Government by also achieving energy \nefficiency for the taxpayers because the U.S. Government is our largest \nenergy user. The fact is, we have over 500,000 buildings in the United \nStates. Making them more energy efficient would give us a 30-percent \nreduction in the Federal energy use. The President should lead that \ncharge. But we are making sure in this underlying bill that we are \nmandating new energy efficiency titles led by my colleagues, Senator \nBoxer and Senator Bingaman, to make sure the taxpayers will get almost \n$4 billion in annual savings if we achieve these Federal energy \nefficiencies.\n  Also, we must protect the consumers from price spikes. We all know \nthat consumers have paid an increased price at the pump and that gas \nprices are at an alltime high related to where they were just 5 years \nago. This underlying bill makes price gouging--the manipulation of \nenergy prices--a Federal crime. To try to manipulate supply and \nartificially impact markets is something that should have strong \ncriminal penalties, and that is what this underlying legislation does.\n  We also make sure we are making the right technology investments. I \nsaid earlier that technology could help the United States achieve \ngreater efficiency and keep more energy dollars in America's \npocketbook. We believe that over $700 billion in increased economic \nactivity can be the result of investment in good energy technology. It \ncould also create more than 5 million jobs here in the United States by \n2025. But that means taking the investments that are given to the oil \nindustry now, which is making record profits, and instead investing \nthem in new energy technology that will lead to job creation and energy \nsavings. I know that in the Finance Committee we will be discussing \nthese ideas in the very near future, and I hope they can be implemented \nwith the underlying bill we are going to be considering in the next 2 \nweeks.\n  But we have to keep in mind, as we look at the alternatives for \ncreating energy, that we have to be smart about protecting our \nenvironment. We want to keep more energy dollars in the\n\n[[Page S7504]]\n\npockets of the American consumers and American businesses, but we will \nnot achieve that if we look for solutions that are actually going to \nadd to our CO2 problems in the United States.\n  Let's be clear: There are great technologies that will help us in \nreducing greenhouse emissions. There are others that will be less \nappealing. I know it will be hard for my colleagues in areas where \ntechnology has not yet reached this point to be a market driver. More \nwork needs to be done. But we should not be, in looking at our \nincentive policies, chasing technology that will not help us achieve \nthe leadership the United States would like to see in fuel technology.\n  We know that cellulosic ethanol, which is the goal of this underlying \nbill--and I was proud, in the 2005 act, to write the cellulosic mandate \nas part of the underlying legislation. Cellulosic--plant-based \nethanol--plant-based ethanol from gasoline today would be a 90-percent \nreduction in our CO2 footprint. We want to go in that \ndirection as a nation, using plants to create a fuel source for \nAmerica. We want to do that not only for what it achieves for us in \nreduction of CO2 but because it also doesn't compete with \nour food source in America and drive up food prices.\n  Biodiesel, another great reduction in greenhouse impact at 67 \npercent, is an area in which we can, for our large industrial users, \nprovide an alternative fuel to help our economy grow. Sugar-based \nethanol, at 56 percent, as the country of Brazil is doing, is again a \nreduction in the CO2 and an opportunity to scale a \ntechnology to help an entire nation.\n  We also know that for us, electricity, or plug-in hybrids, could see \na 46-percent reduction.\n  We know we will have a very interesting debate on the Senate floor \nabout corn-based ethanol, and we will have to be honest about where \ncorn-based ethanol can take us in the future. It is not the alternative \nfuel that will help drive our economy.\n  We know corn-based ethanol will not be the technology that continues \nto have the opportunities for us that these other advanced fuels do. So \nwe need to be smart about the investment strategy.\n\n  I need to say a little about the coal to liquid or carbon \nsequestration issues. That technology does not yet exist for the \nbreakthrough we would like to see. It will actually add--add--to our \nCO2 emissions if people deploy this technology today as a \nsolution for us in trying to get off foreign oil.\n  So we need to be smart about our plans. We need to make sure we are \nkeeping more energy dollars in America's pocketbook. We need to make \nsure we get on to this next chapter in American history and make sure \nwe are not continuing 3 years from now to talk about record oil prices \nbut about how American consumers are paying less at the pump, getting \nmore alternatives, and that new jobs are created by the new direction \nin an energy economy we are about to see unfold.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7504-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 6, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6) to reduce our Nation's dependency on \n     foreign oil by investing in clean, renewable, and alternative \n     energy resources, promoting new emerging energy technologies, \n     developing greater efficiency, and creating a Strategic \n     Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve to invest in \n     alternative energy, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for a \nperiod of up to 20 minutes on the legislation and that following my \nremarks, Senator Alexander speak for a period of up to 30 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the progress this \nbody is making toward reducing our dependence on foreign oil. In 5 \nshort months, we have assembled and advanced a package of energy \nproposals that will strengthen the foundation of a new, clean energy \neconomy for our Nation.\n  Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici have led us to where we are \ntoday, as have the chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, and the Commerce \nCommittee. The bill before us today, H.R. 6, is a product of many minds \nand many good ideas.\n  The extraordinary progress the Senate has made in the last 5 months \nresponds to a seismic shift in how Americans are thinking about energy \nand about our world. At no time in our history--at no time in our \nhistory--has energy been so clearly a matter of national security, of \neconomic security, and of environmental security. The issue before us \nis fundamentally about the security of the United States of America.\n  Think back to 2000. At that time, it seemed that the threat of \nIslamic radicalism was confined to foreign soil. Few understood the \nurgency of combating climate change at that time. Gas prices at that \ntime were $1.20 per gallon. That price cloaked the real costs and the \nreal danger of our dependence and our addiction to foreign oil.\n  Today, this is all different, and fortunately, today, the people of \nAmerica and this Senate are recognizing it is all different. In every \ncorner of American society, the conventional wisdom about our energy \npolicy has changed. The fact is, our dependence on foreign oil affects \nthe lives of Americans each and every day. It touches our security, our \npocketbooks, and our conscience.\n  Most strikingly, oil has become a major factor in global security. \nOur dependence--our dependence--our overdependence makes us vulnerable \nand weakens our standing in the world. Since 2001, China and Russia \nhave partnered to lock up oil in central Asia, rolling us out of that \nregion. Venezuela has wielded its resources to buy off its neighbors \nand to divide our hemisphere. Iran has used its oil resources to court \nRussia and China, convincing them to oppose our diplomatic efforts to \nstop Iran from building nuclear weapons.\n  Countries that wish us harm know about our addiction. They know any \ndisruption in supply sends gas prices through the roof and slows our \neconomy. They are happy--they are happy--our enemies are happy to \nprofit from our addiction. Oil money lines the pockets of terrorists, \nextremists, and unfriendly governments. It funds the Hezbollah rockets \nand militias in Lebanon today. It reaches bin Laden, it reaches al-\nQaida, and it finances the militants in Nigeria who kidnap and \nterrorize westerners.\n  The sad truth is that today we are funding both sides of the war on \nterror. We spent over $100 billion last year to fight the extremists in \nIraq and Afghanistan, extremists who are funded indirectly through the \noil revenues we finance out of this country and around the world. This \nsituation is absolutely crazy.\n  To make matters worse, our oil dependence is causing economic pain \nfor Americans. With gasoline over $3 a gallon and holding, $50 and $80 \nvisits to the gas stations for family members to fill their cars are \nstraining family budgets and frustrating small business owners. Across \nmy State, the farmers and ranchers whom I fight for every day here are \nbudgeting for the harvest, and they are having to budget for numbers \nthat are astronomical that they never saw before. The question they ask \nthemselves as they go to bed every night is whether they are going to \nbe able to make enough money to pay off their operating line at the end \nof the harvest season.\n  Americans want affordable alternatives at the filling station.\n  So far they have few. We must move forward in providing those \nalternatives.\n  The third reason we are on the floor today with this legislation is \nour bill will help jumpstart a new energy economy. That new energy \neconomy is\n\n[[Page S7505]]\n\nbased on the environmental security threats we see from global warming. \nClimate change now stands as one of the greatest moral challenges of \nour time. It is an issue we are obligated to confront.\n  The desperation and disaster brought by Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane \nRita, and a series of prolonged droughts, floods, and fire storms over \nthe past several years have driven climate change to the center of \nAmerican consciousness. We cannot afford to leave our children a legacy \nof an environmental disaster. We need to begin to work on that problem \nnow, and this legislation begins to do that with respect to carbon \nsequestration.\n  This is not the beginning of our efforts here. In 2005, this Chamber, \nwith most of the Members who are still here today, worked in a \nbipartisan fashion to pass the 2005 Energy Policy Act. The bill before \nus today is a significant step forward toward tackling the national \nsecurity, economic security, and environmental security implications of \nour oil addiction. The 2005 Energy Policy Act was a first step in \nmoving us in that direction.\n  We approached the 2005 Energy Policy Act much as we have this \nproposal today. It was a work Senators Domenici and Bingaman did--\nSenator Domenici was chairman and Senator Bingaman as ranking member, \nand now their roles are reversed. They said we have an energy problem \nand we can craft a better energy policy, and that received nearly 80 \nvotes in the Senate. It is that same bipartisan approach that they have \ntaken to this legislation. Other committees also contributed to the \nlegislation before us today and have also taken that kind of approach. \nThat is why, at the end of the day, we will succeed in moving forward \nwith energy legislation in the Senate.\n  The bill in the 109th Congress, the 2005 Energy Policy Act, was \nperhaps the most important energy legislation passed in 20 or 30 years \nin this country. During that time, I traveled to all 64 counties in \nColorado and spoke to the people of my State about that bill. By and \nlarge, they appreciated the balanced approach we took to the 2005 act. \nThe bill kick started a renewable energy economy, made big investments \nin technologies, took a cut at consumption with smart efficiency \nmeasures, and it made sensible additions to our domestic oil and gas \nsupply.\n  There remains much to be done, and that is why we are here today. We \nshould not forget our bipartisan work of 2 years ago, which planted the \nseeds for our new energy economy; and today, in the week ahead, and in \nthe following week, we will have an opportunity to build on the success \nof 2 years ago.\n  The new energy economy is in fact taking root. I don't think you will \nfind a better example of how quickly Americans can change their \napproach to energy than in my State of Colorado. We have sparked a \nrenewable energy revolution in Colorado in just 2 years, and the \nbenefits have already touched every corner of my State. Our farmers and \nranchers are leading the charge. In Weld County, Logan County, and Yuma \nCounty, which are remote and far away from Denver, we are seeing \nbiofuel plants spring to life, creating new markets and new \nopportunities for our rural communities. So the ``forgotten America,'' \nin fact, is having new opportunities created for them because of the \nfact that we are embracing the clean energy revolution. Today, we have \nthree ethanol plants that are already in production, where there were \nnone 2 years ago. We have several others that are under construction \nand are being planned.\n  But it is not just biofuels. In the San Luis Valley, where my family \nhas lived, ranched, and farmed for five generations, Xcel Energy just \nbroke ground on the largest solar plant in North America. More and more \nwind turbines are turning on the plains of southeastern Colorado, \npowering front range homes, while providing incomes for the ranchers \nwho own the land. Indeed, the current program with respect to the \nconstruction of wind energy farms in Colorado will mean that very soon \nwe will be producing the same amount of electricity that is produced \nfrom three coal-fired powerplants in Colorado. That is enormous \nprogress in a very short time.\n  How did we spark that renewable energy revolution in Colorado? The \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005 helped, but it is not the only force of \nchange. The National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden is the crown jewel \nof our labs, and it is a hub for innovation for our clean energy \nfuture. The President of the United States has visited NREL. Many \ncolleagues in this Chamber have visited NREL. We do all we can here to \nsupport the work that the researchers are doing there today. We have \ncreated the Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory, which binds the \nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden with the Colorado School \nof Mines, Colorado State University, and the University of Colorado. \nThe collaboratory is an engine for ideas, technologies, and talent, and \nmaking sure those technologies are being deployed out into the private \nsector.\n  I have held a renewable energy summit in Colorado in each of the last \n2 years. We have tried to connect the business community and those \npeople with the ideas to make sure that deployment occurs. These \nsummits have been a huge success and were attended by the business \ncommunity, environmental interests, farmers, and ranchers. This last \nyear, we had over a thousand people who attended that summit, which was \nsponsored by the Governor of Colorado, Governor Ritter, as well as \nmayors and other leaders throughout the State.\n  In Colorado last year, 2007, we actually moved forward in enhancing \nour renewable energy standard, our renewable portfolio standard for our \nState. The renewable energy revolution underway in Colorado makes me \nall the more excited about the bill we are considering today. Its \nprovisions are sensible and, by and large, they are bipartisan and \nshould be noncontroversial.\n\n  The bill includes 3 key components. First, it dramatically increases \nproduction and the use of biofuels. The bill will quintuple the \nexisting renewable fuels standard to 36 billion gallons by 2022, 21 \nbillion of which must be advanced biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol. \nThat is more than enough to offset imports from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and \nLibya combined. I will say that again. The 21 billion gallons of \nadvanced biofuels, combined with what we produce from corn ethanol, \nwill get us to 36 billion gallons. That amount of production from \nalternative biofuels is enough to offset our imports from Saudi Arabia, \nIraq, and Libya combined. I make that point to underscore the \nimportance of the biofuels and alternative fuels title in this \nlegislation.\n  Second, H.R. 6 also helps us reduce our dependence by making better \nuse of what we have. The transportation sector accounts for a full two-\nthirds of our oil consumption. It offers the cheapest and best \nopportunities for saving fuel. The bill helps automakers retool their \nvehicles by providing items such as loan guarantees for hybrids and \nadvanced diesels. The bill will also make a reasonable increase in CAFE \nstandards. The bill increases and incentivizes the engineering \ncapabilities of our automakers.\n  Finally, the bill before us also begins to address the environmental \nconsequences of our energy policy. The debate about how to tackle the \nthreat of global warming will have few easy answers. It will be a \ndifficult challenge for us when we get to specifically addressing the \nissue of global warming later in this Congress. But one thing we can do \ntoday is to determine how we can store the carbon we are currently \nputting into the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration technology is neither \nnew nor complicated. It has been around in the oil fields in America \nfor 50 years. We need to take that technology and refine our techniques \nfor storing it and determine where we can store the carbon that is \ncurrently being emitted from powerplants and other sources around our \ncountry. This bill will help start us in that direction.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Six minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I want to say I am very proud of this \nbill. I know a lot of work has gone into this bill. It is an impressive \nand thoughtful next step toward reducing our dependence upon foreign \noil. In the coming days, I hope we can find ways to strengthen this \nlegislation in some specific ways.\n  I want to speak very briefly about four amendments that several of my\n\n[[Page S7506]]\n\ncolleagues and I will be offering in the several days ahead.\n  The first amendment I intend to offer is the 25x'25 resolution, which \nestablishes a national goal of producing 25 percent of America's energy \nfrom renewable sources, like solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass, by \n2025. That resolution is a vision for where we want to get as \nAmericans. It is sponsored by a great group of bipartisan Senators, \nincluding Senators Grassley, Hagel, Harkin, Lugar, Obama, and the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Tester. That legislation was introduced \nearlier this year as S. Con. Res. 3, and it has received widespread \nbacking. It is endorsed by 22 current and former Governors and many \ngeneral assemblies from across the country. Nearly 400 organizations, \nfrom the Farm Bureau and the Union of Concerned Scientists, to John \nDeere, to the Natural Resources Defense Council, have embraced 25x'25 \nand the vision incorporated in that amendment. I hope we can include \nthat in this legislation.\n  The second amendment, which I will mention briefly, incorporates \nprovisions from S. 339, the DRIVE Act. That is legislation which \nSenators Bayh, Lieberman, Brownback, Sessions, and 23 other Senators \nhave been working on for a long time. It has a robust mandatory oil \nsavings plan. The DRIVE Act aims to increase our Nation's energy \nsecurity by cutting 2.5 million barrels per day from our Nation's oil \nuse by 2016, and 10 million barrels per day from its oil use by 2031. I \nam hopeful these provisions will also be added to the bill.\n  Third, Senator Bingaman and I and others will be introducing an \namendment to create a national renewable energy standard. Many States, \nsuch as Colorado, already have a renewable energy standard and are \nreaping the benefits. I know there will be debate and discussion about \nhow exactly we move forward with the renewable energy standard. But I \nbelieve the time has come for our Nation to adopt a renewable energy \nstandard in the same way many States have done, including my State of \nColorado.\n  For example, a renewable energy standard of 20 percent by 2020 will \nreduce emissions of carbon dioxide by an estimated 400 million tons per \nyear. That is equal to taking 71 million cars off of America's roads, \nor planting 104 million acres of trees. While we look at this renewable \nenergy standard, I know we will have a debate about whether we can \nimprove upon what we have done here. I look forward to that debate.\n  Finally, the Presiding Officer, Senator Tester, from Montana, and I \nwill be introducing an amendment to make better use of America's vast \ncoal resources. Coal is to the United States what oil is to Saudi \nArabia. The vast resource of coal from the great States of Montana, \nColorado, Wyoming, West Virginia, and throughout our country, is \nsomething we need to use. But as we use our coal resources, we need to \nmake sure we are using them in a smart way so it doesn't damage our \nenvironment.\n  The amendment we will introduce will provide loan guarantees to build \ncoal gasification facilities. We also will have standards in there with \nrespect to life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from those facilities to \nmake sure they are 20 percent lower than emissions from petroleum \nfuels. I appreciate the great work of my colleagues who have worked on \nthat amendment.\n  How we improve our energy security and reduce our dependence upon \nforeign oil is the central national security, economic security, and \nenvironmental security challenge of the 21st century. It will determine \nwhether we will continue to be entrenched in conflicts over resources \nin every corner of the world. It will determine whether we will triumph \nin our fight against oil-funded extremists and terrorists. It will \ndetermine whether our economic fortunes will hinge on the price of oil \nthat OPEC sets, or whether the United States will stand proudly and \nindependently as the world's innovator for clean energy technologies; \nand it will determine whether we will succeed in leaving our children \nand grandchildren a world wrought with environmental dangers, or \nwhether we can correct our path in time.\n  I thank my colleagues for their great work on this bill, and I look \nforward to a productive and thoughtful debate and a successful \nconclusion to energy legislation in the days and 2 weeks ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for \nhis courtesy in arranging for me to speak next. The Senator from \nColorado and I and the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, who is \nhere, the chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator Domenici, the \nranking member, and Senator Lieberman, who has already spoken, were at \nbreakfast this morning at our usual Tuesday morning bipartisan \nbreakfast. And Senator Bingaman expressed the hope, as I am sure he \nwill on the Senate floor when he speaks, that we can make the kind of \nprogress this year that we made 2 years ago on the Energy bill. And I \nhope so too.\n  He talked about how difficult it was and how impressive it was for \nfour committees, plus the Finance Committee, all to make a contribution \nand how we might be able to make progress with alternative fuels, with \nenergy efficiency. The more we learn about energy efficiency, such as \nwith appliances and lighting, and the more we can do in accelerating \nresearch on how to recapture carbon, the better off we will be.\n  Earlier this morning, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut said in that \nspirit of bipartisanship that he hoped one amendment would not be added \nto this bill, and that would be an amendment calling for the drilling \nfor oil in the Alaska wildlife area. That is a controversial piece of \nlegislation.\n  I want to make a similar suggestion in the spirit of bipartisanship. \nI note my friend from New Mexico is on the Senate floor, and I hope the \nSenate would not agree to and maybe we would not even have to debate, \nthe amendment that Senator Bingaman offered before in the last Congress \nand which he plans to offer again which would require a 15-percent so-\ncalled renewable portfolio standard in every State. I wish to spend a \nfew minutes this morning talking about why I believe it is important \nthat we not adopt that amendment.\n  I am reminded of a story about a Tennessee mountaineer who was \nconvicted of murder, and the judge sentenced him and told him his \nchoice was to be hanged or be shot.\n  The defendant thought a minute and said: May I ask a question, judge?\n  The judge said: Of course.\n  My question is, Do I have another choice?\n  Mr. President, we Tennesseans feel the same way about Senator \nBingaman's proposed renewable portfolio standard which would require us \nto make 15 percent of our electricity from renewable fuels, mostly wind \npower. That would raise our taxes, it would raise our electric rates, \nit would run away jobs, and it would ruin our mountaintops. That is not \nthe kind of choice we like to have.\n  Forcing Tennesseans to build 40-story wind turbines on our pristine \nmountaintops or pay billions of dollars in penalty taxes to the Federal \nGovernment amounts to a judge giving a defendant the choice of being \nhanged or shot.\n  In Tennessee, the wind simply doesn't blow enough to produce much \nelectric power. Residential homeowners cannot afford these new taxes, \nindustries will take their jobs to States with cheaper power, and \ntourists will spend their dollars where they can see the mountaintops \ninstead of giant wind turbines.\n  There is, in this case, a better choice, fortunately, and that choice \nis for clean, reasonably priced energy in the Tennessee Valley from \nconservation and efficiency, from nuclear reactors--a new one of which \njust opened within the last few weeks in our region by TVA--and by \nclean coal. Because of its nuclear and hydro plants, Tennessee is \nalready on the honor roll, ranking 16th among States in production of \ncarbon-free electricity. But we are one of 27 States that would not \nmeet the standards under Senator Bingaman's amendment, which he expects \nto offer during this debate.\n  This is real money. The Tennessee Valley Authority suggests that by \nthe last year that this new standard is in effect, it would cost \nTennesseans at least 410 million new dollars a year.\n  What could we do with that kind of money? If the goal were clean air, \nwe could give away 205 million in $2 fluorescent lightbulbs per year, \nproducing\n\n[[Page S7507]]\n\nenergy savings equal to the combined output of almost two of the three \nunits of TVA's Browns Ferry nuclear plant. In other words, the $410 \nmillion could buy enough fluorescent lightbulbs to equal two nuclear \nreactors. Or the $410 million would be the equivalent of 3,700 megawatt \nwind turbines that would span a 550-mile ridge line, more than twice \nthe distance from Bristol in the northeast part of Tennessee to \nChattanooga, which is about the only place in Tennessee that wind power \ncould actually go, along those ridgetops. Or with $410 million, we \ncould pay the $100 per month electric bill for Tennessee's 2.5 million \nresidential TVA customers for 1\\1/2\\ months each year. Or if the goal \nis simply clean air, it would be better, I respectfully submit, to \nspend the $410 million purchasing one new scrubber each 9 months to \nclean emissions from TVA's coal-fired powerplants. I strongly back \nrenewable power wherever it makes sense. In our State, I have worked \nhard to expand solar energy. The solar energy industry gave me an award \nlast year for that work. I was the principal sponsor of the tax credit \nfor homeowners to put solar panels on their homes. I have worked with \nthe Tennessee Farm Bureau to encourage the use of biomass as a \nrenewable energy. But this--and I will try to be a little bit more \nspecific in the next 10 or 12 minutes--this proposal amounts to a wind \nportfolio standard which simply does not fit the Tennessee Valley nor, \nI submit, any other part of our region. It simply does not work in the \nSoutheast.\n  Why is there a wind portfolio standard? There are other forms of \nrenewable energy, of course, but they don't all fit in the definition, \nnor do all types of clean, carbon-free energy fit within the \ndefinition. Seventy percent of our carbon-free electricity in America \ncomes from nuclear power. About 33 percent of TVA's power is carbon-\nfree nuclear power. That doesn't count within the Bingaman definition. \nNeither does the existing 7 percent of clean, completely clean power \nthat comes from hydro, from dams.\n  That makes about 40 percent of TVA's electricity carbon, sulfur, \nmercury, and nitrogen free, ranking it 16th among all the States in \nterms of producing carbon-free energy. As I said, Tennessee is on the \nhonor roll. Yet we Tennesseans would still be subjected either to these \ntaxes or putting these wind turbines along our scenic mountains, which \nI will discuss.\n  According to the Energy Information Agency assessment of the Bingaman \nproposal, 4 years ago, wind and, to a lesser extent, biomass are \nprojected to be the most important renewable resources stimulated by \nthe renewable portfolio standard.\n  There is some other evidence that biomass will be stimulated, but I \nthink it is a fair comment to say that this is mostly a wind portfolio \nstandard. And my argument is, that may be fine in North Dakota--which \nthe Senator from North Dakota says is the Saudi Arabia of wind--maybe \nit works there, and maybe North Dakotans want to see the wind turbines \nthere, but it doesn't work in Tennessee and in most of the Southeast \nbecause the wind simply doesn't blow enough to produce much \nelectricity.\n  The National Academy of Sciences says 93 percent of potential wind \nenergy capacity occurs west of the Mississippi River. We can see on \nthis chart that in this white area, that is where there is the least \namount of wind. There may be plenty of it somewhere else but not in \nTennessee and not in the South. There is only one wind farm in this \nentire southeastern part of the United States. That is a TVA wind farm \non Buffalo Mountain, which I will show in just a moment.\n  TVA had hoped that the wind on Buffalo Mountain would blow to produce \nelectricity about 35 to 38 percent of the time. They have been \ndisappointed that it only blows about 19 to 24 percent of the time. And \nin August, when we are sitting on the porches sweating, perspiring, and \nwanting our fans on and air-conditioning on, the winds on the only wind \nfarm in the southeast--Buffalo Mountain--blew just 7 percent of the \ntime. That is not an estimate. That is an actual count from TVA and the \nwind farm.\n  So the only places in the southeast region, if we can go to the next \nchart, that have wind resources are the ridges and the crests. Maybe \nunlike Iowa and North Dakota where they can have large wind farms, \nmaybe even in Colorado they can have large wind farms, but in \nTennessee, the only places that wind possibly works are on the ridges \nand the crests. In addition to being the places with the most wind, the \nridges and the crests are also in the most visited national park in the \nUnited States, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Those are the \nhighest mountains in the Eastern United States. They run up through \nPennsylvania as well. They are the Great Smoky Mountains and the \nmountains around them. They are the reason most of us live in those \nareas.\n  It is quite a sight to see when you put wind turbines on top of those \nmountains. It is a sight that I would rather not see. Here is West \nVirginia, which is north of the southeastern part of the United States. \nBasically it cuts off the whole tops of those mountains. In my opinion, \nit makes strip mining look like a decorative art. These are 400- or \n300-feet turbines. These are not your grandmother's windmills. They are \nwhite and large and have flashing red lights on top of them. You can \nsee them for 10, 12, 14 miles away.\n  Then, since they are on remote ridgetops, they have to dig large \npower lines down through whomever's backyard to get there. It is quite \na dislocation in the scenery. So one would think there would have to be \na big payoff before we would take some of the most beautiful parts of \nthe United States and basically ruin the mountaintops.\n  Here is what it looks like in Tennessee. You can get a little sense \nof how big these turbines are. In Tennessee, we like football and we \ncan put things in perspective, sometimes putting things in football \nterms. Each of these wind turbines is twice as tall as the skyboxes at \nNeyland Stadium, which is the second largest football stadium in the \nUnited States. Penn State has one, I guess, about the same size. These \nrotor blades, which go round and round, stretch from the 10-yard line \nto the 10-yard line. I can see these turbines from the Pellissippi \nParkway in Tennessee from about 14 miles away. This is at about 3,500 \nfeet. These are some of our most beautiful vistas in Tennessee.\n  The problem is, even here, which ought to be a prime spot--this is \nthe reason TVA put the turbines here--it didn't work very well. It was \na disappointment. As I mentioned, in August, the wind turbines only \noperated 7 percent of the time. Wind tends to be strongest during the \nwinter months and at dawn and dusk, but demand for electricity is \nhighest during the summer and during the day. Basically, when we need \nthe wind, it doesn't blow. And a point that many people often miss is \nthat you can't store it. Unlike more conventional forms of power, you \nuse it or you lose it. So it is of minimal help.\n  Also, it is more expensive. I have a chart showing the expense. Let's \ntake nuclear power which produces 70 percent of the carbon-free \nelectricity in the United States today, and wind, which is also carbon \nfree. Actually, both are completely free of carbon, sulfur, mercury, \nand nitrogen, which are the problems for clean air in the Tennessee \nregion. Let's compare a 1,000-watt nuclear plant reactor and a 1,000-\nmegawatt capacity wind farm. The 1,000-megawatts is about the size of a \nnew nuclear reactor. The new Browns Ferry plant in Tennessee that \nopened the other day is 1,280 megawatts. This column is the number of \nhours per year for both nuclear and wind. And this second column is the \ncapacity factor.\n  In plain English, this is how much they operate. For TVA, its nuclear \npowerplants, which produce about one-third of our electricity and most \nof our carbon-free electricity, the nuclear powerplants operate 92 \npercent of the time. The wind turbines operate, at best, 24 percent of \nthe time in the Southeast, in the area we know about. Remember, there \nis only one wind farm in the Southeast. We have it, and that is what it \ndoes.\n  The cost of electricity is up to twice as much for wind over nuclear. \nThat is what people in the utility industry call the all-in cost--that \nis, including the cost of building the facility and the cost of \noperating the facility.\n  So the brief analysis is that wind is more expensive, on a per unit \nenergy generated basis, and produces much less energy than nuclear \npower, for example. In addition to that, if we build\n\n[[Page S7508]]\n\nthe wind turbines, we still have to build and operate the nuclear \npowerplant because, as we pointed out, the wind turbines only operate \nabout 22 percent of the time.\n  My hope would be that we would not have a one-size-fits-all national \nmandate on States that are seeking to create clean energy. Tennessee \nwants to do its part. As I said, nuclear power creates 70 percent of \nthe carbon-free energy in the United States. It produces 33 percent of \nthe carbon-free energy in the Tennessee Valley through TVA, and TVA \njust opened a new reactor and they are planning more. Why would we \nimpose on a State which is already leading the country in terms of \nhelping to produce clean energy, carbon-free energy--why would we \nimpose a mandate on that State that would raise its rates or impose new \ntaxes and drive away jobs from industries that cannot afford to pay the \nhigher rates and at the same time put on our mountain tops, from \nBristol to Chattanooga, these huge wind machines that destroy the view?\n  We have 10 million people every year who come to Great Smoky \nMountains National Park, nearly three times as many as come to \nYellowstone. They come to see the mountains; they don't come to see the \nwind turbines. I guarantee, if we continue to provide incentives and \nmandates to put up these \n300-, 400-, 500-foot-tall wind turbines with red flashing lights, that \nis all the visitors will see when they come to Tennessee. They will not \nbe able to see anything else.\n  I am eager to work with Senators Bingaman and Domenici on the Energy \nbill. I had the pleasure, the last 4 years, of serving with them on \nthat committee. I admire the way they work together. They made a point \n2 years ago of saying that when we go too far in either direction, we \nwill pull back a little bit so we can make sure we have a good, strong \nbill. I believe the bill in 2005 was underestimated. I believe the bill \nproduced in 2005, produced by Senators Domenici and Bingaman and the \nSenate working with the House, literally set America on a different \ncourse in terms of producing large amounts of reliable, affordable, \nclean energy. It helped us do that in a way that would keep the costs \nof natural gas down, which was very important to us at that time and \nstill is today.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Southeastern Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners \nexpressing the same views I have just expressed, that such a mandate \nwould cause us to end up paying higher electric prices with nothing to \nshow for it. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Finally, I would like to reiterate what we could \nbetter do with the money. I see the Senator from North Dakota here. I \nmentioned a little earlier that he has said North Dakota is the Saudi \nArabia of wind, and I admire North Dakota for that, I admire him for \nhis outspoken advocacy of that, and I hope all the giant wind machines \ngo to North Dakota. That is where I would like them to be, just not in \nTennessee--not just because of how they look but because in our neck of \nthe woods they do not work. They raise our taxes, or they raise our \nrates, or they destroy our mountains, or they run away jobs from \nindustries and tourists who do not want to be part of that. I would \nrather see us look for better ways to spend those dollars.\n  As I suggested earlier, we could take the same amount of money we \nwould be taxed, if we choose not to build these, by providing 205 \nmillion $2 light bulbs, which would be the equivalent energy savings of \nalmost 2 nuclear reactors, or it would be the equivalent of 3,700 of \nthese wind turbines, which would run along the ridge tops from Bristo \nto Chattanooga, or it would pay the monthly electric bill for \nTennessee's 2.5 million TVA residential customers, every Tennessee \nresidential customer, for a month and a half, or it would put a new \nscrubber on TVA's coal-fired powerplants every 9 month period.\n  I am afraid this is an idea looking for a problem to solve. It may \nsolve it in North Dakota, it might solve it in New Mexico and perhaps \nit does in Colorado, but it does not in Tennessee. It raises our taxes, \nraises our rates, ruins our mountains, and it sends jobs away, runs \nthem away.\n  I hope, in a spirit of bipartisanship, perhaps the Senator from New \nMexico, one of our most thoughtful Senators, the leader of this debate, \nwill decide there are other things we can focus on rather than a one-\nsize-fits-all mandate which may work in some States but does not in my \nState.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                       Southeastern Association of\n\n\n                             Regulatory Utility Commissioners,\n\n                                    Little Rock, AR, May 31, 2007.\n       Dear Senators Bingaman and Domenici, and Congressmen \n     Dingell and Barton: The undersigned state utility \n     commissioners are writing to express our concerns about the \n     nationwide, mandatory federal renewable portfolio standard \n     (RPS) being discussed/introduced by Senator Bingaman. As \n     state regulators, we are responsible for ensuring that retail \n     electricity consumers receive affordable, reliable electric \n     service. We are concerned that a uniform, federal RPS mandate \n     fails to recognize adequately that there are significant \n     differences among the states in terms of available and cost-\n     effective renewable energy resources and that having such a \n     standard in energy legislation will ultimately increase \n     consumers' electricity bills.\n       The reality is that not all states are fortunate enough to \n     have abundant traditional renewable energy resources, such as \n     wind, or have them located close enough to the load to render \n     them cost-effective. This is especially true in the Southeast \n     and large parts of the Midwest. Even in regions of the \n     country that do have access to wind energy, there is \n     frequently stiff local opposition to building huge wind \n     turbines, significant costs for the additional transmission \n     needed, and reliability concerns. As a result, some wind \n     renewable energy projects do not get built, while others take \n     years to build. The availability of other renewable energy \n     resources, such as geothermal, is even more limited.\n       Because of the limited availability and cost-effectiveness \n     of traditional renewable energy resources, we are deeply \n     concerned that our utilities will be forced to buy renewable \n     energy credits from the federal government or from renewable \n     energy generators in other regions of the country. \n     Correspondingly, our retail electricity consumers will end up \n     paying higher electricity prices, with nothing to show for \n     it.\n       Renewable energy resources may be able to make a \n     significant contribution to energy production in those \n     regions of the country that have abundant renewable \n     resources. In fact, over 20 states and the District of \n     Columbia have already seen fit to approve their own RPS \n     programs based on the resources available to them. Moreover, \n     those states have included a wider array of energy resources \n     in their definitions of eligible renewable resources than the \n     proposed federal RPS mandate, Some states consider power \n     produced from municipal solid waste, small hydroelectric \n     facilities or coal waste to be renewable energy. Other states \n     count expenditures on demand-side management or alternative \n     compliance payments toward meeting the state RPS \n     requirements. None of these alternative renewable energy \n     resources, however, would receive credit under the Senate \n     version of a federal RPS program.\n       While state public service commissions and energy service \n     providers should certainly consider available and cost-\n     effective renewable energy resource options as they make \n     long-term decisions for incremental energy needs, the \n     imposition of a strict federal RPS mandate, as contrasted \n     with a state-driven cost-effectiveness determination, will \n     only result in higher electricity prices for our consumers. \n     Because the availability and cost-effectiveness of \n     traditional renewable energy resources varies so widely among \n     states and regions, we believe that decisions regarding \n     renewable energy portfolios should be left to the states. If, \n     however, the Congress desires to address renewable energy \n     objectives in the upcoming Energy Bill, we urge you to \n     expressly allow each individual state to determine the extent \n     to which renewable energy can be reliably and cost \n     effectively utilized within that state.\n           Sincerely,\n       (Signed by Members of the Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, \n     Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and \n     Tennessee commissioners.)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I see my colleague from North Dakota \nwishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here supporting a piece \nof legislation which I think advances this country's energy interests. \nI am a member of the Senate Energy Committee. I have worked with \nSenator Bingaman and Senator Domenici not only on the previous Energy \nbill in 2005 but on this Energy bill, and I think this is a good bill. \nWe are going to improve it some on the floor of the Senate, but it came \nout of the Energy\n\n[[Page S7509]]\n\nCommittee as a bipartisan bill and one I think will improve the energy \npolicy in this country.\n  Energy is a very important policy. We don't think about it much. I \nknow most all of us get up in the morning and we just flick a switch \nsomeplace in our house. That switch turns on lights and we turn on the \ntelevision set, it turns on all the things we use all day. While we are \nsleeping, the air-conditioner is running. We have all these \nconveniences, and we do not necessarily understand that all of it comes \nfrom somewhere beyond a switch. So energy has been pretty easy for this \ncountry. Now we are running into some interesting questions and \nchallenges. We have to develop a more thoughtful, more sensible energy \npolicy for the long-term future.\n  There is an airplane which is now parked in a museum. I believe it \nwas tail No. 27,000, an old 707 that used to be Air Force One. It was \nthe Air Force One that flew President Reagan around, and others. It was \nthe Air Force One that was in Dallas, TX, in fact, the day John F. \nKennedy was assassinated. One of its last trips before it was retired \nto a museum was a trip to Asia. I was a member of that delegation, \ngoing to meet with the President of China and others.\n  In a cabin on that little old airplane flying over the Pacific one \nnight, about 10 or 11 o'clock at night, one of our Senate colleagues, \nJohn Glenn, was sitting there with us. I was peppering John Glenn with \nquestions about his circling the Earth as an astronaut back 40 years \nprior to that time. I was a young kid and I had been listening to the \nradio that day, and I listened to this account of this astronaut \ncircling the Earth. The whole world was focused on what this astronaut, \nup alone in Friendship 7, a tiny little capsule, was doing.\n  I asked him a lot of questions about it that evening. I had the \nopportunity as a new Member of the Senate with my colleague John Glenn \nto pepper him with a lot of questions. One of my questions was this. I \nsaid: My understanding back then was that the city of Perth, Australia, \nwhen you were orbiting the Earth that night, turned on every light in \nthe city as a signal to the astronaut flying alone orbiting the Earth. \nDo you remember the ability to look down and see the lights from Perth, \nAustralia?\n  He said: I do, I do. I remember this brilliant light coming up from \nPerth, Australia, where all the citizens decided to shine up a light to \nthis astronaut flying alone on Friendship 7.\n  The only evidence of life on Earth as he orbited the dark side of the \nEarth was energy, light--human beings turning on a light switch and \nlighting a city to light the way for an astronaut orbiting the Earth.\n  Energy is a significant part of our lives every single day and \nvirtually in every way. As I said, we take it pretty much for granted.\n  Let me talk about the challenges, if I might. One of the significant \nchallenges is oil. We have this big old planet of ours. We have roughly \n6.5 billion neighbors on this planet. We circle the Sun. We have this \nprodigious need for oil, so we stick straws in the earth, called \ndrilling rigs, and suck oil out of the earth. We suck about 84 million \nbarrels of oil a day out of this planet of ours--84 million barrels a \nday we suck out of this earth.\n  We use 21 million barrels in this country alone. In this little patch \nof ground called the United States of America, we have built an \nunbelievable economy, dramatically improved the standard of living over \na long period of time, and we have an unending thirst for oil. So one-\nfourth of all of the oil used on this planet is used in this country, \nthis place on the globe.\n  Unfortunately, a substantial amount of the oil is under the sands of \nthe Middle East and in unstable parts of the world. Here is what \nhappens. When we import oil, here is what we use the oil for: 67 \npercent is used for transportation. So nearly 70 percent of the oil we \nuse in this country is used in the vehicle fleet or for transportation. \nOne of the things we are discussing here in the Energy bill is this \nissue of trying to make these vehicles more efficient. If we use 70 \npercent of the oil in this country for transportation and we have had \nvery little change in efficiency of vehicles, then the question should \nbe and is, Should not we make vehicles more efficient?\n  Here is an example. This is a chart you can't see particularly well: \nAuto Fuel Efficiency Versus Performance. Do you see what has happened \non the blue line, performance--zero to 60 in a nanosecond? Increased \nperformance, more power, more speed. What has happened with respect to \nmiles per gallon? Just like that, right flat across.\n  Part of that is the consumer. The consumer wants to buy big, heavy \ncars, fast cars. I understand that. In fact, here is a survey. I was \nvery surprised. CNW Research pointed out that overall fuel economy--\nthis is a couple of years ago--is No. 12 in concern by consumers. I am \nsure it has changed now. But cupholders and sound systems ranked above \nthe issue of overall fuel economy. I expect that is not the case now \nwhen you are driving up to the gas pump and in some vehicles putting in \n$40, $50, $60 or $70 worth of gasoline into that vehicle. So perhaps \nthat has changed.\n  But this legislation does a lot of things with respect to energy. It \nrequires an improvement in the efficiency of vehicles. I know \nautomobile companies came here last week. I had a chance to talk to the \nCEOs of the three big U.S. auto companies. I know they are taking the \nsame position they have always taken--not now, not us, not today.\n  The fact is, we must, it seems to me, insist that our vehicle fleet \nbe more efficient. Because nearly 70 percent of the oil we use in this \ncountry is being used in our vehicles, the only way we are going to try \nto extract ourselves from being addicted to foreign oil is to begin to \nmake changes in a range of areas, and that includes making cars more \nefficient. That means a higher mileage per gallon standard.\n  We have a circumstance, as I indicated, where a substantial part of \nthe oil is put in one place on this planet and the dramatic need for \noil is in another place. Much of where we get our oil is in very \ntroubled parts of the world. We could, one day, wake up with terrorists \nattacking a refinery somewhere and a shutoff of the oil to this country \nfrom foreign sources, and this country would be flat on its back. This \ncountry would have its economy in tatters. That is why we need to be \nmuch less dependent, we need to find a way to be independent of the \nneed for oil from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Iran, Iraq, Venezuela--all \nthe places in the world that are unstable, where we have a great \nreliance on oil. That is at least part of what this bill is about.\n  I am going to talk about several other things as well, but I, along \nwith my colleague, Senator Larry Craig, a Republican--I am a Democrat--\nwe joined in introducing something called the SAFE Energy Act, Securing \nAmerica's Future Energy. The Energy Security Leadership Council is a \ngroup of really interesting people including some CEOs of major \ncorporations and flag officers in the U.S. military. They studied these \nissues for several years and put together a plan.\n  That plan is recommendations to the Nation on Reducing Oil \nDependence; trying to make this economy of ours less oil intensive.\n  I introduced a piece of legislation with Senator Craig that \nimplements most all of these recommendations. I would commend it to my \ncolleagues because I think it makes a lot of sense. It talks about \nexpanding the supply of energy, especially renewable energy; also talks \nabout finding additional supplies. We believe we ought to be able to \nexplore and drill more in expanded areas, particularly in the Gulf of \nMexico, because there are substantial reserves of oil and gas in the \nGulf of Mexico that are attainable without ruining anybody's view or \ncreating other problems.\n  We believe that in addition to renewable energy and the production of \nrenewable energy, all of the biofuels are necessary. We believe that \nCAFE standards, or at least automobile efficiency standards, are \nnecessary as well. This piece of legislation brought to the floor of \nthe Senate includes all of them.\n  Let me continue to talk about oil for a moment and say that when I \nwas a little boy, I remember they drilled one oil well near my hometown \nin southwestern North Dakota. I lived in a town of 300 people. There \nwasn't a lot to do, obviously, in a town of 300 people.\n  So when they brought in a drilling rig and constructed a drilling rig \nand\n\n[[Page S7510]]\n\nstarted to drill for oil about 3 miles from town, I will never forget \nas a little boy going out there in the evenings in my parent's car. We \nsaw all these lights on the oil rig at night. We sat there and looked \nat it. That was entertainment.\n  We did that night after night. We figured at some point they were \ngoing to strike oil. We didn't want to be too close to the rig, because \nthe movies showed that when you strike oil, you get a gusher.\n  But we watched. We would drive out there and park, the whole town \nwould go out there and park. We would watch that oil well. Nothing was \nhappening, of course, nothing you could see. We saw the lights. That \nwas a whole lot more than was going on in town.\n  Well, it turns out it was a dry well; never drilled another one. But \nthat was my experience. As a young boy, my father also managed a \ngasoline station. So I pumped a lot of gas as a young boy. Some say \nthat my occupation hasn't changed so much being in the Senate, but I \ncontest that, of course.\n  My point is this: Oil is central to our lives and will remain central \nto our lives, but we need to find a way to reduce our dependence on the \nsources of oil that come from very troubled parts of the world.\n  In North Dakota, for example, in western North Dakota, we now have \nwhat is called the Bakken Shale, which could, we hope--the U.S. \nGeological Survey will determine this--but it could contain dramatic \namounts of recoverable oil.\n  Incidentally, I was in western North Dakota visiting with Marathon \nOil that is now drilling. It is unbelievable what they are doing. They \ndrill 2 miles down--2 miles down--then take a giant bend and drill 2 \nmiles out. One drilling rig. They go down 2 miles and then bend it and \nthen drill 2 miles out. It is unbelievable technology.\n  We hope there is additional production here in this country. That is \none way to be less dependent on foreign sources of oil. We can take a \nlook at where you can get additional oil. I mentioned the Gulf of \nMexico is a substantial opportunity for us as well. But there are a lot \nof things for us to do and do well, if we are going to be less \ndependent on foreign sources of oil, also, if we are going to have an \nenergy policy that has much more credibility than our current policy.\n  Now, the Congress passed what was called the Energy Policy Act of \n2005. We did a number of things there. I was one of the Members of the \nCongress who, at that time and since that time, one of I guess four or \nfive of us in the Senate who tried to open up what is called Lease 181 \nin the Gulf of Mexico. We succeeded in doing that. It is a smaller \ntract than we had hoped, but that also will contribute to the \nproduction of additional energy here at home.\n  Some say our energy strategy for the future must be ``digging and \ndrilling.'' I call that yesterday forever, digging and drilling. Yes, \nwe are going to dig and, yes, we are going to drill. But if that is all \nwe do, we lose. Everything we use in this country every day needs to be \nmore efficient. Our refrigerators, our air conditioners, our vacuums, \neverything needs to be more efficient. That is No. 1.\n  We have had very big debates on strange-named things such as SEER \nstandards. I mean how many people have heard of SEER 13 standards for \nair conditioners. But it makes a big difference in the number of \npowerplants you have to build in this country based on the standards \nfor efficiency for all the things we use with respect to appliances.\n  In addition to all that, we at the same time have to rely on other \nsources and other types of energy; wind energy as an example. Well, my \ncolleague from Tennessee apparently does not like wind energy. God \nbless him. He has a right not to like wind energy.\n  It seems to me it makes a lot of sense with a turbine, the much more \nimproved turbines and technologically capable turbines, to extract the \nenergy from the wind and turn it into electricity. Yes, it is an \nintermittent source of electricity because you do not produce it when \nthe wind is not blowing. But in some States, my State in particular, \nwhich is ranked by the Department of Energy as having the largest wind \nenergy potential, taking energy from the wind and producing electricity \nwith that energy makes a lot of sense.\n  We have an exciting experiment going on in North Dakota that I have \nbeen involved in: taking energy from the wind through a wind turbine, \nturning that energy through a turbine into electricity, using \nelectricity through the process of electrolysis to separate hydrogen \nfrom water. You use an intermittent energy source to produce hydrogen \nand store the hydrogen. That is pretty unbelievable. Yet we can do \nthat. We can do that, and it is going make us less dependent on foreign \nsources of energy.\n\n  Now one of the proposals that will be offered by my colleague, \nSenator Bingaman, which I intend to be here and support, and I believe \nseveral have spoken in opposition to it, is what is called a renewable \nportfolio standard. Not a very sexy name, in fact we should rename it, \nrenewable energy standard of some type.\n  But it is simply this: With respect to electricity that we are \ncreating in this country, 15 percent of that electricity should come \nfrom renewable sources. Establishing a national standard, a goal, what \nis it we want to meet? Where do we want to go? An old saying: If you \ndon't care where you are, you will never be lost.\n  Well, I mean, if we do not care where we are, we will never have a \nstandard that we will miss. But how about ascribing a standard for this \ncountry that forces us to reach a little bit and says that, for every \nkilowatt hour of electricity we are going to use, 15 percent of what we \nproduce is going to come from renewable sources of energy.\n  Once again, it relieves and begins to withdraw our heavy dependence \non foreign sources of oil because a substantial amount of our \nelectricity now comes from fossil fuels, from natural gas and coal and \nso on.\n  Now, the issue of the renewable portfolio standard, I understand, is \ngoing to be controversial because some do not want the Federal \nGovernment to be involved in requiring something such as this. But, \nfrankly, I don't think we have much choice. The other issue that will \nbe involved in with this bill, which I support, is a renewable fuels \nstandard. That renewable fuels standard is one that calls for 36 \nbillion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022. Now, I helped write the \nlast renewable fuel standard. It was the first one we ever established. \nIt was 7\\1/2\\ billion gallons by 2012.\n  We are going to be at 10 billion gallons, exceeding that standard in \na year or two. We believe we should aspire to achieve much more; a \nrenewable fuels standard, using the biofuels; yes, the production of \nethanol; growing energy in our farm fields on a renewable basis, you \ncan do that year after year; the ethanol that can come from cellulose \nthat I believe has great capability in our future. All of that is good \nfor this country.\n  It is good for our farmers, good for our consumers, it is good for \nbeginning to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil. Now, we \nhave a lot of issues we are going to be discussing, some controversial, \nsome perhaps not, but my hope is that in the coming week and a half or \nso we can finish this Energy bill.\n  I wish to show a couple of charts again. First of all, the amount of \noil we use in this country. Those are million barrels per day. I \nmentioned we suck 84 million barrels of oil out of this little planet \nof ours. Look at what we use in the United States. Our population uses \none-fourth of all the oil that is taken out of this planet every single \nday.\n  I mean, that is an oil intensity for our economy that, in my \njudgment, needs to be changed. Then, finally, let me say again, if 70 \npercent of that oil, nearly 70 percent is used in that vehicle fleet. \nIf in that vehicle fleet we have seen all those improvements in \nacceleration, for example, and no improvement with respect to miles per \ngallon, then we better figure out how we address this in a different \nway.\n  One other item I am going to talk about for a moment is something \ncalled SPR. One of the problems with this life is there are so many \nacronyms and so many shorthand names for things, the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. We are doing something that makes a lot of sense to \nme. We are taking oil and sticking it underground and saving it for a \ntime when we might need it, a security reserve of oil. The Strategic \nPetroleum Reserves makes sense to me. In fact, we increased the\n\n[[Page S7511]]\n\namount of that SPR authorization in the 2005 Energy Policy Act. But \nwith respect to our original goal, we are 97 percent there--97 percent. \nI do not think it makes any sense at this point to increase it, despite \nthe authorization, I do not think it makes any sense, when the price of \noil is where it is, very high--the price of gasoline is extraordinary--\nI do not think it makes sense to be taking any oil out of the supply \nchain and sticking it underground.\n  Yet our Government continues to do that. I know we have not been \npurchasing oil at this point. They suspended that through the summer \ndriving season. But we are still taking about 8 or 9 million barrels of \noil and putting it in SPR as part of the payment for royalties in kind. \nI do not support that either.\n  The President is asking for a near doubling of SPR in the next \nappropriations cycle. I am not going to support that. I am going to \nwrite the bill. I will be writing the bill as chairman of the \nappropriations subcommittee that funds that. I am not going to increase \nthat because I think at a time when gas prices are going through the \nroof, the last thing we ought to do is take oil out of the supply, \nbecause all that does is put upward pressure on gas prices. So I \nbelieve that is another thing we might wish to consider in this \ndiscussion.\n  Finally, the issue of energy is one that I know consumes perhaps less \nattention from time to time than others, because we take it for \ngranted. We turn the light switch on, we get in our car, we do all \nthese things, all of it powered as a part of our energy need, and we do \nnot think much about it. But if, God forbid, somehow all of it were \nturned off, and we had an example a few years ago, I think we were out \nof energy in the capital region for 5 or 6 days, then all of a sudden \nwe understood what energy means to our daily lives.\n\n  If ever we would see gas lines around the block again, we would \nunderstand what this addiction to oil means for our daily lives. Now, I \nsaid earlier that if our entire approach with respect to energy is \ndigging and drilling, that is yesterday forever. I do not mean we will \nnot continue to use fossil fuels, I believe we will. Fossil fuels will \nbe a significant part of our future.\n  That means oil, coal, and natural gas. I am going to spend a lot of \ntime and money as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee dealing \nwith this issue of clean power and clean coal technology because we \nhave to be able to continue to use that resource. But it is also the \ncase that we have so much more to do. Because for decades we have been \ntold that you cannot do renewables, renewables are a pat-on-the-head \nsort of thing. If you are talking about renewables, good for you, God \nbless you, but you ought to go to a library someplace and visit with \nyour two or three friends about these things; it does not matter to \nAmerica's future. That is total nonsense.\n  Renewable energy is very important for this country. It is long past \nthe time that we get about the business of dealing with it. Yes, it is \nhydrogen and fuel cells, which I feel very strongly about. It is wind \nand solar. It is geothermal. It is a wide range of issues dealing with \nrenewable energy that I believe will contribute to this country's \nenergy security. I believe it will give us a much better and a much \nstronger energy policy.\n  I see my colleague from Idaho is here. As I indicated earlier, he and \nI have introduced a piece of legislation that a fair part is included \nin the bill that was reported out of the Energy Committee. I am also on \nthe Commerce Committee, which has reported a portion of this bill as \nwell.\n  I believe we need do a lot of things well in order to make this \ncountry less dangerously dependent, as we now are, on foreign sources \nof energy. That is our goal.\n  I believe our plan does that. I believe the bill that is brought to \nus from the Energy, Commerce, EPW, and Foreign Relations Committees \nadvances this country's interest.\n  My hope is, in the coming week or two, perhaps a week and a half, as \nthis is being considered, we can improve the bill even more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota and I over \nthe years have coalesced around a variety of issues we have been \nsuccessful on on some occasions in causing to become public policy. \nEarlier this year--and Senator Dorgan has already mentioned it--we \ncoalesced around three concepts we thought were critically necessary in \na current and future energy portfolio and, therefore, the public policy \nthat drives it. We recognized that efficiency would be and must be a \npart of the equation, that clean energy, the biofuels, must be a part \nof the equation for the future to make us less dependent. But also \nsomething that must be a part of the equation is production of current \nknown and future sources of hydrocarbons. In other words--I will quote \nthe Senator from North Dakota--you can't conserve or drill your way out \nof the current $3-plus gas we have and the greater dependency we have \non foreign nations to supply us, but a combination of both into the \nfuture brings us to where this great country ought to be from the \nstandpoint of a national energy policy.\n  The Reid bill, the Bingaman bill that has been introduced on the \nfloor, S. 1419, is about the future. You can stand on a hilltop and see \nit out there 25 or 30 years into the future. But the man or woman of \nthe American economy today who is at the gas pump and filling his or \nher car or truck wants to know about tomorrow and next week and next \nyear. Are gas prices going to continue to go up? What is the problem \nhere? Why isn't this great Nation more self-sufficient? And for those \nwho study energy a good deal and see a 60-percent reliance on foreign \nproduction, shouldn't we be worried about national security? Shouldn't \nwe be worried about the emergence of petronationalism, about a little \ndictator down in Venezuela jerking the tail of a great country because \nhe supplies 17 percent of our total foreign imports? Yes, we ought to \nbe concerned about that. We ought to be angry about it.\n  The reason we grew complacent, the light switch would always produce \na light or the gas pump would always produce inexpensive fuel, is \nbecause it has always been there. What a large part of Americans didn't \nknow is that politically and in a public policy way we began to set in \nplace a series of things over the last 20 years that flattened \nproduction, made it less profitable, created self-reliance, and didn't \ncompete and keep up with the amount of consumed energy we were \nrequiring of a growth economy. As a result, we hit the wall. The wall \nis $3-plus gas. All power bills are going up. Energy is a part of \nAmerica's disposable income and is becoming an increasingly bigger \npart. Americans are sitting now scratching their heads and saying: Are \nwe going to have to change our lifestyles because energy is going to \ncost a lot more?\n  My wife and I and a group of Senators, the week before last, traveled \nin Europe. As we landed at Andrews Air Force Base, got in our cars and \nheaded home, I turned to my wife and said: I see we are back in the \nland of the big cars.\n  That is part of our addiction. We love our big cars. We had been \ntraveling in Luxembourg, France, and Italy, and by definition, it is \nthe land of the little car. Why? Because gas over there from a \ngallonage point of view is about $7.50 a gallon. It is at least double \nplus a little more of what we are currently paying today. As a result, \nEuropeans significantly over the last 20 years have changed their \nlifestyles because they couldn't afford the energy. I am not going to \napologize because America consumes a lot of energy. We are nearly 26 \npercent of the world economy. We consume 26 percent of the energy base. \nWhy? Because we are 26 percent of the world economy. It takes energy to \nproduce jobs, to produce products, to create an economy. We are driven \nby energy. It is going to cost more to stay at 26 percent if we don't \ndevelop good public policy that gets us through tomorrow and takes us \ninto the future in a way that the consumer can understand and \nappreciate.\n  Consumers are angry today, and they have a right to be. They look at \nvery large profits on the part of the oil companies and say: Look, it \nis their fault. Those profits are driven by demand and the ability to \nsupply. There are no gas lines today because there is energy at the \npump, but we are paying more for it. The Senator from North Dakota is\n\n[[Page S7512]]\n\nright, the politics of this issue would change again if there were long \ngas lines at the pump and they were paying $3-plus a gallon. So the \nsupply is there in the current form, but 60 percent of it comes from a \nforeign nation somewhere in the world. Most of those supplies and those \nforeign nations are in very precarious political situations. It is a \nvery unstable world out there from whence these supplies come. As a \nresult, the futures market anticipates that and builds a margin in to \noffset the risk to deal with the demand.\n  What am I saying here? I am saying to the Senate today that S. 1419 \nis a piece of the total, but it isn't where we ought to be tomorrow. \nTomorrow ought to be about energy security and energy production. You \ndon't talk green, although you have to talk green and should talk \ngreen. You don't talk cellulosic ethanol being in production in 10 \nyears at a rate of 15 billion gallons a year because it won't be, \nbecause the technology isn't there, although we are driving there. \nEnergy efficiency, a CAFE standard, is a place we ought to go. I for \nthe first time join with the Senator from North Dakota in a 4-percent \nmandatory efficiency. That takes us down the road. But that is out in \nthe future. What about tomorrow? What about knowing where our current \noil reserves are, the 15 or 20 billion barrels or more of oil that is \nin the Outer Continental Shelf that may be very accessible in a clean \nand environmentally sound way? What about expanding our refinery \ncapacity? Because in this transitional period of the next two-and-a-\nhalf to three decades, where more cars will be electric, more cars will \nbe hybrid, we will be producing 20 percent of our liquid transportation \nfuels from corn-based ethanol, cellulosic-based ethanol, to get to the \n30 to 32 billion gallons a year. What about all of that? That is our \nfuture.\n  My consumers in Idaho want to know about tomorrow. The Reid-Bingaman \nbill has nothing to do with tomorrow. We simply cannot ignore the next \n10 or 15 years and jump into the future. We have to continue to produce \nand we need to produce. We have to continue to refine the hydrocarbons \nto supply the gas, and we need to expand that capability. It better be \non shore. It better not be in Venezuela or in Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or \nsomeplace else that is at this moment, at best, politically unstable, \nlet alone Iran and Iraq. That is where our dependence lies today. To \nfail to address that in the Senate is to fail to address the No. 1 \nquestion of a great nation: How do we stay great? How do we stay at 26 \npercent of the world GDP? How do we stay generous to the rest of the \nworld? We produce and push a lot of new technology, and that is in part \nwhat the Reid bill is about. That is all going to be transparent and \ngiveable to the rest of the world. When we lead on energy in all \naspects, the rest of the world benefits because we share it.\n\n  Therefore, as this bill comes to the floor, there is a great deal \nthat has to be done. We need a new RPS, renewable portfolio standard, \nwind, solar--a great idea, an old concept. Today's energy world is \nabout cleanliness. Why not a new standard? Why not a clean portfolio \nstandard instead of a renewable portfolio standard? Include wind, \ninclude solar, include sequestration of carbon, include efficiencies, \ninclude nuclear, include hydro. Let's get on with the business of being \nclean. If Senator Reid wants to come to the floor and talk about \nclimate change, then he ought to be talking about all of those other \nthings that drive the economy toward a cleaner energy future, not \ncommand and control but incentives, creativity, bringing off the \nlaboratory shelf and into production the kind of things we know are \nalready out there.\n  Coal to liquids, what is wrong with that? Some environmental groups \nare wringing their hands and saying: There might be a problem there. We \nknow it will burn 90 percent cleaner. That is not a problem. It is only \nin the mind of some idealist that it isn't perfect. How do you get to \nperfection? You start by adjusting and changing and improving. Today we \nare tremendously proud of our ethanol production in corn. But it has \nbeen 20 years in refinement and development to the distillery that is \nset up tomorrow somewhere in the Midwest. It is going to be so much \nbetter than the distillery that went into production a decade and a \nhalf ago. That is what this bill ought to be about, and it isn't there \ntoday.\n  What about the tax incentives, and what is the Finance Committee \ngoing to do? None of that is there.\n  This chart illustrates the problem. Here is the line for demand; here \nis supply. This is the hydrocarbons. That is pretty simple. Where does \nthis margin come from? Offshore, foreign countries. High risk, less \nnational security. Why do a lot of military leaders and those who look \nin broader terms support what Byron Dorgan and Larry Craig did today in \nthe SAFE bill and those three factors about production, efficiency, and \nbiofuels? They support it because of national security, taking this out \nof the equation, getting us back into production.\n  You have heard me talk a lot over the past about the Outer \nContinental Shelf and the billions and billions of gallons of oil that \nis out there. We have allowed States to say no even though it is a \nnational, Federal resource. Last year we picked up a little bit right \nhere in lease sale 181, but here in the eastern gulf are phenomenal \nresources, billions and billions of barrels of oil that are very \naccessible, achievable in a sound environmental way, and we are still \nsaying no. We are still saying, let a tinhorn dictator in Venezuela \njerk us around.\n  Here is another problem. The Cubans have said: Come drill us. The \nworld is coming. The world is drilling in Cuba today. Vietnam came in \nlast week. Spain, Norway, Malaysia, and Canada are 45 miles off our \nshore drilling for oil, but we can't drill. It is the ultimate ``no'' \nzone of politics. The ``no'' zone went up decades ago when the \ntechnology wasn't there to achieve the environmental standards upon \nwhich we demand and insist. The technology is here today. But the \npolitics of Florida won't allow us to touch this. So the American \nconsumer simply says: OK. I am going to pay more. I am going to pay \nanother 50 cents a gallon so Florida can have its political way or \nanywhere else, for that matter, along the eastern seaboard or as it \nrelates to this equation over here, the western coast, Alaska. Or have \nwe come to a turn in the road where technology allows us to go there in \na clean way and bring down that dependency, allows us to thumb our \nnose, if you will, at the foreign sources?\n  Here is the other side of the equation. Nearly $300 billion a year \nleaves our shore to go to another country to buy their oil, and some of \nthose countries are buying guns and shooting at us. How smart we aren't \nto allow that policy to continue to prevail.\n  That is part of the debate in the coming weeks as it relates to 1419. \nIt is not a complete package. It is way out into the future. It is not \nabout tomorrow. It is not about national security. It is not about \nproduction. If we don't have those factors in a bill, this Senate will \nnot serve its public and the American consumer in a responsible way in \nsustaining and building a great nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7512-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to discuss \none of the provisions of this Energy bill that is now before the \nSenate. This is the provision that would increase the fuel efficiency \nof our Nation's fleet of vehicles. These provisions were approved by \nthe Commerce Committee with substantial bipartisan support. They are \nknown as the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act.\n  I come to the floor in place of Chairman Inouye, who is ill today and \nhas asked me if I would mind describing the provisions of this \nlegislation, and, of course, I am delighted to do that. The legislation \nis supported by a bipartisan group of Senators, including Senators \nStevens, Snowe, Dorgan, Collins, Durbin, Boxer, Cantwell, Carper, \nKlobuchar, and Kerry.\n  The basic premise of the legislation is to increase the fuel economy \nof cars, SUVs, and light trucks by 10 miles per gallon over 10 years--\nthat is the ``10 over 10''--and to do this by 2020. But the bill does \ndo more than that. It continues beyond 2020 and increases fuel \nefficiency by 4 percent a year through 2030. This is with the addition \nof the Dorgan legislation which the Commerce Committee added to Senator \nSnowe's, Senator Inouye's and my 10-over-10 bill in the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Some would have liked this legislation to go further, perhaps to 40 \nmiles per gallon or more. Others do not want any significant increases. \nBut I think this legislation strikes the right balance, and it sets \nforward a significant, achievable standard for the future.\n  It would be the first major fuel efficiency increase in the past 25 \nyears. Can you believe it? With all the talk and all the discussion in \nthe past 25 years, nothing has been done to increase fuel efficiency. I \nhave been working on this legislation in one form or another--first, it \nwas with Senator Snowe as an SUV loophole closer. We have been doing \nthis for more than a decade now.\n  But the simple truth is that today the technology exists to \naccomplish the goals of this legislation. It can be done without \nreducing safety and with significant benefit to our economy and our \nenvironment. It does so in a way that gives auto manufacturers the \nflexibility and the time they need. I hope they listen to this because \nI think they have a misimpression of the bill. This is not according to \njust us, but it is according to the experts--the National Academy of \nSciences, the International Council on Clean Transportation, and \nexperts at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. So it is time to \nbreak the logjam.\n  We all know our Nation faces stark energy challenges. Gas prices have \nrisen to above $3 a gallon--more than doubling in the past 5 years. \nGlobal warming is real, it is happening, and it is having an impact on \nthe world around us. The United States needs to address the \ntransportation sector's emissions of carbon dioxide. Transportation, in \n2004, accounted for 28 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. With a \nwar in Iraq and tense relations with Iran, we need to move away from \nour dependence on foreign oil. Through this legislation, we believe we \ncan have a significant impact in each of those areas.\n  By 2025, increases for cars and light-duty trucks would save 2.1 \nmillion barrels of oil per day. That is nearly the amount of oil \nimported daily from the Persian Gulf, so it would be a savings, by \n2025, of about what we import each day now. That is consequential. It \nwould reduce carbon dioxide emissions--which is the primary global \nwarming gas--18 percent from anticipated levels in 2025. That is the \nequivalent of taking 60 million cars off the road in a year. And--and \nthis is a big ``and''--it would save the consumer, the driver, the \nfamily, a net $69 billion at the gas pump. That is based on a $3.08 a \ngallon gas price. That is the recent average price nationwide. So with \ngas costing $3.08 a gallon, the net consumer savings--if this bill were \nin place--would be $69 billion. This would mean, if you go to the \nindividual or the individual family, it is a savings of $700 to $1,000 \na year for families with children, depending on the price of gas. So \nthe time has come to act.\n\n  Now, here is what the measure would do. I hope people will listen. It \nwould set achievable fuel economy standards for all vehicles, \nincreasing fleetwide average fuel economy for all cars, SUVs, and \ntrucks by 10 miles per gallon over 10 years--or from 25 to 35 miles per \ngallon by model year 2020. So 25 to 35 miles per gallon by 2020, and it \nis 2007 today. It would provide for an additional 4-percent annual \nincrease after that until 2030. It would require the Department of \nTransportation to improve the fuel economy of medium and heavy-duty \ntrucks over a 20-year period--not tomorrow, not today but over a 20-\nyear period--for the first time in history addressing this particular \narea of concern.\n  America, do something about your heavy trucks, and over the next 20 \nyears try to see if you can't make them more fuel efficient.\n  The key to this bill is it changes the way automakers are allowed to \nmeet these standards in fairly substantial ways. I wish to describe \nthem.\n  The provision provides the time and the flexibility needed for \nautomakers, we believe, to meet these standards. This is where Detroit \ndoes not listen. We believe--we sincerely believe--it creates a level \nplaying field for all automakers. Let me describe how.\n  Under the existing CAFE system, each automaker must meet a 27.5 \nmiles-per-gallon standard for their particular fleet of cars. This \ncurrent system disadvantages American companies that build larger cars \nwith lower gas mileage. So we admit the present system disadvantages \nAmerican automobile makers.\n  But under the newly proposed system contained in this bill, the \nNational Highway Transportation Safety Administration would have broad \ndiscretion to divide vehicles into classes based on their attributes, \nsuch as size. So a small car in a small-car class is evaluated against \nother small cars--not a small car evaluated against a Navigator or a \nCadillac but class-by-class evaluations. This requirement would no \nlonger apply to each automaker. This is additional flexibility. \nDifferent automakers will meet different standards, depending upon the \nmix of cars they choose to make.\n  From 2011 to 2019, the National Highway Transportation Safety \nAdministration must set fuel economy standards that are the maximum \nfeasible\n\n[[Page S7514]]\n\nand ratchet these standards up at a reasonable rate.\n  By 2020, the total average must meet the 35 miles per gallon--the \ntotal average. Some cars will be below it, and some will be above it--\nas long as the total average meets the standard. This gives Detroit the \nflexibility they say they need. I do not know why they will not \nunderstand it.\n  This effectively gives the automakers 13 years to get the job done, \nand it means fuel economy will increase across all classes--from the \nsmallest sedans to the largest SUVs. It may be different by the class, \nbut, nonetheless, it would increase, so that the average fuel economy \nwould be 35 miles per gallon. At the same time, the measure establishes \na credit trading program under the direction of the National Highway \nTransportation Safety Administration, known as NHTSA. NHTSA would \ndesign, run, and operate this credit trading program.\n  The provision was strongly recommended by the National Academy of \nSciences in 2002. It would give an automaker a financial incentive to \nexceed the standards. If it does, it could sell credits to another \nautomaker and profit from having a more fuel-efficient fleet. So that \nan automaker that makes a car that attains 37 miles a gallon can sell \nthat differential to someone who cannot quite make it.\n  It would also allow the banking of these credits for up to 5 years--\ninsurance if a company falls below the standard in a later year. If an \nautomaker cannot meet the standards in a given year, they can purchase \nthese credits, use bank credits, or borrow from projected surpluses \nfrom future years. So the bottom line is this is a practical, workable \nsystem which ensures substantial increases in fuel efficiency. Quite \nfrankly, it is a major improvement over the current system, which has a \nmuch more rigid approach.\n\n  I want to say something. In all the time I have been working on this \nlegislation, nobody from the automaker community has ever come to me to \nsay: Look, we like this, but we don't like this. If you just changed it \nthis way, it would appeal to us.\n  We have bent over backward to try to accommodate a bill to meet what \nfor the past years--every time this comes up on the floor, I hear them \nargue: You can't evaluate small cars against big cars. Well, we don't \ndo that in this bill.\n  Another thing we have done--and this was pursuant to Senator Stevens' \nrequest and interest in the committee--this measure provides an off-\nramp in 2020 in the unlikely event that there are substantial \nunforeseen costs.\n  The measure would give NHTSA the authority to set a standard lower or \nhigher than the 35 miles per gallon in 2020. The authority could be \ninvoked only if a thorough review of the costs of putting new \ntechnologies in our automotive fleet exceeds the agency's best estimate \nof the value to the Nation of setting the standard at this level. So \nthat is the off-ramp. There can be an evaluation, a kind of cost-\nbenefit look at the situation, and there would have to be clear and \nconvincing evidence that the costs exceed the benefits. Obviously, we \nwanted to make it somewhat difficult--not a rollover so everybody could \nget out of it--somewhat difficult.\n  NHTSA would have to take into consideration billions of dollars in \nfuel savings, national security implications of reducing our dependence \non foreign oil, the effect of global warming and air pollution, and, on \nthe other side of the scale, additional costs to manufacturers and \nconsumers. Given all of the clear and meaningful benefits, we believe \nautomakers can and will be able to meet these standards, actually with \nlittle difficulty, but the provisions give NHTSA discretion in the \nevent it becomes clear automakers cannot meet the standards down the \nroad.\n  So that is what the bill does. The fact is, this legislation is past \ndue. Our Nation has seen gas prices skyrocket over the past 5 years. It \nnow costs $50, $60, or $70 to fill up a tank with gas. In my State of \nCalifornia, this is a big deal. People often have to use at least 2 \ntankfuls of gasoline, so instead of a tank at $20, if it is a tank at \n$70, instead of 4 times 20, which is $80, it is 4 times $70, just to \ndrive to work.\n  In the long term, a key to reducing gas prices is to reduce demand \nfor gasoline. By increasing fuel efficiency, we can reduce consumption \nand thereby reduce demand. Americans understand this. That is why, in \npoll after poll, the American people overwhelmingly support increased \nfuel efficiency. A poll published in April of this year by the New York \nTimes and CBS shows that more than 90 percent of Americans favor \nlegislation for acquiring more fuel efficient vehicles. Ninety percent. \nThat is amazing. People want more fuel-efficient vehicles. A poll \ncommissioned by the National Environmental Trust shows that more than \n80 percent of truck owners favor higher fuel economy standards. That \nwas done between April 28 and May 1 of this year. These results are \nconsistent all across ideologic and geographic divides. Simply put, \nAmericans by large majorities want improved mileage on their \nautomobiles.\n  Now, some question whether the standards in this legislation are \nachievable. You have only to look at what other nations are doing to \nsee that, in fact, they are. Canada has proposed raising its fuel \neconomy standard to 32 miles per gallon by 2010--32 miles per gallon by \n2010. Australia's fuel efficiency averages 29 miles per gallon and is \nexpected to rise to 34 miles per gallon by 2010. Europe's fuel \nefficiency currently exceeds 40 miles per gallon, and that is expected \nto increase over the next few years. Japan's fuel efficiency averages \n46.3 miles per gallon and is expected to rise to 48 miles per gallon by \n2010. Even China will have a new vehicle fleet averaging 37 miles per \ngallon--not in 10 years, not in 5 years, but next year. So these \nstandards have to be met by American automobile manufacturers \nmanufacturing in China next year. They will have to meet 37 miles per \ngallon.\n  In the United States, it is 25 miles per gallon. This is really \nunacceptable. These higher standards are being met abroad by the same \nautomakers who claim it is impossible to do it here in the United \nStates. This includes BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Ford, General Motors, \nPorsche, Volkswagen, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Subaru, and Toyota. All have \nagreed to push fuel economy well above 40 miles per gallon in Europe \nbut say they cannot achieve these standards in the United States. Does \nthat make sense to anybody in this body? I think not. Does it make \nsense to anyone in America? I think not.\n  Now, also, the simple truth is that the technology exists to achieve \na 35-mile-per-gallon standard by 2020. Existing technology can do it. \nSo as Detroit complains it can't do this or it can't do that, the \nNational Academy of Sciences says it can.\n  This is what they tell us:\n\n       We can increase the fuel economy--\n\n  This is what they say can be done, the National Academy of Sciences--\n\n     of mid-sized SUVs to 34 miles per gallon with existing \n     technology, large cars to 39 miles per gallon with existing \n     technology, minivans to nearly 37 miles per gallon with \n     existing technology, and large pickups to nearly 30 miles per \n     gallon with existing technology. When you average all of this \n     together, you will find that the fleet could achieve 37 miles \n     per gallon, 2 miles more than this measure envisions.\n\n  This is a conservative estimate. The National Academy of Sciences \nstudy measured cost-effectiveness based on $1.50 per gallon as opposed \nto today's $3 per gallon. So now you can see how conservative it is. \nThe academy didn't consider hybrids and other emerging technologies \nsuch as the popular Toyota Prius, just the standard American \nautomobiles. So it is quite possible that even greater increases in \nfuel economy could be achieved.\n  Now, how can this all be done? By using existing technology and \nsimple design improvements. Let me give my colleagues some of the \nthings for which the technology already exists: better aerodynamics, \nalternater improvements, engine friction reduction, using more \nefficient transmissions, electric power steering, electric water pump, \nreduced engine friction, and using only engine cylinders that are \nnecessary. These changes still could be made to great effect.\n\n  A 2006 study by the Canadian Government concluded that the cost-\neffective technologies identified by the 2002 National Academy of \nSciences report remain available and more cost-effective than ever. Our \ncurrent fleet is more powerful, accelerates more quickly, and brakes \nmore effectively. But with all of these advances, there is one critical \ndesign feature we have not improved at all in 25 years: Today's cars \nget the lowest number of miles to the\n\n[[Page S7515]]\n\ngallon since 1988. That is 20 years ago--the lowest number of miles to \nthe gallon since 1988. This has to change.\n  I would say to all of those who want to fight this because they think \nit is too strong and because Detroit objects to it that the handwriting \nhas been on the wall for a long time and Detroit has not come in and \nmade a suggestion. All of this scientific evidence indicates that \nDetroit can meet these standards, that the technology exists to meet \nthese standards, that they are doing it in other countries but for some \nreason they have buffaloed the Congress of the United States into \nbelieving you can do it in China, you can do it in Europe, but you \ncan't do it in the greatest economic power on Earth--the United States \nof America.\n  Some also say we can't increase fuel economy without reducing safety, \nbut this also is simply not true. A recent study by groups, including \nthe International Council on Clean Transportation, has concluded that \nno tradeoff--no tradeoff--is required between fuel economy and vehicle \nsafety. The conclusion of this report is consistent with the conclusion \nof numerous other studies. Let me quote directly from the report:\n\n       Vehicle fuel economy can be increased without affecting \n     safety, and vice versa.\n\n  That is on page 2 of their report.\n\n       Advanced materials allow vehicles to be both bigger and \n     lighter, providing multiple ways to improve safety and fuel \n     economy without sacrificing functionality. Fuel economy can \n     be dramatically improved without compromising safety. Safety \n     can be bolstered without sacrificing fuel economy.\n\n  That is on page 17 of their study.\n  There is technology in place today to be used to increase safety \nwithout sacrificing fuel economy. Let me just give my colleagues a few \nexamples: seatbelt reminders, window curtain airbags, lower bumpers, \nelectronic stability control, improved body structure, seatbelts that \ntighten if a vehicle were to roll over. It seems to me that is such a \nsimple thing, that if automobile manufacturers wanted to improve \nsafety, they would do that.\n  We saw what happened to a former colleague of ours who was not \nwearing a seatbelt. Nobody can challenge that seatbelts don't make one \nof the biggest safety improvements in the history of the automobile. \nWhen the Governor's crash took place, everybody else essentially was OK \nin the car except for Governor Corzine, and he didn't have his seatbelt \non. If anything is clear evidence of the safety of seatbelts, this is \nit. So safety can be improved without an effect on fuel economy.\n  This legislation includes a provision that will help improve safety. \nIt directs the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration to \nissue a rule that seeks to reduce incompatibility between SUVs and \npassenger vehicles. This could be done through measures which ensure \nthat bumpers hit bumpers in the event of an accident. I just saw this \ncoming to work today, where a Sedan had rear-ended an SUV, and you saw \nthe difference because of the inequality of the bumpers. This happened \njust a few blocks away.\n  In response to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Ford assembly plant \nin Richmond, CA, switched from making cars to assembling Jeeps, tanks, \nand armored cars. By July 1942, just 6 months after the bombing, the \nRichmond Tank Depot and the women who worked there were supplying our \nArmed Forces with the best military hardware in the world.\n  Technology, paired with American ingenuity and hard work, helped us \nprevail in that struggle and has been a key ingredient of America's \nunprecedented wealth and security.\n  Today, we face a much different threat. It is the threat of our \nNation's addiction to fossil fuels--to oil--and what that will do to \nour economy, to our environment, and to our foreign policy if we don't \nchange our ways.\n  These are serious questions and they deserve a serious response. \nIncreasing fuel economy is not a silver bullet. I am the first one to \nsay that. It won't solve problems by itself. However, it is a major \npiece of the puzzle. We have the best universities in the world, the \nstrongest financial system, and the best workers. We can do this. We \ncan make these improvements. We can lead the way. We have only to find \nthe political will.\n  I am very proud the bill before us now contains this legislation. I \nbelieve, as I have tried to describe--and I apologize for the length of \nthis statement--that it is compatible with the needs of Detroit; that \nthe legislation is drafted to respond to those needs by the class-to-\nclass comparison, to avoid what always has been in every discussion on \nthis floor the greatest threat to Detroit, which is to compare a small \ncar to a large car and, therefore, make it difficult for them to \nmanufacture large cars. This will not do that. I hope it will be voted \non.\n  I very much thank the Chair. I know Senator Snowe was going to come \nto the floor and, hopefully, she will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1505 to Amendment No. 1502\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I call up amendment 1505 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1505.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I want to explain this amendment, but \nfirst I will yield to the distinguished ranking member of the \ncommittee, the senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I thank Senator Inhofe for yielding to \nme. I am going to take a very few minutes. I have not had a second \nround on this. I assume both of us will. I have to leave the floor \nshortly for another meeting. I will stay here up to the last minute. I \nwant to make a couple statements about the bill, as introduced, and \nwhat it does in terms of the transportation, gasoline, and diesel \nconsumption in the country.\n  We have just had the Senator from California explain an amendment \nthat is no longer an amendment; it is in this bill. The Senator \nexpressed in a very profound way, in a very lengthy explanation, this \nprovision which the Senator from California originated. But we must \nunderstand that, today, it comes to us from the Commerce Committee, \nwherein the Feinstein proposal is encapsulated in the bill that was \nmanaged in committee by Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens.\n  I believe Senator Feinstein would join us in giving our appreciation \nand thanks to the Commerce Committee for the courage they showed. They \nmet to try to help us put together a bill that would address the energy \nproblems of our country and, obviously, immediately we ran into \nprovisions of the law, or matters of law, that had to be changed, which \nwere not part of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  The big one out there is what do we do about CAFE standards. What \nhappened before is we had a big hoopla on that, and we will probably \nstill have it, so the Senator from California ought to be ready. \nObviously, even though she did not amend, it is in the bill. Those who \ndon't like it will offer an amendment to the bill striking or modifying \nthat provision of the CAFE standards of America that is in the bill.\n  Over all these years, we have been going back and forth, never \ngetting anything done--until this year. Clearly, this bill before us, \nwhich took the CAFE standards and finally said we are going to adopt \nthe changes recommended in the Feinstein bill, which have been bantered \naround--we are going to adopt it in the language of the Commerce \nCommittee and send it over to the leader, and it will be incorporated \nin the bill. So when the bill comes over, it has whatever was done in \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee, to save our consumption of \ngasoline and related products. It has the CAFE standards and a couple \nof other provisions. I want to say that I believe the bill before us \nincludes the CAFE standards we have spoken of, which were put in the \nbill by the Commerce Committee, headed by Senators Stevens and Inouye.\n  In addition to that, which is by itself one of the biggest \nmodifications of our\n\n[[Page S7516]]\n\ngasoline usage in this country and, obviously, it has a ways to go \nbecause it might not clear the Senate later today, or tomorrow, or \nwhenever we figure out that the Senators who want their amendments \nfinally come up. But as before us, this is the largest transportation \nsavings of fuel in history. CAFE standards all by themselves would have \nbeen a very big achievement. Everybody knows that. That is in the bill. \nSo there is one.\n  Secondly, we adopted just about what the President spoke of in his \nState of the Union Address with reference to biofuels and a new \nstandard for those set forth in the 2005 Energy bill; that is, the big \nbill. We started down the path of biofuels, but all we had in there was \ncorn-produced biofuels. What we have done in this bill is mandated 21 \nbillion gallons which has to come from cellulosic ethanol by 2022. So \nthe total biofuel required in our bill is 36 billion gallons. Let's \nhope--I think it will--that we will produce the little, tiny, remaining \ntechnology breakthrough, which we are putting everything in, and if \nthat works, we will be on our way to the breakthrough that will permit \nus to use the cellulosic ethanol I have been speaking of. That will \npermit us to reach this new high standard of 36 billion gallons.\n\n  Remember, we get the CAFE standards, which have been explained, which \nreduce the amount of gas and diesel used, and then we have this \ngigantic breakthrough that we expect, and this tremendous amount of \nfuel that will come from biomass, which I stated to you was 36 billion \ngallons. Then this bill has a giant set of mandated efficiencies, \nincreases in efficiencies, the biggest we have ever had. In fact, $12 \nbillion will be saved by our consumers from the efficiency provisions, \nthe big items you buy at your hardware store or big chain store, the \nitems you use in your kitchen and that you wash your clothes with--\nthose big items have the new efficiency standards, and we have been \ntoying with them for years. Senator Bingaman has been trying to get \nthem done. They are in this bill.\n  People might still take them out in the next week, but I don't think \nso. I think this bill will stay as it is. It is bipartisan. The \nprovisions I am talking about, so far, came out of the Committee \nbipartisan. CAFE did not come out of our committee, but it came out of \nCommerce bipartisan, with a very huge majority.\n  I am pleased that right away when we finish that, we get on with the \nnext thing the bill ought to have in it, and that is some new \nproduction. That brings the Senator from Oklahoma in, who has been for \na long time trying to get us to do something about the refining \nsituation in our country. I am not even totally familiar with the \nSenator's amendment. He has given it to us and submitted it to the \nSenate. Senator Bingaman and his staff are looking at it. We will be \nlooking at it. I don't know when we will vote on it. With his \npermission, I assumed he would not be upset if we set it aside and go \non to some other work and then call it up in due course in the Senate. \nWe will do that after the Senator is finished. We don't think we are \ngoing to vote on it right away because we have to study it, and the \nSenator would not have wanted it otherwise. Senator Bingaman wants to \nlook at it.\n  There is another matter that was also in this Commerce bill. It has \nbeen packaged. We have Energy matters, Commerce matters, and I note \nthat Senator Cantwell is standing on the floor. She had something to do \nwith an amendment in the Commerce Committee that has to do with trying \nto--if there is gouging taking place out there in the hinterland of \nAmerica, this amendment she and I will talk about when we are finished \nwith Senator Inhofe's amendment will tell everybody what is in the bill \nabout antigouging that the distinguished Senator worked on. It is \nmostly hers. Others might have added something, but we will talk about \nit, so that we put together what will be the package we can all \nunderstand--that is, the Energy and Commerce package, plus whatever \nelse came in through the Environment and Public Works Committee--a \nsmaller portion. Put all that together and it is a pretty good bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nhaving given me a chance to speak.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, reclaiming my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I appreciate having had the opportunity \nto yield to the Senator from New Mexico for his explanation. I think it \nis very important that we understand there are a lot of good things we \nare looking at in this bill. But he so accurately points out that the \nbig problem we have today--not 10 years from now--is supply. We need to \ndo something about the supply. The bill doesn't adequately address \nthat.\n  The amendment I have called up, No. 1505, is essentially the same \namendment we considered in my Environment and Public Works Committee \nduring the years I served as chairman. It is one of these things where \nit is very difficult to figure out why anyone could vote against it, \nbecause it is permissive, it allows States to do things; it doesn't \nmandate.\n  I was pleased to hear the majority leader recognizing that the United \nStates has become too reliant on foreign sources of energy. \nUnfortunately, the majority's bill presently doesn't improve the \nsituation. Indeed, it could actually worsen it. The fact is that \nAmericans are paying more at the pump because we don't have the \ndomestic capacity to refine the fuels consumers demand. So we are \ntalking about two ways to resolve the problem of supply. One is \nproduction, and the other is you can have all the production in the \nworld, but if you don't have the refining capacity, you cannot get it \nrefined and into use.\n  Some Members' answer is more hybrids than SUVs, but that ignores the \nprofound impact high fuel prices have on our economy. According to the \nDepartment of Labor's recent numbers, about 3 percent of the Nation's \ninflation is directly attributed to high fuel prices. That means \nwhether your constituent drives a gas guzzler, a hybrid, rides a \nbicycle, or walks, they are paying the same for high fuel prices.\n  In order to lower those prices, we have two options. We can increase \nthe capacity at home or import more from abroad. The LA Times wrote in \nMay 25, 2007, that ``gas supplies are tight because the United States \nlacks refining capacity, and every time a refinery shuts down for \nmaintenance, or because of an accident, prices rise. Americans are \nstarving for affordable energy, and the majority's bill tells them to \ngo on a diet. That is good. We want to have these things to help with \nour consumption. But the Energy bill really does nothing today in terms \nof taking care of the supply problem we have.\n\n  The good news is it is not too late to do something to improve the \nsituation. It is in that good faith to improve the energy security \nposition of our country that we are offering the Gas Price Act. The \nlack of domestic refining capacity is not new to many Members, the \npublic, or even to the Federal Reserve. In May of 2005, Chairman Alan \nGreenspan stated:\n\n       The status of world refining capacity has become worrisome \n     and the industry is straining to meet markets which are \n     increasingly dominated by transportation fuels that must meet \n     ever more stringent environmental requirements.\n\n  While chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I \nheld a series of hearings to look into this issue. The very same month \nI held one of those hearings, the senior Senator from California, who \nwas on the Senate floor speaking a moment ago, Mrs. Feinstein, made \nthis statement in a letter to the Governor of California. It says:\n\n       I can see where the cumbersome permitting process, with \n     uncertain outcomes, would make it difficult to plan and \n     implement projects . . . I encourage you to improve the speed \n     and predictability of the permitting process, and believe \n     that this will allow business and government to focus on \n     their limited resources on actions that most benefit the \n     environment.\n\n  That is the statement Senator Feinstein made in a letter to Governor \nSchwarzenegger. I wholeheartedly agree with that statement.\n  The amendment that Senator Thune and I are offering today will \nimprove the energy security of the United States, and it will do so in \ncomplete compliance with environmental laws and in concert with State \ninterests.\n  In her letter to Governor Schwarzenegger, the senior Senator\n\n[[Page S7517]]\n\nfrom California was correct in recognizing much of the permitting \ndecisions are by States and not by the Federal Government. That is why \nwe work very hard to recognize the importance of State and local groups \nin making those decisions.\n  The Environmental Council of States, which represents State \ndepartments of environmental quality, said as much. Keep in mind, this \nis the council that represents all the different State departments of \nenvironmental quality, as well as noting that the Gas Price Act does \nnot weaken the environmental laws.\n  Similarly, the National Association of Counties stated:\n\n       It goes a long way in addressing the concerns of local \n     governments during a refinery siting, ranging from the \n     importance of considering local needs, concerns, and honoring \n     a county's land use authority.\n\n  It is important to point this out because it seems that time and time \nagain, some of the Members of this body hide behind the vague concerns \nover the environment in defending their failure to improve U.S. energy \nsecurity. After working with a variety of stakeholders, this bill \nachieves both goals. It increases energy while preserving local \ngovernments and environmental quality.\n  The fact is, like it or not, the United States needs to increase its \ndomestic refining capacity if we are to solve the economic struggles \nfacing every family.\n  The amendment we are offering today redefines and broadens our \nunderstanding of a refinery to be a domestic fuels facility. Oil has \nand will continue to have a role in the U.S. economy, but the future of \nour domestic transportation fuel system must also include new sources, \nsuch as the ultraclean synfuels derived from coal and cellulosic \nethanol derived from homegrown grasses and biomass.\n  Expanding the existing domestic fuels facilities or constructing new \nones is a maze of environmental permitting challenges. This is what the \nSenator from California was talking about a few minutes ago in trying \nto encourage Governor Schwarzenegger to streamline this permitting \nprocess.\n  This amendment provides a Governor with the option of requiring the \nFederal EPA to provide the State with financial and technical resources \nto accomplish the job and establishes a certain permitting process for \nall parties. The public demands increasing supplies for transportation \nfuel, but they also expect that fuel to be good for their health and \nfor the environment.\n  To that end, the amendment requires the EPA to establish a \ndemonstration to assess the use of Fischer-Tropsch diesel and jet fuel \nas an emission-control strategy. Initial tests found that Fischer-\nTropsch diesel significantly reduces criterion pollutants over \nconventional fuels and could easily be transported with existing \ninfrastructure.\n  It should be noted that the ongoing tests at Tinker Air Force Base in \nmy home State of Oklahoma found that Fischer-Tropsch, or coal-to-liquid \naircraft fuel, reduced particulates 47 to 90 percent and completely \neliminated the SOX emissions over fuels that are used today.\n\n  I might add, this is a technology that is here. It needs to be \nimproved upon. We are currently flying a B-52 that has eight engines \nusing this type of fuel.\n  Good concepts in Washington are bad ideas if no one wants them at \nhome. As a former mayor of Tulsa, I am a strong believer in local and \nState control. This is something that is controversial in Washington. \nThere are a lot of people in this body who don't think any decision is \na good decision unless it is made in Washington. I am the opposite. I \nfeel closer to the people. They should be more involved, and that is \nwhy we structured it the way we did.\n  The Federal Government should provide incentives rather than mandates \non local communities. Increasing clean domestic fuel supplies is in the \nNation's security interest, but those facilities can also provide high-\npaying jobs to people in towns in need.\n  Our amendment provides financial incentives to the two most \neconomically distressed communities in the Nation, towns affected by \nBRAC and Indian tribes, to consider building both liquids and \ncommercial scale cellulosic ethanol facilities. Here we are talking \nabout people who have gone through the BRAC process, people who have in \ntheir States facilities that were military facilities that were closed \nduring the base realignment and closure process.\n  I am very proud my State of Oklahoma is the leader in the development \nof the energy crops for cellulosic biofuel. The key now is to promote \ninvestment, and nothing would speed the rapid expansion of the \ncellulosic biofuels industry more than investments by the Nation's \ntraditional providers of liquid transportation fuels.\n  We have in the State of Oklahoma the Noble Foundation, Oklahoma State \nUniversity, and Oklahoma University--all very much involved in the \ndevelopment of cellulosic biofuels. It is a technology that is coming. \nWe know it is. I guess what we need to do is understand, while it is \ncoming, we still need to run this great machine called America.\n  Many integrated oil companies have formed and substantially expanded \ntheir biofuels divisions within the past year to prepare for the \neventuality of cross-competitive cellulosity biofuels. Oil companies \ninvest in exploration because their stock prices are affected by their \ndeclared proven reserves. Creating a definition of renewable reserves \nwould create a similar incentive for them to invest in cellulosic \nbiofuels.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 directed the Department of Energy to \naccelerate the commercial development of oil shale and tar sands. Given \nthe country's interest in developing renewable alternatives to fossil \nfuel, it is logical that the SEC would develop criteria in cooperation \nwith biomass feedstock sources in its hierarchy at the same time.\n  This is Congress's least expensive way to jump-start the cellulosic \nbiofuels industry. Increasing capacity to produce clean fuels at home \nis critical in making America more secure. Passing the Gas Price Act \nwould be a material and substantive action toward this majority's \nstated goal of energy independence. To vote against it underscores \nsomething altogether. They like higher gas prices at the pump.\n  What we are talking about is something that is permissive. It allows \nStates to opt out, if they want, and it streamlines the permitting \nprocess. It requires EPA to establish a demonstration to assess the use \nof Fischer-Tropsch diesel and jet fuels. It will help in our refining \ncapacity, if we are talking about refineries for petroleum or \nrefineries for biofuels or any other kinds of refineries.\n  To have a comprehensive Energy bill, we need to do what we have done, \nwhat we have already done in this bill, but the problem is here today, \nas was pointed out by the Senator from New Mexico. We have a supply \nproblem, and that supply problem is here and now. The gas price \namendment to expand our refining capacity would dramatically and \nimmediately relieve that problem.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Again, there are two supply problems--one in production \nand one in refining capacity.\n  I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I told Senator Bingaman that I have to \nleave the floor for about 20 to 25 minutes, and I need somebody here.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will be happy to do it. Let me repeat what I told \nSenator Bingaman privately. I have no intention of bringing up this \namendment for a vote now. We will set this amendment aside for other \namendments and then hopefully we will have several lined up tomorrow. I \nthink tomorrow we will start these votes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is what I wanted to tell the Senator. Madam \nPresident, can the Senator from Oklahoma stay in my stead?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I will stay in his stead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I know there are others waiting to \nspeak. I don't want to delay the proceedings greatly, but I do have \nsome concerns. I would like to ask a couple of questions of the \namendment sponsor, if I can.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me for a question?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes, I am glad to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Because there is so much concern about this amendment\n\n[[Page S7518]]\n\nfrom within this committee and others, I would like to have a vote on \nthis amendment. I don't want to take a lot of time. But I am wondering \nif my friend will propound some type of unanimous consent request so \nthat the Senators on the floor can respond to the presentation by \nSenator Inhofe, but then give him time. I just think it might make for \na more even flow.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me respond. I think the simpler \nthing would be to have the Senator from California, who is the chair of \nthe committee of jurisdiction, go ahead with any statement she wants, \nand I will withhold my questions at this point. I know there are others \nwishing to talk about CAFE standards.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has indicated a willingness to set his \namendment aside. He is not pushing for a vote at this time. Why doesn't \nthe Senator from California go ahead and speak in response to the \namendment at this point, and then perhaps we can have the other \nSenators who want to talk about CAFE standards talk about that issue, \nand we will see what other amendments we can also line up.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, of course, I support Senator Inhofe's \nright to offer this amendment, but, to me, it is a disastrous amendment \nbecause it is a taxpayer giveaway to the oil companies. And I will \nexplain why it is a total taxpayer giveaway to the oil companies that \nare making more money now than ever in history.\n  It doesn't do one thing to expand energy supply--not one thing. It \nshortcuts many environmental laws, which I will not go into at this \ntime, but if we get further time, I will do that. It shortcuts many \nenvironmental laws that protect the air quality which is so important \nto our families. In California, 9,900 people every year die of \nparticulate matter in their lungs. We cannot afford to say we are going \nto forget about air quality. That is a disaster. We don't want to \nbecome a China where they don't care about their people and their \npeople suffer. We don't want to go there.\n  In the Energy bill in 2005, oil companies got a huge break, and it \nwas made very attractive for them to open new refineries. My staff \ninforms me that not one company has taken advantage of this break. So \nthere is nothing that I think suggests that even going as far as \nSenator Inhofe goes, which is a total giveaway, will result in \nincreased energy supply.\n  This bill never made it out of our committee when the Senator was \nchairman. It was never offered in the committee since I have been \nchairman. And if it were to be offered, it would go down.\n  Let me tell a story about Bakersfield, CA, where Shell Oil owned a \nrefinery. We were all saying how important it was to continue the \nproduction of gasoline. In California, 2 percent of our gasoline supply \ncame from this particular refinery.\n  Guess what. Shell Oil announces they are shutting down the refinery.\n  We were stunned, and we said: Why?\n  They said: We are not making a profit.\n  Guess what we found out. They were making a huge profit.\n  Then they said: We can't find a buyer.\n  We said: Really?\n  We went to the attorney general. We said: Can you help us?\n  He got involved. At that time, it was Bill Lockyer. Guess what. \nSomebody stepped forward to purchase the refinery.\n  Shell Oil wanted to shut down the refinery because they wanted to \nmanipulate the supply. It is as simple as that--more money in their \npocket, vertical integration. These are the people we want to reward \nwith the Inhofe amendment? I think not. I think quite the opposite. I \nthink we ought to agree to Senator Cantwell's antigouging amendment. I \nthink we would want automatic investigations by the FTC. That is what I \nthink we would need.\n  I wish to address some other aspects of this bill. As I understand \nit, there is an aspect of this bill which I want to make sure my \ncolleagues understand before they come to vote on it, if, in fact, we \nhave a vote. When I say this is a taxpayer giveaway, I mean what I say. \nThere are expedited permits, waiver of all kinds of environmental laws, \nthere is access to Federal lands, free. I say to my friend from New \nMexico, can you imagine any other industry that gets free access to \nFederal lands? Not only do they not have to pay for the land, but they \nget 88 percent of the costs of the refinery if they are on Federal land \nand 100 percent reimbursement if they are on Indian land. What a \nsituation--at a time when oil company profits are going through the \nroof and CEOs are coming before us and putting their heads down as we \nlook at the amount of bonuses they are getting--into the tens of \nmillions of dollars. This is the time to give them Federal land for \nrefineries, which they have shown they are not interested in building? \nWaive all environmental laws to the detriment of the health and safety \nof America's families? Reimburse them for 88 to 100 percent of the cost \nof building their plant? What a deal. If people vote for this, I have a \nlittle piece of land in a very rocky part of California I could sell \nyou. This makes no sense at this time.\n  I say to my colleagues, it is very important that we have supply. I \nam supporting this new fuels mandate. I see wonderful opportunities in \nthe area of cellulosics that I think are fantastic, very exciting. I am \nwilling to invest in research so we can use coal in a clean way. These \nthings are all exciting. This is an opportunity for business. We don't \nhave to give away the store to the oil companies to build these \nrefineries when, again, I have experience that tells me they are \nactually shutting down refineries.\n  In California, the case in point is the Shell oil refinery in \nBakersfield, one of the biggest scandals we had there, with nontruths \ncoming after nontruths.\n  ``We don't really want to close it down, but we have to because it is \nnot profitable.'' Oh, yes, it turned out it was profitable. They just \nwant to manipulate the supply.\n  ``We can't find a buyer, we are looking high and low and can't find a \nbuyer.'' In 3 weeks, the attorney general found them a buyer.\n  Here is the point about this Energy bill which Senator Bingaman is \nmanaging. It is the product of three or four different committees, and \nthe bills that are included in the majority leader's package are bills \nthat came out of committee. They have gone through the committee. They \nhave been debated, they have been discussed, and they have been voted \nout. This particular plan of my friend's--he has every right to offer \nhis amendment. I defend his right to offer it. But it never passed our \ncommittee even when the Republicans were in control. It certainly would \nnot pass out of committee today. It is a taxpayer giveaway with \nabsolutely no proof that refineries would be built.\n  I stand so strongly against this bill, on behalf of the American \ntaxpayer as well as in behalf of the American families who want their \nhealth protected and do not want us to waive every single environmental \nlaw that protects the quality of the air they breathe inside their \nbodies.\n  I yield the floor. I will be back to respond to the comments of my \ngood friend from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me respond.\n  I am not sure what bill the Senator from California is talking about. \nShe didn't really describe this bill at all. Let's go through very \nquickly her four points, if the Senator from California would like to \nlisten.\n  First of all, the EDA portion provides grants to local communities, \nnot oil companies. This is not grants going to oil companies. Maybe the \nSenator from California has not gotten emotional in experiencing what \nhas happened when there are BRAC closings and some of the bases have \nhad to close. But when that happens, the EDA does have the function, \nand the EDA in this case can provide grants if local communities apply \nfor these grants. If they do not want to apply for them, they do not \nhave to do it. The fund seeks to promote development of future fuels, \ncoal to liquids, cellulosic biomass, not just oil.\n  This is not the same amendment, I might add, as we tried to pass \nunsuccessfully by a one-vote margin in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee.\n  Second, this idea that there is a rollback in environmental laws--the \nassociation representing the environmental\n\n[[Page S7519]]\n\nconcerns of every State, the Environmental Council of States, clearly \nstates this will not do any such thing. Here is the Environmental \nCouncil of the States. Every State belongs to this, including \nCalifornia. It says in here:\n\n       This bill does not weaken the standards and allows each \n     State to choose its best course on most of the matters \n     detailed in the bill.\n\n  So there you have it. On this matter, the organization that \nrepresents all the environmental groups is strongly supporting this.\n\n  Will do nothing to increase energy independence? The reason the \nUnited States is vulnerable, in a vulnerable position, is because we \ndon't have an adequate supply to meet the demand. Supply--that is what \nI have been talking about since we started talking here. Reducing \ndemand is only one part of the equation. We want to reduce demand. We \nalso want to increase supply.\n  I would say probably the most damaging thing that has been stated by \nthe junior Senator--here is a quote by the senior Senator from \nCalifornia. When she talks about streamlining permitting, yes, that is \none of the big problems. So I used a quote by Senator Feinstein in a \nletter to Governor Schwarzenegger. I will read it again because I think \nmaybe the junior Senator wasn't in the Chamber when I talked about \nthis. This is a quote out of the letter:\n\n       I can see where a cumbersome permitting process, with \n     uncertain outcomes, would make it difficult to plan and \n     implement projects . . . I encourage you to improve the speed \n     and predictability of the permitting process, and believe \n     that this will allow business and government to focus their \n     limited resources on actions that most benefit the \n     environment.\n\n  That is exactly what we want to do. That is a very acute observation \nby the senior Senator from California.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I was not aware that Senator Feinstein \nwas supporting your amendment. Is that what you are suggesting?\n  Mr. INHOFE. This is a quote. Would you like me to read it again?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like you to read it again.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will read it again.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would really like that because you are implying that \nshe supports your amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, no; I am saying she is concerned about the permitting \nprocess.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We all are. That doesn't mean we support your amendment. \nGo ahead, read it again.\n  Mr. INHOFE. ``I can see where a cumbersome permitting process, with \nuncertain outcomes, would make it difficult to plan and implement \nprojects . . . I encourage you to improve the speed and predictability \nof the permitting process, and believe that this will allow business \nand government to focus their limited resources on actions that most \nbenefit the environment.''\n  This is exactly what this bill does. We have a section in here that \nallows States, if they want to do it--and there is nothing wrong with \nallowing States to do what they see is in their best interests. I agree \nwith Senator Feinstein that this would allow States to overcome this \ncumbersome permitting process, as she states in her statement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, if I might say, I appreciate hearing \nthat. It has nothing to do with this particular amendment, which, \nbasically, is a giveaway to the energy companies at a time when they \nare making a fortune.\n  We have a Federal Clean Air Act. We have it for a reason: Air goes \nfrom one State to another, one region to another. That is what we have. \nIt is a Federal Clean Air Act. This was passed under Republican and \nDemocratic administrations, over and over again. This is what the \npeople want.\n  Do they want streamlining of permits? Yes. We all do. I was a county \nsupervisor. I did a lot of my work streamlining permits. That doesn't \nmean backing off on protecting the people you represent and making sure \nyou have an adequate timeframe to ascertain what are the pollutants \nthat are going to come out of the smokestacks here. What are the \ndiseases that could follow if these pollutants get into the lungs of \nthe people?\n  This is an amendment which hides behind the word ``streamlining.'' \nBut what it really does, it waives environmental laws.\n  Yes, I know a lot about this particular amendment. I have to say, the \nSenator from Oklahoma talks about these local redevelopment \nauthorities--you could have 10 people from oil companies on those \nredevelopment authorities. You could. So you cannot stand here and tell \nme this is protective of the public interest.\n  We have an amendment which has been offered as some kind of a fix to \nthe lack of refineries. You take a look at our refineries. I think the \nSenator from Washington is aware of this. They remind us a lot of the \nproblems we had with Enron. They keep taking power offline, shutting \ndown the refineries for so-called maintenance, at higher and higher \nlevels. And when Shell Oil had a chance to expand a refinery or keep it \ngoing, they chose to shut it down.\n  My friend doesn't think the refinery companies, I guess, are making \nenough money. They are making record profits. He wants to give them \nland for nothing. He says it goes to a redevelopment agency. Yet there \nis no protection for the public there. At the end of the day, these \ncompanies are getting it for free, whether they are getting it from the \nFederal Government directly to them or the Federal Government through a \nredevelopment agency. Environmental laws are waived. People in this \ncountry will not be protected. It is a backdoor way to repeal part of \nthe Clean Air Act at a time when people are dying of particulate \nmatter.\n  Now, if you are on Indian land, you get that land, and you get \nreimbursed 100 percent for the plant. So my friend can get up and say: \nI didn't read it. And he could read me a quote from my friend, Senator \nFeinstein, who, as far as I know, is not supporting his amendment. I \nmean, it is a very tricky thing. I can hold up a statement from Senator \nDomenici and say: Look at this statement.\n  I can hold up a statement from every Republican from a speech they \nmade saying how important it is that the people be protected from lung \ncancer. That has nothing to do with this amendment. It is a good \ndebating tactic, but at the end of the day this amendment failed in the \nEnvironment Committee when the Senator from Oklahoma had the gavel, and \nthis amendment would clearly have failed in the committee when I was \nholding the gavel.\n  So the fact is, what we are trying to do in this particular \nlegislation is gather around amendments that have been voted out of \ncommittee in a bipartisan fashion, that were not contentious, like this \none; that are not argumentative, like this one; and that are very \nunclear and are going in uncharted waters, like this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me respond again. The distinguished junior Senator \nfrom California can say over and over and over again as many times as \nshe wants that it is giving money to oil companies. It is not.\n  Specifically, the EDA portion provides grants to local communities if \nthey want them. If the local community doesn't want them, they don't \nhave to have them.\n  At this point in the Record I want to have printed a letter from the \nEDA that says:\n\n       No for-profit entity is eligible to receive EDA assistance.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         United States Department of Commerce, Economic \n           Development Administration,\n                                 Washington. DC, October 21, 2005.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Chair, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inhofe: This letter responds to the Committee \n     on Environment and Public Works' request on October 19, 2005 \n     for clarification on the Economic Development \n     Administration's (``EDA'') mission and entities that are \n     eligible to receive EDA assistance, as well as additional \n     information on EDA's past involvement in base realignment and \n     closure (``BRAC'') rounds.\n       EDA's mission is to lead the federal economic development \n     agenda by promoting innovation and competitiveness, preparing \n     American regions for growth and success in the worldwide \n     economy. To implement this mission, EDA is directed by its \n     authorizing statute, the Public Works and Economic \n     Development Act of 1965, as amended (``PWEDA''), to foster \n     economic growth by ``empowering local and regional \n     communities experiencing chronic high unemployment and low \n     per capita income to develop\n\n[[Page S7520]]\n\n     private sector business and attract increased private capital \n     investment'' (Section 2(a)(3)(C) of PWEDA).\n       EDA is authorized to provide assistance only to an \n     ``eligible recipient,'' as that term is defined in PWEDA. An \n     ``eligible recipient'' means a(n) (l) economic development \n     district; (2) Indian tribe; (3) State, including a special \n     purpose unit of a State or local government engaged in \n     economic or infrastructure development activities; (4) city \n     or other political subdivision of a State; (5) institution of \n     higher education; or (6) public or private non-profit \n     organization or association acting in cooperation with \n     officials of a political subdivision of a State (Section \n     3(4)(A) of PWEDA). No for-profit entity is eligible to \n     receive EDA assistance with one exception: EDA may provide a \n     grant to a for-profit entity under its Training, Research and \n     Technical Assistance program (Section 3(4)(B) of PWEDA). \n     However, this relatively small program is not applicable to \n     the provision of EDA assistance for the reuse of former \n     military installations.\n       For the most recent BRAC round, beginning in FY 1994, \n     Congress (Commerce-Justice-State appropriators) began adding \n     a Defense Economic Adjustment line item to EDA's annual \n     appropriations. In FY 1994, EDA received $80 million in \n     defense economic adjustment funding. The high-water mark of \n     this round came in FY 1995, with BRAC '95 underway, in which \n     EDA received an appropriation of $125 million in defense \n     economic adjustment funding that was subsequently slightly \n     reduced due to an across-the-board rescission that year. \n     Defense economic adjustment appropriations then slowly \n     declined through FY 2001. The table below depicts actual \n     EDA Defense Economic Adjustment appropriations (after any \n     rescissions or adjustments) for the most recent BRAC \n     round.\n\n \n            [Dollars in millions, after rescissions, if any]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Defense Economic\n                     Fiscal year                          Adjustment\n                                                         appropriation\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1994................................................               $80\n1995................................................               120\n1996................................................                90\n1997................................................                90\n1998................................................                89\n1999................................................                84.8\n2000................................................                77.3\n2001................................................                31.4\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Defense Economic Adjustment appropriations have been \n     allocated among EDA's six (6) regional offices based on a \n     variety of factors, including the number of major \n     installation closures located within the regional office's \n     designated region, the number of military and civilian \n     personnel dislocations resulting from base realignments, the \n     number of affected defense installation contractors (not \n     relevant to the current round), and the relative economic \n     distress level of the affected area.\n       Each fiscal year, EDA's regional offices have awarded \n     assistance to BRAC-affected communities based on the policies \n     and procedures in place at the time of each award. These \n     policies and procedures are published in the Federal Register \n     each year in EDA's Federal Funding Opportunity (``FFO'') \n     notice. The FFO also specifies EDA's Funding Priorities for \n     the funding available during that fiscal year. Funding \n     Priorities include such items as investing in transportation, \n     communications, or other sector-specific infrastructure \n     enhancements. In no instance has any one funding priority \n     utilized all of a regional office's defense economic \n     adjustment allocation. Rather, investments are made across \n     different priority areas based on the needs of the local and \n     regional economy.\n       EDA Defense Economic Adjustment investments made during the \n     most recent BRAC round, covering the period from FY 1994 \n     through FY 2001, are depicted in the enclosed tables. As \n     requested, the tables include the investment recipient, \n     location, EDA grant dollars, and jobs and private investment \n     realized when available.\n       Thank you for this opportunity to explain EDA's mission and \n     its policies and procedures related to BRAC, and to provide \n     additional information on EDA's past BRAC-related \n     investments.\n       If you have any additional questions, please do not \n     hesitate to contact David T. Murray, EDA's Director of \n     Intergovernmental Affairs, at (202) 482-2900.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Benjamin Erulkar,\n                                                    Chief Counsel.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Then, also, the permitting process is a small part of \nthis amendment, but it is a very important part. It is a part that we \nhave, subtitle A, about 4 pages, talking about trying to make the \npermitting process more streamlined. And that is where I used the \nstatement from Senator Feinstein, who certainly agrees when she says: I \ncan see where a cumbersome permitting process with uncertain outcomes \nwould make it difficult to plan and implement projects.\n  Well, that is just one of the many things that we are trying to \ncorrect with this bill. Again, I have responded to all of the other \nstatements that were made. I would repeat in terms of the environment, \nI am going to go ahead and submit for the Record at this point, along \nwith the letter on the EDAs, a letter from the Environmental Council of \nthe States, when they state very specifically: The bill does not weaken \nthe standards and allows each State to choose its best course for most \nmatters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Environmental Council\n\n\n                                                of the States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 25, 2005.\n     Re S. 1772 Gas PRICE Act.\n\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Environment and Public \n         Works, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inhofe and Senator Jeffords: I am writing to \n     provide comments on behalf of the Environmental Council of \n     the States (ECOS) on the above bill. ECOS is the national, \n     non-partisan association of the States' environmental agency \n     leadership.\n       We appreciate the Senate's desire to address the \n     shortcomings of the nation's refinery processes exposed by \n     the recent hurricanes and hope our comments assist you.\n       States implement most of the federal environmental statutes \n     on behalf of the federal government, including most programs \n     that regulate the nation's refmeries. These include the Clean \n     Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation \n     and Recovery Act. States issue most of the environmental \n     permits pursuant to these Acts, as well as conducting the \n     inspections, monitoring and enforcement.\n       While each State's opinions may vary over the details of \n     the bill, we can agree that the bill takes an approach that \n     we would like to see in more legislation. I speak here of the \n     ``opt-in'' feature.\n       In this approach, the Governor of each State decides \n     whether the benefits the bill provides are appropriate for \n     the State. This includes the streamlined permits approach, \n     the judicial review of such arrangements (Title II), and the \n     fuels waiver (Title IV). Some concern remains about the \n     special fuels provisions. We appreciate that within Title IV \n     a state would be held harmless under section 110 to account \n     for the emissions from a waiver granted by the Administrator \n     at the request of that State. We would not expect such \n     emissions to significantly contribute to another state's air \n     quality issues, but would note that the protection afforded \n     should be limited to that extent.\n       ECOS has long emphasized the need for the flexibility that \n     allows each State to tailor its environmental programs \n     according to its needs. This bill does not weaken the \n     standards and allows each State to choose its best course on \n     most of the matters detailed in the bill.\n       Our primary reservation is that the bill, if passed, not be \n     conferenced with the recent Gasoline Security Act of 2005, \n     passed by the House.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Stephanie Hallock,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think there is a basic, as I said before, problem in \ndisagreement on the floor of this body when there are a lot of people \nwho do not think that decisions, good decisions, are made unless they \nare made in Washington, DC.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I just have one last response. I don't \nknow how many of my colleagues ever sat on a redevelopment agency. I \nhappen to have done so when I was on county board of supervisors. And \nit is disingenuous to say it is the redevelopment agency that gets the \nbenefit. The redevelopment agency is the conduit to the private sector, \nand that is where the benefit goes.\n  Now, in many cases it is totally fine. When I sat on the \nredevelopment entity, it was because we had a very run-down part of our \ncounty that needed support. And so whatever it was we could give to \nthem, any benefit in the Tax Code, et cetera, that is what we did.\n  But how about this? The benefit goes to the particular businesses now \nthat are making record profits. I would tell you, the American people \nlooking at this debate are going to say: Why aren't you protecting us \nfrom price gouging like Senator Cantwell suggests? That is the bill \nthat is in the package, not this bill which essentially says we are \ntaking away clean air protection, we are going to have 50 different \nstandards here, 50 different permit processes. What a nightmare. We are \ngiving away the money of the taxpayers to the biggest corporations in \nAmerica that are making the most money ever--not only giving them the \nland but paying them back for all of their costs.\n\n[[Page S7521]]\n\n  To me, to put this in this package will doom this package. I just \nhope if and when this does come up for a vote, there will be a \nresounding no. It was voted down in the committee, and it ought to be \nvoted down on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I would observe that the junior Senator \nfrom California is not going to support my amendment. However, I would \nalso observe that you can't keep saying the same thing over and over \nand over again and make it true.\n  We have quoted the Environmental Council of the States. They all say \nthere is nothing in here that is going to be damaging to the \nenvironment. Anyway, it is my understanding that I am going to be \nwilling to set this aside for other amendments, so we can perhaps get \nin the queue and have several votes tomorrow, whenever the appropriate \ntime is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wanted to follow my colleague, Senator \nBoxer, to talk just a bit about the automobile efficiency standards \nthat are in this bill. I played a role in the Commerce Committee in \nhelping to write a portion of that.\n  Before I do that, let me say it is often the case that a piece of \nlegislation brought to the floor of the Senate dealing with an \nimportant issue is described as something that is very significant, \nearthshaking. And in most cases it does not turn out to be quite that \nsignificant.\n  My dad once told me: Never buy something from someone who is out of \nbreath. There is always kind of a breathless quality to reform packages \nthat are brought to the floor of the Senate. I must say, however, that \nI think what we have on the floor of the Senate, perhaps with some \namendments, is a significant change with respect to an issue that we \nshould address; that is, energy.\n  Let me talk about the automobile efficiency issues and the issues of \nrenewable fuels and renewable energy. Now, I noted that the OPEC \ncountries have weighed in the last few days. This is dated June 7. It \nsays: OPEC--that is the cartel--those are the countries that have \nformed a cartel. They produce a substantial portion of our country's \nenergy, the world's energy. About 40 percent of global oil production \ncomes from the eight OPEC countries.\n  Here is what OPEC says. OPEC, on Tuesday, warned Western countries \nthat their effort to develop biofuels as an alternative energy source \nto combat climate change risks driving the price of oil, ``through the \nroof.''\n  The Secretary General of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries said: The powerful cartel was considering cutting its \ninvestment in new oil production in response to moves by the developed \nworld to use more biofuels.\n  So let me say again what this is. This is the OPEC cartel, which, of \ncourse, would be illegal in our country, getting together and saying to \nthe United States: If you begin to produce more biofuels, ethanol and \nso on, we may well cut our production of oil, which would have the \ncapability of then putting upward pressure on oil and gas prices; \nalmost certainly it would do that. An interesting and I think also \ndisturbing message from the OPEC countries.\n  But this underscores why we need an Energy bill. I mean we are held \nhostage by a group of people sitting in a room, called OPEC ministers, \ndeciding how much they are going to produce, at what price they want to \nproduce it. They close the door, make judgments in secret in a secret \ncartel that would be illegal in this country. They say to us: Oh, by \nthe way, if you want to get out of this box that you are in, by \nproducing more of the energy yourself in the form of renewable fuels, \ngood luck. By the way, tough luck, because we may well decrease our own \nproduction.\n  Well, if I might just point out that this bill itself, it has some \ntitles. Let me read the titles of the bill. I am sure my colleagues \nhave done that: Title 1, Biofuels for Energy Security, it is a very \nimportant title; title 2, Energy Efficiency, there is substantial \nenergy to be gained in the efficiency standards; title 3, Carbon \nCapture, Storage, Research and Development; title 4, Cost-Effective, \nEnvironmentally Sustainable Public Buildings. All of this is important.\n  With respect to the biofuels, I was thinking as I was sitting here, \nabout a young guy who came up to me one night. He was about 21 years \nold. He came up to me at a community meeting in North Dakota and said: \nI just came in from the west coast. I drove a pickup truck from the \nwest coast on vegetable oil. He was fueling his pickup truck using \nvegetable oil.\n  Here is a kid that is working for alternative fuels groups out on the \nwest coast someplace with stars in their eyes and dreams about finding \nalternative fuels that work.\n  I said: Well, how does it work when you use vegetable oil?\n  He had modified his engine in his pickup truck and drove across the \nNorthern Tier using vegetable oil. He said: It worked great until they \ngot to Montana, by the way, no offense to the Montanans here. He said \nit worked great until we got to Montana when it got kind of cold. Then \nthe viscosity of that vegetable oil thickened up and they could not \nquite use it for a while.\n\n  But the point is, there are a lot of people doing inventive, \ninteresting, fascinating things fueling their vehicles, creating \nmodifications to vehicles. We are talking about creating a very \nsubstantial and aggressive standard for what are called biofuels, \nparticularly ethanol and cellulosic ethanol, and so on.\n  Now, my colleague from California talked about automobile efficiency, \nand the automobile efficiency standards that we have created. Let me \nmake the point first that there has been no change in 25 years to these \nstandards. None. I have actually been persuaded in years past by those \nwho say: Well, let's have NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic and \nSafety Administration within the Department of Transportation, develop \nthese new standards.\n  The fact is, that is an excuse for doing nothing. It is pretty \nevident to me now that nothing will happen if that is what we continue \nto do. So we, as a Congress, on a bipartisan basis, have said: We need \nmore efficiency with respect to our vehicles.\n  We use about 145 billion gallons of fuel a year in this country, 145 \nbillion gallons of fuel. If we blended every gallon with ethanol, that \nwould be a market of 14\\1/2\\ billion gallons of ethanol. We have \ncreated a renewable fuel standard of 7\\1/2\\ billion gallons of ethanol \nby 2012. I was one of the authors of that just a couple of years ago. \nWe are going to exceed that very quickly. We are probably at that level \nnow, and going to be at 10 billion gallons in 2 or 3 years.\n  So now we are going to go to 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels. \nThe OPEC countries say: Oh, this is awful. The roof is going to come \nin. We may decrease production of oil if you decide you are going to \nmove in another direction.\n  Even as we do that, believing that with 70 percent of the oil that we \nimport into this country being used in vehicles. And, understanding \nthen we must make the vehicles more efficient if we are going to become \nless dependent on the OPEC countries and less dependent on foreign \nsources of oil from whom we now get over 60 percent of our oil, then we \nhave a CAFE standard in this bill.\n  Now here is the result of the CAFE or the automobile efficiency \nstandard in my State's newspapers, and I assume others by the auto \nindustry. This is the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. They are \nputting full-page ads in the newspapers, and they are also doing direct \nmail to constituents: Say no to extreme fuel economy increases. Make \nsure you don't pass these increased automobile efficiency standards.\n  Well, that is what they have been saying for 25 years, and nothing \nhas changed. I have told this story repeatedly, and I will again \nbecause I think it is important. The first car I purchased as a young \nboy in high school was a 1924 Model T Ford for $25. It had been sitting \nin a grainery for decades. A guy sold it to me for $25. I spent 2 years \ntrying to get it to run.\n  I restored that old Model T Ford. What I discovered was you put \ngasoline in a 1924 Model T Ford exactly the\n\n[[Page S7522]]\n\nsame way you put gasoline in a 2007 Ford. Everything else about the \nvehicle has changed. Everything. There is more computing power in a \n2007 brand new car than there was on the lunar lander that put the \nastronauts on the moon. Everything about these vehicles has changed \nexcept you still have to stick a gas hose in the tank and start \npumping.\n  We did that in the 1924 model car, and you do it today in a 2007 \nmodel car. I would like to see us move and pole-vault to a new future. \nI happen to believe we ought to move to a hydrogen fuel cell future, \nwhere you have twice the efficiency of power to the wheel and put water \nout the tailpipe.\n  What a wonderful thing that would be. And hydrogen, of course, is \nubiquitous. It is everywhere. You can take wind energy, produce \nelectricity from the wind, use the electricity through the process of \nelectrolysis, separate hydrogen from water, store hydrogen for vehicle \ntransportation.\n  There are so many things we can do, but let's start, let's at least \nstart, with the current vehicle fleet, saying to the automakers that we \nintend and expect you to produce more efficient automobiles.\n  The CAFE standards we have created that are in this legislation are \ncalled ten-in-ten. It is not unreasonable to believe that we should \nexpect greater efficiency in these vehicles. Yes, we know the \nimprovements that have been made in vehicles: better cupholders, more \nadept sound systems, all of the wonderful things that come with all of \nthese new cars. But what about more efficiency? Nothing has changed.\n  A friend of mine looked at an identical vehicle they purchased 10 \nyears prior. They loved the vehicle. So 10 years later they are ready \nfor a new vehicle. They looked at the sticker on the window and \ndiscovered that in 10 years, the efficiency of that vehicle had not \nchanged by 1 mile per gallon, not 1.\n  That describes the failure. We ought to certainly expect better than \nthat.\n  Let me say also, in addition to supporting the automobile efficiency \nstandards we will be voting on--standards that are bipartisan, \nstandards that are reasonable, standards that have an off ramp so if \nthey are not achievable, the industry will not have to meet them--they \nwill have to demonstrate they are not capable scientifically of doing \nso.\n  In addition to that issue, which is so important, I wish to mention \nthe issue of fossil fuels. We are, in fact, going to use fossil fuels \nin our future--coal, oil, and natural gas. I am a big supporter of \nrenewable energy sources and renewable fuels. I believe that strongly. \nWhether it is wind, biomass, geothermal, renewable fuels, all of those \nare critically important. We will continue to use fossil fuels. It is \nimportant to me that we find ways to unlock opportunities to continue \nto use coal in a way that doesn't degrade the environment.\n  We have now finally come to an intersection. That intersection \nincludes energy policy and climate change. We need to find a way, \nthrough clean coal technology and other issues--I will be working on \nthat in the appropriations subcommittee which I chair--to continue to \nuse those resources, particularly coal.\n  My colleagues have included, with my support, the efficiency titles \nof this legislation which are very important. Everything we do every \nday, from turning on a light switch to using appliances, everything we \ndo every day and in every way uses energy. There are dramatic advances \nin lighting and dramatic savings to be had with respect to lighting \nstandards in this bill. We fought for a long while about an obscure \nterm called SEER 13 standards for air conditioners. We fought tooth and \nnail. The requirement for SEER 13 standards on air conditioners is very \nimportant and will require us to build fewer new energy plants because \nof the savings and the conservation that comes from that efficiency \nstandard.\n  There is a lot to commend in this legislation. The next important \nstep will be an amendment offered by Senator Bingaman that I will \ncosponsor with others called the renewable energy standard which will \nrequire 15 percent of our electric energy to come from renewable \nenergy. That is an important standard and one I hope the Congress will \nembrace and support.\n  I am going to be speaking on other amendments as well. I again \ncommend Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici. We have a good start. I \ncome from not only the Energy Committee but Senator Stevens and Senator \nInouye on the Commerce Committee on which I serve, Senator Boxer and \nSenator Inhofe and others who have worked on this legislation. We are \noff to a start that can be a very important policy change and a new \ndirection for the country in energy policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1508 to Amendment No. 1502\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, before the Senator from North Dakota \nleaves the floor, I would like to clarify something he said. He \nindicated his first car was a 1924 model car. I wanted to clarify that \nhe did not purchase it in 1924.\n  Having done so, I now call up amendment No. 1508.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for Mr. Bayh, \n     for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Coleman, Mr. \n     Salazar, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n     Kohl, Mr. Reed, and Ms. Collins, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1508 to amendment No. 1502.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for not more than 7 minutes on this amendment and then \nSenator Salazar be allowed to speak for up to 7 minutes also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, this is the amendment I spoke about \nduring morning business. I am proud to cosponsor it with Senator \nSalazar, as well as Senators Bayh, Brownback, Coleman, Feinstein, \nLincoln, Cantwell, Kerry, Dodd, Collins, Kohl, and Reed of Rhode \nIsland. It is a broadly bipartisan group.\n  This amendment would replace section 251 in the underlying bill which \nis the topic of our interest today. Section 251 in the bill sets forth \ngasoline savings targets as part of our move to help make America \nenergy independent. We instead would put in title I of the DRIVE Act, \nwhich many of us introduced earlier this year, which sets oil savings \nplan requirements that are more ambitious and appropriately so.\n  We all know America is a nation addicted to oil and that addiction is \nhurting us and our people in many ways. It is saddling consumers with \nhigh gas and oil and other fuel prices. It is compromising our foreign \npolicy. It is diminishing the quality of our environment. It is leaving \nour economy and our very national security subject to political \ninstability in faraway places and to the malicious whims of foreign \nleaders of oil-producing nations, such as Ahmadinejad of Iran and \nChavez of Venezuela. The only real and permanent solution to this \nproblem is to substantially reduce the amount of oil consumed by our \ntransportation sector, which consumes virtually all the oil, certainly \nthe greater part of it, we consume as a nation.\n  The underlying bill before the Senate, managed by the chairman and \nranking member of the Energy Committee but containing parts that came \nout of the Commerce Committee, the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee I am honored to serve on, under the leadership of Senator \nBoxer, is a very admirable and responsive piece of legislation, a real \nact of leadership by this Congress, a bipartisan act of leadership. \nThis is an institution, after the problems we had last week with the \nimmigration bill, that desperately needs to show the American people \nand ourselves we can work across party lines to get things done, to \nsolve problems that are real and present every day in the lives of our \ncitizens. There are few one could say that would be more true of that \nthan the energy crisis and challenge.\n  The savings targets in section 251 of the underlying bill are \nexpressed in terms of American gasoline consumption and reduction of \nit, not oil consumption. The problem is gasoline usage can be reduced \nby increasing the use of diesel, but diesel is also made from oil, and \noil is the substance to which we are addicted, with all the negative \nconsequences I have described. So reducing oil consumption, in the \nopinion of those of us who are sponsoring this amendment, should be the \nexpress goal of the Senate bill's transportation provisions because oil \ndependence is what hurts us, is what drains the budgets of America's \nfamilies and businesses. It hurts our national economy. It compromises \nour environment and undermines the independence of our foreign policy. \nThis amendment would make that crucial correction from goals reducing \ngasoline consumption in the underlying bill to goals reducing oil \nconsumption.\n  The gasoline savings goal in H.R. 6 amounts to a 20-percent reduction \nin projected oil consumption by 2030, if we try to transfer it to oil. \nThe oil savings requirement in this amendment would amount to a 35-\npercent reduction in projected oil consumption by 2030. That is \nsignificant and would go a long way toward solving the problems we have \ntalked about. I believe there is broad bipartisan support in the Senate \nfor these stronger targets. Indeed, the fuel economy and renewable \nfuels provisions already found elsewhere in H.R. 6 will themselves go a \nlong way toward achieving the stronger targets.\n  The DRIVE Act, which is the earlier legislation 26 of us introduced, \nits title I comprises our amendment to H.R. 6. It would direct the \nexecutive branch to identify, within 9 months and then within 18 \nmonths, and to publish Federal requirements that will achieve the \nfollowing real and significant goals: A consistent reduction in U.S. \noil consumption by 2016, a 7-million-barrel-per-day reduction by 2026, \nand a 10 million barrel per-day reduction by 2031. Today we consume \nsomewhat over 20 million barrels of oil per day. That would be \nsignificant to cut 10 million barrels off our oil consumption by 2031. \nThe measure would also direct the Office of Management and Budget to \npublish an analysis identifying the oil savings projected to be \nachieved by each requirement to be created and demonstrating that the \nlisted measures will, in the aggregate, achieve the overall specified \noil savings. So we are setting goals, and we are asking the executive \nbranch to come up with programs to show how existing statutory \nauthority and regulatory authority they have can be used to achieve \nthese goals which will make America much more energy independent or, in \nfact, to come back and say to us: We need more authority, some new \nstatute to achieve these goals we have set.\n\n[[Page S7524]]\n\n  The cosponsors of this amendment believe we need targets that will \nkeep the pressure on our Government and on all of us to use the \nauthorities Congress has provided to achieve the robust oil savings \nAmerica and its people need. The DRIVE Act, which is the act from which \nthis title I amendment is taken, has 26 cosponsors in the Senate, a \nbroadly bipartisan group reflective of every section of the country and \nevery ideology represented in the Congress. It shows there is a \nconsensus of demand for change in savings in oil consumption. That is \nexactly what this amendment would do.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt it overwhelmingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I first acknowledge my good friend from \nConnecticut for his good work on the DRIVE Act over the last several \nyears. It is no coincidence that he and a number of bipartisan Senators \nhave been leading the effort to make sure we set America free. In fact, \nthe coalition that helped in writing the legislation Senator Lieberman \nspoke about calls itself the Set America Free Coalition. It includes \nconservatives such as C. Boyden Gray and progressives such as former \nSenator Tim Wirth, who have come together and recognized that setting \nAmerica free from our addiction to foreign oil is an imperative for the \nUnited States in the 21st century.\n  Similar to the good work that gets done in this Chamber, this is \nbipartisan legislation. This amendment also has the cosponsorship of \nSenators Brownback, Coleman, Lincoln, Cantwell, Kerry, Dodd, Collins, \nKohl, and Reed of Rhode Island, and others. It is a good amendment that \nreflects the bipartisan composition of this body.\n  Let me say why I believe this ambitious set of goals for the United \nStates is important. It is irrefutable that today about 66 percent of \nthe oil being used in America comes from abroad. Of the oil we are \nimporting from those foreign countries, 41 percent of it comes from \nunderneath the sands or lands of hostile regimes. So that national \nsecurity implication is we need to get off the pipeline to those \nhostile regimes that today essentially allows them to fund the war on \nterror against the United States and the free world.\n\n  The legislation we have before us with this amendment reflects the \nAmerican dream of a more energy-secure future, with fewer oil imports \nand a strong renewable energy economy here at home.\n  We need to set high goals for oil savings because we know we can, in \nfact, meet them if we set them high--in the same way we set high \nstandards in the 1960s, when President Kennedy said we would be \nlaunching an initiative that would get a man to the moon within 10 \nyears, and we were able to do that; in the same way President Roosevelt \nsaid we would be able to move forward and develop the Manhattan \nProject, and we were able to do so within 4 years.\n  That is the same kind of vision and the same kind of boldness we need \nto have with respect to oil savings in America today. The amendment we \nhave brought before this body today--which is the embodiment of the oil \nsavings provision of the DRIVE Act--in fact, has that kind of boldness, \nthat kind of courage within it. I, therefore, strongly encourage my \ncolleagues in the Senate to support the amendment we have brought \nbefore you.\n  Let me, once again, say this amendment is broadly supported by both \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Senate. I hope it is one of those \namendments that can be adopted by our Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1515 to Amendment No. 1502\n\n(Purpose: To establish an energy efficiency and renewable energy worker \n                           training program)\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment and call up my amendment which is at the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I would like to talk to the Senator. \nWe are still on the amendment. What are you asking? That we set it \naside for what purpose?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I wish to offer an amendment to create \na workforce for sustainable energy and energy efficiency. We are \nbuilding on what was in the bill originally. We have boilerplate \nlanguage.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: We have set \naside only one amendment to proceed with another thus far; that is, the \namendment of the Senator from Oklahoma was set aside; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, now he is asking that be done again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is also correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask the Senator, how long do you \nthink you would be before we could return to the regular order?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Fifteen minutes or so.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. One-five?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not wish to restrict you. You talk long similar to \nmyself. Would you rather have 20 or 25 minutes?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 15 or 20. I think I can do it in 15.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Twenty minutes is all right by me.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  There being no objection, the pending amendment will be set aside and \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1515 to amendment No. 1502.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me thank my friend from New Mexico for the \nopportunity to go forward.\n  Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Clinton, Senator Kerry, and Senator Biden.\n  Our amendment would strike section 277 of the Senate substitute, \nwhich is very broad language directing the Secretary of Labor to work \nwith the Secretary of Energy to develop workforce training for the \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy sectors, and replace it with a \nclearer directive regarding workforce development in those same areas.\n  Before I get too far along in the description of the amendment, I \nwould like to thank Senators Bingaman and Domenici for including \nsection 277 in the underlying bill. I think we all recognize the need \nto provide more workforce training in the areas of energy efficiency \nand renewable energy if we are to truly meet the challenge in front of \nus.\n  The amendment I offer today simply builds upon the language already \nincluded in the legislation we are considering, and so I hope it will \nreceive the resounding support of this body. In other words, we had \nboilerplate language already in it, and we have built upon that. Up to \nthis point, we have had strong bipartisan support.\n  This amendment would create a sustainable, comprehensive public \nprogram to provide quality training for jobs created through renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency initiatives--an area of our economy that \nis in tremendous need of expansion to meet the demand for a skilled \nworkforce in these sectors.\n  Fundamentally, the amendment would do two basic things: One, expand \nour Nation's capacity to identify and track the new jobs and skills \nassociated with the growing clean energy technology sector; secondly, \ndevelop national and State training programs to address skill shortages \nthat have already begun to impair the expansion of clean energy and \nefficiency technologies.\n  More specifically, the amendment would authorize funding for national \nand State research on labor market trends in the energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy sectors. Additionally, the amendment would provide \ncompetitive grants for national and State\n\n[[Page S7525]]\n\ntraining programs in the renewable energy and energy efficiency areas.\n  Entities eligible for grants are nonprofit partnerships that include \nequal participation of industry and labor groups, and there is explicit \nencouragement for the development of partnerships with other \norganizations such as community-based organizations, educational \ninstitutions, small businesses, cooperatives, State and local veterans \nagencies, and veterans service organizations.\n  Some of the target populations for the training programs include \nthose who are veterans of the Armed Forces, those affected by national \nenergy or environmental policies, those displaced by economic \nglobalization, and those seeking pathways out of poverty and into \neconomic self-sufficiency. The eligible industries include the energy-\nefficient building, construction, and retrofits industry; the renewable \nelectric power industry; the energy-efficient and advanced drive train \nvehicle industry; the biofuels industry; and the deconstruction and \nmaterials use industries.\n  Some may ask whether we even have reason to believe we need training \nto increase the number of workers skilled in the areas targeted by this \namendment. The answer is a resounding yes. We know the lack of trained \nworkers is a significant barrier to the growth of the renewable and \nenergy efficiency industries.\n  A 2006 study from the National Renewable Energy Lab identified the \nshortage of skills and training as a leading nontechnical barrier to \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency growth. This same study \nidentified a number of critical unmet training needs, including lack of \nreliable installation, maintenance, and inspection services, the \nshortage of key technical and manufacturing skills, and failure of the \neducational system to provide adequate training in new technologies.\n  All of those issues are addressed in this amendment. I can tell you \nfrom talking to the people on the ground, there is a real shortage of \ntrained workers in these areas. In Vermont, if a family wants to \nretrofit and weatherize their home, it could take a very long time to \nmake it happen because there are simply not enough workers out there \ntrained to do the work. The same thing goes for installation of solar \npanels or wind turbines.\n  The widespread adoption of these technologies is being stopped in its \ntracks because we simply do not have enough people to do the jobs. But \ninstead of talking about a study or listening to my experience from \nVermont, let me actually offer testimonials from some of those who are \nmost familiar with the need for the workforce development concepts I am \nproposing.\n  Let me quote Tim Michels, from Energy Solutions, Incorporated, from \nSt. Louis, MO:\n\n       We have been saving energy for institutions for over 30 \n     years. We typically find that we can reduce energy use 25+ \n     percent with less than a 4 year payback, so it is very \n     economical and we have lots of case studies to prove it. The \n     limiting factor to our growth as an industry is lack of \n     qualified professionals to perform the analyses.\n\n  That is what we are trying to do: find the workers to do those types \nof efforts.\n  Lisa Mortensen, the CEO of Community Fuels, of Encinitas, CA, states:\n\n       Currently, we are constructing a 7.5 million gallon per \n     year biodiesel plant at Port of Stockton, California. As a \n     renewable energy start-up we have an intimate understanding \n     of the need for a high quality workforce. Skills in \n     mechanical operations, industrial hygiene and safety, quality \n     control and a wider understanding of energy production are \n     essential to a quality workforce. These skills are not easily \n     learned. With funding opportunities like the one proposed, \n     our company could work with local training institutions to \n     help develop a workforce prepared for the changing U.S. \n     landscape.\n\n  Christopher O'Brien, vice president for strategy & government \nrelations, Sharp Electronics Corporation, of Mayway, NJ, writes:\n\n       Sharp Corporation is the world's leading producer of solar \n     photovoltaic equipment and has been the No. 1 producer since \n     2000. Sharp's solar manufacturing plant in Memphis is the \n     largest solar panel manufacturing facility in the U.S., with \n     annual production capacity of 64 Megawatts, comprised of \n     almost 400,000 solar panels. The 200 solar production workers \n     in Memphis are represented by IBEW Local 474. Sharp supports \n     the proposal for increased Federal funding for worker \n     training in solar and other renewable energy and energy \n     efficiency industries. . . . We have since 2003 trained and \n     certified over 1,681 workers. Additional Federal funding \n     support would help to accelerate the pace of this training \n     and would assure Sharp and other solar manufacturers that \n     there will be a reliable and professionally trained pool of \n     workers to deliver and install solar energy systems on \n     customers' homes and commercial buildings. . . .\n\n  Those are a few--just a few--of the testimonials that have come \nacross my desk as I have worked on this amendment, but I do think they \ndo a good job of making this issue real for those of us in the Senate.\n  Now, my colleagues may wonder why we need a specific program for \ntraining in energy efficiency and renewables. The answer is simple: \nWhile the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries use many \nskills that can be transferred from other industries, specific, \nadditional skills are often needed to take maximum advantage of the \nnewer energy technologies.\n  For instance, investments in training of building maintenance workers \nand building superintendents and engineers can improve the operation of \ntoday's heating and cooling systems by as much as 10 percent in large \npublic and commercial buildings, according to the National Association \nof Energy Services Companies. Such training could save millions of \ndollars per year in energy costs in larger public or commercial \nbuildings, not to mention reduce the emission of pollutants that add to \nglobal warming. Let me quote from two business leaders about the need \nfor specific training in these areas.\n  Erik Larson, from Indie Energy, of Evanston, IL:\n\n       We are the first company in the Chicago area to develop \n     geothermal systems for commercial and residential \n     developments using in-house vertical drilling. . . . We \n     recognized right away that the skill sets required for a \n     geothermal operation were not available in current labor \n     markets.\n\n  Robert de Grasse, senior vice president of technical standards, \nAIMCO--America's largest owner of apartment complexes--of Denver, CO, \nwrites:\n\n       I personally support the Energy Efficiency and Renewable \n     Energy Worker Training Program. AIMCO is expecting that \n     properly trained maintenance technicians will have \n     significant and measurable benefits; in particular with HVAC \n     systems and electric motors. Energy User News described the \n     energy and financial savings on HVAC for community colleges \n     in California was estimated from 6 percent to 19 percent of a \n     typical community college's energy bill; a direct result of \n     technical training.\n\n  There is no doubt in my mind this amendment could make a tremendous \ndifference in our ability to implement concrete, on-the-ground \nstrategies that help to address our energy challenges. Ensuring we have \na workforce trained in the skills needed to implement bold energy \nefficiency and renewable energy policies will go a long way.\n  Before I yield the floor, I would like to read the long list of some \nof the organizations that support the Sanders-Clinton-Kerry-Biden \namendment, and I ask unanimous consent that letters from the following \ngroups be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                       NAESCO,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2007.\n     Re business leaders urge vote for Sanders-Clinton amendment \n         to promote workforce training for a new energy economy.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As a business association representing \n     leading companies working to build a new clean energy \n     economy, we strongly urge you to vote ``yes'' on an amendment \n     to the Energy Savings Act of 2007 (SB 1321) that will be \n     vital to our nation's energy security and to the fight \n     against global warming. Offered by Senators Sanders and \n     Clinton, the Amendment would establish an Energy Efficiency \n     and Renewable Energy Workforce Training Program at the \n     Department of Labor to ensure our country trains the \n     workforce needed to ensure continued robust growth of a new, \n     clean energy industry.\n       NAESCO's current membership of about 85 organizations \n     includes firms involved in the design, manufacture, financing \n     and installation of energy efficiency and renewable energy \n     equipment and the provision of energy efficiency and \n     renewable energy services in the private and public sectors. \n     NAESCO members deliver about $4 billion of energy efficiency \n     projects each year. NAESCO numbers among its members some of \n     the most prominent companies in the world in the HVAC and \n     energy control equipment business, including Honeywell, \n     Johnson Controls, Siemens, Trane and TAC/Tour Andover. Our \n     members also include many of the nation's largest utilities: \n     Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, New York \n     Power\n\n[[Page S7526]]\n\n     Authority, and TU Electric & Gas. In addition, ESCO members \n     include affiliates of ConEdison, Pepco Energy Services, \n     Constellation, PP, DMJM Harris and Direct Energy. Prominent \n     national and regional independent members include Custom \n     Energy, NORESCO, Onsite Energy, EnergySolve, Ameresco, UCONS, \n     Chevron Energy Solutions, Synergy Companies, Wendel Energy \n     Services, WESCO and Energy Systems Group. NAESCO member \n     companies have been delivering energy efficiency projects to \n     residential, commercial, institutional and industrial \n     customers across the country for the past twenty years.\n       The companies we represent are developing and deploying a \n     wide range of innovative clean energy technologies, utilizing \n     domestic biomass, wind, solar energy, geothermal power, fuel \n     cells, energy efficient technologies and services, and much, \n     much more. By 2025, these technologies could provide electric \n     power equal to half of all the electricity that our country \n     uses today. By 2030, our industries could replace 30% to 40% \n     of the petroleum our country now imports. By doing so, our \n     industries could make a significant contribution to curbing \n     global warming pollution, enhancing our nation's energy \n     security, and creating up to 5 million new jobs by 2025.\n       However, to achieve these goals, we must find enough \n     qualified, trained people to design, manufacture, install, \n     operate, and maintain a host of innovative renewable energy \n     and energy efficient technologies. Across the country, our \n     companies experience workforce shortages as one of the key \n     barriers to growth. Indeed, a recent literature review from \n     the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) identified the \n     shortage of skills and training as a leading non-technical \n     barrier to renewable energy and energy efficiency growth.\n       We believe that the $100 million dollars authorized by the \n     Sanders-Clinton Amendment is urgently needed to develop \n     national and state skill training programs that will prepare \n     workers technically for our emerging industries, as well as \n     to analyze market trends and demonstrate best practices. \n     While the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries \n     use many skills that can be transferred from other sectors, \n     in many other cases, our companies require specific, new \n     skills to take maximum advantage of the newer energy \n     technologies. By establishing a pilot program specifically \n     geared toward the renewable energy and efficiency industries, \n     the Sanders-Clinton Amendment would enable us to build the \n     workforce our industries need to achieve their maximum \n     potential.\n       Our companies stand ready to help our country with new \n     energy technologies that will make us all more secure, curb \n     the threat of global warming, and create economic opportunity \n     for millions of working Americans. We urge you to vote \n     ``yes'' on the Clinton-Sanders Amendment as a crucial step \n     toward achieving these vital objectives.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Donald D. Gilligan,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Center for American\n\n                                         Progress Action Fund,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2007.\n     Senator Bernard Sanders,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n     Senator Hillary Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Sanders and Clinton: I write to express my \n     strong support for the proposed Sanders-Clinton Energy \n     Efficiency and Renewable Energy Worker Training Program that \n     will be offered as an amendment to the upcoming energy bill, \n     and to encourage other Senators to join in support of this \n     provision as co-sponsors. This is a critically important \n     energy and jobs measure that will help to ensure both \n     America's future energy and economic security.\n       As our nation confronts the twin challenges of our \n     escalating energy dependence and a mounting climate crisis, \n     we are presented by a remarkable opportunity to meet these \n     pressing demands with new more efficient and ever cleaner \n     sources of energy. This ``energy opportunity'' represents a \n     chance to rebuild our communities, to better train our \n     workers, and to reinvest in the basic infrastructure of the \n     nation. This amendment takes a significant step forward in \n     meeting the practical need to ensure that American firms and \n     workers have the cutting edge skills to participate in the \n     growing market for clean and efficient energy, and to capture \n     the jobs of the future.\n       Even as wind and solar energy experience explosive annual \n     growth rates, the utility industry is facing retirement of \n     half its workers within the decade, while the National \n     Renewable Energy Lab has identified a shortage of skilled \n     workers as a major barrier to deployment of renewable and \n     efficient energy. This amendment strategically invests \n     $100,000,000 dollars into a more robust labor market and \n     skills training that will prepare up to 30,000 workers to \n     jump start these booming industries that America invented. \n     This is a smart investment in a safer, more prosperous, and \n     more competitive U.S. economy.\n       By enhancing the workforce investment system, and working \n     with state governments, non-profit community groups, and both \n     labor and management, this amendment offers an efficient path \n     forward for the American economy. Targeting workers displaced \n     by shifting energy policies, enhanced skills for returning \n     veterans, pathways out of poverty for those most in need of \n     work, and a reliable labor market for both small business and \n     heavy industry represents a sound investment in the future. \n     This amendment will help build a state of the art economy and \n     expand markets for renewable energy, good jobs in \n     construction and building trades, and job security for the \n     U.S. auto industry. Thank you for your leadership on this \n     issue. The Center for American Progress Action Fund salutes \n     your vision, and offers its full support for this important \n     measure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John D. Podesta,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 11, 2007.\n     Re support the Sanders-Clinton amendment on worker training \n         for the clean energy economy.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As representatives of the environmental, \n     energy efficiency, and clean energy advocacy communities, we \n     urge you to vote for an amendment to the Renewable Fuels, \n     Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 (S. \n     1419) that will train working Americans for high-skilled jobs \n     in the emerging, clean energy economy. Sponsored by Senators \n     Sanders and Clinton, the amendment would create an Energy \n     Efficiency and Renewable Energy Workforce Training Program at \n     the Department of Labor to train workers in the skills our \n     country needs to make the most of new investments in clean, \n     renewable energy and energy-saving technologies.\n       As Congress advances programs to enhance our energy \n     security and address global warming, workforce shortages have \n     emerged as one of the top barriers to the new energy economy. \n     Indeed, a 2006 study from the National Renewable Energy Lab \n     identified a shortage of skills and training as a leading \n     barrier to renewable energy and energy efficiency growth.\n       The program established by the Sanders-Clinton Amendment \n     would help ensure that our nation develops the best models \n     for training workers in the new skills required to properly \n     manufacture, install, maintain, and operate clean energy \n     technologies. Grant funding under the program could, for \n     instance, train wind-industry workers in such new skills as \n     turbine siting, airfoil repair, and weather patterns that \n     affect turbine performance. Investments in training of \n     building maintenance workers, superintendents, and engineers \n     could improve the operations of sophisticated heating and \n     cooling systems by as much as 10 percent, saving millions in \n     energy costs each year in large public, industrial, or \n     commercial buildings.\n       Of crucial importance, the Sanders-Clinton amendment \n     provides working Americans with a clear pathway to earn a \n     family-supporting livelihood in the emerging, new energy \n     economy. We enthusiastically embrace this amendment for \n     signaling that America is, at last, ready to replace the old \n     debate of ``jobs vs. the environment'' by investing in ``jobs \n     for the environment.''\n       Thank you for considering our request to co-sponsor this \n     vital amendment. If you have any questions about this \n     legislation, please feel free to contact Jessica Maher in \n     Sen.

Collins,\n       Executive Director, American Solar Energy Society.\n     Randall Swisher,\n       President, American Wind Energy Association.\n     Donald Gilligan,\n       President, National Association of Energy Service \n     Companies.\n     Robert Dinneen,\n       President Renewable Fuels Association.\n     Rhone Resch,\n       President, Solar Energy Industries Association.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to request your support for an \n     amendment to be offered by Sen. Sanders to S. 1419 the \n     ``Energy Savings Act of 2007.''\n       The Sanders amendment would establish the Energy Efficiency \n     and Renewable Energy Worker Training Program to train workers \n     for good-paying jobs in clean energy design, manufacturing, \n     installation, construction, operation, and maintenance. This \n     program would help U.S. workers get good jobs in an industry \n     expected to experience rapid growth as our nation refits and \n     rebuilds its energy infrastructure, and would help the U.S. \n     economy take advantage of emerging environmental \n     technologies.\n       To ensure that the benefits from new investments in our \n     national energy infrastructure are distributed equitably, the \n     Sanders amendment would give priority to partnerships that \n     train veterans, workers displaced by globalization or \n     environmental policies, and disadvantaged workers and \n     communities. In addition, to allow for the delivery of \n     training unique to specialized geographic and industry needs, \n     the Sanders amendment balances grants between national, \n     regional, and state workforce development programs.\n       As Congress considers legislation designed to reduce our \n     country's reliance on foreign sources of fossil fuels, we \n     believe it should also invest in the domestic workforce. \n     American workers should have every opportunity to acquire the \n     skills necessary for job opportunities that will be created \n     by new investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy \n     industries.\n       The AFL-CIO strongly urges you to support and cosponsor the \n     Sanders amendment. To become a cosponsor, please call Jessica \n     Maher in Sen. Sanders' office. If you have any other \n     questions or need any further information, please contact \n     David Mallino in the AFL-CIO's Department of Legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               William Samuel,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     Department of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 5, 2007.\n     Re co-sponsor the Sanders-Clinton amendment on workforce \n         development for the new energy economy\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I write to urge you to co-sponsor an \n     amendment that Senators Sanders and Clinton will offer during \n     the upcoming debate on S. 1419, the Renewable Fuels, Consumer \n     Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007, that would \n     help America develop the specialized workforce skills needed \n     to ensure robust growth of the renewable energy and energy \n     efficiency industries. The Sanders-Clinton Amendment would \n     establish an Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Workforce \n     Training Program to be administered by the Department of \n     Labor (DOL) in coordination with the Department of Energy.\n       The purpose of this initiative is twofold--to expand our \n     nation's capacity to identify and track the new jobs and \n     skills associated with the growing energy technology sector \n     and to develop national and state skill training programs \n     that will demonstrate best practices in addressing skill \n     shortages that have already begun to impair the expansion of \n     energy technologies that are crucial to national security, \n     economic competitiveness, and curbing global warming.\n       Industries eligible for training services under the program \n     would include: energy-efficient building, construction, and \n     retrofits; renewable electric power; advanced automotive \n     drive trains; advanced bio-fuels; and the deconstruction and \n     materials use industries.\n       As Congress advances programs to enhance our energy \n     security and address global warming, workforce shortages are \n     emerging in the utilities sector that could stymie growth of \n     the renewable energy and efficiency industries. According to \n     the American Public Power Association, half of current \n     utility workers will retire within the next decade. However, \n     our nation is not training enough new workers to fill their \n     places. For instance, the number of high school graduates \n     with technical training has declined by 35 percent over the \n     last decade.\n       Already, the renewable and energy efficiency industries are \n     feeling the pinch. A 2006 study from the National Renewable \n     Energy Lab (NREL) identified the shortage of skills and \n     training as a leading non-technical barrier to renewable \n     energy and energy efficiency growth. In particular, the NREL \n     study identified a number of critical unmet training needs, \n     including lack of reliable installation, maintenance, and \n     inspection services, the shortage of key technical and \n     manufacturing skills, and failure of the educational system \n     to provide adequate training in new technologies.\n       Leading companies in the renewable energy and efficiency \n     sector experience lack of skilled workers as a key business \n     constraint. According to Steve Cowell, CEO and Chairman, of \n     Conservation Services Group (CSG), a leading provider of \n     building efficiency and renewable energy services, ``the \n     growth of the industry is constrained by the challenges of \n     finding experienced, trained people. . . . CSG has identified \n     this issue as our . . . industry's most significant \n     constraint on growth.''\n       The program established by the Sanders-Clinton Amendment \n     would help ensure that our nation has the best models for \n     training workers in the many new skills required to properly \n     manufacture, install, maintain, and operate clean energy \n     technologies. For instance, grant funding provided under the \n     amendment could train workers in such substantial new skills \n     as wind turbine siting, airfoils and composite repair, and \n     weather patterns that affect turbine performance.\n       While the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries \n     use many skills that can be transferred from other \n     industries, specific, targeted skill enhancements are often \n     needed to take maximum advantage of the newer energy \n     technologies. For instance, investments in training of \n     building maintenance workers and building superintendents and \n     engineers can improve the operations of today's sophisticated \n     heating and cooling systems by as much as 10 percent in large \n     public and commercial buildings, according to the National \n     Association of Energy Services Companies. Such training could \n     save millions of dollars per year in energy costs in larger \n     public or commercial buildings.\n       The Sanders-Clinton amendment is unique among many of the \n     new energy polices that Congress will consider for providing \n     a pathway for working Americans to earn a family-supporting \n     livelihood in our new energy economy. This Amendment honors \n     the sacrifice of our veterans by including them among groups \n     targeted for training. In addition, the Amendment helps to \n     tap the full range of our nation's human capital by offering \n     training opportunities to those displaced by national energy \n     and environmental policy, economic globalization, individuals \n     seeking pathways out of poverty, formerly incarcerated, \n     adjudicated and non-violent offenders who seek to play a \n     constructive role in society, and incumbent workers in the \n     energy field needing to update their skills.\n       The $100 million authorized by the Sanders-Clinton \n     Amendment is needed to implement programs of sufficient size \n     and scale to achieve the dual goals described previously--\n     enhanced labor market information as well as national and \n     state demonstration training programs. The Amendment would \n     authorize up to $40 million in grants on a competitive basis \n     under a National Training Partnerships program and up to $40 \n     million in grants to states to implement labor exchange and\n\n[[Page S7528]]\n\n     training programs. Preference would be given to states that \n     show leadership in promoting renewable energy, energy \n     efficiency, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. \n     Eligible entities would include non-profit organizations that \n     are composed of partnerships between industry and labor, \n     taking advantage of established programs in order to ensure \n     the highest-quality training possible. The Sanders-Clinton \n     amendment also provides funding for national and State \n     industry-wide research, labor market information, and labor \n     exchange programs.\n       Using the average costs of attending a community college, \n     we estimate that funding would be sufficient to train between \n     20,000 and 30,000 workers per year. These numbers represent \n     just a small fraction of the 3 million workers that would be \n     needed, according to our own estimates, if the country \n     launched an ambitious ten-year Apollo-like effort to build a \n     new energy future. However, we believe it is prudent to begin \n     with a pilot program on the scale proposed by Senator Sanders \n     to ensure we fully understand the kinds of training needed \n     and future workforce trends before investing in a larger \n     effort.\n       Worker training, we believe, will be crucial to the wider \n     market penetration of innovative renewable energy and energy \n     efficient technologies. With passage of the Sanders-Clinton \n     Amendment, businesses can, for instance, have greater \n     confidence that an expensive solar array or geothermal heat \n     pump will be properly installed, reducing the perceived risks \n     of investing in relatively unfamiliar technologies. As skills \n     improve, costs will come down. That will, in turn, pave the \n     way toward making renewables and efficiency a core component \n     of our country's energy mix.\n       Thank you for considering our request to co-sponsor this \n     vital amendment. If you have any questions about this \n     legislation, please feel free to contact Jessica Maher in \n     Senator Sanders' office or Dan Seligman, Apollo's National \n     Campaign Director.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jerome Ringo,\n                                       President, Apollo Alliance.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Some of those groups are the Apollo Alliance; the \nRenewable Fuels Association; Wider Opportunities for Women; the Union \nof Concerned Scientists; the AFL-CIO; the National Association of \nEnergy Service Companies, which includes many businesses and utilities \nthat we all have heard of--Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Trane, and \nPacific Gas & Electric, to name a few--the Sierra Club; the Alliance to \nSave Energy; the Solar Energy Industries Association; Clean Water \nAction; the American Wind Energy Association; Earthjustice; the \nAmerican Solar Energy Society; the American Council for an Energy-\nEfficient Economy; Public Citizen; the Center for American Progress \nAction Fund; and the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n  To conclude, this amendment has widespread support from the business \ncommunity and from organized labor. It has support from the \nenvironmental community. What it says is if we are going to go forward \nin a bold way, breaking our dependence on fossil fuels, moving to \nenergy efficiency, moving to sustainable energy, we are going to need a \nskilled workforce to help us move in that direction. I have always \nbelieved as we move to sustainable energy and energy efficiency, we \nhave the capability of creating millions of new, good-paying jobs. This \namendment is terribly important if, in fact, we are going to be able to \ndo that.\n  I yield the floor and ask for support of this amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I have conferred with my colleague and \nwe are willing to accept the amendment offered by the Senator from \nVermont, the one he presented to the Members, the one that is currently \npending. Perhaps my colleague wants to speak to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, we have reviewed the amendment, and \nactually we have similar activity already prescribed for in the bill. \nThis modifies some, changes some, adds in other places, but all of it \nis authorizing to the extent that it expands--it is pretty much the \nkind of thing the bill contemplated. So we have no objection on our \nside.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I appreciate those comments, and the \nSenator from California who chairs the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee indicates it is acceptable to her committee as well. So at \nthis point, I think the Senate is ready to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1515) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President and fellow Senators, I need now to \nbother you with a few minutes of time, because some very good Senators \nhave come to the floor to speak in favor of a proposal that was brought \nto the floor by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, and he was \njoined by the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Salazar. Between the two, they \nmentioned and enumerated a number of Senators who favored this--good \nSenators here who favor this proposal that was brought to the Senate's \nattention, as it was a freestanding amendment that has been floating \naround the Senate for quite some time as something that maybe we should \nconsider. Now, it sounds good. Senators who spoke about it spoke \neloquently about it, but I would suggest that maybe, just maybe, these \ngoals in this amendment were necessary yesterday--maybe yesterday, \nSenator Bingaman--I am not sure, but maybe.\n  But I encourage my colleagues to look to the underlying bill and \ncompare it to the goals that are set forth in that amendment. We don't \nneed the goals, because we have already--the amendment they offer sets \ngoals and then directs the administration to figure out how to get \nwhere they are supposed to go. I think that is sort of like \noutsourcing. That is outsourcing of the legislature duties and \nresponsibilities to the executive, and then praising the bill because \nit tells the executive they have to reach these goals and save all of \nthis oil. Well, if it were that easy, ever since we found out we were \ngreatly dependent upon foreign oil, it would have been a cinch. There \nwould have been nothing to it. We could have come to the floor and said \nwe have an answer.\n  We want a dream. We want a dream, and the dream is a two-sentence \nbill that says the executive branch of Government shall have OMB \nproceed to direct goals that will get us to the point where we are no \nlonger dependent. What a dream they could say that is. I am kind of \nparaphrasing my wonderful friend from Colorado who talked about the \ndream, that this was a dream to achieve big things. But you see, this \nis merely saying to the executive branch: You do what we ought to do, \nand when you do it, or if you do it, we are going to take credit today, \nbecause we told you to get OMB, the Office of Management and Budget, or \nsomebody in your branch of the Government, to set the goals and then \ntell us how to do it, and then do it.\n\n  Let me get back to why we don't need it, if we ever needed it. I \nwould have made this same argument in any event, but I want to say \nyesterday it was a little more relevant. My colleagues understand we \nhave a bill before us, and we the Congress set goals on gasoline \nsavings and then we set the policies that will attain the goals. They \nare tough, hard goals. They are not saying to the President: You reach \nthese goals. We reach the goals. In fact, we will vote on this bill and \nwhen we do, if we do, and if we have enough courage, we will be voting \non changing the automobile standards in a big way. For the first time \nin decades, we will have changed the standards for automobiles, for new \nautomobiles, and made the automobile manufacturers make cars every year \nless dependent, more efficient so they use less gasoline.\n  But we don't say: Executive branch, You do it. Set the goals. And \naren't we happy we dreamed big and we said to you, you set the goals \nfor CAFE standards. We didn't say that. We said: Here, we changed them. \nAnd if anybody wants to vote to change the CAFE standards, they are \nalready changed in this bill. If you want to change the CAFE standards \nand save a huge number of barrels, since they are talking\n\n[[Page S7529]]\n\nabout barrels, a huge number of barrels of crude oil, because all the \ngasoline for the most part comes from that, you will achieve those \nsavings by voting for this bill. You don't have to vote for an \namendment that says to the President: You set the goals, Mr. President, \nand then you achieve them. And, boy, when that gets done, we will have \nmade a real dream come true.\n  Now, I figure we should stop dreaming. We dreamed so much on energy \nand we have been working so hard that today, for the first time in the \ntransportation section, the section of our law that is transportation \noriented, we took one big bite out of the use of transportation fuel, \nand we did not need the amendment I am opposing that was brought here \ntoday and that the distinguished Senators from Colorado and Connecticut \nand others spoke in favor of. We don't need it anymore, because we \ndon't need anybody else setting the goals. We achieved the goals \nourselves right in the bill.\n  In 1972, President Nixon set the goal of being energy independent by \n1980. We were about 30 percent dependent on foreign oil at that time. \nToday, unfortunately, we are 60 percent reliant upon foreign oil. That \ntells me goals are not enough. We need action. Interestingly enough, \nthis bill that they offer an amendment to is the action. It is the \naction per se. We have not had any action that makes us less reliant, \nsubstantially less reliant, as does this bill. By adoption of the \nchanges in the laws that apply to new cars, we have dramatically \nreduced what Americans are going to spend on gasoline and diesel fuel \nin the forthcoming years because we have changed the law and have \ncaused that to happen in a very good way. But we haven't asked anybody \nto do it for us. We haven't said: Mr. President, would you find in your \nadministration somebody who could set these goals and achieve them? \nBoy, we have told you how to do it. We have set them very high so we \ncan go home and tell the American people how high we have set the goals \nand how much we achieved. But we did nothing in the amendment. We did \nnothing; we just asked the White House to do it.\n  I know a lot of people have endorsed a bill that does this, that has \nthese goals that asks the President to ask the OMB to achieve the \ngoals, and we have everybody on it. We have people in ordinary life who \nare great citizens. We have former Senators, former members of White \nHouse staff. They all joined this bill. But the bill was nothing more \nthan a set of goals, and it said the White House should go out and \nachieve them. It was sort of saying: We would like to be President, but \nwe are not. Since we are not, we are going to adopt this amendment and \nit is going to tell the President that is what he ought to do. But I \nsay that once again, the amendment, which I am going to call the \nSalazar amendment for a moment, would require the administration to \ndevelop a plan to reduce oil consumption by 2.5 million barrels of oil \nper day during the calendar year 2016, ramping up to 10 million barrels \nper day during calendar year 2031. But the bill we are considering \nalready includes an ambitious gasoline savings goal. It goes on to \nachieve the goal. The bill itself achieves the goal by changing the \nlaw. Senators are going to be voting--not the President--to get it \ndone. The bill we are considering already includes ambitious savings. \nThe bill sets gasoline savings at 20 percent by calendar year 2017, 35 \npercent by calendar year 2025, and 45 percent by calendar year 2030.\n  Now, we did not ask the President to ask staff to come up with a goal \nand then today brag on the goal because the President is going to do \nit. What we did in this bill is we adopted these goals and then changed \nthe law to achieve them.\n  As you know, we changed the law to achieve the savings, by changing \nthe law on new automobiles and other things in this bill. These goals \nare consistent with what the President articulated in the State of the \nUnion Address. But we didn't wait around to see how he was going to do \nit and let him call the shots and then brag that he set the goals. We \ndid it ourselves. The President's Twenty in Ten Initiative calls for a \nreduction in gasoline usage by 20 percent in 10 years, or by 2017.\n  This bill not only includes these gasoline savings goals but \nestablishes the programs that will put us on track to meet them. In \nparticular, the bill includes an ambitious renewable fuel standard that \nwill displace foreign oil with homegrown renewable fuel.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Then we set the \npolicies that attain the goals we are trying to achieve. Outsourcing \nour authority--we outsource it to the White House in the amendment that \nwas put before us--Senator Lieberman first brought it up. I don't know \nwho takes credit as its author. Perhaps it is the distinguished Senator \nfrom Colorado, Mr. Salazar, but we all know which three or four \nSenators first came up with it.\n  I wish to talk for a moment about this. On the biofuels part of the \nbill, we save 2.5 million barrels per day by 2017--I have converted \nsome of this to barrels so they won't wonder what we are doing--4.5 \nmillion barrels per day by 2025, and 6.5 million barrels per day by \n2030. This is just the renewable fuels section. If we add the CAFE \nstandards from the bill, we probably will exceed these goals in \npractice by passing this bill.\n  This amendment is unnecessary. The amendment offered by Senator \nSalazar and others here today is unnecessary because we, as a matter of \nfact, already adopted law changes. We will be the ones who were \ncourageous and did the work. We are not going to just set goals and put \nnumbers there and say, now we have done our job, and say to the \nPresident, you go do it, and then come to the Senate and say, won't it \nbe great. We set these goals, and the President will do it.\n  I don't believe that is the way we are going to do that. If that was \nthe way we were going to do it--I told you about Richard Nixon and how \nfar we were already substantially indebted to the world, 20 percent \ndependent. We were all trying to get a balanced budget in terms of the \nenergy consumption. He wanted to have a zero difference. He wanted to \nmake everything work, where we didn't have any excess use of oil, and \nhe announced that. But, you see, he was President. He could have done \nwhatever he wanted that was legal. He must have found that the \nPresident cannot do it. He didn't achieve it. The Congress tried but \ncould not achieve it with him, and nobody could do it very easily.\n  We have been doing very well when you consider what we did in the \nbill we passed 2 years ago, the Energy bill, plus the two things which \nare in this bill which are gigantic, the likes of which we have never \ndone--the CAFE change, which is giant. You heard the effects from \nSenator Feinstein. That is not set in stone. That is adopting the \nchanges in CAFE standards, big changes. And then we did the dramatic \nthing the President recommended in terms of moving ahead with ethanol \nand beyond ethanol to the kind of cellulosic ethanol, which is going to \nbe truly a magnificent substitute for the oil we are using. But we are \nnot setting a goal; we are going to do it. The bill will do it. By the \ntime we are finished, the bill will achieve almost as much as the \nSalazar amendment requested in goals.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I want to get it clear in the Record \nwho this amendment belongs to. It was introduced by Senator Bayh some \ntime ago. It had as sponsors Senators Brownback, Lieberman, Coleman, \nSalazar, Cantwell, Kerry, Dodd, and Kohl. The amendment was also \nproposed by Senator Reid. I now have it straight that these were the \nSenators on this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nBayh amendment No. 1508 that is rooted in one of the most basic \nresponsibilities we have as Members of this body,\n\n[[Page S7530]]\n\nand that is to preserve the security of the American people. For over a \nyear, I have been working with a bipartisan group of Senators, \nincluding Senator Bayh, Senator Lieberman, Senator Brownback, and \nSenator Salazar, on a plan that will create oil savings for this \nNation.\n  By the way, the bill before us does that. Senator Domenici is right. \nCongress needs to do the hard work, there is no question about that. \nThis bill has already been strengthened, and there have been provisions \nwith CAFE that will add to the strength of this bill.\n  The approach we are offering is a more aggressive approach than the \nsavings target in the bill. It is a more aggressive approach than CAFE \nor other oil savings that we see.\n  We offer this amendment today to replace the gasoline savings goal in \nH.R. 6, the underlying legislation we are now considering, with title I \nof what we call the DRIVE Act, which we have offered as an amendment. \nIt would direct the executive branch of our Government to identify \nwithin 9 months and to publish within 18 months Federal requirements \nthat will achieve a 2.5-million-barrel-per-day reduction of U.S. oil \nconsumption by 2016, which is the amount of oil that we currently \nimport from the Middle East. The amendment goes on to achieve a 7-\nmillion-barrel-per-day reduction by 2026, and a 10-million-barrel-per-\nday reduction by 2031. That is about 50 percent of the per-day oil \nconsumption in the United States today.\n  The amendment would also direct the Office of Management and Budget \nto publish an analysis to ensure the Government's action plan will \nachieve the oil savings targets, and the amendment will hold the \nGovernment accountable by including specific requirements to the \nexecutive branch to evaluate, review, and update the plan.\n  The question that is probably on the minds of most Americans is, Can \nwe do this? Is America up to the challenge? Can we summon the \nleadership and resources for a task of this magnitude? The simple \nanswer for us as Americans is: We can because we must.\n  The handwriting is on the wall. Failure to address our energy \ndependence will mean a future for our kids which is less prosperous, \nless safe, and less free.\n  We should be motivated not by fear, however. We need to dream of the \nbetter America we can build.\n  This bill before us does that. It moves us in that direction. This \namendment moves us more aggressively in that direction. It makes sure \nthe Federal Government has all the tools at its disposal, the tools \nthat the underlying text provides.\n  The American people will make it possible. For every voice of concern \nI hear about foreign oil dependence, I hear about another instance of \nAmericans' innovative spirit. All I have to do is look at my home State \nof Minnesota where entrepreneurs are inventing new renewable fuel \nprocesses, hydraulic-powered vehicles, new revolutionary energy-saving \ntechnologies, the list goes on and on.\n  The DRIVE Act, upon which this amendment is based, includes a \nblueprint of a plan for oil independence that centers on three \nprinciples: energy conservation, vehicle technology, and renewable \nfuels. H.R. 6, the underlying text, has included many components of our \nplan, and, again, I give great credit to both the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Bingaman, and the ranking member, my friend, Senator \nDomenici, for the work they have done and all that they have pulled \ntogether to help America lessen its dependence on foreign oil. We need \nan oil savings target that is bold. We need one that will hold \nGovernment accountable to achieving cuts to our foreign oil dependence.\n  We have the tools, but now we need the leadership. We need to give \nthe leadership direction, and that is what this amendment does. This \namendment would express that leadership in terms of what we think is a \nmore relevant standard, one that focuses on our problem--oil \nconsumption. The underlying bill will reduce gasoline use, but it is \npossible it could result in an increase in diesel which is, of course, \nmade from oil. So our amendment, which is based on oil reduction, is, \nin our opinion, the more appropriate goal for this law, and that is why \nwe are offering this amendment to H.R. 6.\n  The gasoline savings goal currently in H.R. 6 amounts to about a 20-\npercent reduction projected oil consumption by 2030, 23 years from now. \nBut the oil savings in our amendment amounts to a 35-percent reduction \nin projected oil consumption in 2030. That is a significantly greater \nreduction, and I believe it is one we can achieve if we set the goal as \nhigh as it should be--high enough to cut our dependence on foreign oil \nand free America from dependence on the oil of tyrants. We put \npetrodollars--oil is a malleable product. We may not buy directly from \nIran, but the fact is, the addiction we have to foreign oil puts \npetrodollars in the pockets of thugs and tyrants such as Chavez in \nVenezuela and Ahmadinejad in Iran.\n  The reality is that 97 percent of transportation in the United States \nis fueled by oil we buy from a unified global oil market. Saudi Arabia \nholds 20 percent of the world's oil reserves, Iran 10 percent, and \nVenezuela holds 6 percent of the world's oil reserves. It is time to \nstop funding Hugo Chavez and start sending that money to America's \nentrepreneurs.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nbipartisan oil savings amendment. Again, I applaud the chair and the \nranking member, the Senators from New Mexico. They have strengthened \nthis bill. There will be a CAFE piece that we know will achieve greater \nsavings. But, clearly, what we are doing is about oil consumption not \njust about gasoline. I think we should set the higher standards. If we \ntell Americans this is the goal we have to reach, they will get it \ndone, and we will benefit from it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, we probably are going to enter into an \nagreement to have a vote this evening, but I didn't want the good \nSenator to leave the floor without me making three points.\n  I do not seek now to have an argument about his approach. I will do \nthat before the vote when we set that up. But when the Senator from \nMinnesota talks about a goal of saving oil and the bill before us has \nsavings of gasoline, I just wonder if he knows that most of the crude \noil goes to gasoline in the United States. That is a fact, isn't it? \nMost of the crude oil we import, that we bring into our country to go \nto refineries, is turned into gasoline and used by automobiles.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, most of the fuel we consume, I think \nover 60 percent, is gasoline. But the issue is dependence. Our concern \nis not just about gas. It is about oil, oil dependence. So we push a \nlittle further on the large issue.\n  I certainly agree with my distinguished colleague from Mexico that \ngasoline is a major part of what we are consuming.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I am going to yield the floor in a \nmoment. I just want to say, if my colleague thinks carefully, the \namendment that was offered that was spoken to by my good friend sets \ngoals to be achieved by the White House, by the executive department. \nWe have a bill before us that I am so proud of because for the first \ntime, we did it right. We put in the bill the kinds of law changes that \nwill save gasoline and oil because we change the law. We don't have to \nask the President to find ways; we did it. When Senators vote for it, \nthey will not be voting for a goal that asks the President to do \nsomething. They will be voting for a change in the law that makes cars \nmore efficient in the future if produced and used in the American \nmarket.\n  That same bill will save tremendous amounts of electricity and \nwhatever is used with electricity because we are going to become so \nmuch more efficient on appliances and the like.\n  And, third, there will be some enormous savings because we are going \nto make gasoline from something other than crude oil and other than by \nmaking it out of corn. We are going to make it out of switchgrass and \nother products that are part of the biomass approach.\n  I am proud that just those three will do more than we have ever done, \nand we won't be asking a President to set goals to achieve, which a \nPresident has never been able to do. If they could, they would do it \nwithout us asking them. We are doing it in this bill.\n\n[[Page S7531]]\n\n  I yield the floor and will return when we have a vote on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, first, I thank my friend from \nMinnesota, Senator Coleman, who has been very active in the \nconstruction of the so-called DRIVE Act. I thank him for his \ncosponsorship of this amendment. I appreciate very much this is a \nbipartisan measure.\n  I say to Senator Domenici, if I may, I wish to respond to his \nstatement. The aim of this amendment is to build on--and I mentioned \nthis earlier in my statement--all the extraordinary steps forward that \nare in the bill that has come out of the Energy Committee and the \nCommerce Committee.\n  In other words, we are trying to do basically a couple of things with \nthis amendment. One, it is true we are moving from the goal in the bill \nthat just says gasoline to oil so that it includes all oil usage in the \ncountry.\n  Second, basically, we are saying to the executive branch that over \nthe time ahead, here are some national goals we are setting. You have \nauthority in law, and if this bill passes--thanks to the work that \nSenator Domenici and Senator Bingaman have done, and our friends on the \nCommerce Committee--the Government will have more authority. Put all \nthose authorities together in a package and tell us how you are going \nto use those authorities to achieve the real goals in this bill.\n  So this is not in any way intended to undermine the very progressive \nsteps in the committee's proposal, H.R. 6. It is intended to put a \nrequirement on this administration and following administrations to \nmake sure that all the authorities they have in the law are used to \nachieve these goals. If they don't feel they can do it with the \nauthorities they have, they can come back to us and ask for more.\n  I yield to my friend from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I second what my colleague has said. I \napplaud the underlying work on this bill. It is progressive. It is \ngoing to make a difference.\n  What we are doing is simply building on that foundation and \nunderstanding that the issue of oil dependence is about oil dependence, \nand if we can move the ball forward, if we can give some specific tools \nto the administration--Congress is going to do the hard work. The \nSenator from New Mexico has done the heavy lifting. This is a very \nbroad-based bill. There is a lot in this bill. I believe this amendment \ncertainly has some responsibilities, and the executive branch needs to \nbe part of the solution. I believe it is appropriate for Congress to \ngive them this kind of direction. We will all benefit. But it certainly \nbuilds on a very steady foundation that the Senator from New Mexico has \nput forth, and I applaud him for doing that.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I will add, unless Senator Domenici \nwishes to speak, I will suggest the absence of a quorum but not quite \nyet.\n  Senator Coleman has a good point. We are supporting the bill. It is a \nvery significant step forward coming out of the committees. Again, I \nthank Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici for their bipartisan \nleadership on this bill. This amendment sets good, significant goals \nfor savings of oil consumption by America over the next 23 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 5:45 today be for debate with respect to amendment No. 1508 and \nthe time be equally divided and controlled in the usual form and no \nsecond-degree amendment be in order prior to the vote and that at 5:45 \np.m., the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment, without \nfurther intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, what were the last two \nlines?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment, \nwithout further intervening action or debate, at 5:45.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have half the time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, you do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, if there is no one here to speak \ndirectly to the amendment at this point, I would like to speak to the \nbill under this unanimous consent request. I will yield if someone \ncomes to the floor to speak directly to the amendment, No. 1508.\n  This week in the Senate we are considering an energy bill, the \nRenewable Fuels Consumer Protection and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007. \nThis legislation is built upon a goal we believe in, the goal to move \nAmerica in a new energy direction which will enhance our national \nsecurity and strengthen our economy while protecting the Earth on which \nwe live.\n  This new energy direction calls upon the strength of America: \ninnovation, ingenuity, creativity. We are calling for improvements in \nenergy efficiency, development of cleaner alternative fuels, investment \nin research and development for new technology, improvements to fuel \neconomy, and stronger consumer protection.\n  If we do not take steps to use our energy resources more wisely and \ninstead continue on the path we have followed, we threaten our Nation's \nfuture, we risk our economic security, and we fail to protect our \ncountry and our children from the growing threats of global warming. If \nwe continue on the path from where we have been, we will be left behind \nas others around the world who recognize the growing demand for energy \nmake their own advancements in harnessing renewable resources and \nimproving energy efficiency. We will fall behind as a nation and, \ninstead of being leaders of innovation, we will be followers, reliant \non others.\n  Business as usual will not improve our economy or make our Nation \nmore secure. A new energy direction for our country will create jobs \nand grow our economy. Here are some facts, for a moment, to put it in \nperspective.\n  Every day, we consume 20.8 million barrels of oil, 14,000 barrels per \nminute, over 10,000 gallons per second--25 percent of all the oil \nproduced in the world consumed here in the United States. Over 60 \npercent of the oil we use is imported. This figure may grow to 70 \npercent over the next two decades, with about half of the increase \ncoming from members of the OPEC oil cartel, many with whom we have \nrelationships that are shaky at best. The thirst for oil costs us $291 \nbillion annually on oil imports, with 38 percent of this money going to \nOPEC.\n  In 2006, the top five integrated oil companies made $119 billion in \nprofits. Making money is not a bad thing, but that is a recordbreaker. \nSince 2005, when the Senate last considered energy policy, gasoline \nprices have gone up 45 percent. Since the election of this President, \ngasoline prices in America have doubled. In my State, 2 years ago, we \npaid $2.19 a gallon. Today, the average is $3.35; in Chicago, $3.50. \nThe cheapest gasoline I could find 10 days ago in Chicago, $3.75 a \ngallon. In the past 5 years, we have witnessed a 136-percent increase \nin gas prices and an 83-percent increase in diesel fuel prices. Think \nabout the added shipping costs, manufacturing costs, and agricultural \ncosts associated with this.\n  Three factors are at work here: the industry's failure to reinvest \nenough of their profits to expand refinery capacity, the increasing \nglobal demand for world oil resources, and our failure to reduce \nconsumption. In order to help reduce our dependence on imported oil and \nbreak us from these ever-increasing costs, this bill calls for \nstrengthening renewable fuel standards.\n  A century ago, Henry Ford's Model T was the first flex-fuel vehicle. \nIt could run on both gasoline and ethanol. Ford knew that fuel could be \nfound in many places, even fermented.\n  Here we are today, a century later, encouraging the production of \nbio-based renewable fuels in order to displace a portion of our \npetroleum thirst. This Energy bill calls for an increase in the \ndomestic production of clean, renewable fuels to 8.5 billion gallons in \n2012 and 36 billion in 2022. It specifically calls for an increase in \nadvanced biofuels, those not derived solely from corn. This provision \nwould save 1.4 million barrels of oil a day and reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions. Another provision in this bill will save us 1.5 million \nbarrels of oil a day and also reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  For the first time in 30 years, this bill raises fuel economy \nstandards for cars and trucks to 35 miles a gallon by\n\n[[Page S7532]]\n\nthe year 2020. I offered an amendment 2 years ago that would have \ncalled for these higher fuel economy standards. The Senate was not \nready for that amendment. I think America was. My amendment did not \npass, but it was a starting point for the legislation we have today.\n  Title V of this bill reflects a true bipartisan compromise and \naddresses many concerns about CAFE standards. It authorizes NHTSA to \nestablish tailored fuel economy standards based on vehicle size and \nweight, which removes the disparity between large-car manufacturers and \nthose that produce smaller vehicles.\n  I would like to say a word about this. I still hear that many of the \nAmerican automobile companies oppose these CAFE standards. It is truly \nunfortunate. The time for debate has come and gone. Unfortunately, some \nof the leaders of these companies have failed to make the right \ndecisions about the products they sell in America. They have failed to \ninvest in the kind of technology that would have brought us better \nmiles per gallon with safe cars, cars that serve our families and the \nneeds of our economy. They failed to do this. Sadly, other automobile \ncompanies have not failed. They have stepped in with more fuel-\nefficient cars that are now extremely popular. There are long waiting \nlines for hybrid vehicles and other cars that have real fuel economy. \nIt is a sad day for Detroit, and I feel bad for an industry which once \nused to lead the world, and I feel even worse for the workers who were \nnot part of these management decisions which unfortunately brought them \nto this moment today, decisions which resulted in cars and trucks that \nare being sold that do not serve the needs of America and its future as \nthey should.\n\n  Now we have to change. We really have to move beyond this. We have to \nurge Detroit to move beyond their current thinking. Instead of just \nselling us more of last year's model, bring us fuel efficiency, bring \nus fuel economy so we can save money at the gas pumps and stop pumping \nall of these greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, destroying \nthe climate on our planet.\n  Two years ago, BusinessWeek published a story that said:\n\n       As Congress puts the final touches on a massive new energy \n     bill, lawmakers are about to blow it. That's because the bill \n     . . . almost certainly won't include . . . a government-\n     mandated increase in average fuel economy.\n\n  That was 2 years ago. That is when I offered my amendment. That is \nwhen it failed. We cannot fail again. If we fail again, shame on this \nCongress, shame on the Members who will not look to the reality of our \nfuture, which is with more fuel economy and fewer emissions from \nvehicles.\n  We also need to move for energy efficiency in so many different \nareas--in the appliances we use and the machinery we build, certainly \nin the cars and trucks we drive. We have to realize our reliance on \nforeign oil does not make us safer but, in fact, weaker in a world of \nreal danger. We need to reduce our demand for foreign oil and increase \ndomestic sources so we do not find ourselves drawn into countries \naround the world primarily because we depend so much on the energy from \nthat country or that region. We have seen it happen over and over \nagain.\n  A New York Times article from April 20 cited a report issued by 11 \nretired admirals and generals. This report argued that climate change \ncould be a ``threat multiplier'' in already fragile parts of the world. \nRising sea levels could threaten the livelihoods of a billion people \nliving within 45 miles of Asia's coastlines; in Africa, recurring heat \nwaves, causing widespread shortages of food and water. So our \ndependence on foreign oil and the energy we consume not only sends more \nAmerican dollars abroad, sometimes to countries that do not share our \nvalues, but it tends to change the world we live in, change it in ways \nthat destabilize us and make the world less safe.\n  We want innovation to be the driver of our future, not oil. We want \nmore American jobs, a stronger economy, and a cleaner environment. We \nwant a secure future for America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, since I last had the opportunity to \nspeak, a unanimous consent was entered to vote on the amendment, No. \n1508, which has been introduced by the occupant of the chair, Senator \nSalazar, by Senator Bayh, Senator Coleman, Senator Brownback--who is, \nunfortunately, not here today but is a cosponsor--myself, and others.\n  I do wish to say that this bill sets strong targets for a reduction \nof oil consumption by America and the American people and American \nbusinesses. It does so by way of breaking what we all agree is a \nharmful dependence we have.\n  I wish to make clear that the underlying bill as proposed by the \ncommittee includes targets. So we are not doing something different by \nhaving a target; we are just saying the target ought to be to reduce \noil consumption, not just gasoline consumption, as the underlying bill \nindicates.\n  That is because we all know the problem we have in America is an \naddiction to oil. It is oil dependence, not just gasoline dependence. \nIt is all of the various uses of oil we have. To get a bit technical, \nif we only talk about reducing gasoline consumption, that might be \naccomplished by greater use of diesel, but diesel comes from oil. So we \nwould not, even if we went to diesel, decrease our dependence on \nforeign oil. So we think this is building on not just the targets in \nthe bill but building on all of the good work for energy conservation \nand energy efficiency in the bill. It would strengthen the bill.\n  The targets are a bit more ambitious and would, by our calculations, \nreduce American consumption of oil by 35 percent from what it would \notherwise be in the year 2030. That is substantial.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged equally to both sides during any ensuing quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, let me say, we are \ngetting close to the end of a good day on the bill. This is a three-\npart bill that came to us from the Energy, Natural Resources Committee, \nthe Commerce Committee, and the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nThen the majority leader put them together, and I was very proud to be \nable to come to the floor and tell the Senators and the American people \nwhat an outstanding bill this was. We had not heard much from anybody, \nand people were not quite sure what happened. But people kept saying: \nWe had an energy bill. Well, we can, at the end of the first day, say \nwe still have it. It has not been changed any. We accepted one \namendment. It was an authorizing amendment, and it enlarged upon some \npieces of the bill. But essentially it is intact.\n  And, lo and behold, without this amendment that is before us, which I \nurge the Senate not pass, that they not vote for it--it is harmless, \nbut I do not think we ought to pass it. I wish to tell you all why. To \ndo that I have to talk a little bit about the bill, because the bill \nchanges the law. If all of the things in this bill get adopted, we will \nsave huge amounts of crude oil and gasoline.\n  The other side keeps mentioning that the bill saves more gasoline and \nnot enough crude oil. But I guarantee you that if we could get the kind \nof savings that could be forthcoming from transportation fuels, America \nwould be safe, America would be happy, and we would not be dependent, \nbecause we would be using much less crude oil also.\n  So there is no difference. They are almost the same. Nonetheless, the \ntruth of the matter is that never in the history of the Congress have \nwe saved so\n\n[[Page S7533]]\n\nmuch gasoline--that is the thing that moves transportation in America: \ndiesel fuel, transportation, and related products. Never have we \nchanged America so much in terms of how much of that fuel we would use. \nWhat fuel? The fuel everybody says makes us more and more dependent, \nthe transportation fuel. Right.\n  Now, what happened is we did not adopt a bill in the Energy Committee \nor the Commerce Committee, headed by the Senator from Hawaii and \nSenator Stevens from Alaska. Those bills that produced that came from \nthese committees and are actually changes in the law.\n  Let's talk right off and say the biggest change is the CAFE \nstandards. The Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction, had the \ncourage and the guts to adopt a long-standing amendment sponsored by \nthe Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and it had been regularly \nknown as the bill that changes the CAFE standards. We adopted it. It is \nin here. The changes we have been yearning for are here. We adopted \nthem, and they are now before us. We don't have to ask anybody to make \nthe changes that will cause the biggest single savings in \ntransportation fuels that we ever did.\n\n  Then right on top of that, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nadopted a huge multiyear program to use more ethanol but ethanol that \nwould not be produced by corn but, rather, by switchgrass and come out \nof that whole area we are now researching and just almost over the \nhurdle in terms of a new kind of production of ethanol. When you add \nthe two together, it is the biggest reduction in transportation fuel we \nwill ever get.\n  I wanted to make the point that we did not set any goals; we did not \nadopt any targets; we did not ask the President to find any savings. We \nasked the President to sign a bill that will make the savings because \nwe change the law.\n  When oil savings amendments were offered in the past, people would \nsay this was a hidden CAFE standard. They were correct. When you direct \nthe executive branch to save oil in such a dramatic way, one of the \nonly ways you can do it and reach that goal is to change the CAFE \nstandards. So whenever you were telling the President to make these \nsavings, everybody would say: In transportation, the only way you can \ndo it is to change the CAFE standards. Isn't that interesting? But we \ndidn't do that here today. We changed the CAFE standards and saved oil \nand gasoline over the next 30 years, calculated as it is in the bill, \nbecause we got that done.\n  We don't need a hidden CAFE in this bill, which essentially is the \nonly way you could get to your targets in oil is to do something to \ntransportation consumption, and that means you would have to do \nsomething with the so-called hidden CAFE standards that would be \nincorporated in your suggested targets. In the bill we have, there are \nreal increases in the CAFE standards that are adopted and they were \narticulated by Senator Feinstein and talked about at length. Perhaps \nwhen we pass this amendment asking the President to save oil, perhaps \nwhen we do that--and I know my good friend, the occupant of the Chair, \nthinks that amendment I am talking about is a great thing because it \nsets targets and let's us dream, as he says, but I think all the \nPresident would have to do, if we adopt and sent to him the Bayh \namendment--that is properly the name of it because he was the first \nname on this many months ago--I would venture to say, without fear or \ntrepidation, if we had the bill we have before us today, Senator Bayh \nwouldn't be introducing this amendment with these kinds of targets, \nbecause he would look down and say: The biggest target for crude oil \nthat is used in gasoline is already done because they have changed the \nCAFE standards. They don't need another target.\n  If we continue this way and we adopt the Bayh amendment, then when \nthe President signs our bill, he can send it back to us and say: This \nis my plan, to do what you asked me to do, because in this bill we have \nalready accomplished the things you were talking about.\n  Let me say, there isn't any rancor. I am not trying to belittle \nanybody. The truth is, when you have to set targets and tell the \nPresident to achieve the targets, you have accomplished nothing. \nBecause if that is the way you could have saved crude oil in the past, \nevery President would have done it himself, would have taken us out of \nthis crisis by doing just what your targets say, go out and find them \nand do them. But you can't do them. You have to have Congress. You have \nto change laws.\n  I want to sit down for a moment and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, if I could ask a question of my friend and \ncolleague from New Mexico, I am informed that the time on our side of \nthe aisle has expired. Is it possible I could prevail upon him to \nrequest 2 minutes, perhaps?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 7 minutes 57 \nseconds. The Senator from Indiana has 1 minute 33 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What do you want, five total?\n  Mr. BAYH. If I go beyond three, it will have been an imposition.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will say five.\n  Mr. BAYH. I thank the, Senator. I appreciate that very much.\n  I want to begin by complimenting you for the excellent work you and \nSenator Bingaman have demonstrated on this bill. I know it is a matter \nof great concern to you and, frankly, I am pleased to see your \ncooperation from your State can cross party aisles just as mine with \nSenator Lugar crosses the party aisle in my own State.\n  I thank all of our colleagues, starting with Senator Lieberman for \nhis hard work and leadership. I thank Senator Salazar, who occupies the \nPresiding Officer's chair today; Senator Brownback, who could not be \nwith us. He is in the process of returning to the floor but is \nsupportive and helpful. I thank Senator Collins, Senator Norm Coleman, \nand all others who have been instrumental. Our leadership group on this \nbill extends from Senator Brownback to Senator Kerry. It includes \nDemocrats, Republicans, and even independent Democrats, suggesting the \nbreadth of our support and, more importantly, the justice of our cause.\n\n  I don't speak often on the floor. Frankly, I don't find utility in it \nthat often. But the magnitude of this issue is important to our Nation. \nIts importance to our Nation compelled me to come here today to speak \non behalf of this amendment. It is a friendly amendment designed to \nimprove what is a good work product in the underlying bill. We offer \nthis amendment for several reasons.\n  First, because the issue of oil dependency is one of the defining \nchallenges of our time. Our ability to grapple with this issue will \naffect our Nation in profound ways. It will affect finances, our \neconomy, our environment and, most importantly, the quality of the \nworld that one day we will leave to our children.\n  Unfortunately, today we are not doing nearly enough to meet this \nchallenge. We can and must do better. This is brought into stark \nreality when you realize that since the attack on 9/11, we import more \noil to this country today than we did on that day. Clearly we must do \nbetter. The expected consumption of petroleum is projected to increase \nfrom 20 million barrels per day this year to 26.8 million barrels per \nday in 2030. This is unacceptable. We have gathered here today to do \nsomething about it, to move us as far and as fast as we can to reduce \nthis dependency on imported petroleum.\n  This is affecting the quality of Americans' daily lives. I was \nlooking at some statistics before coming to the floor. American \nconsumers in the first 6 months of 2006 spent $38 billion more on \ngasoline than they did in 2005, and $57 billion more than they did in \n2004. This is an alarming trend that we don't need to bring to the \nattention of anyone who is filling up at the pump. Clearly we have to \ndo something about this. Our amendment is designed to be robust and \naggressive in doing so.\n  We have worked with a coalition of 26 of our colleagues to form the \nDRIVE Act. It spans the ideological spectrum. Our goal is to reduce oil \nimports by 2.5 million barrels per day over the next 10 years, an \nequivalent of everything we currently import from the Middle East. \nAlong with the authors of this bill, we propose that we move America in \na\n\n[[Page S7534]]\n\nbetter direction to find a better future for our children and create a \nlegacy of which we can be proud. I believe we can do that in material \nways, getting there further and faster than the underlying bill \nenvisions.\n  Our approach targets oil, petroleum, not just gasoline. Gasoline is \nan important subset of the challenge. But dependency on oil and \nparticularly imported oil gets to the heart of the challenge facing our \ncountry. That is what our amendment does. We propose an additional \nreduction of 3.8 million barrels per day, a further reduction in our \ndependency of 15 percent, a material step in improving our situation. \nFinally, we hold the administration accountable, requiring the Office \nof Management and Budget to work with the Departments of Energy and \nTransportation to come up with a specific plan, not just a goal but a \nspecific plan with concrete steps to achieve that goal and to revisit \nthat plan, to evaluate its effectiveness every 3 years, to make sure we \ndo more than pass this amendment or pass this legislation but, in fact, \nwe translate this legislation into concrete results for the American \npeople.\n  Let me conclude by saying this is a good bill. It begins to take us \nin the right direction. But now is the time to do something more than \njust good steps. Now is the time to take bold, transforming steps to \nmeet the challenges, particularly one of the defining challenges of our \ntime. Now is the time to invest in American ingenuity, to build an \nAmerican future that is more prosperous, more healthy, and more secure. \nNow is the time to forge a legacy that will enable our grandchildren \none distant day to say that we were both good stewards of our Nation \nand, most importantly, good stewards of their future.\n  That is what this bill will accomplish. That is what this amendment \nwill accomplish. That is why I urge colleagues to vote in support of \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator from New Mexico for his \nindulgence. He has been very kind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, that was an eloquent statement and I \nwant to acknowledge it. But I want to make sure those who are worried \nabout America's energy crisis know a mere statement, whether it be \nverbal or written down on a piece of paper, that says we ought to \nachieve this doesn't achieve anything. Or we in the Senate think our \ngoal should to be save 3.5 million barrels of oil and then say how \nproud we are that we are going to achieve this great goal; that doesn't \ndo anything. All you have is, if you have a bunch of targets and goals \nand they are high and they are big, you can say: We are a better \ndreamer than the other side, because we have these great dreams about \nhow much we should save and what our target should be. But think for a \nminute, what do they accomplish?\n  The truth is, the underlying bill, for a change, saves on crude oil \nconsumption and gasoline, because we have changed the CAFE standards \npermanently. As anybody in here remembers, every time we were talking \nabout saving large quantities of gasoline, if we could just change the \nCAFE standards. Remember? Well, we changed them. The biggest way to \nsave on gasoline is to change them. We changed them. We don't need a \ntarget in the bill that says we should save on gasoline. Maybe you \nshould say by changing the CAFE standards, but the President can't \nchange the CAFE standards. Only we can, and we did.\n  They have some auspicious goals, some magnificent targets. They can \nspeak eloquently about what will be required to do them. But the point \nis, they don't save one single penny's worth of gasoline. They don't \nachieve 10 cents' worth of savings. They are merely goals, things we \nwish to do. I guarantee you that the bill they are attaching this \namendment to for a change will truly save by changing the CAFE \nstandards permanently. By changing the standard for ethanol and the \nsecond generation of ethanol, we will save more on gasoline and then on \ncrude oil, which it comes from, than we have ever done before. So we \ndon't need an amendment to a terrific bill. The bill is something we \ncan be very proud of. Three committees participated. They did it \nbipartisanly.\n  Now we have bold and high words about what the President should do \nbecause it says the President shall find ways to achieve these \ngoals. That is essentially the plan: Mr. President, we have these \ngoals. Mr. President, you go talk to OMB and you achieve them.\n\n  That is it. I do not believe anybody thinks that will work. But I \nwould say, if it passes, I do not know what it does, and I do not know \nwhat we would do with it because I do not know how you get any savings \nfrom that kind of proposal.\n  But I kind of know where we are. A lot of Senators and non-Senators \ngot together before we were here with this bill and decided they would \nintroduce a bill that sounded good, that set high goals, and they did. \nThen we come along with a bill that actually does it, and they want to \namend it to get in on the action, which I do not believe would \naccomplish much.\n  I compliment the Senators for the way they have worked, and in \nparticular Senator Bayh, whom we do not see very much, but I see him a \nlot, and I am pleased always to see him. I say to the Senator, I thank \nyou for the way you have responded.\n  I wish to say again, I don't believe with the bill we need your bill. \nWith the bill that is underlying, we do not need another bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, last Wednesday I came to the floor and \nintroduced legislation that would place the country in a new direction, \na path toward a better energy future, by requiring that 25 percent of \nelectricity be provided by renewable sources in this country. For me, \nthis is not that radical an idea, since my State, the State of \nMinnesota, just enacted this plan this past year. It was brought into \nlaw by an overwhelming majority, a bipartisan majority in a Democratic-\ncontrolled legislature, and signed into law by a Republican Governor. \nIn fact, it is even higher for Xcel Energy, which is our largest \nelectricity company. They are bound to a 30-percent standard. In fact, \nthe CEO of that company came and sat in my office and told me that he \nfelt they could meet that standard without increasing rates.\n  Part of this is that Minnesota has been on the front end of \nrenewables. We have done it with fuel, with biodiesel, and with \nethanol--in fact, we have about a third of this country's ethanol that \ncomes right in our State. And we have done it with wind. We have so \nmany wind turbines right now down in southeastern Minnesota, in the \nPipestone area, that they have actually opened a bed and breakfast. If \nyou are looking for an interesting weekend, you can go to the bed and \nbreakfast in Pipestone, MN, and wake up in the morning and look at a \nwind turbine.\n  But this is serious stuff. I was proud to introduce that 25-by-25 \nstandard, but I also want to say that I support the standard the \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, is introducing in the next few \ndays, and that is a 15 percent by 2020 standard.\n  Our current path has led us to record-high electricity and natural \ngas prices. These prices are not only hurting ordinary families, but \nthey are also hurting businesses that see their own costs going up \ndramatically. The growth of energy-intensive industries, such as \nmanufacturing, is actually being stunted due to skyrocketing energy \ncosts. We already know the negative impact this situation is having on \nthe environment. It is clear that we need a new direction, that we \ncannot continue down the energy path we are on anymore. A strong \nrenewable energy policy is good for this country.\n  Currently, I will say, we do not have a diversified electricity \nportfolio. Mr. President, 52 percent of our electricity comes from \ncoal, 20 percent is generated using nuclear power, 15 percent natural \ngas, 7 percent hydro, and only 2.5 percent from renewable energy. A \nstrong renewable electricity standard can actually diversify our energy \nsources so we are not so reliant on one energy source, such as natural \ngas, that could be vulnerable to periodic shortages or other supply \ninterruptions.\n  A strong renewable energy standard can also save the American \nconsumer money. According to several studies, a 15-percent renewable \nelectricity standard will save consumers a total of $16.4 billion on \ntheir energy bills by the year 2030. An aggressive national standard \nwill also open the door to a new electricity industry that will bring \nin thousands of jobs and pump billions of dollars into our economy.\n  Over the last 20 years, America's renewable energy industries, and \nthe wind industry in particular, have achieved significant \ntechnological advancements. The industries for solar, wind, and biomass \nenergy systems are expanding at rates exceeding 30 percent annually, \nand the clean energy revolution is still in its infancy. So the \nquestion is, Does the United States want to be a leader in creating new \ngreen technologies and the new green industries in the future? Are we \ngoing to sit back and watch the opportunities pass us by?\n  We are no longer the world leader in two important energy fields. We \nrank third now in wind production between Denmark and Spain. We are \nalso third in solar power installed, behind Germany and Japan. \nIronically, these countries surpassed us by using technology that was \nactually developed in our own country. We came up with the right ideas, \nbut we didn't have a plan or the standards in place to adequately fund \nthe deployment of these technologies. That is because the Federal \nGovernment has been complacent and let the States take the lead. That \nis good in some ways. The States, as Justice Brandeis noted, are the \nlaboratories of democracy. He always talked about, in that one opinion, \nhow an individual State can have the courage to experiment and bring us \nnew ideas on a national basis. But I don't think he ever meant this \nshould mean inaction by the Federal Government. Sadly, that is what has \nbeen happening.\n  Twenty-two States now throughout the country have already \ndemonstrated the value of establishing renewable electricity standards. \nAs I mentioned, Minnesota has been one of the most aggressive with its \n25-by-25 standard.\n  The way that bipartisan standard was set, with a Democratic \nlegislature and a Republican Governor, should be a model for national \naction. The courage that we have seen in the States must be matched by \ncourage in Washington. We have an opportunity in the next 2 weeks for \nthe Federal Government to act. It is time for the Federal Government to \nbegin moving toward an aggressive national standard on power with State \nstandards.\n  We have everything we need, we just need to act. I have talked to \nmany investors and businesspeople, and part of the issue is we never \nthink in the long term in government. We don't set these standards out \nbecause when you set those standards out, the money is going to follow \nin terms of investment. But they think the standard is going to change \nor maybe we just set it for the next 2 years instead of setting it out \nas Senator Bingaman has suggested in his amendment for the year 2020, \nwhen we get stronger investment confidence in what we are going to be \ndoing in this country and the new direction in which we are going to be \nheaded in this country.\n  We have the fields to grow the energy that will keep our Nation \nmoving, and we have the wind energy to propel our economy forward right \nhere in the United States. We have the science, we have the \nuniversities, we have the technological know-how. We always believe in \nscience.\n  In my State, we brought the world the Post-it note and the pacemaker. \nWe have always been on the front end in science. That is why the people \nwho are committed to a strong, renewable standard in our State are not \njust limited to the people who might be investing in it. It is students \nat the university who see the potential. It is kids who wear little \nbuttons about ``save our penguins.'' It is the city council down in \nLanesboro, MN, that recently changed out all of their lightbulbs \nbecause they are concerned about climate change. It is farmers who are \nputting up wind turbines in their backyard because they know it is \ngoing to save them money. It is school districts that say: Maybe I will \nget a wind turbine. It is governments across this land, with mayors and \ncity councils that are installing solar energy, that see the future and \nsee this new direction.\n  It is our job in the next 2 weeks to lead the new direction. And that \nis why I support a strong renewable standard. That is why I urge my \nfellow Senators to support the amendment, which I am already \ncosponsoring, for a 15-percent renewable standard for electricity in \nthis country. We have to start now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7535-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7535-S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, there is a term that is often used here in \nthe Senate when members refer to one another. That term is \n``gentleman.'' No one fit that term better than Senator Craig Thomas. I \njoin with all my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in mourning \nthe loss of Senator Thomas, and in extending our condolences to his \nwonderful wife Susan and the entire Thomas family.\n  In the 10 years I was privileged to serve with Senator Thomas in this \nChamber, I never once heard him raise his voice, and I never once saw \nhim lose his temper. But that doesn't mean that Senator Thomas was not \na fighter for his beloved Wyoming. In fact, he was a very effective \nadvocate for the people of Wyoming and all of rural America. His \naccomplishments were not the result of shouting. They were the result \nof perseverance, integrity, and a whole lot of hard work.\n  I was privileged to serve with Senator Thomas on a number of \ncommittees, where I saw firsthand the scope of his interests and his \neffectiveness. On the Finance Committee, I saw how he was a champion \nfor better health care for rural Americans, and I saw how he worked to \nopen markets for the cattlemen, farmers, and soda ash producers of \nWyoming.\n  On the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, he brought Wyoming's \nunique perspective to the forefront on the energy debate, and, as \nchairman and ranking member of the National Parks Subcommittee, he \nbrought the first reform overhaul to the National Parks Service in 20 \nyears--a vital step in a State that is home to the Yellowstone National \nPark, one of the crown jewels of our park system.\n  And I served with Craig on the Indian Affairs committee, where the \nEastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes of Wyoming's Wild River \nReservation and Native Americans across the country could always count \non his commitment to improving their lives.\n  Although Craig Thomas spent the last 18 years of his life working in \nthe corridors of the U.S. Capitol, he never forgot where he came from. \nHe was a true westerner, a straight-talker, and he was always just \n``Craig'' to his constituents. Always at Craig's side was his wife and \npartner Susan, who is always a remarkable, eloquent advocate for \nWyoming. The last several months have been difficult and challenging \nones for Craig, and Susan was always there for him.\n  Mr. President, my wife Sharon joins with me in extending our \ncondolences to Susan, the Thomas family, and the people of Wyoming. I \ncan say without hesitation that the ``gentleman from Wyoming'' will \nalways be remembered by those of us who were fortunate to serve with \nhim, and by all those he served with such diligence and distinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7536-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to join the majority leader in \nmarking a solemn milestone in the war in Iraq. Three thousand five \nhundred members of the armed services have died fighting in Iraq. Like \nthose before them who died serving their country, those 3,500 men and \nwomen have served honorably. We are all indebted to them for their \ncourage and patriotism, as we are indebted to the 25,950 troops who \nhave been wounded.\n  It has been just under a year since the 2,500th U.S. servicemember \ndied in Iraq. With the toll of this war continuing to mount, \nparticularly since the President decided to escalate our involvement, \nwe must redouble our efforts to change course in Iraq. We owe it to the \ntroops serving in Iraq. These brave men and women signed up to defend \ntheir country, not to police an Iraqi civil war. Many of these \nindividuals chose to join the Armed Forces as a result of the horrific \nattacks of September 11. Yet they have found themselves fighting in a \ncountry that had nothing to do with those attacks. As they endure \nuntold hardship in Iraq, al-Qaida and its extremist network are \nrebuilding in Afghanistan, northern Africa and around the globe.\n  As I am sure my colleagues have done, I have been to the memorial \nservices honoring the dead, I have handed the wounded their Purple \nHearts, I have spoken to the parents whose children have returned from \nwar with brain injuries they will live with for the rest of their \nlives. These experiences are a constant reminder of the responsibility \nwe have to the brave individuals who have volunteered to defend their \ncountry. We have a duty to ensure that when they are asked to fight on \nour behalf, it is not on the basis of false premises and shifting \nrationales. We have a duty not to put them in harm's way when there is \nno exit strategy. Most importantly, we have a duty to bring them home \nbecause we know there is no military solution to the war they are \nfighting.\n  We must help the Iraqi people rebuild their country and we must work \nto build the broad international coalition that is needed to help bring \npeace and stability to Iraq. But our servicemembers in Iraq have been \nasked to do the impossible--they have been asked to resolve political \nand other differences by military force. The Congress has the power to \nchange this misguided policy by forcing the President to redeploy U.S. \ntroops. Measures that express the need for a policy shift, and concern \nfor the well-being of the troops, may be well-intended but they do not \ngo far enough and they will not help the troops. Only binding \nlegislation requiring redeployment will prevent further brave \nservicemembers from losing their lives for this administration's failed \nand self-defeating policies.\n  Many soldiers serving in Iraq have written to me to express their \nsupport for my efforts to end this war. It is with them in mind that I \nwill continue working to end this tragic mistake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7536-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COLLAPSE OF THE BERLIN WALL\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to note that exactly 20 years \nago, on June 12, 1987, President Ronald Reagan stood at the Berlin \nwall, at the Brandenburg Gate, and issued his--issued liberty's--famous \nchallenge to Soviet tyranny:\n\n       General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek \n     prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you \n     seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, \n     open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\n\n  Although that speech was deeply rooted in the Cold War, and is indeed \nseen as a significant milestone in that war, it also spoke larger \ntruths. President Reagan also said:\n\n       Freedom leads to prosperity. Freedom replaces the ancient \n     hatreds among the nations with comity and peace. Freedom is \n     the victor.\n\n  President Reagan was not just addressing West Berlin, and the Soviet \nGeneral Secretary, he was addressing the world, and posterity. He was \nexpounding on the American ideal of liberty and justice for all. He was \nnot addressing a regional problem, but mankind's aspirations. It was a \ntriumphant moment for Americans and our ideals.\n  Accordingly, I have previously submitted a resolution, S. Con. Res. \n1, calling for an artistic rendering of that moment in time to be \npainted into the Capitol, along with the other significant scenes of \nour Nation's past. As we walk through the building today, we can see \nscenes from the Nation's founding, from the Civil War, our westward \nexpansion, even the Moon landing and Challenger astronauts. I would \nlike to also see Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate. I think it would be \nentirely appropriate to have this image added. It would be an important \nreminder of the struggle this Nation undertook. It would stand for the \nmillions of Americans who did their part for nearly half a century in \nthat struggle, both military and civilian. And it would testify to the \ngreatness of our Nation, and the greatness of our 40th President.\n  Today I am adding cosponsors to that resolution. I urge my remaining \ncolleagues to join me as well. This is worth doing.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7537-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7537]]\n                   POLLINATOR HABITAT PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President I rise today to speak about S. 1496, the \nPollinator Habitat Protection Act, which I introduced on May 24. \nPulitzer Prize-winning insect biologist E.O. Wilson said the honeybee \nis nature's ``workhorse--and we took it for granted.'' That statement \nsums up the state of the Nation's honey bee.\n  Our Nation's honeybees are being affected by a phenomenon named \ncolony collapse disorder, and the symptoms are baffling. Since October \n2006, 35 percent or more of the United States' population of the \nWestern honeybee--billions of individual bees--simply flew from their \nhives and disappeared.\n  We don't know what is causing their disappearance. The honeybee is an \nactive pollinator for both agriculture and native plants. It is used \ncommercially to pollinate crops across the country, and some crops, \nlike apples and almonds, will not produce fruit without the assistance \nof the honeybee. My home State of Montana is the country's fifth \nlargest honey-producing State. Without bees, Montana would not produce \nour famous huckleberries.\n  During busy years, a hive might make up to five cross-country trips, \nfollowing the crop blooming cycles. Scientists are speculating that the \nbees are stressed from making cross-country journeys and are being \nattacked by viruses and parasites. Either way, this is an emergency \nsituation, and we have to do something now.\n  That is why I am introducing the Pollinator Habitat Protection Act. \nThis bill is simple and it makes sense. It is the right thing to do.\n  Through the use of the existing conservation programs in the farm \nbill, agricultural producers would receive incentives to rebuild \nnatural habitat with flowering plants to benefit pollinators such as \nhoney bees. For example, instead of planting straight grass, a producer \ncould plant clover, alfalfa, or other native flowering plants on land \nenrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program.\n  Perhaps this bill's most attractive feature is that it does not cost \nadditional money or create a new program. It simply requires existing \nconservation programs to acknowledge pollinator habitat as a \nconservation resource and rewards producers whose conservation \npractices are beneficial for pollinators.\n  When the budget is tight, it is better to improve existing programs \nrather than create new ones. This is a dramatic important improvement \nfor our conservation programs.\n  It is not often we can protect our environment and increase \nproducer's income at the same time. But that is exactly what this bill \nwill do. This is one simple way to help out our honeybee population and \ngive farmers another option to make money on their land.\n  As a honorary cochair of the Pollinator Partnership, I am honored to \nintroduce this legislation. I thank organizations like the Coevolution \nInstitute which are doing the right thing, by bringing a diverse group \nof people together from across the country to address this challenging \nissue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1496 the Pollinator Habitat \nProtection Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7537-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7537-S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WORLD DAY AGAINST CHILD LABOR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, June 12, is the annual observance \nof the International Labor Organization's World Day Against Child \nLabor. This is the day we set aside each year to speak out against the \nfact that millions of children around the globe continue to be trapped \nin forced and abusive labor, often in extremely hazardous conditions.\n  For many years, I have been active in efforts to stop exploitative \nchild labor as well as trafficking in child and female slaves around \nthe world. In my travels, I have seen this scourge firsthand. I have \ncome to the floor of the Senate many times to speak about this issue. I \nhave spoken about how shocked I was to see the deplorable conditions \nunder which these kids are forced to work. Many are physically, \nemotionally, and sexually abused. All of them, every child engaged in \nabusive child labor, is deprived of a childhood solely for someone \nelse's gain.\n  Why should we as a nation tolerate children being used in such a \nmanner? We should not. It is a moral outrage and an affront to human \ndignity. When a child is exploited for the economic gains of others, \nnot only does the child lose, but the family loses, and I think the \nwhole world loses. It is bad economics, and it is bad development \nstrategy. A nation cannot achieve prosperity on the backs of its \nchildren, and there must be no place in the global economy for child \nlabor.\n  This year, the World Day Against Child Labor specifically shines a \nspotlight on child laborers in agriculture. This has been a special \nconcern for me going back many years. I have been especially concerned \nabout forced child labor in the cocoa industry.\n  In 2001, the Knight-Ridder syndicate ran a series of articles on \nforced child labor on cocoa farms in West Africa. According to one of \nthose articles, child laborers in Ivory Coast ``are whipped, beaten, \nand broken like horses to harvest the almond-sized beans that are made \ninto chocolate treats for more fortunate children in Europe and the \nUnited States.''\n  When I read these articles, I resolved to do everything I could to \nend this tragic exploitation of children. Together with Congressman \nEliot Engel of New York, we engaged the major chocolate companies in \nlengthy, intense negotiations. The result was what is now called the \nHarkin-Engel protocol, an agreement that aims to ensure that cocoa \nbeans are grown and processed in a manner that complies with the \nInternational Labor Organization Convention 182 concerning the \nprohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms \nof child labor.\n  The Harkin-Engel protocol, signed in September 2001, applies \neverywhere that cocoa is grown and processed. It laid out a series of \ndate-specific actions, including the development of credible, mutually \nacceptable, voluntary industry-wide standards of public certification \nby July 1, 2005 in order to give a public accounting of labor practices \nin cocoa farming. Although I was disappointed that the July 2005 \ndeadline was not fully met by the industry, we have continued to work \ntogether and the rollout of the certification system--including \nmonitoring, data analysis reporting, and activities to reduce the worst \nforms of child labor--will proceed as aggressively as possible in Ivory \nCoast and Ghana with the goal of covering 50 percent of the two \ncountries' cocoa producing areas by July of 2008. This is, indeed, a \nmilestone on the path toward the ultimate goal of 100 percent coverage \nin cocoa-producing countries around the world.\n  The clock is ticking. The corporations and national governments that \nwere party to the Harkin-Engel protocol are moving forward. For \nexample, the Government of Ghana has conducted a pilot project and the \nresults were released. However, the results still need to be \nindependently verified, and I am hopeful that the industry will work \nwith the Ghanaian government to have these preliminary reports \nindependently verified in accordance with the protocol. Additionally, \nthe Ivorian government has only recently begun to conduct a pilot \ncertification process. It is a good start, but that pilot needs to be \nscaled up in order to give more realistic results for the main harvest \nseason.\n  The Harkin-Engel protocol marks an important first--an entire \nindustry, including companies from the United States, Europe, and the \nUnited Kingdom taking responsibility for addressing the worst forms of \nchild labor and forced labor in its supply chain.\n  Today the protocol stands as a framework for progress in West Africa, \nbringing together industry, West African governments, organized labor, \nnongovernmental organizations, farmers groups, and experts in a \nconcerted effort to eliminate the worst forms of child labor and forced \nlabor from the growing and processing of cocoa.\n  To further assist in the effort to eradicate child labor, in my \ncapacity as chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, this \npast April I convened a hearing to facilitate collaborative efforts by \nadvocacy groups in the child labor field. In light of the International \nLabor Organization's report last year, the discussion focused on how \nbest to continue the cooperative international effort to eradicate \nchild labor.\n\n[[Page S7538]]\n\n  The ILO global report, ``The End of Child Labor: Within Reach,'' \nstates that for the first time child labor, especially in its worst \nforms, is in decline across the globe. Between the years 2000 and 2004, \nthe number of child laborers worldwide fell by 11 percent, from 246 \nmillion to 218 million. Even better, the number of children and youth \naged 5-17 trapped in hazardous work decreased by 26 percent, declining \nfrom 171 million in 2000 to 126 million in 2004. Among younger child \nlaborers, the drop was even sharper at 33 percent.\n  This is remarkable progress in just 4 years' time. And looking to the \nfuture, the report cautiously predicts that, if the current pace of \ndecline is maintained, and if global efforts to stop child labor \ncontinue, we have a real shot at eliminating child labor in its worst \nforms within 10 years' time.\n  Today, 218 million child laborers--many of whom are trapped in the \nworst forms of child labor, such as prostitution, armed conflicts, and \nslavery--are still suffering. While the U.S. Government and \ninternational organizations such as the World Bank and UNICEF have \nprograms designed to reduce abusive and exploitative child labor, it \nwill require all of these entities and others working together if we \nare to reach the goal of ending the worst forms of child labor by the \nyear 2016.\n  Likewise, in the broader fight against child labor, the ILO report \nverifies that we are on the right track to eliminate abusive and \nexploitative child labor. The great work of the ILO's International \nProgram on the Elimination of Child Labor, IPEC, affirms the confidence \nI placed in this program early on. I secured the first Federal \nappropriation for the IPEC program back in 1996, and over the last \ndecade, I have secured a total of more than $323 million for the \nprogram. Clearly, that money has made a real difference in the lives of \nchildren. It has given millions of children an opportunity to get an \neducation and to break the cycle of poverty.\n  Although there has been a tremendous amount of progress in ending \nchild labor, now is not the time to become complacent. Economic \ndevelopment alone is not enough. We must also focus on human rights and \neducational opportunities for those in poverty. Social change must go \nhand in hand with economic development, which requires workers' and \nemployers' organizations. Our keys to success will be mainstreaming \nchild labor efforts with other human rights and development goals, as \nwell as getting national governments, NGOs, and international \norganizations working cooperatively to end child poverty.\n  We should not think about these children only on June 12 each year. \nWe should think about this last vestige of slavery 365 days a year. I \nhave remained steadfast in my commitment to eliminating abusive and \nexploitative child labor. It was in 1992 that I first introduced a bill \nto ban all products made by abusive and exploitative child labor from \nentering the United States. And I am committed to working with the \nrepresentatives of the cocoa industry and the national governments to \nimplement the Harkin-Engel Protocol by July 1, 2008 deadline.\n  In my view, we can make significant progress to eliminate this \nscourge if we all do our part and redouble our efforts. This means that \ngovernments must not merely pass laws but enforce them, while also \nstriving to provide quality free education. Businesses must take \nresponsibility, as well, by not hiring children, and by paying adults \nlivable wages so they can provide for their families. Multilateral \ninstitutions must also play a robust role. Together, we can eliminate \nthe worst forms of child labor by 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7538-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   75TH ANNIVERSARY OF JACOB'S PILLOW\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this month marks the 75th anniversary \nseason of Jacob's Pillow. Based in Becket, MA, it is the longest \nrunning dance festival in the United States. Jacob's Pillow is renowned \nin the dance world for its commitment to excellence and beloved by \naudiences throughout the world for the quality and diversity of its \nprogramming.\n  This prestigious organization is one of the most significant cultural \ngroups in Western Massachusetts and it attracts tens of thousands of \nvisitors to the beautiful Berkshire Mountains each summer. Cultural \ntourism is the second largest industry in Massachusetts, and cultural \njewels such as Jacob's Pillow are the anchors of the industry. Year \nafter year, surveys demonstrate that arts, culture, and heritage are \namong the top reasons for visiting Massachusetts.\n  With its proud heritage, Jacob's Pillow continues to be one of the \nmost dynamic centers of dance in our State and across the country. As \nMikhail Baryshnikov has said, ``Jacob's Pillow is one of America's most \nprecious cultural assets--a haven for choreographers and dancers and an \nenvironment that nurtures the creation of new work.''\n  The site was originally a family farm settled with extraordinary \npioneering spirit in the 1700s, and it became a station on the \nUnderground Railroad in the 19th century for slaves escaping to \nfreedom.\n  In 1933, Jacob's Pillow was established as a dance festival and \nschool. Its mission continues today to support dance creation, \npresentation, education, and preservation. Through this work, it \nbroadens appreciation and understanding for classical and modern \ndance--and it provides an important opportunity for dancers and \nchoreographers to develop their own work and skills.\n  In addition to its regular programming, Jacob's Pillow also offers \nover 200 free events each season, including performances, workshops, \nlectures, and discussions with artists. It maintains a preservation \nprogram with rare archives open to the public, a training program for \narts administrators, year-round community programs, and a creative \ndevelopment residency program.\n  Jacob's Pillow also encompasses a professional school training and \nmentoring program for emerging dancers and is recognized throughout the \nglobe as a center for arts leadership in the world of dance.\n  It is the first and only dance institution in the United States to be \ndeclared a National Historic Landmark for its important part in our \ncountry's cultural heritage. It embodies the very best in cultural \nachievement and has enhanced the causes of the many talented artists \nwho have performed on its stages and enhanced the lives of countless \naudiences who have enjoyed their exceptional performances.\n  As President Kennedy said, ``I am certain that after the dust of \ncenturies has passed over our cities, we, too, will be remembered not \nfor victories or defeats in battle or in politics, but for our \ncontribution to the human spirit.''\n  I commend the many dedicated persons who have made Jacob's Pillow \nsuch a remarkable success over the past 75 years. May this treasure of \nBerkshire County continue to enrich us all in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7538-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7538-S7539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE OF CFE STATES PARTIES\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, on May 28, 2007, Russia requested an \nExtraordinary Conference of States Parties to the Treaty on \nConventional Armed Forces in Europe--the CFE Treaty--to discuss what \nRussia identified as ``exceptional circumstances'' that may lead them \nto suspend implementation of the treaty. Russia complains that most of \ntheir former Warsaw Pact allies have now joined NATO, significantly \naltering, in Russia's view, the ``balance'' of forces in Europe. This \nExtraordinary Conference is now under way in Vienna, Austria. What \nhappens there will have tremendous implications for the security of \nEurope and for U.S.-Russian relations. Both sides must avoid actions \nthat could lead to the potential unraveling of a treaty that has served \nas a cornerstone of European security since the end of the Cold War.\n  In 1990, the CFE was conceived as a mechanism to reduce post-Cold-War \narsenals of conventional weapons in Europe and has evolved into a \nstabilizing influence through its wide range of agreed verification \nmeasures. This treaty should not be relegated to the dustbin of \nhistory. That is not in the interest of all European States, including \nRussia, nor of the United States.\n  The CFE Treaty was originally designed to limit the possibility of a \nsurprise attack on Europe, when the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact still \nexisted. It imposes numerical limits on\n\n[[Page S7539]]\n\nmajor conventional military weapons--battle tanks, armored combat \nvehicles, artillery, combat aircraft, and attack helicopters--that can \nbe deployed within Europe. These limits are verifiable through an \nextensive regime of inspections, transparency measures, and data \nexchanges. To be sure, since the Cold War ended, most countries, \nespecially in central Europe, have reduced their levels of conventional \nweapons well below the limits specified by the treaty. Nonetheless, the \nverification measures that continue in place to the present day provide \na level of openness and predictability important to the continued \nstability of Europe.\n  The ``exceptional circumstances'' referred to in Russia's request for \nan Extraordinary Conference of the CFE States Parties are of Russia's \nown making, and Russia holds the key to their resolution. At the end of \nthe last decade, the CFE Treaty was updated to reflect post-Cold-War \nrealities in Europe. The Adapted CFE Treaty was signed in 1999 at \nIstanbul, Turkey; however, it has not entered into force. Ratification \nof the treaty by the United States and its NATO allies will not occur \nuntil Russia implements two political commitments it made at the time \nof the treaty's signing.\n  In 1999, Russia pledged that it would fully withdraw its forces from \nthe territories of Georgia and Moldova, which were part of the former \nSoviet Union. One of the CFE Treaty's fundamental tenets is that a \nnation must give its consent for the stationing or deployment of \nforeign military forces on its territory. NATO nations have insisted \nthat Russia live up to this fundamental principle and abide by its \ncommitments. In the Senate, we have made clear to administration \nofficials that we would give advice and consent to ratification of the \nAdapted CFE Treaty's provisions only when and if Russia satisfied these \ncommitments.\n  Russia has protested that its commitments regarding Georgia and \nMoldova were not related to the CFE Treaty. However, both the Georgian \nand Moldovan Governments have said repeatedly that they want Russian \nforces withdrawn from their territories. This has become a central \nissue in the CFE Treaty debate. Russia possesses the ability and the \nmeans to fulfill these commitments, needing only to close a single, \nlargely abandoned Russian base in Georgia, and to withdraw a few \nhundred troops and an ammunition storage depot in Moldova. Russia has \nmade progress in Georgia, but very little in Moldova since 2004.\n  The United States is prepared to find ways to work through its \ndifferences with Russia on important security issues in ways that \nrecognize shared interests. Russia's threatened suspension of the CFE \ndoes not demonstrate a reciprocal view and could lead to the unraveling \nof the CFE Treaty itself. Nevertheless, the Extraordinary Conference \ncan serve as an opportunity to modernize the Cold-War-era CFE Treaty in \na direction that reflects the current security environment in Europe \nand one in which all parties can completely fulfill their commitments.\n  The administration's proposal to multilateralize the current Russian \npeacekeeping forces in Moldova, perhaps under the auspices of the NATO-\nRussia Council, merits serious consideration. In Georgia, Russia has \nalready taken significant steps to reduce its troop presence the \nremaining steps are far less demanding but just as important. The \nExtraordinary Conference should offer a new beginning, rather than the \nbeginning of the end.\n  The United States and its NATO Allies believe that the Adapted CFE \nTreaty offers the best path toward ensuring a Europe united and at \npeace, one in which Russia honors its commitments. If this were to \noccur, then, and only then, would the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the United States Senate be likely to begin a careful, \nexpeditious review leading to U.S. ratification of the Adapted CFE \nTreaty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7539-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING SENATE CHAPLAIN BARRY C.

JAMES A. LAKE\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge a special \nmilestone in the career of one of the truly great nuclear energy \nluminaries of our time. I am speaking of the retirement of Dr. James A. \nLake of Idaho National Laboratory.\n  During his nearly quarter-century of service to Idaho National \nLaboratory--and by extension, to all of America--Dr. Lake has applied \nhis exceptional technical and managerial expertise to some of this \nNation's highest priority research and development initiatives in the \nnuclear energy arena. From leading the design team that developed an \ninnovative ultra-high-flux research reactor concept early in his Idaho \ncareer, to guiding the establishment of the U.S./Russian International \nCenters for Environmental Safety later on, Dr. Lake's contributions \nhave had an extraordinary impact.\n  As the elected president of the American Nuclear Society at the start \nof the 21st century, Dr. Lake did much to usher in the nuclear \nrenaissance now sweeping the globe. In a single year, he personally \nvisited 11 countries, a dozen universities, and more than 20 nuclear \npowerplants and nuclear facilities around the world. He also gave \ncountless interviews with major television, newspaper, and magazine \njournalists--representing CNBC, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington \nPost, BusinessWeek and others--to help them better understand nuclear \npower's unique abilities to dependably generate massive amounts of \nelectricity--around the clock, rain or shine--without generating any of \nthe greenhouse gases that are now of such global concern.\n  Beyond his contributions to INL and the American Nuclear Society, Dr. \nLake has also left his indelible mark of excellence on countless other \norganizations and activities ranging from the American Association of \nEngineering Societies to the International Nuclear Societies Council. \nHe holds patents on ``An Inherently Safe Fast Breeder Reactor'' and \nother key nuclear technologies and has more than 35 publications in \nrefereed journals and conference proceedings.\n  Dr. James A. Lake--scientist, research leader, nuclear energy \nvisionary, and gentleman--leaves a legacy of growth, safety, and \nsuccess in the nuclear programs at INL, for which the laboratory, the \ngreat State of Idaho, and the Nation will be forever grateful. I extend \nmy best wishes to Dr. Lake as he retires from INL and moves on to the \nnext chapter of his remarkable life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7540-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I would like to commemorate \nthe 65th anniversary of the founding of Holloman Air Force Base near \nAlamogordo, NM, on June 10, 1942.\n  Established 6 months after the entry of the United States into the \nSecond World War, Holloman served as a training center for B-17, B-24, \nand B-29 bomber crews for the duration of that conflict. Over the \ncourse of the war, 20 bomber groups trained at Holloman before serving \nin the European and Pacific theaters of the war.\n  After the war, Holloman became the primary Air Force base for the \ntesting and development of guided missiles and unmanned aircraft. \nHolloman was also the site of several notable events, including a 1954 \nrocket-propelled sled test that reached speeds of 632 miles per hour \nand earned Dr. John P. Stapp the title of ``Fastest Man Alive.'' \nAdditionally, Holloman was the location of CPT Joseph W. Kittinger, \nJr's, 102,800 feet skydive in 1960 that broke four world records and it \nwas there that ENOS, the chimpanzee who made the first American animal \norbital flight, received his training.\n  In 1968, a new era at Holloman began with the arrival of the 49th \nTactical Fighter Wing. For the last 39 years, the 49th has called \nHolloman home and has flown F-4 Phantom IIs, F-15 Eagles and in 1992 \nbecame the only Air Force unit equipped with the F-117 Nighthawk, also \nknown as the stealth fighter. Holloman also serves as the home to the \nGerman Air Force Tactical Training Center.\n  Today, Holloman is preparing for another major transition. As the F-\n117 is retired, the 49th will begin to receive new F-22 Raptors. Since \nits founding, Holloman has played an important role in the development \nof new technologies and has been home to the world's most advanced \naircraft. Most importantly though, I believe it is the men and women \nwho serve at Holloman who make it one of this country's premier \nmilitary installations. I would like to thank all those who served and \ncontinue to serve at Holloman for their hard work and dedication. I \nhave no doubt the work done at Holloman will continue to contribute to \nthe national security of the United States for another 65 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7540-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7540-S7542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING ROBERT M. \n                              La FOLLETTE\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I honor the extraordinary \nlife of Robert M. La Follette, Sr. This week, on June 14, people around \nmy home State of Wisconsin will mark the 152nd anniversary of La \nFollette's birth. Throughout his life, La Follette was revered for his \ntireless service to the people of Wisconsin and to the people of the \nUnited States. His dogged, full-steam-ahead approach to his life's work \nearned him the nickname ``Fighting Bob.''\n  Robert Marion La Follette, Sr., was born on June 14, 1855, in \nPrimrose, a small town southwest of Madison in Dane County. He \ngraduated from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1879 and, \nafter being admitted to the State bar, began his long career in public \nservice as Dane County district attorney.\n  La Follette was elected to the House of Representatives in 1884, and \nhe served three terms as a Member of that body, where he was a member \nof the Ways and Means Committee.\n  After losing his campaign for reelection in 1890, La Follette \nreturned to Wisconsin and continued to serve the people of my State as \na judge. Upon his exit from Washington, DC, a reporter wrote, La \nFollette ``is popular at home, popular with his colleagues, and popular \nin the House. He is so good a fellow that even his enemies like him.''\n\n[[Page S7541]]\n\n  He was elected the 20th Governor of Wisconsin in 1900. He served in \nthat office until 1906, when he stepped down in order to serve the \npeople of Wisconsin in the Senate, where he remained until his death in \n1925.\n  As a founder of the national progressive movement, La Follette \nchampioned progressive causes as Governor of Wisconsin and in the \nCongress. As Governor, he advanced an agenda that included the \ncountry's first workers' compensation system, direct election of \nSenators, and railroad rate and tax reforms. Collectively, these \nreforms would become known as the ``Wisconsin Idea.'' As Governor, La \nFollette also supported cooperation between the State and the \nUniversity of Wisconsin.\n  His terms in the House of Representatives and the Senate were spent \nfighting for women's rights, working to limit the power of monopolies, \nand opposing pork-barrel legislation. La Follette also advocated \nelectoral reforms, and he brought his support of the direct election of \nSenators to this body. His efforts were brought to fruition with the \nratification of the 17th amendment in 1913. Fighting Bob also worked \ntirelessly to hold the Government accountable and was a key figure in \nexposing the Teapot Dome scandal.\n  La Follette earned the respect of such notable Americans as Frederick \nDouglass, Booker T. Washington and Harriet Tubman Upton for making \ncivil rights one of his trademark issues. At a speech before the 1886 \ngraduating class of Howard University, La Follette said:\n\n       We are one people, one by truth, one almost by blood. Our \n     lives run side by side, our ashes rest in the same soil. \n     [Seize] the waiting world of opportunity. Separatism is \n     snobbish stupidity, it is supreme folly, to talk of non-\n     contact, or exclusion!\n\n  La Follette ran for President three times, twice as a Republican and \nonce on the Progressive ticket. In 1924, as the Progressive candidate \nfor President, La Follette garnered more than 17 percent of the popular \nvote and carried the State of Wisconsin.\n  La Follette's years of public service were not without controversy. \nIn 1917, he filibustered a bill to allow the arming of U.S. merchant \nships in response to a series of German submarine attacks. His \nfilibuster was successful in blocking passage of this bill in the \nclosing hours of the 64th Congress. Soon after, La Follette was one of \nonly six Senators who voted against U.S. entry into World War I.\n  Fighting Bob was outspoken in his belief that the right to free \nspeech did not end when war began. In the fall of 1917, La Follette \ngave a speech about the war in Minnesota, and he was misquoted in press \nreports as saying that he supported the sinking of the Lusitania. The \nWisconsin State Legislature condemned his supposed statement as \ntreason, and some of La Follette's Senate colleagues introduced a \nresolution to expel him. In response to this action, he delivered his \nseminal floor address, ``Free Speech in Wartime,'' on October 16, 1917. \nIf you listen closely, you can almost hear his strong voice echoing \nthrough this chamber as he said:\n\n       Mr. President, our government, above all others, is founded \n     on the right of the people freely to discuss all matters \n     pertaining to their government, in war not less than in \n     peace, for in this government, the people are the rulers in \n     war no less than in peace.\n\n  Of the expulsion petition filed against him, La Follette said:\n\n       I am aware, Mr. President, that in pursuance of this \n     general campaign of vilification and attempted intimidation, \n     requests from various individuals and certain organizations \n     have been submitted to the Senate for my expulsion from this \n     body, and that such requests have been referred to and \n     considered by one of the Committees of the Senate.\n       If I alone had been made the victim of these attacks, I \n     should not take one moment of the Senate's time for their \n     consideration, and I believe that other Senators who have \n     been unjustly and unfairly assailed, as I have been, hold the \n     same attitude upon this that I do. Neither the clamor of the \n     mob nor the voice of power will ever turn me by the breadth \n     of a hair from the course I mark out for myself, guided by \n     such knowledge as I can obtain and controlled and directed by \n     a solemn conviction of right and duty.\n\n  This powerful speech led to a Senate investigation of whether La \nFollette's conduct constituted treason. In 1919, following the end of \nWorld War I, the Senate dropped its investigation and reimbursed La \nFollette for the legal fees he incurred as a result of the expulsion \npetition and corresponding investigation. This incident is indicative \nof Fighting Bob's commitment to his ideals and of his tenacious spirit.\n  La Follette died on June 18, 1925, in Washington, DC, while serving \nWisconsin in this body. His daughter noted, ``His passing was \nmysteriously peaceful for one who had stood so long on the battle \nline.'' Mourners visited the Wisconsin Capitol to view his body and \npaid respects in a crowd nearing 50,000 people. La Follette's son, \nRobert M. La Follette, Jr., was appointed to his father's seat and went \non to be elected in his own right and to serve in this body for more \nthan 20 years, following the progressive path blazed by his father.\n  La Follette has been honored a number of times for his unwavering \ncommitment to his ideals and for his service to the people of Wisconsin \nand of the United States.\n  During the 109th Congress, I was proud to support Senate passage of a \nbill introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Tammy \nBaldwin that named the post office at 215 Martin Luther King, Jr., \nBoulevard in Madison in La Follette's honor. I commend Congresswoman \nBaldwin for her efforts to pass that bill, and I am pleased she is \nintroducing House companion measures of the legislation I am \nintroducing today in the Senate.\n  The Library of Congress recognized La Follette in 1985 by naming the \nCongressional Research Service reading room in the Madison Building in \nhonor of both Fighting Bob and his son, Robert M. La Follette, Jr., for \ntheir shared commitment to the development of a legislative research \nservice to support the Congress. In his autobiography, Fighting Bob \nnoted that, as Governor of Wisconsin, he:\n\n     made it a . . . policy to bring all the reserves of knowledge \n     and inspiration of the university more fully to the service \n     of the people. . . . Many of the university staff are now in \n     state service, and a bureau of investigation and research \n     established as a legislative reference library . . . has \n     proved of the greatest assistance to the legislature in \n     furnishing the latest and best thought of the advanced \n     students of government in this and other countries.\n\n  He went on to call this service ``a model which the federal \ngovernment and ultimately every state in the union will follow.'' Thus, \nthe legislative reference service that La Follette created in Madison \nserved as the basis for his work to create the Congressional Research \nService at the Library of Congress.\n  The La Follette Reading Room was dedicated on March 5, 1985, the \n100th anniversary of Fighting Bob being sworn in for his first term as \na Member of Congress.\n  Across this magnificent Capitol in National Statuary Hall, Fighting \nBob is forever immortalized in white marble, still proudly representing \nthe State of Wisconsin. His statue resides in the Old House Chamber, \nnow known as National Statuary Hall, among those of other notable \nfigures who have made their marks in American history. One of the few \nseated statues is that of Fighting Bob. Though he is sitting, he is \nshown with one foot forward, and one hand on the arm of his chair, as \nif he is about to leap to his feet and begin a robust speech.\n  When then-Senator John F. Kennedy's five-member Special Committee on \nthe Senate Reception Room chose La Follette as one of the ``Five \nOutstanding Senators'' whose portraits would hang outside of this \nchamber in the Senate reception room, he was described as being a \n``ceaseless battler for the underprivileged'' and a ``courageous \nindependent.'' Today, his painting still hangs just outside this \nchamber, where it bears witness to the proceedings of this body--and, \nperhaps, challenges his successors here to continue fighting for the \nsocial and Government reforms he championed.\n  Mr. President, to honor Robert M. La Follette, Sr., during the week \nof the anniversary of his birth, today I am introducing two pieces of \nlegislation. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl; the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy; and the junior Senator from Ohio, Mr. \nBrown.\n  I am introducing a bill that would direct the Secretary of the \nTreasury to mint coins to commemorate Fighting Bob's life and legacy. \nThe second bill that I am introducing today would authorize the \nPresident to posthumously award a gold medal on behalf of Congress to \nRobert M. La Follette, Sr. The\n\n[[Page S7542]]\n\nminting of a commemorative coin and the awarding of the Congressional \nGold Medal would be fitting tributes to the memory of Robert M. La \nFollette, Sr., and to his deeply held beliefs and long record of \nservice to his State and to his country. I hope that my colleagues will \nsupport these proposals.\n  Let us never forget Robert M. La Follette, Sr.'s character, his \nintegrity, his deep commitment to progressive causes, and his \nunwillingness to waver from doing what he thought was right. The Senate \nhas known no greater champion of the common man and woman, no greater \nenemy of corruption and cronyism, than ``Fighting Bob'' La Follette, \nand it is an honor to speak in the same Chamber and serve the same \ngreat State as he did.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7542-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING PHILIP M. KAISER\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nhonor the memory of Philip Kaiser, a dear family friend who was also an \noutstanding public servant. In a career that spanned four decades, he \nserved as an ambassador to four countries and as Assistant Secretary of \nLabor for International Affairs. He was a man of tremendous \naccomplishment who was sought out by U.S. Presidents, from Truman to \nCarter, for his unparalleled diplomatic skills.\n  While he served as Ambassador to Senegal in the early 1960s, he \nbrokered a critical agreement with the Senegalese President that \nprevented Soviet aircraft from refueling there during the Cuban Missile \nCrisis, in case the Soviets tried to use aircraft to break the \nblockade. Later, when he served as Ambassador to Hungary during the \nCarter Administration, he negotiated the return of a powerful national \nsymbol in Hungary, the Crown of St. Stephen, to the Hungarians after it \nhad been held for safekeeping in the United States after World War II.\n  Ambassador Kaiser received his undergraduate degree at the University \nof Wisconsin and then studied at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Those \nexperiences undoubtedly influenced his career, and, as it turns out, \nthey influenced my career as well. It was because Philip Kaiser went to \nthe University of Wisconsin that he met my father, Leon Feingold. They \nbecame, and always remained, good friends. As I grew up, I got to know \nAmbassador Kaiser, and heard so much about him from my father. As a \nyoung man with an interest in public service and foreign affairs, I \nlooked up to Ambassador Kaiser. In fact, one of the reasons I applied \nfor a Rhodes Scholarship was because Ambassador Kaiser had been a \nRhodes Scholar himself.\n  I am proud to have known Ambassador Kaiser and proud of his \nconnection to my family. I am deeply saddened by his passing, and my \nthoughts are with his wife, his children and grandchildren, and his \nmany friends during this difficult time. He left a lasting mark on this \ncountry and the world, and it is an honor to pay tribute to his memory \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7542-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING KAY AND MARY KRAMER\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to honor two remarkable \nIowans. Kay and Mary Kramer of Clive, IA have served their local \ncommunity, our great State of Iowa, and America well. They have set an \nexample of civic service that all people should be proud to follow.\n  Mary has a distinguished record of service to our country. She was \nthe U.S. Ambassador to Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean. \nAdditionally, she served on the White House Commission on Presidential \nScholars, honoring outstanding high school seniors each year for both \ntheir academic and artistic achievements.\n  Mary has also served her home State of Iowa well. She has done this \nthrough her work in the Iowa Senate where she was elected and reelected \nfor more than a decade. While serving in the senate, Mary was chosen by \nher fellow senators to be President of the senate. Her election to this \nposition of leadership is a testament to the respect Mary has earned \nfrom those who know her best.\n  Mary and her husband Kay make a great, civically-minded team. Kay was \nnamed as a West Des Moines Citizen of the Year and is an active \nvolunteer in his community. He served on the West Des Moines Board of \nHuman Services and is still active as an officer with the West Des \nMoines Rotary Club.\n  I am proud to call Kay and Mary Kramer friends, and I am happy to \nhonor both of them here today. I appreciate their tireless efforts to \nserve Iowa and America. I hope that their good work, and lifetime of \nservice, does not stop any time soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7542-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7542-S7543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING CLAIRA MONIER\n\n Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, the senior Senator from New \nHampshire, Judd Gregg, and I wish to recognize the considerable \nachievements of Claira Monier, a Goffstown resident who recently \nannounced her retirement after leading the New Hampshire Housing \nFinance Authority for nearly two decades.\n  Claira is a gold standard public servant. A New Hampshire native, she \nhas devoted her life to improving her community, State and Nation. \nMoreover, in what limited spare time she has, Claira is someone to whom \nSenator Gregg and I can turn for steady counsel on policy--housing tax \ncredits, bond caps, affordable housing--and politics. She is a rare and \nirreplaceable friend.\n  Whether in the classroom or leading efforts to expand access to \nhousing or health care, Claira has demonstrated the highest commitment \nto service over a 40-year period. Although her record of achievement is \nwell-known in New Hampshire, it is worth repeating here on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  From 1967 to 1974, she held teaching and administrative positions at \nNew Hampshire College and St. Anselm College. Claira subsequently \nserved for 5 years as the director of the New Hampshire State Council \non Aging, completing her tenure in 1981.\n  Having demonstrated uncommon competence and creativity in these \nroles, Claira was selected as Region I Director of the U.S. Department \nof Health and Human Services. In 1988, she began her legendary career \nas executive director of the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority--\nan organization on which she has left an indelible mark.\n  While working by day to support affordable housing and home ownership \ninitiatives in New Hampshire, Claira managed to simultaneously bring \nher leadership skills to a number of nonprofit boards.\n  She served as a Director of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston from \n1990 to 1992 and was a member of its Affordable Housing Advisory \nCouncil. She also found time to serve for 2 years as chairman of then-\nGovernor Gregg's Commission on Health Care Costs and Availability, \nleaving the panel in 1991. Claira was board president of the National \nCouncil of State Housing Agencies and served as cochair of the Fannie \nMae Housing Impact Advisory Council.\n  The list goes on: past chair of the Manchester Red Cross; former \nSouthern New Hampshire University trustee; 2003 chair of the Heritage \nUnited Way Campaign; former chair of the New Hampshire Main Street \nCenter; chair of New Hampshire's chapter of the American Lung \nAssociation; chair of the West High School endowment fund; member of \nthe Dartmouth Hitchcock Healthcare System's assembly of overseers; and \nso on.\n  It is not exactly clear when, or if, Claira had time to sleep.\n  But this much is known: Claira is one of those special people who \nlooks at her community and is able to see how she can make it better. \nShe is not prone to idle thoughts. Rather than stand on the sidelines \nsaying how the order of the world should be, Claira enters the arena \nwith vigor and inspires people to achieve difficult objectives.\n  The results of her work can be seen across New Hampshire. For first-\ntime homeowners in our State--or those who thought they might never be \nable to own a place of their own--it is likely that Claira's leadership \nat New Hampshire Housing had something to do with their securing a \npiece of the American dream. It is difficult to imagine work that is \nmore hopeful.\n  There is no question that Claira leaves behind a rich legacy at New \nHampshire Housing. Her successors, no doubt, share her commitment to \nthat organization's mission and will continue the important work she \nhas started. It should be noted, though,\n\n[[Page S7543]]\n\nthat Senator Gregg and I will certainly miss working with her on \ncritical issues that impact so many New Hampshire residents.\n  Claira may be retiring from her day job but in no way is she retiring \nfrom her community. Her knowledge of New Hampshire, her warm demeanor, \nand her strong leadership will continue to benefit the organizations \nshe supports. Additionally, candidates--notably those seeking the \nhighest office in the land--will turn to Claira for advice and counsel \nthat only she can provide.\n  Claira is a good, true and loyal friend. A great citizen of New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg and I extend our warm regards to Claira on the \noccasion of her retirement. We look forward to seeing her in the \ncommunities she has served and will serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7543-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO PEARL D.

She also served on the board of directors for the Children's \nWish Endowment and as past president of the Slidell Memorial Hospital \nWomen's Health Alliance, among many other great accolades.\n  Councilwoman Pearl D.

More than 60 nominations were submitted \nfrom public and private sectors, institutions, and individuals.\n  J. M. Lapeyre, the designer of the original shrimp-peeling machine in \n1946, founded Laitram, LLC, and completely transformed the shrimping \nindustry. Since its inception, his descendants have continued to carry \non this tradition of improvement and modernization. Over the past 5 \nyears, Laitram has patented more than 60 new inventions, including 16 \nin 2006, illustrating Laitram's commitment to innovation and the best \nquality for its customers and the State of Louisiana.

Mr. President, I wish to honor Bossier City, LA, \nwhich is celebrating its centennial anniversary, and I would like to \ntake a few moments to publicly recognize their great history.\n  In the 1830s, the area of Bossier City originally encompassed the \nElysian Groves Plantation of James Crane. Due to its proximity to the \nriver, it quickly became a hotbed for trade and activity. By 1850, \nhundreds of wagons crossed through the vicinity on their way to the \nWest; many settlers also stayed, realizing the land's fertile river \nvalley and abundant farmland. Soon, interstate railway systems boomed, \nand Bossier became a growing metropolis. The farmers, realizing the \narea's potential, quickly began to sell plots of land as transportation \nflourished. Finally, in 1907, with its growing textile industry and \nexpansive transportation system, Bossier City received official status \nas a city in Louisiana. Throughout its history, Bossier City has \nendured and survived many impediments, such as the great fire which \nconsumed over half of the downtown area. In the late 1950s, Bossier was \nnamed the fastest growing city in Louisiana.\n  Bossier City began its centennial celebration on April 7 with the \nbiggest birthday party that the city has ever witnessed on the banks of \nthe city's foundation on the Red River. The initial festivities ranged \nfrom the opportunity to meet the city's oldest resident to a reception, \nwith a 100-square-foot birthday cake. Throughout the year, the \ncommemoration will continue with events from the American Cancer \nSociety's Relay for Life to Barksdale Air Force Base. Over the year, \nresidents and business owners in the city will be able to attend and \nplan activities that aid in representing the city's deep southern \nhistory and culture.\n  The centennial memorializes Bossier City's rise to one of the great \ncities of the State of Louisiana. Today, I want to congratulate Bossier \nCity on the last 100 years, and I wish the residents luck and continued \nsuccess and progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7543-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:46 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that it has passed \nthe act (S. 676) to provide that the Executive Director of the Inter-\nAmerican Development Bank or the Alternative Executive Director of the \nInter-American Development Bank may serve on the Board of Directors of \nthe Inter-American Foundation, without amendment.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 65.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     provide resources to address the colony collapse disorder \n     affecting honeybees; to the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 76\n\n       Whereas, Michigan and the nation's agricultural industry \n     rely on honeybees to pollinate plants and enable the \n     production of our nation's fruits, vegetables, seeds, and \n     nuts. Honeybees pollinate at least 90 commercial crops and \n     account for 80 percent of the nation's pollination services, \n     providing $5 billion to $10 billion of direct benefits to \n     United States agriculture; and\n       Whereas, honeybees in Michigan and 25 other states have \n     succumbed to a mysterious ailment referred to as Colony \n     Collapse Disorder, where honeybees abandon their hives. In \n     affected states, beekeepers lost up to 50 percent of their \n     colonies last winter, threatening Michigan's $383 million \n     fruit industry and billions of dollars of agricultural \n     production nationwide; and\n       Whereas, immediate research is needed to determine the \n     cause of Colony Collapse Disorder and assistance to Support \n     our nation's 135,000 beekeepers and the agriculture industry \n     from this potentially crippling threat: now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to provide \n     resources to address the Colony Collapse Disorder affecting \n     honeybees; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation,\n       Adopted by the House of Representatives, May 22, 2007.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-115. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan expressing \n     opposition to Norfolk Southern Corporation's proposed sale of \n     its rail line between Lansing and Jackson; to the Committee \n     on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 96\n\n       Whereas, The Norfolk Southern Corporation is considering \n     the sale of several Michigan lines, including the line that \n     runs between Lansing and Jackson. Traffic on Michigan's rail \n     lines has increased over the past two years. Expanding both \n     freight and passenger rail service is being promoted as a \n     solution to rising oil prices, pollution, and increased \n     highway congestion. The sale or closure of rail lines could \n     be counterproductive to efforts to improve Michigan's \n     economy; and\n       Whereas, The Norfolk Southern lines are vital links between \n     Michigan cities and between Michigan and neighboring states. \n     Expanding rail capacity on the Lansing/Jackson line is \n     essential to the future development of this area. New \n     industry, including production plants for coal energy, \n     biodiesel, and ethanol fuel, is proposed for Michigan and the \n     railroad will play an integral role in moving products and \n     supplies. Continued operation of this line by Norfolk \n     Southern is essential to expansion of new industry in \n     Michigan; and\n       Whereas, Norfolk Southern is a Class One railroad operator, \n     earning revenue in excess of $250 million annually. As a \n     Class One operator, Norfolk Southern has the capacity to \n     maintain and promote the use of these lines. The proposed \n     sale of the Lansing to Jackson line will almost certainly \n     place the line under the management of a Class Three \n     operator, a rail company earning revenue of $20 million or \n     less annually. A Class Three operator may be far less likely \n     to have the means to maintain the line, thus increasing the \n     chance of accidents. Class Three operators also rely on \n     federal grants for line and equipment maintenance--grants \n     that are not always guaranteed; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we express \n     opposition to Norfolk Southern's proposed sale of its rail \n     line between Lansing and Jackson; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate; the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives; members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation; the United States \n     Department of Transportation, Surface Transportation Board; \n     the Norfolk Southern Corporation; AMTRAK; and the Michigan \n     Department of Transportation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7544-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7544-S7545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. HATCH:\n       S. 1591.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nfull expensing for the cost of qualified refinery property in the year \nin which the property is placed in service, and to classify petroleum \nrefining property as 5-year property for purposes of depreciation; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to reintroduce my legislation, \nthe Refinery Investment Tax Assistance Act, aimed at increasing \nrefining capacity in this Nation. No one doubts that U.S. consumers and \nbusinesses will face another long hot summer of too high gas prices. \nThere is general consensus among experts that a major bottleneck in \nU.S. refining capacity is a big part of the reason prices are so high. \nMy bill will help resolve that problem.\n  As my colleagues know, the Government does not explore for, extract, \ntransport, or refine oil in this country. Our Nation relies wholly on \nprivate industry to feed a very large domestic energy appetite. \nUnfortunately, the Government often stands in the way of industry in \nthese activities. While many refiners would like to expand their \ncapacity to refine oil, they face extraordinary costs from bureaucratic \nregulations that limit the available funding for such expansion. \nBecause of this and other unfriendly economic factors, not a single new \nrefinery has been built in the United States since 1976. In fact, we \nhave lost nearly 200 refineries over that time period and now we badly \nneed that refining capacity.\n  I authored a key provision of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which is \ncurrently providing some incentives for new refining capacity. However, \ndue to budgetary constraints, the tax incentives in my proposal were \ncut in half during the conference between the House and the Senate. I \nam confident that if we had known 2 years ago just how much of a \nbottleneck the refinery shortage would present in today's market, the \nfull measure of my incentive would have been enacted.\n  The Refinery Investment Tax Assistance Act would restore those \nprovisions I originally introduced, but which were later removed for \nbudget reasons. First, it would increase the short-term incentive for \nthe industry to build new refineries or to expand existing ones. As \nwith the 2005 bill, S. 1591 would provide immediate expensing of 100 \npercent of the cost of new or expanded refineries in certain \ncircumstances. As I said earlier, cost constraints forced us to limit \nthis incentive in 2005 to 50 percent of expensing for refiners that \nwere able to commit to installing new refining equipment before 2008. \nUnder this bill, any added capacity would have to be placed in service \nby 2012 in order to qualify to write off the full cost of the expanded \ncapacity in the first year.\n  The second part of S. 1591 would address the 10-year depreciation \nschedule for refining assets under our current tax law. This 10-year \nschedule is longer than the write-off period for much of the equipment \nused in other manufacturing industries, including the petrochemical \nindustry. My bill would eliminate this disparity by shortening the \ndepreciation schedule for refining assets from 10 years to 5. This \nunfair and unwarranted treatment of our refining industry acts as a \nlong-term obstacle to new investment in increased capacity. I call on \nmy colleagues to help me level the playing field on depreciation for \nthis critically important sector of our energy industry.\n  I should also point out that this legislation would allow refineries \nto change only the timing of the depreciation of their equipment, but \nnot the amount. Meanwhile, it would increase the size of our tax base \nby encouraging industry to build new refineries and increase capacity.\n  Testifying before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nin 2005, Mr. Bob Slaughter of the National Petrochemical & Refiners \nAssociation said that an important solution to the energy crisis would \nbe to ``expand the refining tax incentive provision in the Energy Act \n[and] reduce the depreciation period for refining investments from 10 \nto . . . five years in order to remove a current disincentive for \nrefining investment.''\n  These changes are incorporated in the legislation I am introducing \ntoday.\n  Mr. Slaughter gave this testimony in the aftermath of hurricane \nKatrina. Every American has felt the effects of the storms on our \nenergy sector. Refineries have been pummeled and, at one point, an \nunprecedented 25 percent of our Nation's refining capacity was taken \noffline. The rising gas prices hurt families' budgets, businesses that \npay high travel expenses, and even school districts that must fuel \nbuses to transport students. Once again, forecasters are predicting a \nterrible storm season this summer with hurricanes comparable to those \nof 2005.\n  We have learned that when it comes to our Nation's energy security, \nrefining is where we are the most vulnerable. This legislation will \nhelp us deal with the energy crisis and make our Nation more secure \nfrom the attacks of Mother Nature and terrorists. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in pursuing the secure and independent refining program \nthat this country truly needs. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7548]]\n\n                                S. 1591\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax relief and protections to military personnel, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this week, we celebrate Flag Day, and in a \nfew weeks we will celebrate the Fourth of July.\n  We ask a lot from our men and women in the armed services, and their \nsacrifices are essential to protecting our freedom here at home. One \nway to support them is to make the Tax Code a little friendlier to the \ntroops.\n  That is why I am introducing the Defenders of Freedom Tax Relief Act \nof 2007. This bill would extend the tax rules favoring the military \nthat expire in 2007 and 2008. It would also eliminate roadblocks in the \ncurrent tax laws that present difficulties for veterans and \nservicemembers.\n  Our troops should fight against our Nation's enemies, not our \nNation's Tax Code. Family members of fallen soldiers killed in the line \nof duty receive a death benefit of $100,000. But the Tax Code restricts \nthe survivors from contributing this benefit into a tax-favored \nretirement account. My bill would exempt this benefit from the current \nrestrictions on contribution amounts and income limitations. That way, \nthe family members of fallen soldiers could take advantage of tax-\nfavored Roth IRA accounts.\n  Lower ranking, lower income soldiers do most of the heavy lifting in \ncombat situations. Under the current Tax Code, their income is not \ncounted in computing the earned income tax credit, or EITC. The EITC is \na beneficial tax provision available to working Americans. It makes no \nsense to deny it to our troops. My bill would count combat duty income \nfor EITC purposes, and it would make this change to the Tax Code \npermanent.\n  My bill would also eliminate the confusion that surrounds State gifts \nto servicemembers. Military members should not be caught in the \ncrossfire of competing Tax Code interpretations.\n  Another hazard facing our troops in the Tax Code is the statute of \nlimitations for filing a tax refund. Most Veterans' Administration \ndisability claims filed by veterans are quickly resolved. But thousands \nof disability awards are delayed due to lost paperwork or the appeals \nof rejected claims. Once a disabled veteran finally gets a favorable \naward, the good news is that the disability award is tax-free. But many \nof these disabled veterans get ambushed by a statute that bars them \nfrom filing a tax refund claim. My bill would give disabled veterans in \nthis situation an extra year to claim their tax refunds.\n  Our men and women in uniform provide an invaluable service to our \ncountry. They, along with their families, make sacrifices and live a \ndemanding lifestyle. The Tax Code should not add to their hardships as \nthey move from assignment to assignment around the globe.\n  Protecting American interests around the world requires most of our \ntroops to move a number of times during their career. Restricting \nfavorable mortgage bond financing to only first-time homebuyers does \nnot make much sense for them. Therefore, my bill would eliminate this \nrestriction for veterans who served in the active military.\n  The bill would make permanent a provision that allows intelligence \ncommunity employees to make use of the exclusion of gain on the sale of \ntheir home when they are assigned overseas or 50 miles away from their \nhome.\n  A soldier's rucksack is heavy enough as it is without piling tax \npaperwork on top of it. My bill would help reduce paperwork.\n  My bill would treat differential pay as wages. This would make it \neaser for employers to contribute to a reservist's retirement plans. \nAnd it would eliminate the reservist's need to make estimated tax \npayments.\n  My bill would also make permanent certain taxpayer information \nreporting rules, so that the Social Security Administration and the \nVeterans' Administration could facilitate the administration of veteran \nneeds-based pension and compensation programs.\n  A further roadblock for military service men and women is the 10-\npercent penalty triggered for early withdrawal from a qualified \nretirement plan. If reservists are called to active duty, the last \nthing that they should have to worry about is their 401(k) plan or IRA \naccount. This provision would permit penalty-free early withdrawal. And \nit would give reservists 2 years from the time that they stop active \nduty to roll over their IRAs or 401(k) plans.\n  Small business employers are being asked to make sacrifices here at \nhome. My bill would help.\n  Mobilization of Reserve personnel creates unexpected employee \nabsences. This hits small businesses especially hard. Some employers \nvoluntarily take on the added burden of eliminating any pay gap \nexperienced by their reservist-employees. These employers pay the \ndifference between the civilian salary and the military pay. In \nrecognition of their patriotism, my bill would provide small businesses \nwith fewer than 50 employees a tax credit of 20 percent of the \ndifferential pay, up to $20,000, for those small businesses that make \ndifferential payments to reservists called up to active duty.\n  This bill is fully paid for with a change in the Tax Code that makes \nsure that anyone relinquishing their U.S. citizenship is still on the \nhook to pay their fair share of U.S. taxes.\n  We owe the Americans fighting in our Armed Forces an enormous debt of \ngratitude. These important tax reforms are one small way of saluting \nthem for all that they do. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1593\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today Senators Baucus, Grassley and I, \nalong with other Finance Committee members, are introducing the \nDefenders of Freedom Tax Relief Act of 2007. Earlier in the year, \nSenator Smith and I introduced the Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act \nof 2007, which would help those who are valiantly serving their country \nand the families that they leave behind.\n  The Defenders of Freedom on Tax Relief Act of 2007 includes several \nprovisions from the Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act of 2007. It \nalso includes additional provisions to help military families and \nveterans who often struggle financially.\n  The best definition of patriotism is keeping faith with those who \nwear the uniform of our country. That means giving our troops the \nresources they need to keep them safe while they are protecting us. And \nit means supporting our troops at home as well as abroad.\n  Currently, there are over 149,700 military personnel serving in Iraq. \nThere are approximately 22,100 U.S. servicemembers in Afghanistan. Many \nof these men and women are reservists and have been called to active \nduty, frequently for multiple tours.\n  Most large businesses have the resources to provide supplemental \nincome to reservist employees called up and to replace them with \ntemporary employees. I applaud the businesses that have been able to \npay supplemental income to their reservists, but\n\n[[Page S7554]]\n\nit is not easy for small businesses to do the same.\n  In January, the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship held \na hearing on veterans' small business issues. A majority of our \nveterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are Reserve and National \nGuard members--35 percent of whom are either self-employed or own or \nare employed by a small business.\n  We heard some disturbing statistics about the impact and unintended \nconsequences the call up of reservists is having on small businesses. \nAccording to a January 2007 survey conducted by Workforce Management, \n54 percent of the businesses surveyed responded that they would not \nhire a citizen soldier if they knew that they could be called up for an \nindeterminate amount of time. I am concerned that long call ups and \nredeployments have made it hard for small businesses to be supportive \nof civilian soldiers.\n  The Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act of 2007 provides a tax credit \nto small businesses to assist with the cost of paying the salary of \ntheir reservist employees when they are called to active duty. A \nsimilar provision is included in the Defenders of Freedom Tax Relief \nAct of 2007.\n  In addition to helping small businesses, the Active Duty Military Tax \nRelief Act of 2007 addresses concerns related to differential military \npay, income tax withholding, and retirement plan participation. These \nprovisions will make it easier for employers who would like to pay \ntheir employees supplemental income, above their military pay, and make \npension contributions. Our legislation would make differential military \npay subject to Federal income tax withholding. In addition, with \nrespect to the retirement plan rules, the bill provides that a person \nreceiving differential military pay would be treated as an employee of \nthe employer making the payment, and allows the differential military \npay to be treated as compensation. These provisions are included in the \nDefenders of Freedom Tax Relief Act of 2007.\n  The Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act of 2007 would make permanent \nthe existing provision which allows taxpayer to include combat pay as \nearned income for purposes of the earned-income tax credit, EITC. \nWithout this provision some military families would no longer be \neligible to receive the EITC because combat pay is currently not \ntaxable.\n  Last Congress, Senator Smith and I introduced the Fallen Heroes \nFamily Savings Act, which we have incorporated into the Active Duty \nMilitary Tax Relief Act. This provision provides tax relief for the \ndeath gratuity payment that is given to families who have lost a loved \none in combat. This payment is currently $100,000.\n  Our current tax laws do not allow the recipients of this payment to \nuse it to make contributions to tax-preferred saving accounts that help \nwith saving for retirement. The Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act of \n2007 would allow military death gratuities to be contributed to certain \ntax-preferred accounts. These contributions would be treated as \nqualified rollovers. A similar provision is included in the Defenders \nof Freedom Tax Relief Act of 2007.\n  Our service men and women need to know that we are honoring their \nvalor by taking care of those they leave behind. Helping ease the tax \nburden on the death gratuity will enable military families to save more \nfor retirement. These changes to our tax laws will help our military \nfamilies with some of their financial burdens. It cannot repay the \nsacrifices they have made for us, but it is a small way we can support \nour troops and their families at home as well as abroad.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Smith, and Mr. \n        Stevens):\n  S. 1594. A bill to amend title 46, United States Code, to improve \nsafety and security for especially hazardous cargoes, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Maritime \nHazardous Cargo Security Act of 2007 along with my colleagues Senators \nInouye, Stevens, and Smith. As the bipartisan leaders of the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and its Subcommittee \non Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Safety, Security, and \nInfrastructure, we have been working together over the course of this \nsession to evaluate the risks posed by the transportation of especially \nhazardous cargo in the maritime sector. This bill is the result of \nexhaustive research and consultation with affected industries and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Ships bringing liquefied natural gas, \nLNG, from foreign ports as well as the facilities along America's \nshores that handle LNG must be better secured against terrorism.\n  With so much focus on hazardous cargo that is transported on our \nroads and railways, we must not neglect the much larger shipments of \nhazardous cargoes that are carried by vessel. Energy supply challenges \nin our country have led to the proposals for approximately 70 new \nshoreside facilities in the United States to receive liquefied natural \ngas via oceangoing tank vessel. Many of the safety and security risks \nof the transportation of this commodity are known and have been \ndetailed by the Government Accountability Office. Furthermore, other \nchemicals and petrochemicals can present even greater security risks.\n  The shipping system for these commodities is international in scope, \nso our bill would require the administration to work with our \ninternational trading partners to develop standards of care to \nadequately protect those ships, facilities, employees and nearby \ncommunities and residents from attacks involving these and other \nhazardous cargoes. Our proposal would require significant steps to \nprotect the safety and security of our regional and national economies, \nand the public health, from the potential hazards of high risk cargo \ntransported by ship.\n  Specifically the Maritime Hazardous Cargo Act of 2007 would: Direct \nthe Administration to work with international partners to develop \nstandards and procedures for the safe and secure handling of especially \nhazardous cargoes, EHC, for all vessels and port facilities; require \nsuccessful completion of U.S. Coast Guard Incident Command System, ICS, \ntraining for all personnel responsible for the safety and security of a \nvessel in port; require the Department of Homeland Security to develop \nregional response and recovery plans for the resumption of commerce \nafter disruption by a security incident; authorize the U.S. Coast Guard \nto develop cost share plans for security costs associated with high-\nrisk U.S. facilities; authorize assistance to foreign ports that handle \nand transport EHC's for the purpose of complying with or exceeding \ncurrent International Ship and Port Facility Code, ISPFC, standards; \nauthorize voluntary third party validation of international port \nfacilities to certify they meet or exceed international safety \nstandards; and require the U.S. Coast Guard to develop a resource \nallocation plan to show how its proposed budget will be used for EHC \nsecurity operations and to report to Congress biannually.\n  In summary, the Maritime Hazardous Cargo Act of 2007 will require \nstrengthening of Federal protections against terrorist attacks on \nfacilities and vessels that transport, handle, and store especially \nhazardous cargoes, EHC's. The transportation of EHC's by ship can pose \na significant risk to the public safety and the economic security of \nthe Nation, particularly the transportation of chemicals and \npetrochemicals such as anhydrous ammonia, ammonium nitrate, chlorine, \nliquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas. Currently, no \ninternational standards exist for the safe and secure handling of these \nchemicals/petrochemicals by ship and limited U.S. Coast Guard resources \nfor EHC security poses a dangerous risk to our communities.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide flexibility in the manner in which beds are counted for \npurposes of determining whether a hospital may be designated as a \ncritical access hospital under the Medicare program; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my \ncolleague Senator Wyden, to introduce this important piece of \nlegislation for America's rural hospitals. Our legislation will work to \nensure that hospitals in under-served areas, including those in our \nhome State of Oregon, have the flexibility they need to provide care to \ntheir communities.\n  The Critical Access Hospital program, CAH, is an important safety net \nthat ensures that communities have access to health care services in \nrural areas such as my hometown of Pendleton, OR. Hundreds of hospitals \nacross the United States operate under a CAH designation, 25 of which \nare in Oregon. In order to obtain this designation, certain \nrequirements, such as being located more than 35 miles from any other \nhospital, or receiving certification by the state to be a ``necessary \nprovider.'' CAH's also must provide 24-hour emergency care services 7 \ndays a week.\n  One requirement, however, the 25-patient bed limit, has proven to be \ntoo constricting for facilities during times of unexpected, increased \nneed, such as during an influenza outbreak or an influx of tourism to \nthe community.\n  Leadership for Oregon hospitals have expressed to me that these rules \ncould lead to severe patient safety issues. As hospitals reach their \n25-bed capacity, they could be forced to divert those in need of care \nto a hospital much farther from their home and families. Alternatively, \nshould these small hospitals take the patient in they put themselves at \nrisk of losing their important CAH status. Loss of such status could \ncause the closing of the facility altogether.\n  Access to health care remains an issue in our Nation and this bill is \none small way in which we can work to ensure that rural hospital doors \nremain open for millions of Americans living in communities who depend \non CAH's for their medical care. This bill will provide the flexibility \nnecessary for a CAH to choose to meet either the 25-bed-per day limit \nor a limit of 20-beds-per-day averaged throughout the year. Therefore, \nduring a time of surge, they can care for more patients in need even if \nthe hospital would exceed the use of 25 beds, which they could not do \nunder current law. However, our bill ensures that during times of non-\nsurge these hospitals are meeting the requirements under law that make \nthem a CAH. This new yearly average is set lower than the daily limit \nto ensure that we are not expanding this program.\n  We believe that this simple tweak in the current law is critically \nimportant\n\n[[Page S7557]]\n\nto keeping our rural hospitals open and their communities' health care \nneeds served. I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this \nbill, and I look forward to working with Chairman Baucus and other \nmembers of the Finance Committee to secure passage of this important \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VITTER:\n  S. 1597. A bill to preserve open competition and Federal Government \nneutrality towards the labor relations of Federal Government \ncontractors on Federal and federally funded construction projects; to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today a bill \nthat would go a long way toward ensuring that Federal contracting \nremains a process of equal opportunity and open competition. \nSpecifically, my legislation would prohibit the practice of attaching \nrestrictive union-only project labor agreements, or PLAs, to Federal \ncontracts.\n  In short, any contractor or subcontractor who is bidding on a \nconstruction project that includes a union-only PLA must agree to \nrecognize unions as the representatives of the employees on that job; \nuse the union hiring hall to obtain workers and apprentices; pay union \nwages and benefits; and follow the union's restrictive rules, job \nclassifications, and arbitration procedures.\n  These restrictions would apply at the expense of a contractor's or \nsubcontractor's usual team of workers. They would apply in States that \nmay have low numbers of unionized construction workers, even if it \nmeant denying jobs to local, in-State workers and required bringing in \nemployees from out of State. Finally, the restrictions in a union-only \nPLA would apply even though only 13 percent of our private construction \nworkforce belongs to a construction labor union, and therefore \neffectively locking out almost nine of every 10 able, qualified \nworkers.\n  In my home State of Louisiana, just 7.4 percent of private \nconstruction workers belong to a construction labor union. Yet, for \nexample, if union-only PLAs are attached to the Federal construction \nprojects helping rebuild Louisiana after the devastation of Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita, Louisianans will be locked out of this important \nrebuilding process, making it difficult to find work and earn a decent \nwage; the same jobs and wages that would enable Louisiana families to \nreturn to the hurricane-affected areas and rebuild their lives in these \ncommunities. Yet, instead of enabling local folks and businesses to \ncome together and participate in their community's renewal, PLAs will \nensure that these valuable jobs will go to just a select few, mostly \nout-of-State union workers. It is inexcusable that local Louisiana \nfirms and their workers would be barred from freely bidding on \nconstruction projects in their own town or parish. And this is just one \nexample of the harmful consequences associated with PLAs.\n  In sum, the Federal Government should not be in the business of \ntaking taxpayers' money to fund projects that exclude more than four \nout of five workers, making these projects discriminatory, \nanticompetitive, and unnecessarily expensive. At the very least, \ntaxpayers should be able to bid and work on projects that they are \nfunding with their own hard-earned dollars. Construction workers should \nhave the opportunity to work on projects that benefit their own \ncommunities regardless of their union affiliation. The Federal \nGovernment should maintain a neutral position and encourage full and \nopen competition in the Federal contracting process.\n  Contracts should be awarded based on sound, commonsense criteria, \nsuch as quality of work, experience, and cost. Union affiliation has no \nplace within the criteria for considering a contract bid. The best bid, \nby the most qualified contractor or subcontractor, should always be the \nwinning bid.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and to \noppose attempts to attach union-only project labor agreements to \nFederal projects.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1597\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

which \nwas referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 231\n\n       Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach frontier \n     areas of the United States, and in particular the \n     Southwestern States, for more than 2 years after President \n     Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, and \n     months after the conclusion of the Civil War;\n       Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers led by Major \n     General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news \n     that the Civil War had ended and that the enslaved were free;\n       Whereas African Americans who had been slaves in the \n     Southwest celebrated June 19, commonly known as ``Juneteenth \n     Independence Day'', as the anniversary of their emancipation;\n       Whereas African Americans from the Southwest continue the \n     tradition of celebrating Juneteenth Independence Day as \n     inspiration and encouragement for future generations;\n       Whereas, for more than 140 years, Juneteenth Independence \n     Day celebrations have been held to honor African American \n     freedom while encouraging self-development and respect for \n     all cultures;\n       Whereas, although Juneteenth Independence Day is beginning \n     to be recognized as a national, and even global, event, the \n     history behind the celebration should not be forgotten; and\n       Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by \n     former slaves remains an example for all people of the United \n     States, regardless of background, religion, or race: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) recognizes the historical significance of Juneteenth \n     Independence Day to the Nation;\n       (B) supports the continued celebration of Juneteenth \n     Independence Day to provide an opportunity for the people of \n     the United States to learn more about the past and to \n     understand better the experiences that have shaped the \n     Nation; and\n       (C) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     Juneteenth Independence Day with appropriate ceremonies, \n     activities, and programs; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) history should be regarded as a means for understanding \n     the past and solving the challenges of the future; and\n       (B) the celebration of the end of slavery is an important \n     and enriching part of the history and heritage of the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today Senator Levin and I are introducing \na resolution recognizing the historic Juneteenth Independence Day. June \n19 is an ordinary day for many Americans but is a significant day for \nthose who know its history. Juneteenth Independence Day celebrates June \n19, 1865, when Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, \narrived in Galveston, Texas, with news that the Civil War had ended and \nthat the enslaved were free.\n  Americans across the United States continue the tradition of \ncelebrating Juneteenth Independence Day as an inspiration and \nencouragement for future generations. This legislation recognizes the \nhistorical significance of Juneteenth Independence Day and supports its \ncontinued celebration as an opportunity for the people of the United \nStates to learn more about the past and to understand more fully the \nexperiences that have shaped our nation.\n  As Americans, we must remember the lessons learned from slavery. \nJuneteenth is a day that all Americans, of all races, creeds and ethnic \nbackgrounds, can celebrate freedom and the end of slavery in the United \nStates. Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to recognize historic \nJuneteenth Independence Day and support this important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/12/senate-section/article/S7558-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 232--CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT \n    BOULDER MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2006 NATIONAL \n    COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION DIVISION I MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Salazar) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO THE USE OF RENEWABLE \n                   RESOURCES TO GENERATE ENERGY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States has a quantity of renewable energy \n     resources that is sufficient to supply a significant portion \n     of the energy needs of the United States;\n       (2) the agricultural, forestry, and working land of the \n     United States can help ensure a sustainable domestic energy \n     system;\n       (3) accelerated development and use of renewable energy \n     technologies provide numerous benefits to the United States, \n     including improved national security, improved balance of \n     payments, healthier rural economies, improved environmental \n     quality, and abundant, reliable, and affordable energy for \n     all citizens of the United States;\n       (4) the production of transportation fuels from renewable \n     energy would help the United States meet rapidly growing \n     domestic and global energy demands, reduce the dependence of \n     the United States on energy imported from volatile regions of \n     the world that are politically unstable, stabilize the cost \n     and availability of energy, and safeguard the economy and \n     security of the United States;\n       (5) increased energy production from domestic renewable \n     resources would attract substantial new investments in energy \n     infrastructure, create economic growth, develop new jobs for \n     the citizens of the United States, and increase the income \n     for farm, ranch, and forestry jobs in the rural regions of \n     the United States;\n       (6) increased use of renewable energy is practical and can \n     be cost effective with the implementation of supportive \n     policies and proper incentives to stimulate markets and \n     infrastructure; and\n       (7) public policies aimed at enhancing renewable energy \n     production and accelerating technological improvements will \n     further reduce energy costs over time and increase market \n     demand.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that it \n     is the goal of the United States that, not later than January \n     1, 2025, the agricultural, forestry, and working land of the \n     United States should--\n       (1) provide from renewable resources not less than 25 \n     percent of the total energy consumed in the United States; \n     and\n       (2) continue to produce safe, abundant, and affordable \n     food, feed, and fiber.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1525.
