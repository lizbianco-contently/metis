Mr. President, we will be once again taking up the \npending bill dealing with global warming. It is a substantial piece of \nlegislation. I am planning to speak later in the day as well, but I \nwish to take some time during morning business to talk about the \noverall bill as well as an amendment I may file later today on this \nlegislation.\n  In terms of the issue of global warming, first let me say that there \nis little question left that something significant is happening to our \nplanet. There is something happening to our climate that sometimes we \ndon't quite understand. But among almost all scientists, there is \nnearly universal consensus that in the last 100 years, the temperature \nof the Earth has slightly warmed by 1.1 to 1.6 degrees. Through 2050, \nwe expect further temperature increases unless we begin to address the \ncontinued concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n  We are seeing evidence of these impacts. While no specific event is \ndirectly linked, we see droughts occurring more often, and this is \ncertainly happening in my State of North Dakota. Heat waves are \nbecoming more frequent, more intense, and more damaging. Further, the \nnumber of category 4 and 5 hurricanes has nearly doubled in the past 50 \nyears. It is quite clear something is happening that we have\n\n[[Page S4994]]\n\nnot seen before. I think the consensus of scientists now is at a point \nregarding this climate change that is beyond natural change, and we \ncertainly ought to take some no-regret steps. At least at the very \nminimum, we should be taking more substantial steps to try to respond \nto it and deal with it.\n  Now, one of the interesting things about this bill that is on the \nfloor of the Senate is that it requires a commitment to emission \nreductions, technology investments and other actions through 2050. It \nis sometimes hard to see ahead 5 years or 10 years, let alone 30 or 40 \nor 50 years. We have economists who can't remember their own phone \nnumbers who make predictions 10 and 15 years into the future. At the \nsame time, we still have to be seriously thinking about our future \npathway for action. What is our destination? What do we aspire to \nachieve for this country? What do we want to have happen as we move \nahead?\n\n  Let me say that almost everyone believes that our present energy \ncourse is unsustainable. Energy use primarily from fossil fuel \ncombustion in the U.S. and around the world is a significant \ncontributor to climate change, according to most energy and climate \nchange experts. We cannot maintain the current path.\n  So what do we have to do? Well, the legislation in front of us is \nsignificant. It says that we ought to do a lot of things. Yes, some of \nthe proposals here are controversial. Some will likely be changed \nduring this debate or future deliberations, but the reality is that a \ndebate on mandatory emissions cuts must occur.\n  I will offer an amendment I will describe a little later, but chief \namong the things we need to do are the more rapid development of new \nsources of energy, especially with advanced technology. There are \nrenewable sources of energy that do not emit greenhouse gases or other \npollutants. They produce no effluents or no carbon dioxide. This \nincludes wind, geothermal, and solar energy, and we ought to be moving \nmuch more aggressively on these and other opportunities. This has not \nbeen what the U.S. has done historically though. We have initially been \nearly leaders in cutting edge energy technologies and then fallen \nbehind.\n  Let me give an example of how pathetic this country's response has \nbeen in recent years and how much more aggressive it must be in future \nyears. When the U.S. started exploring for oil and natural gas at the \nstart of the last century, this Congress adopted, in 1916, long-term, \npermanent, very substantial tax incentives to encourage that \ndevelopment.\n  It gave a clear signal that, if you go out and discover oil and gas, \nthen we have big tax incentives for you. Industry understood that it \nwas beneficial to find oil and gas through these long-term, permanent \ntax incentives.\n  What do we do for wind energy, solar and other renewable energy \ntechnologies? The Congress put in place a production tax credit in \n1992. These ended up being very short term and rather shallow. It has \nbeen extended for the short term, in many cases by 1 year, five times \nsince we first passed it. It is a stutter step approach--start, stop; \nstart, stop. It has been a pathetic, anemic, and weak response by a \ncountry that should be much more aggressive and bold in providing a \ndirection to develop our renewable energy resources.\n  There are substantial renewable energy resources available in this \ncountry, and we need to get about the business of providing the funding \nfor research and the aggressive incentives for a long-term \ndetermination of where we are going to head with renewables.\n  In 2007, I introduced legislation to encourage a broad range of \nrenewable and clean energy approaches as well as additional \ninfrastructure. That legislation signaled that our country should be on \na course to say to the investors in the U.S. and around the world, \nwhere we are headed for a decade. Count on it. Believe in it. The \nproduction tax credit which will expire at the end of this year should \nbe extended not for 1 year, it ought to be extended for a full decade \nto let America know where we are headed. We want more renewable energy \nthat is not polluting.\n  Now, having said all of that, there are so many things we can do. We \nneed much more extensive deployment of conservation and efficiency, \nincluding more efficient vehicles and buildings. We are going to \nincrease fuel economy standards with a 10-mile-per-gallon increase in \n10 years that we required with the Energy Independence and Security Act \npassed by Congress in December 2007. I was proud to be a part of that \neffort to increase fuel economy standards. We are doing a lot of things \nthat make it easier to move forward with efficiency and conservation \nmeasures. Further, I wish to talk for a moment about an amendment that \nI am going to offer with respect to the advancement of clean coal \ntechnologies.\n  Now, I understand some say that, in order to deal with climate \nchange, you are going to have to find a way to wean yourself off of \nfossil fuels. I understand they say that, but I also understand that is \nnot going to happen in the very near term. Let me tell my colleagues \nwhat is happening with respect to energy use in this country. Almost 50 \npercent of our electricity comes from coal. Without questioning it, we \nget up in the morning, flick on a switch, turn a knob, and turn a dial. \nWe do all of these things with our hands, and energy flows. One-half of \nthose activities are made possible because of the electricity that \ncomes from coal. Does anybody really think we are not going to use coal \nin the future? The problem is, when we use coal, we have CO2 \nthat is emitted into the air. This CO2 and other greenhouse \ngases contribute significantly to cause global climate change. So we \nneed to find a way to capture that CO2 and to store or \nsequester CO2 in geological formations or other means.\n  How do we use coal in the future? We use coal in the future by being \nable to capture this emitted CO2. So how do we do that? The \nquestion isn't whether we are going to use coal. The question is how \nare we going to use coal in the future.\n  There are some who say: Well, it is not possible to capture \nCO2. It is possible. Of course it is possible. At this point \nthe technology isn't fully proven, and it is expensive. Yet, we can see \nseveral technology options ahead.\n  Let me describe to my colleagues a plant in North Dakota, the only \none of its kind in North America. It produces synthetic gasoline from \nlignite coal. Let me tell my colleagues what we do with the \nCO2 in that plant. We capture the CO2 and use it \nfor enhanced oil recovery. It is one of the world's largest examples of \nCO2 capture at an industrial facility. Half of the \nCO2 produced at this facility is now captured. This \nCO2 is put in a pipeline under pressure and sent to \nSaskatchewan, Canada. Oil industry interests there pump it underground \nto enhance oil recovery. We are successfully using CO2 by \ncapturing it, keeping it out of the atmosphere, investing it \nunderground in Canada, and enhancing their oil recovery. That makes a \nlot of sense, and we need more of these types of projects. Is it \npossible? It is very possible. That one of the world's largest \napplications is being demonstrated in Beulah, North Dakota.\n  Now, what else can we do dealing with carbon and the capturing of \nCO2? If you are going to unlock the mystery of how you \ncontinue to use fossil fuels that we must use without impacting our \nenvironment and our planet, we need to have kind of a moonshot \napproach. We can't just tiptoe around the issue. We have to decide we \nare going to significantly commit funding--billions of dollars--to the \nresearch and demonstrations in science and technology.\n  Let me give you some examples. I was in Phoenix, Arizona recently, \nand I toured an electric utility called the Arizona Public Service. The \norganization in Arizona is producing CO2 at a coal-fired \nelectric generating plant. What they are doing with it is very \ninteresting. They are taking a stream of CO2 off their stack \nin a coal-fired electric generating plant and putting it in very long \ngreenhouses, and they are producing algae. This pictures shows one \nexample of greenhouses where they are doing it in tubes.\n  Most of us know what algae is. Algae is single-cell pond scum. Every \nkid knows what that is. You have been to a little pond where stagnant \nwater has hung around for a while and you see green slime or single-\ncell pond scum called algae. Algae grows in water. What does it need to \ngrow? It needs two things--sunlight and CO2.\n\n[[Page S4995]]\n\n  When I became chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee on the Senate side, I discovered that the research that \nused to go on with respect to algae was discontinued nearly 15 years \nago. Last year, for the first time, I reestablished funding to continue \nalgae research.\n  Let me tell you what they are doing in Arizona. In Arizona, they are \ntrying to demonstrate growing algae in these greenhouses which are next \nto a coal-fired electric generating plant. They take the CO2 \nfrom the plant and use it to grow this pond scum. In these very long \ngreenhouses where they are producing algae from the plant's \nCO2, they harvest the algae and produce diesel fuel. So what \nthey are doing is taking something that we want to get rid of to grow \nsingle-cell pond scum called algae, which increases its bulk in hours.\n  By the way, an equivalent acre of corn produces, in terms of ethanol \nfuel, about 300 or 400 gallons. An equivalent acre of soybeans I \nbelieve is around 80 to 100 gallons.\n  An equivalent acre of algae harvested for diesel fuel produces 3,000 \nto 4,000 gallons. Think of this. We use much coal to produce \nelectricity and that increased manmade CO2 is destructive to \nthe atmosphere. Yet capturing the CO2 and producing fuel is \nvery beneficial.\n  An Austin, TX, company came to see me. They have two demonstration \nprojects in Texas. They are taking flue gas off a coal plant, and they \nare producing several byproducts hydrogen, chloride, and baking soda. \nIsn't that interesting? These small demonstration projects take the \nflue gas from a coal electric generating plant, chemically treat it, \nand then produce these byproducts.\n  Take a look at this chart. Here is the baking soda, and it contains \nthe CO2. Instead of emitting it into the atmosphere, it is \nembedded in the CO2. It can be put in a landfill, but you \ncan also make cookies. I happen to like the idea of eating cookies from \nthis process. They said: Do you want to have some cookies produced from \ncoal? It tasted pretty good because it was produced with, among other \nthings, the baking soda which was a byproduct from coal.\n  Here is another example of what we can do. I have in my hand some \nsandstone. You can find this in many geologic formations, including \n10,000 to 15,000 feet underground in North Dakota. There also might be \na very viable way to capture and store the CO2 underground. \nThe carbon dioxide under pressure is pumped underground, attaches \nitself to sandstone and is therefore sequestered. We have examples, as \nI said previously, of CO2 being used in marginal oil wells.\n  We suck out oil all across the planet every single day. We stick \nstraws into the Earth, and we suck out 85 million barrels a day. We use \none-fourth of that oil produced every day in the United States. We have \na prodigious appetite for this energy. When you stick a drilling rig \ninto the ground and find oil, in many cases, you are only getting about \n30 percent of the oil pool pumped up. At that point, it is difficult to \nproduce any more without some extra help or advanced technology. If you \npump CO2 down into that ground under pressure, you enhance \noil recovery. You have a way to get rid of the CO2 by \nputting pressure on the oil to bring it up. You have gotten rid of the \nCO2, protected the environment, are still able to use coal \nand have enhanced the recovery of oil from domestic sources.\n  Why do I tell you all this? I think we need to produce substantial \nwind and other forms of renewable energy. We also have all kinds of \nneeds for efficiency and conservation opportunities. But, if we don't \nfind a way to unlock the opportunities to continue to use our fossil \nfuels, especially coal, we will not solve the problem that is brought \nto us with this piece of legislation on the Senate floor. How do we \nsolve the problem of being able to use coal in a carbon constrained \nfuture? Perhaps by producing baking soda or algae, we can end up \nproducing more cookies or biodiesel. Perhaps it's a dozen other \ninnovative approaches.\n  How do you do that? By investing in research and technological \ncapability. This will require substantially more funding. I was visited \nby Craig Venter, who is one of the two fathers of the Human Genome \nProject and an unbelievable American. He has now turned his attention \nto energy. They are working on sophisticated things that I have a \ndifficult time fully describing in simple terms. They are working on \ncreating new kinds of organisms and bacteria that could eat coal in \nunderground seams and produce liquid fuels. The Department of Energy's \nOffice of Science is also studying the gut system of termites with our \nscientists because we know there are 200 microbes in the intestinal \ntract of a termite. When they eat your house, and they love to eat \nwood, it produces methane. Most living things do. But termites are able \nto break down cellulose. If we are going to have a revolution in the \nuse of biofuels, we need to understand what these termites accomplish \nnaturally. We are trying to figure out what is it in the gut system of \ntermites that allows this insect to eat wood and break down cellulosic \nmaterials. If we can figure that out, we unlock another part of the \nmystery of how to produce more non-oil based fuels.\n  So here is the proposal I will offer today. It is an amendment that \nwould shift a substantial amount of money and dramatically increase the \namount of money available for research and technology for advancing \ncoal research. We would unlock the mysteries of going from research to \ndemonstration to commercial application of carbon capture and storage \nor other beneficial uses. If they don't do that, the goals of this bill \nwill fail. If we don't solve the problem without solving how to expand \ntechnology to use coal in a near zero emissions way, we can not meet \nthe goals outlined in this bill.\n  We have to make substantial investments in technology, science, and \nresearch. I was part of six of us in the Senate who said, some years \nago, pushed to double the amount of money we spend at the National \nInstitutes of Health because it is not spending, it is an investment in \nthe future. If we invest in cures for cancer, ALS, Parkinson's, \ndiabetes, heart disease, and so many more diseases, it will be \nbeneficial to generations around the world. We made the commitment and \ndoubled the amount of funding at the NIH.\n  We need the same kind of commitment with respect to our energy \nfuture. We need to decide we are going to make a commitment. Just as \nNIH deals with the health of people. This bill and the technology we \nneed to develop relates to the health of our economy, of our country, \nand of the expanded opportunities in this country. We need to make a \nsimilar commitment right now.\n  I propose an amendment that would take the underlying bill which has \nabout $17 billion for advancing coal research in the first 12 to 14 \nyears. This is a good start but is not enough. I propose to shift about \n$20 billion to that $17 billion and try to provide about $37 billion in \ntotal. That $37 billion in this cap and trade bill would be coupled \nwith the $500 million that I have each year through appropriations for \nclean coal research. By the way, this President's funding \nrecommendation on research in fossil fuels has largely been largely \nflat and very inadequate to our needs. He has mostly paid lip service \nto our tremendous needs. There is no evidence the White House is very \ninterested in this. Through such an amendment I propose to create a \nfund of at least about $3.5 billion a year, starting in 2009, because \nthese can start with the first auctions and the funding can be \navailable on the first opportunity after passage of a piece of \nlegislation. If this could be accomplished, we would have about $3.5 \nbillion a year for 12 to 14 years.\n\n  I am convinced we can do this. I am convinced that investments in \nthese technology opportunities allow us to address the climate change \nchallenge and still continue to use the most abundant source of energy \nin this country without injuring our environment. There are people out \nthere who are some of the best and the brightest scientists and \nengineers in our country. We need these people working on this issue. \nThere are many technological leaps that need to be made. The best minds \nshould be working on ways to take CO2, produce baking soda, \nand make cookies. They should be working on ways to have beneficial use \nof carbon, which is destructive to our environment, but can be \nconstructive if you invest it in algae and harvest the algae for diesel \nfuel.\n  Frankly, the amount of money that has been committed to research and\n\n[[Page S4996]]\n\ntechnology and development has been pathetic, just pathetic. It is not \njust this, it is also solar, wind, and other technologies. But Jeffrey \nSachs, a professor at Columbia University, has written a wonderful \nessay in Time Magazine this week. I commend him for saying we need a \nmoonshot here. My amendment is going to give us that opportunity--$37 \nbillion invested in the opportunity to unlock the mysteries of how we \nuse our most abundant resource and still protect our environment.\n  We can do this, but we cannot move forward and will not move forward \nin a way that says to our country we need to make investments. I \nbelieve we can produce a number of zero-emission, coal-fired electric \ngenerating facilities. It will not happen by accident. I chair the \nCommittee on Appropriations that funds all our national laboratories. \nThe thousands and thousands of the best scientists in this country are \na national treasure. We are now seeing many of them being furloughed \nand leaving our Federal payroll. We have so much to do, in such a short \ntime, to unlock the opportunities to address this issue I have \ndescribed. I hope we can move forward very aggressively.\n  Finally, in closing, I will speak at greater length on the floor \ntoday on this subject, and I may file an amendment today. But this, it \nseems to me, is the first key to unlock the opportunities that will \ngive us a future in which we can protect our environment and continue \nto use the resources we must use. This must be part of the step if the \npromise of not only this bill but future bills dealing with the great \nchallenge of global warming are to be fulfilled.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I will speak on the climate \nchange bill. How much time do we have under this order?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 8\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Is this in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are in morning business.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, what I wished to share with the \nSenate is how I come to the table on the question of the climate change \nbill.\n  We clearly understand something is happening to the Earth. The Earth \nis heating up. Obviously, there are interests that are going to be \naffected--special interests--if we go about changing the way we are \ndoing business, the kinds of pollutants we are putting in the air, and \nthose business interests will claim that, in fact, they are being \nharmed. I understand that. That is part of the body politic we have to \ncome together and find a solution on what will be the least detrimental \nto folks as we are trying to change the Government policy of all this \nstuff we are putting in the air. Indeed, we have been putting this in \nthe air ever since we started changing our society in the Industrial \nRevolution because the burning of fossil fuels is starting to \naccumulate carbon in the air. That carbon is acting as a shield in the \nupper atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect, that when the Sun's \nrays come in and hit the Earth, and they reflect off; normally, they \nwould radiate out into space. But the fact that we are creating a cap, \nsimilar to a greenhouse, with these gases--primarily carbon dioxide--\nthey are trapping that heat and, as a result, the Earth is heating up.\n  In the course of this debate, we will have a lot more scientific \nevidence that will come forth and tell us how many parts per million of \ncarbon in the air you can get before it becomes almost irreversible. We \ncertainly wish to avoid that. But that means we have to come back to \nthe political policy and make the decisions that will prevent us from \never getting to that concentration of carbon in the atmosphere that \nbecomes the point of no return, that at that point the Earth continues \nto heat up to the point that it has all the consequences--the \nconsequences of the ice sheet in Greenland, which I have been on, which \nis melting, and that in itself is 2 miles thick. It is freshwater \nbecause of the hundreds of thousands of years of the rain coming and \nthe rain turning into snow and the snow packing and, year after year, \nthe same thing happening. It is 2 miles thick in the center of \nGreenland. It is all freshwater.\n  If that melts, the seas are going to rise somewhere between 10 and 15 \nfeet--the entire seas of planet Earth are going to rise. What happens \nto Antarctica and the icecaps there? We will have testimony, and we \nwill have scientific evidence on all this. We cannot let that happen. \nSo we are going to have to make the policy changes; that is, we are \ngoing to have to have the political will in order to make the policy \nchanges, and the tough thing about this is that it is not just this \ncountry. We have to get the rest of the countries to do it. But America \nis the one that has to lead, and in the last decade, America has not \nled.\n\n  Let me just show this chart. This is my State. What would happen if \nthe seas rise? If they rise 10 feet, which is the red--here is the \nState of Florida. We are familiar with it, the peninsula with the \nFlorida Keys. If the seas rise 10 to 20 feet, Florida is going to look \nlike this, just the gray. All of this red and blue is going to be \nunderwater.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, most of the population of \nFlorida is along the coast. I don't want that to happen to my State. My \nState has more coastline than any other State in the continental United \nStates. Only Alaska has more coastline than our State. That is in \nexcess of 1,500 miles of coastline. That is where the population lives \nin Florida. I don't want that to happen to our State.\n  In the closing minutes that I have--Mr. President, will you tell me \nhow many minutes I have.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida has 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to share with the Senate \nwhat I saw from the window of a spacecraft. It is very typical that \nspace fliers, on the first day in space, will be looking for things. On \nthe 24th flight of the space shuttle over two decades ago, I was at \nthat window--when you can get time and you don't have much time because \nevery minute is planned--and I was looking for things. I was looking \nfor the cape where we were launched.\n  By the second day in space, your perspective has broadened and you \nare looking at continents. And by the third day in space, you are \nlooking back at home, and home is the planet. It is so beautiful, it is \nso colorful, it is such an alive creation suspended in the middle of \nnothing, and space is nothing. It is an airless vacuum that goes on and \non for billions of light years--and there is home. It is so beautiful.\n  Yet when you look at it, it is so fragile. You look at the rim of the \nEarth. There is a bright blue color right at the rim that fades off \ninto the blackness of outer space. And right at the rim of the Earth, \nyou can see the thin little film that sustains all of life, the \natmosphere. Even from that altitude, with the naked eye you can see how \nwe are messing it up. Coming across Brazil in the upper Amazon region, \nthe color contrast will show you where they are destroying the \nrainforests.\n  I came away from that profound experience of seeing home from a \ndifferent perspective, with a new feeling that I needed to be a better \nsteward of what God has given us--our home, the planet. If we continue \nto abuse the planet, Mother Nature will not work in syncopation and in \nbalance.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. For that reason, I am supporting this \nLieberman-Warner bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the first \nhalf of our morning business time, the 30 minutes, be divided equally \namong myself, Senator Chambliss, and Senator Sessions.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I first wish to raise the concern I have \nthat this extraordinarily complex piece of legislation, I have been \nadvised that this 342-page bill we have on our desks that we all \nassumed was the working document to which we have been drafting \namendments, is actually not going\n\n[[Page S4997]]\n\nto be the document we are going to be working from as early as this \nafternoon. I have been informed--and I ask colleagues whether this is, \nin fact, the case--that there is actually another bill, not 342 pages \nlong but 491 pages long, that will be laid down this afternoon by \nSenator Boxer.\n  It is very difficult for any of us to be prepared when the target \ncontinues to move. To those who are concerned, as the Senator from \nCalifornia and the majority leader have been about the speed with which \nwe address this bit of legislation, this does nothing but slow us down \nand make our job harder. I hope that is not the case, but that is what \nI am reliably informed.\n  To me, it is counterintuitive to say the least that we would \nundertake to pass legislation with a pricetag of $6.7 trillion that \nwill actually raise gas prices by 147 percent when families in my State \nand across the country are already paying an extra $1,400 a year for \ngas prices as a result of congressional inaction. Actually, I guess it \nis wrong to say congressional inaction because Congress has actually \nacted to impose a barrier to developing America's natural resources \nright here at home to the tune of roughly 3 million barrels of oil a \nday which, if it was made available and Congress would simply get out \nof the way, that would be additional supply which would bring down the \nprice of oil which would give us some temporary relief as we transition \nto a clean energy future for our country and for the world.\n  By that I mean by developing things such as greater use of nuclear \npower, using good old-fashioned American ingenuity, research and \ndevelopment to develop clean coal technology and the like.\n  In the near term, I think we all have to acknowledge the obvious fact \nthat oil is going to continue to be part of our future, but hopefully \nit will be a bridge to a future of clean energy independence, but not \nunless Congress acts. Congress is the problem.\n  I suggest when we look around for the causes of our current energy \ncrisis that Congress simply look in the mirror because we are the \nproblem. It is unfortunate that when the Senate had an opportunity \nrecently to vote on the American Energy Production Act that only 42 \nSenators voted for it. That was when gas was about $3.73 a gallon. \nToday the average price of a gallon of gas is $3.98 a gallon.\n  I asked the question then, and I will ask it again today: Is the \nSenate going to reject an opportunity to develop America's natural \nresources and bring down the price of gasoline at the pump when \ngasoline is at $3.98 a gallon? How about when it is at $5 a gallon or \n$6 a gallon? Where is the tipping point at which Congress is finally \ngoing to wake up and realize it is the reason Americans are paying too \nmuch at the pump?\n  Instead of dealing with that urgent need that affects every man, \nwoman, and child in this country, this Congress has decided to head \ndown another path, and that path is bigger Government, more taxes, \nhigher energy costs for electricity and gasoline, and with the \nuncertainty that any of this will actually have an impact on climate, \nespecially given the fact that countries such as China and India, of a \nbillion people each, are not going to agree to impose this on \nthemselves. So America is going to do this, presumably, while our major \nglobal competitors are not, and we are going to suffer not only those \nhigher prices but job losses, reduction in our gross domestic product, \nand a competitive disadvantage with the rest of the world. Why would we \ndo that to ourselves?\n  At the same time, we see this Rube Goldberg bureaucracy that would be \ncreated. Yesterday, Senator Dorgan said this bureaucracy would make \nHillaryCare pale in comparison with its complexity as reflected on this \nchart. This is the kind of huge expansion in Government power over our \nlives and over the economy that is unprecedented in our country, and I \nsuggest is the wrong solution, is the wrong answer to what confronts us \ntoday.\n  In my State in Texas, it has been estimated under that Boxer climate \ntax legislation that as many as 334,000 jobs would be lost as a result \nof the increased costs and taxes associated with this bill, with a \n$52.2 billion loss to the Texas economy, and an $8,000 additional \nsurcharge on each Texas household. That is over and above the $1,400 \nthat each Texas family is already paying because of congressional \ninaction on oil and gas prices. Electricity costs, 145 percent higher; \ngasoline, 147 percent higher.\n  I don't know why, at a time when the American people and the American \neconomy are already struggling with a soft economy in many parts of the \ncountry, why we would do this to ourselves. It simply does not make any \nsense to me.\n  I would like to have an explanation from our colleagues who are \nadvocating this particular legislation how they can possibly justify \nthis bill. What could be the possible rationale for legislation that \nwould do this to my State and have this sort of Draconian impact on the \neconomy of our country?\n  I have heard some talk that said that gas prices have increased \nduring the time President Bush has been in office. This is what has \nhappened since our friends on the other side of the aisle have \ncontrolled both the House of Representatives and the Senate. We see \nthere is a huge spike in gas prices during a Democratic-controlled \nCongress. But this should not be a partisan issue. This is a matter of \nthe welfare of the American family and of the American economy. Why in \nthe world would we not want to work together to try to develop the \nnatural resources that God has given us to create that additional 3-\nmillion-barrel supply of oil so we can reduce our dependence on \nimported oil from foreign sources?\n  The alternative proposed by our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle is, OK, we are going to impose higher taxes on the oil industry \nwhich, of course, would be passed along to consumers and raise the \nprice of gasoline even more or they say we are going to have another \ninvestigation into price gouging when the Federal Trade Commission has \ninvestigated time and time again and found no evidence to justify a \ncharge of price gouging when it comes to gasoline prices or they say we \nare going to sue OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries, which has to be the most boneheaded suggestion I have heard \nbecause, of course, what in the world would you ask the judge to order \nif you were successful in suing OPEC? I presume to open the spigot even \nwider so we would be more dependent on foreign oil and not less.\n  It is time for a real solution. This bill is not it. I call on my \ncolleagues to do what we can to open America's natural resources to \ndevelopment and bring down the price of gasoline at the pump.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, what is the time agreement at this \nstage?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is allocated 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, our Nation wants progress toward energy \nsecurity, affordable energy. It wants to reduce pollution and it wants \nto fight global warming. There is no doubt about that. It wants us, \nthis Congress, to do something. But it wants us to do the right things, \nwise things, prudent things, not wrong things.\n  I traveled my State this past week, all week, from every corner of \nit. My wife and I traveled around and we talked to a lot of people. One \nthing that is absolutely clear to anybody who has eyes to see and ears \nto hear is that the American people are terribly concerned about \nsurging gasoline and electricity prices that are rising, and this is \nhurting them. This is not an academic matter we are talking about. \nAverage families, carpooling and driving to work, are going to the gas \npump and finding that when the month is over, their bill is now $50, \n$75, or $100 more for the same amount of gasoline that they bought 2 or \n3 years ago, and it impacts their budget. They have less money to pay \nother bills with, to fix the brakes on the car, or purchase a set of \ntires, or take a trip, or have a medical expense, or buy a new suit of \nclothes. These things are reduced when we have now added to their \nnormal expenses $50, $75, or $100 a month for fuel.\n  Some of that, I believe, we can do something about; some of that we \nmay not. We have to be honest with our constituents. But they want us \nto do something. They are not happy, and they should not be, that we \nare importing 60 percent of the gasoline and oil that we will need to \nrun our country\n\n[[Page S4998]]\n\nfrom foreign countries, many of which are hostile to us. We are \ntransferring out of our country $500 billion to purchase that oil. It \nis the greatest wealth transfer in the history of the world. No one has \never seen anything like it before, and it is, in my opinion, without \nany doubt a factor--a major factor; perhaps the major factor--in the \neconomic slowdown we are seeing today and making us less competitive, \nand it is reducing and threatening the health of our economy.\n  Now, when you talk to people in my State, and I think any State that \nyou would consider, and you tell them: Well, we are going to be talking \nabout energy matters next week, and we have a cap-and-trade bill that \nis on the Senate floor, our good and decent and trustworthy citizens, \nthe ones who still have a modicum of confidence in Congress, you know \nwhat they think? You know what they think? They think we are going to \nset about in Congress to do something about surging energy prices, to \ncontain the increase in gasoline prices, to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil and this incredible wealth transfer leaving our Nation's \nsecurity at risk. They think we are going to take steps to strengthen \nthe American economy.\n  Why shouldn't they? Isn't that what they pay us to do? But, oh, no, \nthey would be shocked to learn that the Democratic leadership, the \nleadership of that great Democratic party which claims to represent \nmiddle-class Americans, is uninterested in these matters but is now \nattempting to pass legislation that will raise taxes, substantially \nraise energy costs, gasoline prices, by 50 cents plus a gallon, will \ncause worker layoffs, and will hurt our economy and leave us less \ncompetitive in the world marketplace. That is what this bill will do. \nIt is the opposite of what the American people, our dutiful citizens \nwho send us here, would expect us to be doing at this time.\n  On Monday, my good friend, Senator Reid, the Democratic leader--and I \ndo admire him, and he has a tough job, there is no doubt about it. I \nknow he can't make everybody happy--seemed hurt Monday that the \nRepublican Leader Mitch McConnell said bringing this bill up \ndemonstrated he was out of touch. Well, I say that is maybe too nice a \nterm. Maybe ``clueless'' would have been a legitimate term. Senator \nReid is such a wonderful guy. He comes from Searchlight, NV. I suggest \nhe go back to Searchlight and talk to real people. What are they going \nto say, that they want us to raise prices of gasoline? Give me a break. \nThey are not going to tell him that in Searchlight, just as they didn't \ntell me in Alabama to come here and pass higher taxes on gasoline, to \ncreate bureaucracies the likes of which we have never seen, to create \nhigh energy prices, to drive up the price of energy by this complex, \nsneaky cap-and-trade tax system that the Wall Street Journal calls the \ngreatest wealth transfer since the income tax, or to create a \nbureaucracy that is going to monitor this complexity throughout the \ncountry.\n  It is an unbelievable 342 pages, this bill that is now before us, and \nit is not the right thing. It would represent an injection of \nWashington into the most marvelous thing we have, in many ways, in our \ncountry--the free American economy. It would be an injection of \nWashington into that economy of unprecedented proportions.\n  The goal of this legislation is to reduce CO2 emissions in \nour country, they say, by 71 percent by 2050. That means to reduce the \namount of carbon fuels we use by 71 percent by 2050. But the population \nis increasing in our country during this time significantly, by every \npoll that I think is accurate, and when you calculate that, it means we \nare going to reduce carbon emissions per American--per capita--by 90 \npercent. It means virtually the elimination of coal, natural gas, and \ngasoline and oil--eliminate those from the American economy. We do not \nhave the science and the technology to get us there as of now, yet this \nbill would put us on a direct glidepath toward that direction.\n  So the fact that this is a tax, that it would drive up energy costs--\nindeed is a sneaky tax on the American people--is indisputable. Nobody \ndisputes that. To borrow a phrase from former Vice President Gore, the \ndebate is over on that question. This bill will increase the cost of \nenergy, and high energy prices will reduce economic output, reduce our \npurchasing power, lower the demand for goods and services, make us less \ncompetitive in the world, and ultimately cost American jobs. That is a \nfact. Supporters will argue that it creates a fund to alleviate high \nenergy costs for low-income Americans by reallocating some of the \ntrillions of dollars to people, according to the political whims of, I \nguess, this Congress, to decide who will win and who will get money \nback and who won't get money back. The current increase in gasoline \nprices alone amounts to about 50 cents a gallon, as I indicated, under \nthis legislation. And, amazingly, it does nothing, zero, to produce any \nmore clean American energy and to lower the price of gasoline to \nproduce our energy here at home. I worry about that.\n  In the years to come, we are going to be using a lot of oil and gas \nand coal. We could use clean coal to create liquid fuels that we could \nburn in our automobiles. All of that absolutely can be done to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil. Let me tell you, there is a big \ndifference economically, if you take a moment to think about it, in \nsending $500 billion to Venezuela and Saudi Arabia and UAE to buy oil \nwith than if we spent that money at home creating American jobs for \nAmerican workers.\n  I tell my colleagues that this is a bill that is unjustified and \nunwise. It is change, but change in the wrong direction, and I urge its \ndefeat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I first of all commend my colleague \nfrom Alabama, and I associate myself with his remarks because he is \ndead on target.\n  I also rise today to discuss the Climate Security Act that is before \nthe Senate. First, I thank all of our colleagues who have been \nresponsible for bringing this bill to the floor because we need to \ndebate this issue. It is a critical issue that is important to all \nAmericans, not only this generation but future generations. I have two \ngrandchildren, and I want to make sure we leave our grandchildren an \nAmerica better than we inherited it. So it is a critically important \ndebate.\n  The Climate Security Act will require the transformation of the U.S. \neconomy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an attempt to lower the \naverage world temperature in 2050 and beyond. I note, however, that in \na study done by the University of Georgia, released last year, it was \ndetermined that over the past 100 years the actual temperature in \nAmerica had been reduced by 1 degree, not raised any at all but \nactually reduced.\n  It is estimated the Climate Security Act will generate increased \nrevenues of $6.7 trillion using allowances and auctions. A large \nportion is given directly to various Federal and State programs outside \nof the normal budget and appropriations process. However, this amount \nof revenue must come from somewhere, and unfortunately, under this \nbill, it is going to come from you, me, and from American individuals \nand families who will pay higher costs for the energy we use to live.\n  Economic models have overwhelmingly shown this bill will affect \nconsumers directly through higher gasoline and electricity prices, \nresulting in lower household incomes and millions of jobs being lost in \nAmerica. Moreover, the national economy will be harmed as gross \ndomestic product is expected to drop considerably over the next 40 \nyears, should this bill be enacted.\n  We also know this bill will constrain the supply and significantly \nraise the cost of transportation fuel. Like many of my colleagues, I \nspent the Memorial Day recess traveling around my home State. The \naverage price of a gallon of diesel was $4.77 per gallon, and regular \ngasoline averaged $3.98 per gallon. These are the highest prices ever \nrecorded in my home State of Georgia, and this is my constituents' No. \n1 issue.\n  So it troubles me, as we are seeing almost $4 per gallon gasoline in \nmy home State, that some in this body want to enact legislation that \nwould further increase the price of a gallon of gas. I hear from \nhundreds of Georgians every day who are struggling to fill their tanks \nto get to work or to take their kids to school or to run their \nnecessary errands.\n\n[[Page S4999]]\n\n  I will be honest, I don't know how the average American, the average \nGeorgian in particular, is coping with this issue--with the rapid \nincrease in the price of a gallon of gas.\n  EPA models show that the gasoline prices will rise by a minimum of 53 \ncents per gallon if this bill were implemented. Why would we do that to \nthe American people, who are already hurting at the pump?\n  Regrettably, the legislation before this body would do nothing to \nincrease our domestic supply of oil and help alleviate the lack of \nsupply of gas that is driving the prices up.\n  Instead, this bill will only keep prices rising. The Energy \nInformation Agency study predicts that gasoline prices will increase \nanywhere from 41 cents per gallon to $1 per gallon by 2030 due to this \nlegislation. Some estimates have gasoline prices rising by as much as \n145 percent in my home State of Georgia. This is unacceptable to the \npeople of my State and unacceptable to the people of this country.\n  Nobody disputes the fact that the United States is dependent on \nforeign sources of oil. We currently import 60 percent of our oil--\nactually a little greater than 60 percent--and nobody disputes that \nthis problem has been in the making for decades. Over the past 30 \nyears, the United States has reduced our domestic exploration options \nand left our refining capacity stagnant.\n\n  The rising cost of fuel requires a multi-pronged strategy to respond. \nThat is why we must take commonsense action and increase our domestic \nsupply of oil by exploring where we know there are resources available \nand encouraging the development of alternative fuels, such as \ncellulosic ethanol, to decrease our reliance on foreign oil.\n  We must find both short-term and long-term solutions to provide \nenergy security for our Nation and give relief to Americans.\n  This bill will attack citizens at the pump and increase their \nelectricity costs, thus exacerbating job losses to overseas markets.\n  Higher energy costs to businesses and the necessity to invest in \nexpensive low carbon technologies will force companies to raise the \nprices of their products, opening the market up to low-cost \ninternational competition, or move businesses to China or Mexico, where \nenvironmental regulations are lacking. Millions more jobs will be lost \nin America as a result. One study estimates that between 1.1 and 1.8 \nmillion jobs will be lost by 2020 as U.S. companies close or move \noverseas. Another study shows that up to 4 million jobs will be lost by \n2030 inside the United States if this legislation becomes law. It has \nbeen estimated that in Georgia alone we may lose as many as 155,400 \njobs, should this legislation be enacted.\n  Manufacturing jobs will be one of the hardest hit sectors as the \nEnergy Information Administration projects that manufacturing output \nwill decline by up to 9.5 percent in 2030. This country has already \nlost 19 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2000. This legislation \nwill only help push those jobs outside of our borders.\n  The cost to American families will be too much for many to bear. An \nEPA study estimates that the cost per household in Georgia will be as \nmuch as $608 in 2020, and nearly $4,400 per year in 2050. The median \nhousehold income in Georgia is $64,000. CRA International states that \nthe average increased cost to families is $1,740 per family in 2020.\n  Workers keeping their jobs would be subject to much lower wages, due \nto increased competition and increased costs. Even with lower incomes, \nfamilies would be expected to pay more to heat their homes and fill up \ntheir cars. The Environmental Protection Agency has stated that \nelectricity prices will increase an additional 44 percent by 2030. In \nGeorgia, the estimated cost will be 135 percent higher if this \nlegislation is enacted.\n  This will be devastating to families across the country.\n  According to Housing and Urban Development, poor families spend \nalmost five times as much of their monthly budget in meeting their \nenergy needs--19 percent--as wealthier Americans, who spend \napproximately 4 percent.\n  Increases in energy prices due to carbon limits would hit the poor \nfive times harder, which certainly will be unsustainable. This bill, by \nsome estimates, will hit the average Georgia household in an amount \nequal to $7,231.\n  The effects this legislation will have on consumers is outrageous: \nhigher gasoline prices, higher electricity prices, lower household \nincomes, and job losses.\n  In closing, let me touch on some specific aspects of the bill. While \nthe bill includes a market-based cap-and-trade system----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator has 1 \nminute remaining.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I believe this bill could be more fair and equitable. \nWe also should work to make it more predictable for businesses and \nunderstandable to taxpayers and consumers. One of the greatest \nchallenges to any climate bill will be to ensure that it does not \nstymie economic growth and protects American jobs. We need to continue \nto seek the best way to generate the greatest benefits for the lowest \ncost. We cannot burden our children and our grandchildren with \nincreased energy costs.\n  A climate bill must be flexible to adjust to changing science, \neconomic conditions, and the actions of other countries. The Climate \nSecurity Act attempts to encourage other countries to reduce emissions, \nbut does not appear to be flexible enough to ensure Americans are not \ndisadvantaged because of the inaction of other nations.\n  The details of the Climate Security Act will greatly affect every \nAmerican and are extremely important. Have no doubt about it, a vote \nfor cloture on this bill is a vote to increase gas prices by a minimum \nof 53 cents per gallon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the remainder of \ntime for our business for the next 27 minutes be allotted to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to take a moment on the heels of \nthe comments of my friend and colleague from Georgia to look at some of \nthe hard and fast numbers. We can conjecture here all we want about \nwhat is going to happen to the price of gasoline going forward. He \nsuggested it is going up by 100 percent or 150 percent--who knows? Here \nis what happened. This we do know. We do know the price of gasoline \nstarting back here in 2001 was at about $1.50 a gallon and has risen \ntoday to almost $4 a gallon. We do know that. We can conjecture until \nthe cows come home about what might happen in the future, but we do \nknow what happened in the past under the watch of the current \nadministration. It is not pretty. If we want to make sure this trend \ncontinues, we will not come up with ways to reduce our consumption of \noil; we will not produce more energy-efficient cars, trucks, and vans; \nwe will not reduce the amount of miles we travel in our communities and \nour States; we will not find a whole host of ways to conserve energy; \nwe will not come up with ways to conserve energy through renewables. If \nwe don't do any of those things, this kind of thing will continue. Our \nchallenge here today and the way to make sure this doesn't continue is \nto pursue legislation along the tracks of that which is before us today \nand this week.\n  I begin today by commending the work of Senator Boxer, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Warner, and others in developing this global warming \nlegislation. Let me say to my colleagues, your initial bill was a good \nstart. I believe the version that has been brought before the Senate \nthis week represents a significant improvement over that original \nproposal. The leadership of this troika--it is actually tripartisan \nleadership--a Democrat, a Republican, and an Independent--your \nleadership gives me hope we will pass landmark legislation on this \nfront, not this week, not this month, probably not this year, but in \nthe not too distant future when hopefully we have a new administration, \nregardless of who is President, who is more amenable, more supportive, \nmore understanding of addressing global warming. I plan to do all I can \nin the meantime to make sure we do not lose that opportunity.\n\n  As a lot of my colleagues may know, addressing global warming has \nbeen an important issue for me since my early days in the Senate. I \nthink the facts are indisputable today. Our planet is growing warmer. \nWe human beings are a major contributor to that.\n\n[[Page S5000]]\n\n  My passion on this issue began about a dozen or so years ago when I \nfirst met two doctors, Dr. Lonnie Thompson and Dr. Ellen Mosley-\nThompson, as they received something called the Commonwealth Award for \nScience in Wilmington, DE for their pioneering work on global warming. \nThe Thompsons are natives of West Virginia, as am I, and they are both \nprofessors at Ohio State University, where I received my undergraduate \ndegree, and both are world renowned for their research on the effects \nglobal climate change is having on glaciers and ice fields throughout \nthe world. Measuring levels of carbon from ice core samples that go \nback nearly 1 million years in time, they focused on glaciers and ice \ncaps atop mountains in Africa and South America. They have concluded \nthat many of them--that being the mountains and glaciers, the ice caps \non the mountains and glaciers--will probably melt within the next 15 \nyears or so because of global warming. They fear little can be done to \nsave them. It is up to us in this body to prove the skeptics wrong, to \nshow we can do something, we can pull together and we can address this \nthreat to our planet.\n  Three years ago during our Senate debate on this same issue, I \nstressed that the Arctic sea ice had shrunk by 250 million acres over \nthe past 30 years, an area about the size of California, Maryland, \nTexas--and maybe Delaware--combined.\n  Today, I am sad to say, the Arctic sea ice has shrunk by not 250 \nmillion acres but 650 million acres, an area the size of Alaska and \nTexas combined or the size of 10 United Kingdoms combined. If we \ncontinue down this path on which we have started, the consequences for \nour planet and our country and our people will be catastrophic. It is \nup to us to ensure that America leads the world down a different path. \nWe must and we should.\n  The EPA estimates that unless global warming is controlled, sea \nlevels will rise by as much as 2 feet over the next 50 years. I have \nheard even greater amounts over the next 100 years. For island nations \nand coastlines, that could mean entire cities and beaches are wiped \nout. It is up to us in this body to ensure that those beaches and those \ncities, those coastlines, are preserved.\n  I have a chart here I want to share with my friends. For those of you \nwho have not been to Delaware, this is Delaware: About 100 miles end to \nend, and from east to west, maybe 50 miles here. This is the outline of \nour coast. This is Lewes. This is Cape Henlopen. This is Rehoboth \nBeach, Dewey Beach, Bethany Beach, Fenwick Island, the Nation's summer \ncapital. This is where the beach is today. Fifty years from now, if we \ndon't do anything about global warming, sea level rises will have been \n2 feet and this will be the beach in Delaware. This is Dover, DE, our \nState capital. This past Sunday we hosted 150,000 people from all over \nthe country--NASCAR race. In 50 years from now, if we are not careful, \nthis will not be Dover, it will be Dover Beach. We won't be having \nNASCAR races at Dover Beach. We may be having sailing regattas, we may \nhave motorboat races, but we will not be having stock car races unless \nwe do something about it, so this is imperative for a lot of reasons, \nincluding some that are close to my heart.\n  Since our last Senate debate on this issue we have seen the \nscientific community come together on this issue. The Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change has undeniably affirmed that the warming of our \nclimate system is linked to us, human activity. We also know the United \nStates is one of the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, \nalong with the Chinese. In fact, they may have overtaken us by now. We \naccount, in this country, for almost 20 percent of the world's \ngreenhouse gas emissions and for almost one-quarter of the world's \neconomic output. I believe our Nation has a responsibility to reduce \nour emissions of CO2. In short, we have a responsibility to \nlead.\n  Unfortunately, we have not seen a whole lot of leadership coming from \nthe White House or enough from the Congress on this front. At least not \nyet. That has to change and that change is starting, I hope, this week. \nOthers, in the meantime, have begun filling the void. We have another \nchart here. This is a chart of our country. There is a lot of green, \nlight green, dark green, and blue. The light green areas are the areas \nwhere the States are actually developing their own climate action \nplans. They have been waiting for us. They have given up on that. They \nstarted to take the bull by the horns. Light green is where States have \nsomething in progress in terms of developing their climate action \nplans. The dark greens are the States where they completed action. The \nblues are where they have revisions in progress--about 38 States. They \nhave been waiting for us. They are tired of waiting for us, and I don't \nblame them. One of those States is Delaware. We have a plan in my State \nand a lot of other States will soon have plans to reduce their own \ncarbon emissions.\n  The States are not the only ones filling the void of Federal \ninaction. Fortunately, our Nation's businesses, a number of them, are \ndoing the same thing. Companies such as DuPont, a global manufacturer \nheadquartered in my home State of Delaware, have taken steps to reduce \ntheir own carbon emissions.\n  DuPont CEO Chet Holliday has said:\n\n       As a company, DuPont believes that action is warranted, not \n     further debate. We also believe the best approach is for \n     business to lead, not to wait for public outcry or government \n     mandates.\n\n  Contrary to concerns that combating global warming will hurt American \nbusinesses, DuPont's actions have had major positive impacts on its \nbottom line. In the mid-1990s, as part of a climate change initiative, \nDuPont began aggressively maximizing energy efficiency. That initiative \nhas allowed DuPont to hold its energy use flat while increasing \nproduction. As a result, DuPont reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by \nmore than 70 percent. By doing so, the company actually saved $3 \nbillion--billion, with a ``b.'' But a patchwork of State initiatives \ncombined with good corporate stewardship, however welcome, is not \nenough. We must have a comprehensive national approach, not only to \ngive a signal to corporate America that this is a priority, but to the \nworld, the United States is prepared at long last to be a leader on \nthis front as well.\n  I have enough faith in American technology, American ingenuity and \nknow-how, to believe we can provide that leadership without endangering \nour Nation's economic growth.\n  In fact, if we are smart about it, we will end up strengthening our \nNation's economy, we will end up creating hundreds of thousands of new \ngreen jobs and we will end up creating products and technologies we can \nsell and export around the world.\n  I would quote Thomas Edison on opportunity. This is what Thomas \nEdison loved to say about opportunity: A lot of people miss out on \nopportunity because opportunity comes along wearing overalls and is \ndisguised and looks a lot like work.\n  You know, some people look at global warming, our dependence on \nforeign oil or emissions or bad stuff in the air, and they see a \nproblem. I see an opportunity. It is an opportunity that brings with it \neconomic advantages and the possibility of creating jobs and products \nthat flow from that, including technology and jobs and products.\n  Well, that is one of the big reasons I support the approach of the \nLieberman-Warner Climate Security Act, to provide a solid framework for \ncreating a national, mandatory program to dramatically reduce \ngreenhouse gas over the next 40 years or so.\n  I am pleased to see Chairwoman Boxer's substitute makes several \nimprovements over the bill we passed in the committee last year. \nSpecifically, I applaud the chairwoman's efforts in strengthening the \nrecycling and cost-containment sections of the bill.\n  Let me take a minute here, if I can, colleagues, to focus on the \nimportance of recycling and combating global warming.\n  A lot of times people say: What can I do as an individual to help on \nglobal warming? As it turns out, everybody can recycle. Everybody can \ndo that. Here are a couple of reasons why.\n  In 2006, the United States threw away literally, in cans of trash, \nsome 82 million tons of material, with a recycling rate of about one-\nthird--we recycled about a third of that stuff. Let me back up. Let me \nsay that again. In 2006, the United States recycled about 80 million \ntons of materials. That is about one-\n\n[[Page S5001]]\n\nthird of all that we would otherwise throw away, offsetting the release \nof some 50 million tons of carbon. That is equivalent to the emissions \nwe save by recycling some 39 million cars each year, because we \nrecycle. However, we only recycle about one-third of what we could. \nHowever, each year Americans discard enough aluminum to rebuild our \nentire domestic airline fleet every 3 months.\n  Put simply, increasing recycling cuts greenhouse gas emissions. To \nencourage recycling, the bill compels States to bolster recycling \nprograms by requiring that no less than 5 percent of carbon credit \nrevenues allocated to States must be used for improving recycling \ninfrastructure to help States and local communities recycle more. I \nwish to thank the chairwoman again for working with me on this \nimportant issue.\n  Let me talk about cost containment next. I am also pleased with the \ncost-containment provisions Senator Boxer included in the substitute, \nsuch as the extra pool of allowances available in the early years to \nhelp contain high prices and the allowances that are returned to \ncustomers to keep energy prices down. I believe these provisions are \nmoving us in the right direction to address any runaway costs that \nmight occur in a new market.\n  Although this bill is a good start, I believe we can make some \nsignificant improvements in it, particularly in the area of pollution \ncontrol, in the areas of output allocations and transit, encouraging \npeople to get out of their cars and take a bus, take a train to get \nwhere they need to go.\n  Let me start off by addressing the four p's. It stands for the four \npollutants. I appreciate that this bill acknowledges that dangerous air \npollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury, are \nemitted by the power sector in this country. However, acknowledging a \nproblem is not the same as solving that problem. I believe that in \naddition to reducing greenhouse gases, we must additionally pass a \ncomprehensive bill that also reduces these other three harmful \npollutants.\n  As some of my colleagues know because I have driven you crazy over \nthe last 5 or 6 years on this, visiting many of your offices, 12 of my \ncolleagues and I introduced the Clean Air Planning Act of 2007, or \nCAPA. We believe CAPA provides an aggressive, yet achievable, schedule \nfor powerplants to reduce emissions and alleviate some of our worst \nair-related health and environmental problems, such as ozone, acid \nrain, mercury contamination, and, of course, global warming. This \nmultipollutant approach fits perfectly within the framework of this \ncomprehensive global warming bill. I believe we would be foolish to \naddress only one pollutant coming out of our Nation's smokestacks, \nhowever important it is--carbon dioxide--while others--sulfur dioxide, \nnitrogen oxide, and mercury--threaten our health and our environment \ntoo.\n  My State of Delaware, along with the States around us--Maryland, \nVirginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey--we are at the end of the \nNation's tailpipe. We continue to breathe dirty air. During the summer \nmonths, when ozone pollution is at its worse, more than 10,000 \nDelawareans cannot work or carry out daily activities. Nationally, some \n27 million children age 13 and younger are being exposed to unhealthy \nlevels of ozone.\n  We have another chart here. Not only do we have problems with folks \nbreathing bad air, which is harming their lungs and their respiratory \nsystems, for young children being carried in the mother's womb, mothers \ningest large amounts of fish that contain mercury. This year some \n630,000 infants will be born with high levels of mercury exposure. As a \nresult, they could have brain damage. A number of them will have \ndevelopmental delays, some will have mental retardation, and some of \nthem will have blindness.\n  Sulfur dioxide emissions, meanwhile, from powerplants will cause \n24,000 Americans to die this year--24,000 this year, 462 this week, 66 \ntoday, and 1 or 2 during the time I am speaking here will die because \nof exposure to sulfur dioxide emissions from powerplants. I do not know \nhow many people are going to die from climate change, from global \nwarming, from CO2 emissions in this country in this year. I \ncan tell you how many will die from sulfur dioxide--24,000. Twenty-four \nthousand. That is almost as many people who live in Dover, DE--24,000 \npeople. Fossil fuel-fired powerplants are the single largest source of \npollution that is causing these health problems.\n  If we do not act to tighten our emissions of these pollutants, too \nmany communities will continue to live with the air that is unhealthy \nto breathe and mercury will continue to pollute our communities and \nbring harm to pregnant women and to children.\n  I believe it is not only the right thing to do but also the economic \nthing to do. Strict caps for all four pollutants, not just carbon \ndioxide, can help drive technology toward a comprehensive mitigation \nrather than a piecemeal approach. That is why I am introducing an \namendment, along with Senator  Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, that \nachieves similar reductions for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and \nmercury that are in CAPA but are adjusted to fit the Lieberman-Warner \ntimetable.\n  The bottom line is, as we develop an economywide solution to global \nwarming, we cannot lose sight of the simultaneous need to enact \nstricter caps on mercury, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide from \npowerplants.\n  Next, let me turn to something called output allocations, the way we \nallocate the credits to polluters that emit carbon dioxide. I applaud \nthis bill's provisions that provide important funding for zero- and \nlow-carbon technology as well as funding to encourage the \ncommercialization of carbon capture and sequestration for coal-fired \ngeneration of electricity.\n  However, I believe we are going to use coal for a long time. We have \nto figure out how to capture the other major pollutants as well, and \nthe sooner the better. I believe the Boxer substitute can do better to \nsupport clean and efficient power generation. I am concerned this \nlegislation still provides too many subsidies to dirty, less-\nefficient power generation at the expense of new, clean technologies.\n\n  Global warming legislation should make wind and other renewable \nenergy products more economically viable. Affordable clean energy \nshould be one of our main goals.\n  Unfortunately, this bill still continues on the same old paradigm of \nrewarding the historical polluters by distributing pollution allowances \non an ``input'' basis. This means allowances to emit CO2 in \nthis bill are allocated based on historic emissions and the fuel being \nused rather than with respect to the efficiency with which power is \ngenerated.\n  Output-based allocation is an important policy tool to ensure that \nexisting powerplants--particularly coal-fired plants--are made far more \nefficient and clean within a reasonable period of time. That is why I \nam planning on offering an amendment to change the distribution of \nallowances in the fossil fuel-powered sector from an input allocation \nto an output allocation.\n  It seems to me, colleagues, here we are trying to figure out how to \napportion those allowances to emit CO2. Why not provide more \nallowances to those utilities that create more electricity by using \nless energy? That is what we should be doing. Unfortunately, what we do \nin this bill is we provide more allocation to emit CO2 to \npowerplants that use more energy rather than less energy. We should \nreally provide the allocation and distribution of allowances--to some \nextent, at least--to reward those that provide a lot of electricity \nwithout using a lot of energy.\n  In addition to providing allowances to efficient fossil fuel \nfacilities, my amendment--our amendment--would also provide allowances \nfor new entrants generating electricity from other renewable forms of \nenergy.\n  I have a couple of thoughts on this one. I and some of my colleagues \nare strong supporters of safe--underline ``safe''--and secure--\nunderline ``secure''--nuclear power and believe it must be a prominent \npart of any global warming solution.\n  The resurgence of nuclear power in the United States gives us a \nunique opportunity to rebuild a carbon-free energy industry and create, \nin doing so, tens of thousands of highly skilled jobs for building the \nplants and operating them in the future. But to do this, we must \nprovide support and incentives to the nuclear manufacturers to \nredevelop the workforce--especially facilities--and capacity to \nparticipate and ultimately lead the world in quality nuclear \nmanufacturing. That is why I\n\n[[Page S5002]]\n\nhave joined Senator Warner and Senator Lieberman in an amendment we \nwill offer that provides a sense of the Senate that supports workforce \ntraining for the nuclear industry.\n  Next, transit. Finally, I wish to discuss a very important provision \nin the Boxer substitute that funds transportation alternatives.\n  I talked to you earlier about the importance of getting us out of our \ncars, trucks, and vans and getting us to take alternative forms of \ntransportation that use less energy and produce less pollution. The \ntransportation sector is responsible for about 30 percent of our \nNation's carbon dioxide emissions, almost one-third. That is why \nCongress passed legislation that I coauthored with a number of my \ncolleagues last year--Senator Feinstein and others--to increase auto \nfuel economy from an average of 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles a \ngallon by 2020. The bill before us today also includes a low-carbon \nfuel standard and funding for alternative fuels.\n  Let's look at this chart here on my left. This line right here shows \nwhat CO2 emissions are from our car, truck, and van fleet \nstarting in 2005 by incorporating the new CAFE standards for 35 miles \nper gallon by 2020. Here is where we end up in CO2 emissions \nfor cars, trucks, and vans. Great progress. Unfortunately, if we keep \ndriving more and more every year, the great reductions in \nCO2 which could be recognized here are going to end up with \nno reduction at all unless we do something about vehicle miles traveled \nand reduce the amount of time we spend in our cars, trucks, and vans \nrather than continue to see that grow as we have over the last decades.\n  Living in sprawling areas without transit literally can double a \nfamily's greenhouse gas emissions. The negative consequences go beyond \nimpacting our environment. With gas prices approaching $4 a gallon, \nlonger commutes and increased distances required for errands costs \nmoney too.\n  Public transportation has saved Americans from an additional 286 \nmillion hours of sitting in traffic. So we included a provision in this \nbill--Senator Cardin was very active on this--to use some of the \nauction proceeds to provide people with an alternative to driving, \nadditional alternatives to people to driving. This provision in the \nbill would provide transit to more communities and would also expand \ntransit where it already exists. That is good for our environment, it \nis good for our pocketbooks, and it is good for our peace of mind.\n  While this provision is important, we need to find a way to give \ncommunities a greater say in how they can spend their transit dollars. \nTransit is needed across our Nation. However, many communities would \nbenefit from improved bike and pedestrian infrastructure, be they \nsidewalks, crosswalks, traffic calming, bike lanes--you name it. In \nrural areas, increasing freight rail capacity might be the most \neffective way to reduce vehicle pollution. Ideally, I think we ought to \nleave it to the local communities to determine which strategy works \nbest for them and therefore allow all communities to take steps to \naddress this portion of transportation pollution. Having said that, the \nprovisions in this bill are a good first attempt to address this \nproblem. We ought to do those, but we can do more and should do more.\n  As the only Member of the Senate who serves on all three \ntransportation-related committees, I look forward to attempting to \nbring those three committees together and agree on a comprehensive \napproach to reducing carbon emissions from the transportation sector \nbefore we address climate change next year.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Chair.\n  In closing, I appreciate the significant progress that has been made \nalready to improve this legislation. I applaud the efforts of my \ncolleagues, Senators Boxer, Lieberman, and Warner, for the work they \nand their staffs and our staffs have done. The authors of the bill can \nbe proud and their staffs should be commended, our staff should be \ncommended.\n  We have seen forward-looking companies such as DuPont show leadership \nand vision to develop a business plan for operating in a carbon-\nconstrained economy. We have seen States such as California, Delaware, \nand a few others take action to reduce our carbon emissions.\n  What we have not seen yet is leadership from our Federal Government. \nWhile we continue to do nothing, or too little, our international \ncompetitors are already developing new technologies and preparing for \nthe future.\n  President John Kennedy once said:\n\n       There are risks and costs to a program of action. But they \n     are far less than the long-range risks and costs of \n     comfortable inaction.\n\n  I recognize that despite the hard work of our staffs, Members, and \nleaders on this issue, there is a good chance this conversation will \nneed to continue next year. It will and it should. I believe we must \nact on this issue next year, if we ultimately are unable to find common \nground this year. That is why I am committed to joining Senators Boxer, \nLieberman, and Warner in leading discussions today and throughout the \nyear and bringing together all involved interests and parties to forge \na path forward toward a solution that can pass the Congress early in \nthe next administration. As Members of the Senate, we have a \nresponsibility to ensure that our country provides leadership for the \nworld in which we live on any number of fronts. The time has come for \nus to fulfill that responsibility with respect to global warming.\n  For some people, this is a political exercise. They will offer \namendments to try to embarrass one side or the other, maybe embarrass \nthe authors of the legislation, to basically ensure we don't get \nanything done, to tie us in knots and walk off and leave this \nlegislation behind at the end of this week or sometime next week. That \nwould be unfortunate. The American people know we have a problem. The \nproblem is, the planet is getting warmer. If we don't do something \nabout it eventually, we will not be able to turn it around. It is \nimportant for us to get serious. The American people want us to figure \nout how to work together. Our next President, whoever she or he might \nbe, is going to provide us with much stronger, more positive leadership \non this front. It is incumbent on all of us--Republicans, Democrats, \nand one Independent--to figure out how we can work with that next \nPresident and with ourselves, with folks in the business community, the \nenvironmental community, to come up with a plan of action to reduce and \neventually eliminate the threat that global warming poses to our planet \nbut to do so in a way that seizes on what Tom Edison said: Some people \ndo actually miss out on opportunity because it comes along wearing \noveralls and looks a lot like work. This is one of those opportunities. \nWe should seize the day--as we say in our State, carpe diem--not \nsquander the opportunity but make the most of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, good morning. Let's be clear as we begin \nthis discussion. I, along with a vast majority of my colleagues, \nsupport cutting carbon emissions. We want to cut down on any kind of \nair pollution we have. We have done a great job over the years in \nimproving our air, and we need to do more. But we must cut carbon \nwithout raising prices on gasoline, diesel, electricity, all the things \nthat drive our economy. When American families are suffering record \npain at the pump, a home mortgage crisis, and a soft economy, this is \nnot the time to put the Government in a position of raising energy \nprices far higher than anything we have ever seen.\n  How much would Lieberman-Warner raise energy prices? We can quote \nfrom the sponsors of the legislation themselves. This is what the \njunior Senator from California has said Lieberman-Warner would raise: \n$6.735 trillion. It takes two charts to put up all the zeroes that this \nwould increase energy prices and, thus, tax American consumers. As we \ncan see, too big to fit on any one board.\n  The bill's sponsors claim they are trying to hit energy companies \nwith the cost of this program. Does anybody doubt what will happen when \nwe increase taxes on producers? That has to be passed on. It will be \npassed on to families, workers, farmers, truckers in\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\nthe form of higher energy bills and more pain at the pump. The bill's \nsponsors point to the customer relief they intend in the form of $800 \nbillion over 40 years for tax relief and $900 billion to utilities to \nhelp consumers. That would still mean only $1.7 trillion was returned \nto an American public paying $6.7 trillion in higher energy costs. That \nis a $5 trillion loss. That complicated Soviet-style scheme would be \nbased on the wisdom of some small group of bureaucratic czars who would \ndecide who gets the money. It seems they are writing Congress out of \nthe responsibility of handling the Treasury. They want to go around and \nturn a small group of wise men into the ones who decide who gets the \nallowances, who gets the relief, and where any relief will go.\n  The problem with the $6.7 trillion in higher energy prices is gas \nprices are already at record levels. Gas prices topped $4 in many parts \nof the country and are approaching that in the rest. Drivers are \nsuffering at the pump. I was back in Missouri and traveled all over the \nState, from one corner to the other, over the Memorial Day recess. I \nheard firsthand from commuters, farmers, average citizens, businesses \nlooking at absolute catastrophe from these higher energy prices. They \nare all fed up with higher gas prices. Regrettably, higher gas prices, \nhigher diesel prices are the result of Congress's action or inaction in \nblocking for 30 years the production of new energy in the United \nStates.\n  I visited truck stops in Joplin in southwestern Missouri and Palmyra \nin the northeast part of the State. I heard from truckers about the \nrecord diesel prices. Things are getting so bad that many are laying \noff drivers. Some are even going out of business. This is a real \nproblem for our country. When truckers suffer, we all suffer. If they \ngo out of business, we will not have trucks to deliver the goods. \nTransportation costs make up a significant part of the cost of almost \nevery consumer item. When diesel prices go up, prices go up, and \nfamilies will pay. In many areas, we may not have the trucking \ninfrastructure to deliver the goods we need.\n  How much will Lieberman-Warner increase our pain at the pump? The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency estimates Lieberman-Warner will \nincrease gas prices by 53 cents per gallon by 2030 and by $1.40 per \ngallon by 2050. Supporters of this bill tell us this is no big deal; it \nonly represents 2 cents a year. A good statistician can try and make \nany number look not quite so bad. I can't speak for folks in other \nStates, but I can tell you the folks back home have a minimum amount of \nhigh enthusiasm for Congress taking more action to raise prices.\n  Mr. President, $1.40 is $1.40. That increase in the price of gasoline \nis totally unacceptable, particularly when it comes with increases in \nprices in all other forms of energy. Yet that is the path the \nsupporters of this legislation want us to trod.\n  Some Senators say that since gasoline prices have risen 82 cents \nsince the beginning of the year, it is OK that Lieberman-Warner will \nonly raise prices another 53 cents to $1.40. Does anybody ever stop and \nthink that we are going in the wrong direction? We ought to be talking \nabout what we can do to increase supply, to bring prices down, not \nfiguring out how to come up with a cockamamie scheme that is going to \nincrease prices even more. I find the logic a little bit disturbing, if \nyou can call it that. The 82-cent rise in gas prices over the last year \nhas not been OK with the people in my State. A further 53-cent increase \nby 2030 in gas prices is not OK. A further $1.40-increase in gas prices \nis not OK with the people in Missouri. I can tell you that if we don't \nchange the path we are on now, the increase in prices will be even \ngreater.\n\n  The bill's sponsors say the demand for oil will go down under \nLieberman-Warner. Such a claim seems fantastical, until you examine the \nsource of the study. It is a study by the International Resources \nGroup. That name seems normal enough. But then looking at a copy of the \nstudy, it shows it was guided by the close involvement of the Natural \nResources Defense Council. They are the ones who are behind it. The \nNRDC study used by the other side assumes we will get 50 or 60 percent \nof our energy by 2050 from renewable sources such as wind and solar. I \nam all for clean wind and solar power. But nobody in their right mind \nwill believe we will go to generating 50 percent of our power from wind \nand solar. That isn't going to happen. You talk to the experts. I have \nlistened to experts, experts who are very knowledgeable about biofuels \nand others. They say biofuels can help. Wind and solar can help at the \nmargin. But we are still going to depend upon fossil fuel for most of \nour energy costs, particularly our transportation costs.\n  On oil demand, the NRDC study makes more outlandish assumptions. They \npredict the fleet efficiency for cars and light trucks will go up to 52 \nmiles per gallon. Congress just finished raising CAFE standards to 35 \nmiles per gallon. Now the NRDC says: No problem, we will move it up to \n52 miles per gallon. That would mean we would have a fleet of golf \ncarts hauling our produce. I wonder how many golf carts it would take a \nfarmer to deliver the hay to cattle in the field, how many golf carts \nto pull a wagon full of corn, how many golf carts to take a large \nfamily to school. A fleet of golf carts is a wonderful thing.\n  The NRDC says we will get 52 miles per gallon by moving the vehicle \nfleet to hybrid and plug-in vehicles. That is another startling \nassumption, 100 percent hybrids and plug-ins. Don't get me wrong. I am \na big fan of the potential of hybrid cars using advanced vehicle \nbattery technology. These are things we ought to be working for.\n  Over the recess, as part of my six-city tour of Missouri I mentioned \nearlier, I visited the Ford assembly plant in Kansas City, where they \nmake the hybrid Escape SUV. Kansas City is a national leader in hybrids \nand battery technology. We have the Ford hybrid SUV plant. We have a GM \nplant assembling hybrid sedans and SUVs, and we are an international \nleader in all kinds of battery technology, starting from the original \nlead batteries to lithium-ion batteries to lithium-ion polymer \nbatteries.\n  All these things will help. But Ford is only making about 20,000 of \nthese cars a year. They don't have enough batteries to meet the needs. \nI wish to expand on the use of advanced vehicle batteries for hybrids \nand plug-ins. I believe we need to jump start it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If it comes out of the Republican time.\n  Mr. BOND. How much time remains on the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 17 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask my colleague how much time he needs.\n  Mr. VITTER. I need about 8 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. If we can get a domestic manufacturing supply base for \nhybrid batteries to get the volume up and the prices down, that would \nbe good. Right now we are all depending upon a Japanese battery \nmanufacturer. We need to have those batteries manufactured in the \nUnited States and not be dependent solely on an external source. That \nis a twofer. We could expend the use of clean cars, burning gasoline \nonly occasionally, expand the number of blue-collar manufacturing \njobs--good for the environment and good for workers. But I do not think \nwe can rely on the idea that we will achieve 100 percent hybrid and \nplug-in use during this bill. The NRDC study also assumes massive new \nproduction from carbon captured from powerplants and used for enhanced \noil recovery. I support this too. But to think we can cut oil imports \nby 58 percent because we are expanding domestic production from burned-\nout wells through enhanced oil recovery is beyond the possible.\n  So if we set studies aside by environmental groups supporting the \nbill and manufacturing groups such as NAM opposing the bill, that leads \nus to the mainstream Government agencies such as EPA. They say gasoline \nprices will rise 53 cents per gallon by 2030, $1.40 by 2050. If you add \na $1.40-per-gallon Lieberman carbon surcharge to the current price of \n$4-a-gallon gasoline, you get gas prices at $5.50 a gallon.\n  I can tell folks back home right now there is no way I can accept the \nLieberman-Warner offer of $5.50-a-gallon gasoline. When I tell my \nMissouri constituents we are on the floor debating a bill, when we have \n$4-a-gallon\n\n[[Page S5004]]\n\ngasoline, and the bill would significantly increase energy costs rather \nthan increasing supply that would reduce the price of oil, they cannot \nbelieve it.\n  We are on the wrong track. We need to cut carbon. We do not need to \nincrease energy prices on the American public.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I have been allotted 8 minutes, and I ask \nthe Chair to notify me when 6 minutes of that 8 have expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, like my colleague from Missouri, last week I traveled \nall around my home State. I had about nine townhall meetings and many \nother meetings of all kinds in every part of the State.\n  In these townhall meetings, gas prices--the price at the pump--was \nnot the first question that always came up. It was the first eight \nquestions that always came up. In fact, of all of the discussion I had \nin all of these townhall meetings put together, about two-thirds of \nthat entire discussion--that entire time--was about rising gasoline \nprices and energy prices. It is obviously affecting folks all across \nthe country, certainly including in my home State of Louisiana.\n  In early 2006, when this new Democratic Congress was sworn into \noffice and came into power, the average price at the pump was $2.33 a \ngallon. The new leadership vowed they would do something about those \nsky-high prices. Well, apparently they did because now the average \nprice at the pump is $3.98 a gallon--a staggering increase in a \nrelatively short amount of time.\n  So in this context, when Americans all over our country, certainly \nincluding Louisiana, are suffering from these sky-high prices that \ncontinue to rise--as they go into the summer driving season, many \nhoping to take family vacations, realizing they cannot this summer \nbecause of these costs--I think a very reasonable question to ask is, \nWhat is this Lieberman-Warner climate change bill going to do to an \nalready dire situation with regard to energy prices?\n  Unfortunately, I have concluded it is going to make that already dire \nsituation much worse. It is going to add on to gasoline prices, as my \ncolleague from Missouri has stated. It is going to add on to \nelectricity and other energy prices significantly.\n  On the job site, it is going to also encourage and exacerbate a very \nworrisome trend of exporting jobs to other countries. After all of \nthat, it will do little or nothing with regard to the fundamental \nclimate change challenge because it mandates nothing on the part of \nother industrialized powers such as China and India.\n  Several economic studies have specifically examined these questions. \nLet's start with the price at the pump.\n  The Energy Information Administration estimates that this bill will \ncause gasoline prices to increase--in addition to everything that is \ngoing on now--between 41 cents a gallon to $1.01 a gallon by 2030. Now, \nagain, we are facing dramatically rising prices at the pump now, and \nthere seems to be no end in sight, in large part because we in Congress \nhave not acted in a bold manner to increase supply and do other things \nto help ourselves at home. Yet this bill would move us even further in \nthe wrong direction: between 41 cents and $1.01 more per gallon by \n2030.\n  According to the EIA, the average American uses 500 gallons of \ngasoline every year. The average vehicle is driven more than 12,000 \nmiles per year. So even now, at $4 a gallon, a 12-gallon gas tank costs \nover $50 to fill, and we are going to increase that significantly? That \nis moving in the wrong direction.\n  What about electricity and other important sources of energy? \nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, this bill will \nincrease those prices--electricity prices--by 44 percent by 2030. \nAgain, our consumers are struggling under energy prices right now, \nincluding electricity.\n  Winters are a tough time for folks in the Northeast. In my part of \nthe world, summer is the time of peak electricity load, and that is a \nreal price burden right now. Yet we are considering a bill that is \ngoing to increase that, an already challenging and dire situation, by \n44 percent?\n  Then, what about the jobs picture. We debate in this body all the \ntime how we can keep and expand and grow manufacturing jobs in this \ncountry, how we can get away from the trend of exporting those jobs \noverseas. Yet this bill will only make that problem worse as well.\n  The higher energy prices caused by the bill will force U.S. \nmanufacturers to compete unfavorably with lower cost countries \noverseas. Realistically, companies will move their manufacturing base \nout of the United States to an even greater extent, and many American \njobs will leave with them.\n  This country has already lost 3 million manufacturing jobs since \n2000. We cannot afford to lose more. But what does the rigorous \nanalysis of this bill's impact show? Well, the National Association of \nManufacturers says up to 1.8 million jobs additionally--in addition to \nall of those figures I have already quoted--could be lost by 2020 and 4 \nmillion jobs additionally could be lost by 2030.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator has 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Switching from coal plants to natural gas will drive job loss, \nparticularly in the chemical and fertilizer industries. The chemical \nindustry is extremely important to my State. Over 100,000 chemical jobs \nhave already been lost in the last 5 years due to the high price of \nnatural gas. Out of 120 new chemical plants under worldwide \nconstruction, only one is being constructed in the United States.\n  So like the price of gasoline, like the price of electricity, on the \njobs front we have a very dire, challenging situation already, and this \nbill would make it far worse.\n  The real kicker to all of this is that after all of that damage to \nAmericans, to their lifestyles, to our economy, what would this bill do \nin terms of climate change?\n  I am very concerned it would do little or nothing because, of course, \nit mandates no action on the part of other major powers and energy \nconsumers around the world, specifically China and India. Think about \nit. As we push these jobs overseas, out of our country, where are those \njobs going? They are going to countries such as China and India that \nwould not be taking similar action, that would be continuing to build \ncoal-fired powerplants and use outdated technology, that would \ncontribute to the climate change problem. So much higher gasoline \nprices, much higher electricity and other energy prices, significant \njob loss--and what impact on the problem are we trying to address? In \nmy opinion, little or none.\n  Mr. President, I hope all of our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle hear from the American people, hear from them about the \nchallenges they face right now as they fill up their automobiles, as \nthey try to take summer vacations, as they struggle with other energy \nprices, as they hope to keep their jobs right here in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 8 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. If our colleagues hear that message, I am confident they \nwill vote down this dangerous bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Does the Senator \nfrom New Mexico have time under the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes remaining under morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on Monday, I came to the Senate floor \nand discussed the rising price of gasoline and the additional increases \nthat will result from the Boxer bill. These are not talking points. \nThey are facts from several economic studies done by the EIA, the EPA, \nand many other groups.\n  Later today I will speak on the accomplishments we have already had \nin working together to advance policies that will strengthen our energy \nsecurity and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. We have not been \nasleep. We\n\n[[Page S5005]]\n\nhave done quite a bit. I will also speak about the bill before us and \nthe many concerns I have about its effectiveness, or lack thereof.\n  Right now, I want to speak on the impact this bill will have on the \nAmerican economy. Like many Senators, I believe global climate change \nis a great challenge that our Nation should address. I joined Senator \nBingaman in expressing that sentiment in a bipartisan Senate resolution \n3 years ago. That does not mean anybody has produced a bill or \nlegislation that matched up, in my opinion, with the concerns. The way \nwe are doing it in this bill is one way. It has never worked any place \nit has been tried. I do not know why it should be expected to work in \nAmerica.\n  I have great respect for the Senators who have drafted cap-and-trade \nlegislation, but I remain deeply concerned about the steep costs and \ndire consequences this bill will have on our Nation's economy. I am \ntroubled it will have very little, if any, environmental benefit.\n  To those who are continuing to say this is an absolute environmental \nnecessity, I hope they will try to gather from the experts who have \nlooked at it just how much environmental benefit we will get from this \nbill.\n  The EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, has concluded this bill \nwould reduce global greenhouse gas by just over 1 percent by 2050. \nAccording to the IPCC's own benchmark, such a reduction would reduce \naverage temperatures by one-tenth of 1 degree Celsius in 2050. These \nrates of reduction are far below the levels needed to mitigate the most \nserious effects of global climate change.\n  Now, again, Mr. President, fellow Senators, I am not here just giving \na speech. I am trying to give you facts. If facts are the things that \ncome from studies by experts, we have facts on this bill. I repeat, the \nrates of reduction are far below the levels needed to mitigate the most \nserious effects of global climate change.\n  I am troubled by the various studies on this bill. Everyone has \nconcluded it will increase energy prices and decrease economic growth. \nEspecially in a time of record energy prices and economic slowdown, our \nNation simply cannot afford this bill. That is not just speculation or \nclamor. It is a true probability that we cannot afford it.\n  While these studies confirm that the bill will have a negative impact \non our economy, they also reveal significant uncertainty as to what \nthat impact will be. According to CRA International, the only group \nthat included the low carbon fuel standard in its study, motor fuel \nprices could increase by more than 140 percent by 2015. The EIA \nprojects that the bill could reduce industrial activity by up to 7.4 \npercent by 2030. The Heritage Foundation estimates that 600,000 jobs \ncould be lost by 2026.\n  Another cause for concern on the economic side is the estimate of the \nimpact on gross domestic product. While all studies project a negative \nimpact on GDP, estimates vary from a low of $444 billion, I say to my \nfriend, the occupant of the chair, to a high of $4.8 trillion. That \nrange of $4.5 trillion is as massive as it is inconclusive. It is \nequivalent to $15,000 for every American. A careful review of these \nstudies should shake everyone inside of this Chamber.\n\n  We must realize that cap and trade is neither our best option nor the \nonly option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, the \nCongressional Budget Office Director recently testified that a rigid \ncap-and-trade program is up to five times less efficient than a carbon \ntax.\n  The experience of the European Union, which instituted an emissions \ntrading scheme in 2005, should be highly instructive in this debate.\n  The EU's emissions have continued to rise under cap and trade, by \nabout 1 percent per year. While the EU's system has failed to reduce \nemissions, it is having an adverse economic impact with energy prices \nrising and other carbon intensive businesses fleeing to the developing \nworld.\n  Europe's difficulties are not the only example of the shortcomings of \ncap and trade. Last December, it caught my attention when, during an \ninterview on the Charlie Rose Show, former President Clinton lamented \nthe fate of the Kyoto Protocol, saying: 170 countries signed that \ntreaty and only 6--6 of 170--reduced their greenhouse gases to the 1990 \nlevel, and only 6 will do so by 2012 at the deadline.\n  Our best projections, combined with the precedent of failing cap and \ntrade regimes already in place, show that America should take a \ndifferent path. We have been told that this bill is a market-based \napproach, but then we read a section that says, ``an emission allowance \nshall not be a property right'' and, ``nothing in this Act or any other \nprovision of law shall limit the authority of the Administrator to \nterminate or limit an emission allowance.''\n  Let me explain. These are allowances that are being paid for, in most \ncases, and the CBO treats them as revenues and outlays. And, the \nproponents of the bill expect these allowances to be traded like stock \nand other securities. However, the bill fails to even provide a \nproperty right for allowances and permits the EPA Administrator to take \nallowances or limit them at any time, and in any way. This is the very \nopposite of a market-based approach, and I will have an amendment in \nthe coming days to remedy this problem.\n  Furthermore, this bill allows nonemitters to hold possession and \ntrade these allowances. Presumably they will enter into contracts, \nderivatives, swaps, and other complicated arrangements that may \nundermine the oversight, transparency, and integrity of the market. \nThis is precisely one of the factors that led us to today's mortgage \ncrisis, and maybe this bill creates that blueprint for carbon.\n  My concerns with this bill are no different today than those that \nwere shared by the full Senate in 1997, when we passed a resolution \nexpressing our opposition to the Kyoto Protocol if brought to the \nSenate for ratification. Our economy expanded by 5 percent in the \nquarter before that vote. In the midst of robust growth, the Senate \noverwhelmingly rejected the idea of a treaty that did not include \ndeveloping nations or ``could result in serious harm to the United \nStates economy.''\n  With many factors now limiting our economy, and with China's \nemissions today much greater than in 1997, our resolve should be \nstronger. High energy prices, a housing crisis, and a credit crunch \nlimited our growth to 0.9 percent last quarter. Clearly, we have plenty \nof challenges to overcome. Our dependence on foreign energy is great, \nour trade deficit is high, our national debt continues to rise, and our \ndollar is weak.\n  As we debate this Boxer bill, we should ask ourselves two questions: \nWhat will it achieve, and at what cost? I believe the answer to the \nfirst question is very little--even by 2050, this bill will not provide \nmeaningful global environmental benefit. The answer to the second \nquestion, however, is too much--this bill will disrupt our economy, add \nto consumers' pain at the pump, and weaken our Nation's ability to \ncompete in the global marketplace.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5005-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be a \nperiod of 15 minutes of debate equally divided with respect to the \nconference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 70.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as we begin the debate, first I thank my \ncolleague, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator Gregg, \nfor his continuing graciousness and his professionalism as we have \nsought to find a way to conclude our work on the budget for this year. \nI also thank his staff. We appreciate very much the relationship we \nhave and the very constructive dialog between us as we have searched to \nfind a way to bring this debate to a close.\n  With that, I wish to describe the conference agreement in general \nterms. This agreement, we believe, will strengthen the economy and \ncreate jobs. It will do that by investing in energy, in education, in \ninfrastructure. It\n\n[[Page S5006]]\n\nwill expand health coverage for our kids. It will provide tax cuts for \nthe middle class. It will restore fiscal responsibility by balancing \nthe books by 2012 and maintaining balance in 2013. It also seeks to \nmake America safer by supporting our troops, by providing for our \nveterans' health care, and by protecting the homeland and rejecting the \nPresident's proposals for deep cuts in law enforcement, the COPS \nprogram, and for our first responders.\n  The tax relief in this budget is significant. This conference \nagreement extends the middle-class tax relief, provides for marriage \npenalty relief, the extension of the child tax credit, the 10-percent \nbracket. It also provides for alternative minimum tax relief so more \nthan 20 million people in this country don't get caught up with \nadditional tax obligations. It provides estate tax reform, it allows \nenergy and education tax cuts as incentives to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil, and it provides assistance for families who are struggling \nto pay college costs. It also provides for significant property tax \nrelief and, of course, for the important extenders package.\n  The record under this administration has been a record of debt and \ndeficits as far as the eye can see. This chart shows very clearly what \nhas happened to the debt under this administration. This President, at \nthe end of his first year, had a debt of $5.8 trillion. We don't hold \nhim responsible for the first year because he inherited that budget. \nBut over the 8 years he is responsible for, the debt has gone from $5.8 \ntrillion to $10.4 trillion--almost a doubling of the debt in this \ncountry. This President's fiscal failures are manifest. They are \nwritten across the pages of the economic history of this country.\n  This budget seeks to take the country in a different direction. Under \nthis budget, we reduce the debt as a share of the gross domestic \nproduct each and every year, from 69.3 percent of GDP to 65.6 percent \nby the end of the fifth year. The same is true of the deficit picture \nunder this budget. I am proud to report that we balance the books by \nthe fourth year of the budget. We maintain balance in the fifth year. \nWhile the President's budget balances in the fourth year, it swings \nright out of balance once again in the fifth year. We don't believe \nthat is a responsible course.\n  Under this conference report, spending goes down as a share of gross \ndomestic product, from 20.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2009 \nto 19.1 percent of GDP in 2012 and 2013.\n  We will hear a lot from the other side about spending in this budget \nand we will hear claims that this takes spending through the roof. \nLet's compare the spending in this conference report with what the \nPresident proposed. In this conference report, total spending is $3.07 \ntrillion in 2009. The President has $3.04 trillion. That is a \ndifference of 1 percent. Again, the conference report shows spending of \n$3.07 trillion, the President proposed $3.04 trillion, a difference of \n1 percent. Where did the difference go? Well, it went in those areas I \nhave discussed: energy, education, and infrastructure, all of them \ncritical needs.\n  On the revenue side, the President proposed $15.2 trillion of revenue \nover the 5 years of this budget. We have $15.6 trillion of revenue--a \nmodest difference, a 2.9 percent difference in revenue. We believe that \ncan be accommodated without any tax increase. There is no assumption of \na tax increase in this budget. In fact, as I have identified, there are \nsubstantial middle-class tax cuts in this budget. In addition, we \nbelieve this modest increase in revenue over what the President has \nproposed can be provided by aggressively going after the tax gap--the \ndifference between what is owed and what is paid--by going after the \noffshore tax havens, as well as closing down abusive tax shelters. We \nbelieve that difference can be easily accommodated in those ways.\n  Now, I predict that my colleague, for whom I have great respect and \nreal affection, will stand up here momentarily and he will tell all of \nus this is the biggest tax increase in the history of the United \nStates. He may even say that is the biggest tax increase----\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Momentarily.\n  Mr. GREGG. I was going to say: in the world.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have agreement on that. My friend is going to stand up \nhere and say: ``The biggest tax increase in the history of the world.''\n  I wish to recall his words from last year. Last year he said about \nour budget: It includes, at a minimum, a $736 billion tax hike on \nAmerican families and businesses over the next 5 years--the biggest in \nU.S. history.\n  Here is what happened. There was no tax increase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me conclude on this thought. Here is the record. We \nhad tax cuts of $194 billion. That is the record. That is what \nhappened. No tax increase; tax reductions. If anybody wonders, go to \nyour mailbox and look at the checks you have received from the United \nStates Government. That was passed by a Democratic Congress.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my brief \nstatement not take away from the 15 minutes that has been allotted to \nthe two managers of this budget conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to have the record spread with how we \nwork together here, not as much as we should, but we do it often.\n  As everyone knows, Senator Kennedy is ill. He has had brain surgery. \nHe is now in a hospital in North Carolina. Senator Byrd has taken ill. \nHe is in a hospital in Virginia. My Republican colleagues stepped \nforward. Senator Warner said: I will pair with Senator Kennedy. That is \nsomething we used to do a lot. We don't do it as much as we used to. \nBut I will pair, said Senator Warner, with Senator Kennedy. That way he \nis recorded as if Senator Kennedy were here, he would vote opposite of \nSenator Warner and therefore it cancels out the votes.\n  I called Pete Domenici at home last night and said: Pete, as you \nknow, Senator Byrd is sick. Would you pair with him? He didn't hesitate \na half a second. He said: Of course I will.\n  Now, I want everyone to understand how much I personally, as do we \nall, appreciate these men stepping forward and doing this in a time of \nneed. It would be easy for them to say wait until we get everybody here \nand we will have a vote.\n  But in addition to that, Judd Gregg last night said: I would be happy \nto pair with someone if that is necessary. This is above and beyond the \ncall of duty. Senator Conrad has spoken many times about his affection \nfor Judd Gregg. They have worked so closely together for so long. I \nalso feel he is one of America's very good Senators. Very few people \nare as well prepared as he is to come to the Senate. He has been a \nMember of the House of Representatives, he has been Governor of his \nState, and now a Senator. He and I don't agree with a lot of the votes \nwe do here, but as far as him being a good legislator, he is truly a \ngood legislator.\n  So Senator Gregg, Senator Domenici, and Senator Warner I would \nacknowledge are very outstanding not only Senators but human beings.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on a point of personal privilege, I thank \nthe leader for coming and making the statement he has. People see this \nbody and sometimes they see it at its worst. This, in many ways, is the \nSenate at its best: Senator Domenici agreeing to withhold his vote to \npair with Senator Byrd who could not be here because of illness; \nSenator Warner, whom I asked yesterday to pair and who readily agreed \nhe will pair with Senator Kennedy who could not be here. This is to me \nan act of graciousness, it is thoughtful, it is respectful, and it is \nexactly what one would expect of Senator Domenici and of Senator \nWarner.\n  I wish to say a special note about Senator Gregg who told me \nyesterday if we couldn't find someone else to pair with Senator Kennedy \nor Senator Byrd, he would be willing to do that. When I told my staff, \nI told them that is class. I wish to say publicly what I said to my \nstaff privately, that Senator Gregg has demonstrated the highest \nexample of what the Senate should be about and I thank him for it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my statement \nand that of Senator Conrad's not take away from the time of Senator \nGregg because he needs all the time he can get to show that this is the \nbiggest tax increase in the history of the world.\n\n[[Page S5007]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me thank the majority leader and the \nchairman for their kind words. They would have done the same thing were \nthey in my position, if somebody on our side were ill. I know they \nwould have, because I know the type of people they are, and I thank \nthem for their generous comments relative to my willingness to help on \nthat issue.\n  I especially want to acknowledge, as they have, Senator Warner and \nSenator Domenici. This is Senator Domenici's last vote on the budget, \nand Senator Domenici and the budget are inextricably identified \ntogether. He basically wrote the Budget Act along with Senator Byrd, \nwho regrettably can't be here and whom he is pairing with, and for 30-\nplus hours now, he has been overseeing the budget as the godfather of \nit. For him to pair on this matter on this last vote on the budget is a \nvery gracious act, as Senator Conrad has pointed out.\n  I also thank Senator Conrad and his staff for their courtesy and \ntheir professionalism. It is always afforded to us as Republicans by \nthe majority staff and we very much appreciate it. We obviously \ndisagree fundamentally on where this budget is going, but that doesn't \nmean we can't proceed in an orderly manner. As I have said before, \nalthough I strongly disagree with this budget, I feel equally strongly \nthat this Nation needs a budget, even though in this instance it is \nsomething I will point to as a mistake. But we could have done a lot \nbetter.\n\n  As a practical matter, I respect the efforts put in by the majority \nand the majority staff, and especially the chairman of the committee \nwho worked tirelessly on this and defends it very effectively. He has \nsaid I will say this is the largest tax increase in the history of the \nworld. Let me confirm that, and let there be no mistake about it--there \nis the largest tax increase in the history of the world in this budget. \nWe are talking trillions here, which is hard to understand for anyone. \nIt is a concept that is alien to all of us. But this budget talks in \nthe trillions.\n  This will be the first budget that pushes debt over $10 trillion. \nThat is a lot of money. Two trillion dollars will be added to the debt \nas a result of this budget. This will be the first budget that takes \nnon-emergency discretionary spending over $1 trillion. I suggested we \ndraw the line and say, at least for 1 year, we will hold back and not \ngo over $1 trillion. That idea was rejected.\n  This budget has buried in it a $1.2 trillion tax increase. Yes, it \nwould not occur this year, but it is assumed in the budget. That is how \nthey get to balance in the budget. It is assumed in the outyears. That \ntax increase will translate, when it kicks in, in 2011, into real \nincreases in taxes for Americans. Although most of us cannot understand \n$1 trillion, we can understand the fact that for families earning \n$50,000, with two children, their taxes, under this proposal, over the \nnext 5 years will go up $2,300. For retired people--and there are 18 \nmillion of them--their taxes will go up over $2,000. For 47 million \nsmall businesses in America today--the engines of the economy, of \neconomic growth, the people who create the jobs in this economy--their \ntaxes will go up $4,000. That is a lot of money. That is money they \nshould be able to keep, and it should not come to the Federal \nGovernment. That tax increase should not go into place.\n  This bill has taxes in it that presume that the capital gains tax \nwill essentially double for many Americans. The dividends tax will \ndefinitely double. Rates will jump dramatically. The 10-percent rate \nwill be repealed. The estate tax will jump dramatically.\n  This bill essentially assumes a major tax increase on working \nAmericans and on small business. In my opinion, that is a huge mistake. \nThe other huge mistake that this budget has in it is it makes no effort \nat all to control the accounts that are going to essentially bankrupt \nour Nation for our children, which are the entitlement accounts. We \nknow we are sending this Nation over a fiscal cliff. We know that if we \ndon't act, our children and grandchildren will not be able to afford \nthis Government because of the cost and burdens of Medicare, Medicaid, \nand Social Security.\n  We know the baby boom generation is alive and is going to be moving \ninto retirement. Yet this bill takes no action--no action at all--to \ntry to remedy this very serious fiscal problem, which is going to occur \non the watch of this bill. This is a 5-year budget. So this is a very \nserious failure of taking responsibility on a key issue of fiscal \npolicy.\n  In addition, of course, we have strong differences over the amount of \nspending in the bill. It crosses the trillion-dollar line. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota named some of the important things to spend money on. \nYes, they are important, but we need to set priorities. Rather than \nsimply increasing spending, we ought to look at programs now on the \nbooks, which are not as high a priority as we need, and move the money \nfrom those programs into the programs we want to spend more money on. \nThis budget assumes that of all the Federal programs on the books--$1 \ntrillion of discretionary spending--none will be eliminated, not one.\n  Let me tell you, there are programs we can eliminate, and we should \nhave made that tough decision. So we have strong opinions that this \nbudget doesn't go where it should go. It fails in the issues of tax \npolicy, entitlement policy, and spending policy. Obviously, the other \nside of the aisle is the majority--and, remember, they were in the \nmajority last year too--so they have the right to pass their budget. I \npoint out that last year they claimed they were going to give us a tax \ncut, and they didn't do it. They took credit for the amendment that \nsaid they were going to give a tax cut, but it was never passed. This \nyear, they are taking credit for the same amendment, and I suspect it \nwould not pass again.\n  What will pass is the tax increase of $1.2 trillion in this bill on \nworking Americans. That will come to fruition because the majority \nassumes this budget event. This budget doesn't work without those new \nrevenues. It is a failure, in our opinion, and that is why we oppose \nit.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I again thank all our colleagues. This is \na significant vote because this is the first time in an election year \nsince 2000 that we have been able to pass a budget. That sets a good \nexample for the future.\n  I, again, especially thank Senator Domenici. This is his last vote on \na budget. He, out of respect for this institution, respect for Senator \nByrd, respect for the budget process, agreed to pair with Senator Byrd. \nWe thank Senator Domenici for that gracious act.\n  And Senator Warner, I deeply appreciate your willingness to pair with \nSenator Kennedy, who, as we all know, is ill and recovering. You are a \npro's pro, and we deeply appreciate the respect that you have shown for \nour colleague, Senator Kennedy.\n  Again, I thank all of the staff who have worked so hard. I again want \nto conclude by thanking the ranking member, Senator Gregg, for all he \ndid to allow us to complete work today.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we are all familiar with the phrase ``all \nyou can eat.'' There are restaurants everywhere that specialize in \nfeeding us until we burst. Needless to say, that isn't a good idea. \nEating until you just can't eat any more isn't just a waste of \nresources, it is likely to have a severe impact on your future health--\nand your current waistline!\n  We are in a similar fix here in the Congress. Our country is in a \nsinkhole of debt and it's almost as if we have adopted a philosophy of \n``all you can spend'' around here. Spending is out of control and we \nare doing more than just wasting resources--we are destroying the \nfuture of our children and our grandchildren. Our friends on the other \nside of the aisle don't seem to see what a terrible problem we face. \nJust like that all you can eat line, our colleagues are heading back to \nthe buffet for one more full plate and leaving the bill for our \nchildren to pay. As the old adage says so well, you can pay me now, or \npay me later--and our colleagues have chosen to leave the bills for \nlater. We ought to know better.\n  This week the Senate is considering the conference report for the \nfiscal year 2009 budget resolution, a blueprint that is supposed to \nprovide us with guidance for spending that reflects the priorities of \nthe Congress. As stewards of the public trust, the Congress needs to \nmake responsible choices that leave a fiscally sound country to our \nchildren and our grandchildren. Unfortunately, the budget resolution \nconference agreement we are debating this week doesn't confront any of \nthe tough choices that face our country.\n  I will say once again that we cannot sustain the current level of \nspending without inflicting grave damage on the fiscal health of our \ncountry. This conference agreement rejects the President's proposals \nthat slow the growth of spending in mandatory programs, as well as keep \na handle on discretionary spending.\n  It does nothing to shore up the government's fiscal house, and \ninstead leaves the tough choices to future Congresses and the next \nadministration. Yet every day, Americans sit at their kitchen tables \nand tighten their own budgets to pay for gas, food and other necessary \nexpenses--while we can't even impose meaningful discipline on spending \nhere in Washington.\n  As stewards of the public trust, we owe it to all American taxpayers \nto use the funds they provide us in the most efficient way possible. If \nwe do that, then we provide future generations with a strong economy.\n  As an accountant, I particularly welcome the opportunity to look at \nthe overall spending priorities of our Nation. Fiscal year 2009 ought \nto be another tight year for spending. This year the Federal deficit is \nprojected to be close to $350 billion--under the Conference Agreement--\nwhich will pale in the face of major demands on resources as the so-\ncalled baby boom generation begins to reach eligibility for Social \nSecurity and Medicare. We must realistically deal with issues like \nincreasing health care costs, tax policy, burgeoning energy costs, as \nwell as continuing national security obligations. Americans deserve \nmore than another ``pass the buck'' budget.\n  Mr. President, here is the truth about what the Democratic budget \nresolution would do. It will: raise taxes by $1.2 trillion meaning that \n43 million families with children will pay $2,300 more each year, and \n18 million seniors will pay $2,200 more; increase spending by $210 \nbillion over 5 years. For fiscal year 2009, exceed the President's \nrequested budget by $24 billion; would allow the gross debt to climb by \n$2 trillion by 2013; last year's budget grew our national debt by $2.5 \ntrillion. It ignores entitlement reform--there is no attempt to tackle \nthe $66 trillion in unsustainable long-term entitlement obligations \nthat face our country. The President's budget proposed to reduce the \nrate of growth in one of our most expensive entitlements, Medicare. \nThis would not cut Medicare at all--it would simply reduce the rate of \ngrowth. This conference report rejects even slowing the growth in \nentitlements. For these reasons alone, the conference report ought to \nbe rejected.\n  Congress ought to be considering a budget that reduces the national \ndebt, promotes honest budgeting, and encourages true economic growth by \nreducing energy costs, reducing taxes, and reducing health care costs \nand increasing access for all Americans.\n  Last year, the majority also promised to abide by pay-go rules and \nactually pay for all new spending. Well, as far as I can see this has \nnot happened, and in fact, pay-go enforcement rules have been weakened \nthrough a variety of different mechanisms and smoke and mirrors that \ntaxpayers have ended up with billions in new spending.\n  Congress must take seriously the warnings from the General Accounting \nOffice and the Congressional Budget Office about Federal expenditures \nspiraling out of control. We need to make procedural and process \nchanges to directly address these problems. One of the many procedural \nreforms that I believe would promote fiscal responsibility is a 2-year \nbudget process, known as biennial budgeting.\n  In fact, in his budget for fiscal year 2009, the President once again \nproposed commonsense budget reforms to restrain spending. He has \nseveral recommendations, including earmark reforms and the adoption of \na 2-year budget for all executive branch agencies in order to give \nCongress more time for program reviews. Implementing these overall \nrecommendations would be a step in the right direction.\n  The budget process takes up a considerable amount of time each year \nand is drenched in partisan politics, while other important issues end \nup on the back burner. The Federal budgeting and appropriations system \nis broken, and lends itself to spending indulgences taxpayers cannot \nafford. We only have to look to the mammoth spending bills that nobody \nhas time to fully read or understand before they are passed into law. \nLast year's omnibus appropriations bill is an example of a system that \npromotes fiscal recklessness.\n  This conference report is a missed opportunity. There is a crucial \nneed to enact procedural and process changes that will enable us to get \nthis country on the right budgetary track again. We simply cannot risk \nthe economic stability of future generations by continuing to ``get \nby'' with the status quo. The risks are far too great.\n  The conference report we are debating today is a hollow, tax and \nspend, big government budget. It makes no tough choices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5008-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5008-S5011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FISCAL YEAR 2009\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman Conrad \nand the other members of the Budget Committee for their kind words and\n\n[[Page S5009]]\n\nwell wishes that have been directed toward me during our work on this \nthe final budget resolution during my tenure in the Senate.\n  As most of you know, I have worked on many budgets and numerous other \ninitiatives during my 36 year career. However, important work still \nremains for the Budget Committee. If I had more time I would without a \ndoubt seek to address entitlement spending. I had pledged to work with \nChairman Conrad on his bipartisan bill and I am disappointed that we \nmay not have time to take it up this year.\n  This budget, like many before it, fails to address the 800 pound \ngorilla in the room, otherwise known as entitlement spending. After \n2010, spending related to the aging of the baby-boom generation will \nbegin to raise the growth rate of total outlays. The annual growth rate \nof Social Security spending is expected to increase from about 4.5 \npercent this year to 6.5 percent by 2017. In addition, because the cost \nof health care is likely to continue rising rapidly, spending for \nMedicare and Medicaid is projected to grow even faster--in the range of \n7 or 8 percent annually. Total outlays for Medicare and Medicaid are \nprojected to more than double by 2017, increasing by 124 percent, while \nnominal GDP is projected to grow only 63 percent. The budget currently \nunder consideration does not offer solutions, much less even address, \nentitlement spending or reform. I do not support this budget in its \ncurrent form because it does not offer any meaningful solution for \nentitlement spending.\n  I offer this piece of advice to my colleagues serving on the Budget \nCommittee: tackle entitlement spending. The Budget Committee should \npropel itself to the forefront of this debate and use the tools that \nonly this committee has at its disposal to address the number one issue \non the minds of the American public. With true leadership, this \ncommittee has the potential to turn mere Senators into heroes if they \nchoose to address the entitlement programs. I urge Senators to come \ntogether and find a solution in the near future before it is too late \nto resolve this crisis.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased an agreement has been reached \non a budget resolution conference report. It is the duty of Congress to \napprove the Nation's fiscal blueprint, and this year's budget report \npresents a responsible plan that rightfully prioritizes job creation \nand programs to support the safety, health, and education of America's \nchildren.\n  Our economy has long been suffering and is in need of a boost. This \nbudget will help start to undo the damage caused by the \nadministration's misguided fiscal policies and stave off additional \ncuts proposed by the administration that would affect important \nprograms that are especially needed in this time of economic distress.\n  This budget rejects the President's failed policy of paying for tax \ncuts by adding to the debt burden of our children and grandchildren. \nThe fiscal year 2009 budget that President Bush sent to Congress in \nFebruary would have us pursue the same failed priorities and policies \nthat have proven so woefully wrong for Michigan and for our Nation. The \nPresident's proposal would dig us even deeper into the massive deficit \nditch we are already facing. The President's proposal would provide \neven more tax cuts to the wealthiest among us, while at the same time \nit would cut funding for critical programs important to my State's \neconomy and the well-being of the State of Michigan. This includes cuts \nto, among other things, health care funding, including Medicare and \nMedicaid; decreased funding for important investments in education; and \nthe elimination of the Technology Innovation Program, formerly called \nthe Advanced Technology Program, and the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership, which helps small and mid-sized manufacturers compete in a \nglobal economy.\n  We need to break from those failed policies by forgoing irresponsible \ntax cuts for the wealthiest among us and making important investments \nin America's future; we must work to put our country back on track and \nbegin the long process of climbing out of this deficit ditch.\n  That is why I am glad this resolution provides for a balanced budget \nby 2012. It also furthers our strong pay-go rules, which require that \nall mandatory spending and revenue provisions be deficit-neutral. It \nsets the course to fully offset a repair of the alternative minimum \ntax, which would otherwise cause nearly 20 million middle class \ntaxpayers to be subject to a tax they were never intended to be \nsubjected to. It also assumes middle income tax relief, including \nmarriage penalty relief, the child tax credit, and the persistence of \nthe 10 percent bracket.\n  I am pleased that this resolution includes my proposal to establish a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund to promote American manufacturing. \nCongress needs to act to revitalize our domestic manufacturing sector. \nThe administration has stood by passively while 3 million manufacturing \njobs were lost to America.\n  This resolution also seeks to close the tax loopholes costing the \nTreasury large amounts of revenue and which have shifted an unfair \nburden to middle income taxpayers. Shutting down abusive tax shelters \nand offshore tax havens are two of the major tax gap initiatives \nassumed in the budget resolution. Additionally, this budget would \nreject many of the cuts in funding proposed by the President for \nessential health care and education programs. I believe this budget \nresolution, while only a blueprint for future action, sets us on a \ncourse of fiscal responsibility and paves the way for important \ninvestments in America's future.\n  I am also pleased that this conference report retains an amendment I \nco-authored which, taken together with the underlying clean energy \nreserve fund, will support extension of the current production tax \ncredits for renewable electricity and biodiesel fuel, the small-\nproducer biodiesel tax credit, and clean renewable energy bond \nauthority. It also proposes new tax credits for cellulosic ethanol and \nplug-in hybrid vehicles. I will continue to work to enact these \nnecessary incentives.\n  Major bipartisan efforts will be needed to make true progress on the \nlong-term fiscal problems we face. But this resolution represents a \ngood start by proposing an end to the financing of unaffordable tax \ncuts for the wealthiest among us, as well as funding prudent \ninvestments to promote the health and well-being of our children.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the fiscal \nyear 2009 budget resolution conference report. As a member of the \ncommittee, I want to recognize Chairman Conrad and thank him personally \nfor his untiring efforts to craft a blueprint that will get our \nNation's fiscal house back in order.\n  Perhaps more than at any time in our history, it is imperative that \nCongress focus seriously on our Nation's budget situation. The \ncompeting demands of an aging population, our current international \ncommitments, growing competition in the global economy, our widening \ntrade deficit, and shrinking revenues all require that we address our \nfiscal situation with urgency. Revenues are at a historic low point, \nwhile the demographics of the country are driving spending higher on \nneeds that the private sector is ill-equipped to address. Now there is \nwidespread consensus among working families that--regardless of the \nofficial definition--we are in a recession.\n  Employment growth during this administration has averaged fewer than \n50,000 jobs a month--the lowest monthly rate for any administration \nsince Dwight D. Eisenhower's and less than one-quarter the average of \n237,000 jobs per month created during the Clinton administration.\n  Inflation-adjusted hourly wages have decreased by 1.3 percent since \nAugust 2003. Even median annual household income has decreased by \n$1,700, or 3.6 percent, after accounting for inflation. These are \naggregate statistics, but behind each of them are millions of families \nwho are falling behind as a result of inadequate investment in the \nright priorities.\n  For too long, we have been moving in the wrong direction. Over the \npast 7 years, the Bush administration has sent us budgets with the \nwrong priorities. They have contained drastic cuts to education and \nhealth care programs. They did not provide for investment in our \nnation's public transit systems, bridges, and roads. They did not \naddress energy efficiency. They ignored veterans' health care needs and \nactually attempted to make it more difficult for veterans to access the \nhealth\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\nsystem we promised our troops. And they neglected the programs that \nhelp working families thrive, including child care, housing, community \ndevelopment, and job training. Recent Congresses supported those \nbudgets, and exacerbated the fiscal crisis by enacting irresponsible \ntax cuts that America could not afford--tax cuts that overwhelmingly \nbenefitted the wealthiest Americans, while providing very little help \nfor working families. Last year, under new leadership in Congress, we \npassed a budget that began to change course. This budget continues that \neffort, and I am pleased to support it.\n  This conference agreement targets tax relief where it is most \nneeded--at working families. This includes an extension of the child \ncare tax credit, marriage penalty relief, and the 10 percent individual \nincome tax bracket.\n  Equally important, this budget resolution is fiscally responsible. It \nwill return us to a balanced budget, with a surplus of $22 billion in \n2012 and $10 billion in 2013.\n  Even as crucial domestic programs have suffered under this \nadministration, the Nation's debt has increased from $5.8 trillion at \nthe end of President Bush's first year in office to in excess of $9 \ntrillion.\n  If we fail to change course, we will leave our children and \ngrandchildren an insurmountable legacy of debt. The fiscal policies of \nthis current administration have erased the $5.6 trillion surplus that \nwas projected in 2000 and replaced it with a projected deficit of \nnearly $4 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  The borrowing necessitated by deficit spending has jeopardized our \neconomic position in the world, and it has clouded the outlook for \ngenerations of Americans to come. We have had to turn to foreign \ngovernments to borrow money. Our foreign-held debt has increased by \nmore than 100 percent during this administration. In fact, in just one \nyear, the total has increased from $2.1 trillion to $2.5 trillion. \nAccording to the Treasury Department, as of March 2008, the United \nStates now owes more than $600 billion to Japan, nearly $500 billion to \nChina, more than $200 billion to the United Kingdom We owe $150 billion \nto oil exporting nations, up from $112 billion last year. These levels \nof foreign-held debt threaten our independence as a nation, and they \nare unsustainable.\n  That is why it is so important that we make the difficult budget \nchoices that can return us to a balanced budget, and that this \nresolution contain tools needed to get there, including pay-go.\n  This resolution calls for $3.1 trillion in spending for the next \nfiscal year. It rejects the President's cuts to entitlement programs, \nand it funds domestic discretionary programs at $21 billion above his \nbudget request. This means that we can begin to make much needed \nimprovements in the programs that help build our nation.\n  The many important areas that this budget addresses are particularly \ncrucial in these difficult economic times for America's families. We \nprovide for a reserve fund that will improve access to affordable \nhousing for working families, we add $40 million for emergency food \nassistance and we improve unemployment compensation.\n  In health care, I want to mention two specific areas. This budget \nmakes room for critically needed increases in health research funding. \nThe National Institutes of Health is headquartered in Maryland, and its \ngrants fund research in my state and across the nation. Unfortunately, \nthis is the sixth year in a row that NIH has been essentially flat-\nfunded. I have the privilege of meeting often with biomedical \nresearchers from my home state. They are working to find treatments and \ncures for our most challenging diseases--cancer, diabetes, arthritis, \nALS, and others.\n  During the period when Congress doubled NIH funding--between 1998 and \n2003--researchers' chances of securing NIH funding for a worthwhile \ngrant proposal was one in four. Since 2003, their chances have dwindled \nto one in eleven. Undergraduate and graduate students alike are \nbeginning to question their career choices and wonder if there is a \nfuture for them in biomedical research. With medical research inflation \nat nearly 3.5 percent, we must increase the agency's funding by at \nleast that amount in order to break even. To make progress in the fight \nagainst disease, we must increase our spending substantially. I am \npleased that our resolution rejects the President's planned cuts for \nthis critical agency and makes room for additional funding.\n  This budget resolution also makes room for improvements to pediatric \ndental care. I have come to the floor of the Senate on several \noccasions to talk about a 12-year-old named Deamonte Driver. He lived \njust 6 miles from here in Prince George's County, MD. The Driver \nfamily, like many other families across the country, lacked dental \ncoverage. At one point, his family had Medicaid, but they lost it when \nthey moved into a shelter, and their paperwork fell through the cracks. \nWhen advocates for the family tried to help, it took more than 20 calls \njust to find a dentist who would treat him.\n  Deamonte began to complain of headaches in January 2007. An \nevaluation at Children's Hospital found that he had an abscessed tooth, \nbut the condition was advanced and he needed emergency brain surgery. \nHe later experienced seizures and a second operation. Even though he \nreceived additional treatment and appeared to be recovering, medical \nintervention had come too late. Deamonte passed away on Sunday, \nFebruary 25, 2007. At the end, the total cost of his treatment exceeded \na quarter of a million dollars--more than 3,000 times the $80 it would \nhave cost for a tooth extraction.\n  There is no excuse for us, in the wealthiest nation on Earth, to \nwatch a child die for lack of access to basic dental care. It is \ndifficult to find dentists to treat low-income children for two \nreasons. First, because there is a shortage of pediatric dentists--only \n4.3 percent of dental school graduates in 2001 reported pediatric \ndentistry as their specialty of choice; and second, because the \nreimbursement from public programs such as Medicaid and SCHIP is low.\n  Our budget rejects the President's cuts to dental training programs, \nand it is my hope that we will continue to work to increase the number \nof pediatric dentists and improve reimbursement for public programs. \nBut there are thousands more children, like Deamonte's brothers who \nalso need dental care--who cannot wait for us to recruit and train more \ndentists. I thank both Senator Whitehouse, who joined me in offering an \namendment in committee to address this issue, and the members of the \nBudget Committee who unanimously supported it. My amendment would \nestablish a deficit-neutral reserve fund in the budget for legislation \nto improve access for low-income children who are in either Medicaid, \nSCHIP, or are uninsured. As a result, this budget will allow Congress \nto fund legislation to improve oral health care and more appropriately \nreimburse the providers who are willing to treat low-income children. \nThese are the offices, clinics, and dental schools whose doors are open \nto underserved patients, but whose ability to treat large numbers is \ncompromised by inadequate payments.\n  This budget also funds critical investments in homeland security. The \nPresident's budget reduced funding for important first responder \nprograms, including the SAFER--Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency \nResponse--grant program. The SAFER grant program directly funds fire \ndepartments and volunteer firefighter interest organizations to help \nthem increase the number of trained, frontline firefighters. This \nbudget rejects those cuts and will give firefighters needed resources \nto protect our communities.\n  I am proud that this resolution also addresses another issue that is \ncritically important for Maryland. It calls for pay parity between \ncivilian and military employees. With tens of thousands of Federal \nemployees in Maryland, I have witnessed the additional burdens placed \non our civil servants, particularly since the 2001 terrorist attacks on \nour Nation. These dedicated employees are called upon to assume greater \nrisks with lower comparable pay to private sector wages. In addition, \nmany Federal agencies now face a human capital crisis, with thousands \nof our most experienced employees eligible to retire in the next few \nyears. Pay parity is necessary if we will be able to recruit and retain \na quality Federal workforce, and this budget provides for it.\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\n  Finally, I also note that this budget supports our veterans. We \nrightly reject the President's misguided proposals to increase \nenrollment fees and copayments for veterans' health care services. We \nincrease funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs so that we can \nimprove VA health care facilities and improve access to rehabilitation, \nmental health services, traumatic brain injury services, and speed the \nprocessing time for disability claims.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Conrad for his leadership in helping to bring \nforth this agreement. As he has said previously, it truly marks a new \npath forward for our country. I urged my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Mr. President, my staff members and I hear from \nMississippians every day about the crippling effects of high energy \nprices. We all understand the need for increasing clean energy \nsupplies, and I hope we can continue to work to do that and to develop \nother innovative solutions to deal more effectively with this great \nproblem. But the bill we are considering will not accomplish that goal. \nInstead, the legislation will have a detrimental effect on our economy. \nIt will contribute to a higher overall cost of living, and it will be \nespecially harmful to lower income families.\n  According to projections by the Energy Information Administration and \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, energy costs are projected to rise \nbecause of this legislation. Energy prices are already at an all-time \nhigh. We cannot afford to increase these costs even further. By 2030, \nincreased costs for delivered coal could range between 405 percent and \n804 percent, natural gas prices could rise between 34 percent and 107 \npercent, and gasoline prices could go up between 17 percent and 41 \npercent. Although the substitute amendment we are considering imposes \nyearly cost ceilings, these high prices will still be realized unless \nimprobable advancements in alternative energy production, such as 70 \nnew nuclear reactors and 68 billion gallons of ethanol, are produced.\n  Various projections of this bill show not only will prices increase, \nAmericans could lose jobs as industries struggle to keep costs down. I \nam proud of the new era of manufacturing that my State of Mississippi \nis entering, but I don't want Mississippians to lose the jobs we have \nfought so hard to obtain. The Environmental Protection Agency and the \nEnergy Information Administration suggest that this bill could reduce \nthe gross domestic product of the United States by as much as 7 percent \nby 2050 and could reduce the manufacturing output of the United States \nby almost 10 percent in 2030. A reduction in output means that industry \nwill need fewer workers in order to keep their costs down. A need for \nfewer workers will result in job losses, and unemployment rates in my \nState are already too high.\n  I believe the Senate should spend time considering the best use of \nAmerica's natural resources while being mindful of the environment. \nHowever, if we are going to mandate reductions in greenhouse gases, \nthere are certain principles we need to keep in mind. The Senate must \nconsider the costs we will impose on the consumers we represent. The \nlegislation we have before us goes beyond what is required to reduce \nemissions and imposes harsh, costly restrictions on the industries and \nbusinesses we count on to keep our economy healthy.\n  The bill provides that only 30 percent of annual emissions reduction \nobligations can be met using credits and offsets. Only half of that \namount can be from domestically generated credits, through a complex \nformula, and the remainder of the available credits would come from \noutside the United States. Many of these credits and offsets will \nlikely come from the agricultural sector. Mississippi farmers are \nalready engaged in better and more efficient practices, such as no-till \nfarming, new irrigation efficiencies, and reforestation of marginal \nlands.\n  Another troubling aspect of the legislation is the creation of a \nmassive new mandatory spending regime that would direct nearly $3.3 \ntrillion in auction revenues over the next several decades to dozens of \nspecific programs, some that already exist but some that are new. These \nmandatory programs will not likely receive the proper oversight and \ncontrol that the annual appropriations process provides. It is \nunreasonable to think we can know today whether it will be appropriate \nin 2050 to allocate 3.42 percent of auction revenues for Department of \nthe Interior adaptation activities or to allocate 3.1 percent of \nauction revenues in 2030 for cellulosic biomass programs.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations, where we have \nannual hearings and review the needs and the constraints we are dealing \nwith under the budget for appropriating funds, I cannot support this \napproach that pretends to project what the appropriated amount should \nbe years and years from now.\n  It is my hope we will be able to help restore a strong economy, \ncreate an energy infrastructure that provides for low-cost electrical \nand motor fuel prices, and foster a responsible attitude about our \nnatural resources and the environment. However, the legislation we are \nnow considering will not bring Americans lower energy costs or, \nrealistically, a cleaner environment.\n  Unless major changes to this legislation are considered, I cannot \nsupport this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I could give these remarks now or I \ncould have given them when we were on the bill because they address \nsomething that is disturbing a number of Senators. That concern is that \nthe majority leader may be thinking of filling the tree, which means he \nis not going to allow us to offer a significant number of amendments to \nthis bill. That is, from what I can tell, something that we should not \ndo, and he should not do. As someone who knows him well and works with \nhim well, I think it would be a mistake to fill the tree on a bill like \nthis, and let me give a few examples from my own experience.\n  When we used to do business the way the Senate does business, not \nfilling trees but filling many days with legislation of importance, we \nhad a Clean Air Act, Mr. President. The manager of the bill was Ed \nMuskie. The Clean Air Act; Ed Muskie. The first bill of that sort that \ncame to the floor. I was a brand new Senator. I was on the committee. \nVery interesting. I spent a great deal of time on the Senate floor just \nlistening and watching. That bill was on the floor of the Senate 5 \nweeks--5 weeks not 5 days--with 168 amendments considered and 162 acted \nupon. Of those, 60 were Democratic.\n  Now, imagine this bill before us, which is far more important in \nterms of the ramifications to the American economy, to the costs that \nwill be added to energy, to the trial run that we are taking upon \nourselves to try to curtail carbon, which we don't even know will work, \nyet it will put into the marketplace trillions of new dollars that are \nallocations. There are certificates, not issued by the Treasury of the \nUnited States but, rather, issued under the mandate of this program. \nAll of the language in this bill as to who gets those allocations, as \nthough we walked around and walked the streets and tried to see who \nmight need them and\n\n[[Page S5012]]\n\nwho might support the bill and provide these allocations, that deserves \nas much time as the Senate wants to spend offering amendments. It is \nprobably the biggest, most complicated bill we have had, certainly in \nthe 36 years that I have been a Senator.\n  Secondly, we tried an energy bill. We finally passed it after the \nthird try, but we didn't try to fill the tree. That is language for \nsaying we are making it so that it can't be amended, so that it will \nmove rapidly because all avenues for amendment are filled, and thus the \ntree is filled. That is where the language comes from. The leader has \nthe authority to do it, or whoever can be recognized ahead of him, if \nthey want to do that.\n  I will cite another example. We finally passed a very good \ncomprehensive energy act 3 years ago. That bill was on the floor of the \nSenate for 3 weeks--3 weeks not 3 days. This bill that we are talking \nabout has been on the Senate floor only 3 days, 4 days, and already we \nare considering closing off debate. I have been here 35 years, and I \nhave never seen anything like this--thinking of filling the tree on a \nbill of this magnitude, this complexity, and, I might say, with the \ncertainty of having mistakes. It is just as certain as we are standing \nhere and you are sitting there presiding that this bill has to have \nmany errors in it, many things we will regret passing if we don't amend \nit, talk about it, and analyze it.\n  Having said that, and having examples of precedent here, when we \nbehave like a Senate, where we were not unwilling to take 100 \namendments on a bill when you considered that, and you didn't say: Oh, \nthe Senate is closing its doors, we are dead, we used to say: We are \nlive. We are going to get it done. Senator Muskie made his name on that \none bill because it was here 5 weeks. Nobody ever questioned his \ncapacity, after that, to handle legislation. I use that as an example \nwhen I tell people how do you become a Senator. You have an opportunity \nto come to the floor to manage something for anywhere from 3 days to 3 \nor 4 weeks. I had that chance three times on budgets. Before anybody \never knew me, I had the opportunity to come down here and do that. \nPeople found out I could manage a bill. That is part of the Senate. \nThat happened to Senator Muskie--5 solid weeks and 100 amendments to \nget a Clean Air Act through here.\n  This bill is bigger, more important, more comprehensive, and maybe \nmore difficult for the American economy and American people than the \nClean Air Act. It needs time, not tree building, not trunk building, \nnot closing off opportunities to amend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 14 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5012-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5012-S5014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            OIL SPECULATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I heard my colleague on the other side of \nthe aisle, from Louisiana, on the floor of the Senate, with the usual \nsharp partisan scalpel, talking about what the price of gasoline was \nwhen this Congress was seated, the new Congress--presumably with a \nDemocratic majority was his point--and what the price of gasoline is \nnow, suggesting somehow that the Congress has conspired in increasing \nthe price of gasoline. In fact, nothing could be further from the \ntruth. But I want to explain my concern about what is happening with \nthe price of gasoline and the price of energy in this country. I also \nwant to make the point while I do this that those, including perhaps my \ncolleague who was speaking earlier this morning, who have always felt \nthat regulation was a four-letter word, ought to understand that part \nof what we are experiencing today is regulatory agencies in the Federal \nGovernment taking a Rip van Winkle nap while they ought to be \nregulating, while they ought to be watching on behalf of the public \ninterest what is going on.\n  We have people who came to Government who did not like Government, \nwho aspired not to do anything. A good example of that is the folks who \nwere put in place prior to Enron, running roughshod on wholesale \nelectricity prices--which we later found out was a criminal enterprise. \nPeople on the west coast were bilked out of billions and billions of \ndollars. Why? Because regulators were not watching and didn't care, \nbecause they were regulators who were selected by the very companies \nthey were regulating. In fact, I am told that Ken Lay actually was \nconducting some interviews on behalf of the administration.\n  Ken Lay is dead. He is gone. He came before my committee. I chaired \nthe hearings on the Enron scandal over in the Commerce Committee. He \ncame before the committee. We subpoenaed him. He raised his hand, took \nan oath, sat down and took the fifth amendment. He has now died but \nmany of his colleagues in Enron are spending years at minimum security \nprisons somewhere around the country.\n  Effective regulatory oversight is very important. It is unbelievably \nimportant. Let me explain why that is the case with respect to the \nprice of gasoline and the price of oil.\n  Here is what has happened to the price of gasoline. These are oil \nprices, but gasoline prices track them. This is the price of a first \nmonth contract on the NYMEX. You can see what is happening--up, up, and \nup.\n  Is there a reason that oil prices should go up like that? Let's \nexplore that a bit. Stephen Simon, senior vice president of ExxonMobil, \ntestified a month and a half ago before the House of Representatives. \nHere is what he said:\n\n       The price of oil should be about $50-55 per barrel.\n\n  A big oil executive saying the price of oil ought to be about $50 or \n$55 a barrel.\n  Here is Clarence Cazalot, the CEO of Marathon Oil. He says:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market.\n\n  An oil executive saying the current price at $100--it is much higher \nnow--$100 is not justified.\n  During a question-and-answer period he suggested a more reasonable \nrange for crude oil prices was between $55 and $60 a barrel.\n  This is from the Newark Star Ledger on January 8.\n\n       Experts, including the former head of ExxonMobil, say \n     financial speculation in the energy markets has grown so much \n     over the last 30 years that it now adds 20 to 30 percent or \n     more to the price of a barrel of oil.\n\n  Again, an oil company executive.\n  Fadel Gheit, senior energy analyst at Oppenheimer, with 30 to 35 \nyears experience:\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil. I'm convinced that \n     oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a barrel.\n       I call it the world's largest gambling hall. . . .\n\n  He is talking about the futures market now, for oil.\n\n       I call it the world's largest gambling hall . . . It's open \n     24/7 . . . Unfortunately, it's totally unregulated . . . This \n     is like a highway with no cops and no speed limit and \n     everybody's going 120 miles an hour.\n\n  Fadel Gheit came and testified before our Energy subcommittee and \nsaid the same thing. There is no justification for the current price of \noil.\n  Then what is happening? This is what a market looks like at NYMEX. It \nis hard to see much order there, but I have actually visited that \nmarket. It is a bunch of traders on the floor who wear colored jackets \nand logos and have pieces of paper. It doesn't look like anybody can \nkeep track of what they are doing. They apparently are doing it well. \nAt any rate, in this market, which is supposed to provide liquidity for \nthe price of oil--that is you have a market where you have people who \nhedge and people who buy contracts and so on--there is now an orgy of \nspeculation, an unbelievable amount of speculation.\n  Let me show what has happened with respect to speculation. This line \nshows the percentage of oil owned by speculators, January 1996 to April \n2008. This is oil purchased by people who do not have any interest in \nhaving oil. These are speculators. They buy things they will never get \nfrom people who never had it, expecting to make money on both sides of \nthe trade.\n\n  This market is now infested with speculators. We heard testimony \nyesterday that said the largest holder of home heating fuel in the \nNortheast, in the United States of America, is Morgan Stanley, an \ninvestment bank. Does anybody here think that Morgan Stanley decided as \npart of its corporate charter we aspire to gather a bunch of heating \noil because we want to be in\n\n[[Page S5013]]\n\nthe heating oil business? No. It is an investment bank that is in the \nspeculative business.\n  Hedge funds and investment banks are deep into speculation in these \nfutures markets, very deep. Investment banks for the first time, as I \nunderstand it, are actually buying storage capacity to take energy, \nthat is heating fuel and oil, off of the market and put it in storage \nto keep it in the market. They believe it would be more valuable in the \nfuture than to convert it to dollars, which they think will depreciate. \nSo they buy oil and store oil because they are speculating.\n  The question is, What do we do about that? If, in fact, the \nfundamentals aren't at work here--and, by the way, there is no free \nmarket. Everybody says: What about the free market? Let the free market \nwork. There is no free market. That is absurd. You have a cartel, a \nbunch of folks who represent the OPEC countries. They all have \nministers--Mr. Minister this, Mr. Minister that. They go lock a door \nsomeplace and this cartel decides how much they are going to produce \nand what price point they want. You have a cartel at the front end. \nSecond, you have bigger oil companies. They have all merged. They all \nlike each other so they all married and the fact is nobody cared much \nhow big they got and now they have two names, ExxonMobil, \nConocoPhillips, the list goes on. So they are bigger, stronger, and \nthey have more muscle in the marketplace. Cartel, bigger oil \ncompanies--and third and most important you have an unbelievable amount \nof speculation in a market that ought to work but doesn't work anymore \nat all.\n  Who is injured? The country is damaged. Our economy is damaged. \nEverybody who drives up to a service station and wants to use a gas \npump to fill their car with gas is now actually siphoning money right \nout of their pocketbook right into the bank account of the major oil \ncompanies, right into the bank account of the OPEC countries. They have \n``permagrin.'' They love this. They smile all the way to the bank \nbecause they are depositing our money. But it is injuring our country, \ndamaging our economy, and hurting American consumers.\n  So if this is not just about fundamentals, and if the fundamentals \ndon't justify the current price, what then can we do? We have done at \nleast a couple of little things. I introduced a bill we have now passed \nand the President has now signed it--he didn't like to sign it, but he \nsigned it--that said at least stop putting 70,000 barrels a day \nunderground of sweet light crude. That is a law. They have not stopped \ndoing it because they are filling out the current contract until the \nend of June, but 70,000 barrels of sweet light crude will go into the \nsupply line when that goes into effect at the end of this month.\n  What can we do to end and wring out the speculation? Let me say, \nfirst, we need oil. I am not here to trash oil. We need oil. I \nunderstand that. We put in place in 1960 generous tax breaks that are \npermanent to say: If you are looking for oil or gas, we want to give \nyou some tax incentives to do that. That is what this country did a \nlong time ago.\n  I was on an oil rig about 2 weeks ago in the area of our country that \nhas the largest oil play, I believe. It is called the Bakkan Shale in \nwestern North Dakota and eastern Montana. It is fascinating what they \nare doing. The reason I say we need oil--I encourage drilling. I was \none of four Senators who helped open up Lease 181 off the Gulf of \nMexico. We are now going to get more oil and gas off of that area and \nstill protect our environment.\n  Let me talk about the sophistication of the drilling rig I visited 2 \nweeks ago. They drill down 10,000 feet, make a big curve with the same \nrig, and drill out 10,000 feet. They are searching for a seam that is \n100 feet wide called the shale seam. They divide that seam into three \nparts--the upper part, middle part, and lower part. They go down 2 \nmiles with a drilling rig, make a big curve, go out 2 miles, and they \nare targeting only the middle part of a 100-foot seam to get oil and \nthey end up 2 to 4 feet from where they expect to be with their drill \nbit. It is unbelievable technology. There is a lot going on and I \ncommend them for it. We want to encourage them. We want more \nproduction, but we cannot sit around here, as a Congress, and say it \ndoesn't matter what the current price is.\n  If the price at the pump is $4, the price of a barrel of oil is $125 \nor $130 or $135, it doesn't matter. It matters to the airlines that \nwent belly up recently. I had a discussion yesterday with an executive \nwho told me the name of an airline he thinks may well be liquidated in \nthe next couple of weeks. I was flabbergasted. We have had a good many \nairlines file for bankruptcy recently. We have trucking companies all \nacross this country, especially mom-and-pop truck businesses, that \ncannot afford to buy fuel and have gone belly up and many others will. \nWe have people who can't afford to put gas in their tank to drive to \nwork. That is unbelievable to me.\n  If it were about fundamentals, I would understand this, but this has \nnothing to do with fundamentals of supply and demand or the free \nmarket. It has to do with an unbelievable amount of speculation. We \nhave a right, in my judgment, we have a responsibility, to begin \nwringing that speculation out of those futures markets.\n  There are a number of ways to do that. I have talked before about a \npiece of legislation that would increase margin requirements for those \nwho want to engage in speculation. If you want to buy stock on margin, \nyou have to put up 50 percent of the money. That is a requirement--50 \npercent of the money. If you want to go buy an oil contract, 5 to 7 \npercent. If you want to control $100,000 worth of oil, it will cost you \n$5,000 to $7,000. If you want to control $100,000 worth of stock on \nmargin, it will cost you $50,000.\n  It seems to me first we ought to identify a way to decide what is \nspeculation and what is not and then go after a way to wring out the \nspeculation from these markets. I understand markets need to work, they \nneed liquidity, they need to have an opportunity for legitimate \nhedging. I understand all of that. But I also understand what has \nhappened here is we have galloped into this box canyon with speculators \nmaking massive amounts of money.\n  The other day I was on the floor and I talked about a man who has \nbeen involved in hedging and betting--mostly betting, not hedging--and \nhas made a massive amount of money. He doesn't have any interest in \noil. He has never had oil run through his fingers. He has probably \nnever changed the oil in his car, let alone wanting to buy oil. He \nwouldn't have a place to store it if he got it. He is very interested \nin gambling on the contracts, back and forth, to make money.\n  That is what Mr. Gates said. As I indicated, Mr. Gates is a fellow \nwho has over 30 years' experience. I have talked to him by telephone a \nnumber of times. Mr. Gates says: This is the world's largest gambling \nhall. It is open 24/7, totally unregulated.\n  Now, we have seen speculation and bubbles exist in our country \nbefore. We have seen them in history. There are books written about \nbubbles and speculation. You know when tulips were sold for $25,000 a \npiece, 400 and 500 years ago, it did not matter so much, nobody needed \nto have a tulip to do well during the day.\n  But oil is different. The price of oil affects every American, every \nconsumer, every business. It affects our economy. What are we going to \ndo if this price keeps moving and if we do not find a way to wring the \nspeculation out of this and bring it back to where supply and demand or \nwhere a real marketplace would render the price to be?\n  How many airlines will go bankrupt? Will trucking companies be able \nto purchase fuel? What will consumers do? What will it mean to the \neconomic growth potential of this country?\n  I am working on a piece of legislation that does a couple things, \nthat addresses this speculation in a way to free it, to wring it out of \nthe futures market. The futures market should exist. It is a legitimate \nmarket. The futures market for oil is necessary. You need to hedge. But \nwe need to find a way to have complete transparency, to be able to \nregulate both here and also on the intercontinental exchanges. We \nprobably need to increase the margin requirements and say to \nspeculators: Your day is over. Your day is done. This market will \nexist, but it will exist without you.\n  I intend to work on that amendment with my colleagues in the coming \ndays and offer it and hope we push it to a conclusion.\n\n[[Page S5014]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in order to debate global warming \nlegislation to get us to lower gas prices, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with so we can get back to the \nbusiness of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object, this is a brand new \nsubstitute bill comprised of 491 pages that very few people have even \nhad a chance to see. I think this is an opportunity for us to learn \nwhat is actually in the legislation so that we can do our job and \nconsider it and vote accordingly.\n  I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I reiterate my request because the reason given by my \nfriend is wrong. We have had a summary available for 2 weeks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed \nwith.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, given the lateness of the hour and the \nhard work of all our staff today, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORKER. I object, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue \nreading.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, would it be in order for this Senator \nfrom Colorado to ask a question of the Senator from Tennessee?\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, regular order, if we could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular order is the reading of the amendment. \nThe clerk will read the amendment.\n  The assistant Parliamentarian (Leigh Hildebrand) continued with the \nreading of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Nevada, the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the American public has had the opportunity \nfor the last 8 hours to watch what is wrong with the Republican \nminority. No wonder an election in a heavily Republican House district, \nthe seat of the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dennis \nHastert, goes Democratic big time; a House seat in a special election \nin Louisiana, which has been Republican for a long period of time, went \nDemocratic; and a seat in the State of Mississippi, in a special \nelection, went Democratic. All you have to do is look at the picture of \nwhat has been going on here today to understand why.\n  It seems the Republican minority wants to do anything they can to \nmaintain the status quo. They do not want legislation, and they have \nproven that time and time again. I want everyone to understand that \nbecause of the Republicans, we are going to have to have a vote. In a \nshort time, I am going to call a live quorum and people are going to \nhave to take off their pajamas, turn off their TV sets and head for the \nCapitol, and they should do that because that is what we are going to \nhave, as the terminology is here, in a few minutes.\n  Now, I want also people to kind of get the other picture. The \nThursday before our recess, 13 days ago, we were working on a package \nof nominations. I worked with the Chief of Staff of the President of \nthe United States, Josh Bolten. We cleared a lot of names. The vast \nmajority of them, 80-some, were Republicans, Republican nominees. There \nwere a handful of Democrats, five--I don't know how many. It was all \ndone. I thought we had worked this out with the Chief of Staff, the \nPresident's Chief of Staff. But lo and behold, at the last minute, no. \nSo I thought, well, we would start early this time. So a couple days \nago I started working again with Josh Bolten, and the last couple days, \nin fact 3 days, we have been working. He has had somebody work with my \nChief of Staff and my appointments person, and I thought we\n\n[[Page S5015]]\n\nwere making a lot of headway. We did another deal. We learned at the \nlast minute that the Republicans don't want it. They do not want their \nown people, one of whom was a Secretary of the Cabinet.\n  So this is the stall that is taking place, for reasons that are--\nwell, the American people can see.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll, and the \nfollowing Senators entered the Chamber and answered to their names.\n\n                          [Quorum No. 2 Leg.]\n\n     Boxer\n     Reid\n     Salazar\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum is not present.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to instruct the Sergeant at Arms to \nrequest the presence of absent Senators, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

A quorum is present.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to be patient for a \nshort time.\n  First of all, these valiant people who are sitting in front of the \nPresiding Officer have been required today to read for more than 8 \nhours--total, without any breaks, 8 hours--for no reason other than the \nRepublicans are trying to maintain the status quo in everything.\n  Talk about this picture: reading an amendment that is done extremely \nrarely. We had our staff check, and it is done every decade or so. This \nwas a bill of some 500 pages. The bill has been available for people to \nread long before today. The substitute amendment has been ready long \nbefore today.\n  As I said earlier this week, manmade pollution is causing the Earth \nto warm. The science is crystal clear. We have for more than 100 years \nbeen taking carbon out of the Earth and putting it into the sky. It is \ncausing our Earth to have a fever. Our Earth is sick, and we must look \nat the sickness and try to do something about it.\n  The warming is clear. It has already harmed our environment and our \neconomy. We know that. The scientists know that. You can see it all \naround us. It is causing more frequent and more intense drought, \nwildfires, and floods.\n  Western wildfires. I look around this room, and I see Senator Baucus, \nI see the Senator from California and the Senator from Washington. In \nthe last 30 years, 72 more days of wildfire season--72 more days--\nlightning striking in those 72 days. More fires. Fires are more \nintense.\n  Floods, tornadoes. At least 110 people have been killed in the United \nStates so far this year by tornadoes, putting this year on track to be \nby far the deadliest year in the history of tornado deaths. The average \nfor recent years is 62 tornado fatalities for the entire year. We are \njust completing May, and we are already at 110 deaths. January had 84 \ntornadoes. The 3-year average for the month is 34. It is approximately \nthree times the average. February had 148 deaths compared to a 3-year \naverage of only 25. Multiply that, Mr. President. That does not include \nthe records that are unverified for March, April, and May. One tornado \nseason does not make a long-term climate trend. We understand that. But \nit should give Senators pause and should make them want to limit these \nkinds of global warming risks.\n  Global warming is easily the gravest long-term challenge that our \ncountry and the world faces. It is the most critical issue of our time. \nThe American people have a right to expect their legislature, their \nCongress to address this issue. That is why we decided a number of \nmonths ago that the Senate should take up climate change on June 2. We \ndid so to let the American people know that the Senate was prepared to \nact, and put all Members of this body on notice we were going to act. \nSenators should begin preparing for this important debate, is what we \nsaid, so we could hit the ground running and truly legislate on this \nmost important issue.\n  Late last month, I sought permission to proceed to the climate change \nbill and was informed by the Republicans that they would object to this \nrequest; and they objected. Had the minority, the Republicans, not \nobjected last month, the Senate could already be in its third day of \nlegislating on this important bill.\n  But where do we find ourselves? We find ourselves confronting an \norchestrated effort by the Republican leader to delay and obstruct. We \nhave seen this play a record number of times before this body. In 10 \nmonths we all know they broke the 2-year filibuster record.\n\n[[Page S5016]]\n\n  We are now, I believe, at 72 filibusters for this Congress. There is \none difference in this instance. We have actually been provided with a \ncopy of a page from the Republican playbook and how they intend to \nthwart this body from acting on this important legislation. This was \nprovided to us by a lobbyist involved in Republican strategy meetings. \nLet me read verbatim what this e-mail says. It is too bad the press \ngalleries are bare because it is almost midnight:\n\n       The thinking now is to still use as much of the 30 hours \n     post-cloture on the motion to proceed for debate on \n     thematically-grouped amendments. The goal is for a theme \n     (example: climate bill equals higher gas prices) each day, \n     and the focus is much more on making political points than in \n     amending the bill, changing the baseline text for any future \n     debate or affecting policy.\n\n  Let me repeat the last sentence:\n\n       The goal is for a theme (example: climate bill equals \n     higher gas prices) each day, and the focus is much more on \n     making political points than in amending the bill. . . .\n\n  That is what they say. So this Republican strategy memo could not be \nmore clear. The Republican plan for dealing with the greatest challenge \nfacing this world and this Nation is more about making political points \nthan legislating. Those are not my words; that is what they say in \ntheir memo.\n  But there is more to this cynical strategy that is completely out of \ntouch with this body's obligations and the American people's \nexpectations. Continuing from a Republican strategy memo, I will quote:\n\n       GOP anticipates a struggle over which amendments are \n     debated and eventually finger-pointing over blame for demise \n     of the bill. In the GOP view, this will take at least the \n     rest of this week, and hopefully into next week.\n\n  Mr. President, you could not make anything up more cynical. This is \nthe truth and they say truth is stranger than fiction, and this \ncertainly is. They go on to say:\n\n       At some point, Reid will have to move from the bill, and \n     GOP plans to oppose UC and potentially force debate on \n     debatable motions, and vote against cloture on any such \n     motion. While Reid will eventually be able to circumvent by \n     moving to a privileged vehicle or using some other \n     parliamentary maneuver, the bottom line is that the GOP--\n\n  The Grand Old Party--I bet President Abraham Lincoln would be happy \nabout this one--\n\n     very much wants to have this fight, engage in it for a \n     prolonged period, and then make it as difficult as possible \n     to move off the bill.\n\n  Again, as they say, they want to make political points. Anybody \nwatching this debate will know the Republicans have fully executed this \nstrategy. What did they do today to execute in making political points? \nThat is some political point. It is routine here to not read the \namendments, but they said ``we object.'' So we proceeded to have the \namendment read. They executed this strategy and they have done it well, \nand they tried to make political points. I have no reason to doubt that \nthey are prepared to go the final mile to stretch out the final \nconsideration of this bill before finally killing it.\n  In case anybody needed more proof about their desire, I offered, with \nour staffs, several consents that would have stopped the obstruction we \nhave witnessed in the past few days. My consents would have allowed the \nSenate to move forward to complete action. Isn't that an interesting \nconcept? A bill is offered--and I have been around here a long time, \nand some people have been here longer than I have, but I defy anyone to \nsay they have ever laid down a perfect piece of legislation.\n  That is why we have the amendment process. A bill was laid down and \nwe thought there should be an opportunity to try to make the bill \nbetter. That certainly wasn't what they had in mind. In keeping with \nthe strategy spelled out in this Republican memo, their response was \nthat we are not going to allow this; we are going to object, object, \nand object. Their obstructionism is disappointing to me personally and, \nobviously, to the American people.\n  I repeat what I said earlier this evening. Is it any wonder that \nSpeaker Dennis Hastert's long-time Republican district, in a special \nelection, went Democratic? Is it any wonder a long-time Republican \ndistrict in Louisiana went Democratic? Is there any reason to not \nunderstand why the special election in Mississippi went Democratic? Of \ncourse not, because the American people are seeing what is going on \nhere. The American people want us to do things.\n  Do you know what the Republicans get glee out of doing? They are \nhappy that our approval rating is about the same as the President's. \nIsn't it wonderful that they are a part of this body, 49 of them, and \nthere are 51 of us, and they are boasting about the fact that the \npeople don't think much of Congress. Why don't they? Look at this \nRepublican memo. That should give you some inclination as to why the \nAmerican people feel the way they do.\n  This important legislation has been worked on very hard on a \nbipartisan basis. Is it perfect? Of course not. Shouldn't we be able to \nmove to try to amend this and have the old-fashioned debate to move \nforward on it? I commend Senators Boxer, Warner, and Lieberman. They \nhave worked so hard, and I appreciate their caring about this issue.\n  At this point, I think we have some very serious problems here. I \nwill go through this. We have been told what the answer is going to be. \nSpecifically, to every request that we have given to staff as to how to \nproceed on this bill, there is an objection.\n  I want everybody here to know what I have gone through a little bit. \nListen to this. The Thursday before we went out, I worked very long and \nhard and spent hours working with the President's Chief of Staff, to \nwork out some way to move forward on these nominations. We had more \nthan 80 Republicans and a handful of Democrats. I thought if you have \nthe President's Chief of Staff working on something for several days, \nthat should be sufficient. But guess what happened. I am here late at \nnight with loyal Lula, and everybody else is gone. We asked unanimous \nconsent and there was an objection. I called the Chief of Staff and \nsaid, ``What's this all about?'' Nothing happened. Remember, one of \nthem--I personally asked Chairman Dodd to do a special meeting to get \nthe Secretary of Housing out of the committee. He held a special \nmeeting in the President's room back there. We did that for the \nPresident of the United States, so he would have a Cabinet officer in \nHousing. Today was the culmination of 3 days of work with the \nPresident's Chief of Staff on nominations. We added more people than \nthey requested. We only have 5; they are way over 80 now. I thought we \nhad it all worked out. We called Joe Biden, who had a hold on somebody. \nJoe, the man that he is--always willing to go the extra mile to work \nthings out--said go ahead. The person was Jim Glassman. Some of us know \nwho Jim Glassman is--not exactly a bipartisan person who has been \naround Washington. He was going to replace Karen Hughes in that \nposition in the State Department. We worked very hard to get that \ncompleted and released. The reason we worked so hard is Mr. Bolten said \nthey would appreciate us doing this because if we don't do it tonight, \nhe is going to withdraw. We went the extra mile and worked for a couple \nof hours getting him cleared. We thought we had a deal. I give it to \nLula Davis, the secretary of the majority, and she submits it to the \nminority and we wait all day.\n  Listen to this. They have rejected it. Guess what. Out of nowhere, \nthey want three district court judges. I have not talked to the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. Senator Leahy has always been good \non district court judges. But they want three district court judges, \nand I had never even heard their names. How unfair could they be?\n  So again, Mr. President, wherever you are--probably sleeping, as you \nshould be--you are not going to have a Secretary of Housing because the \nrules around here seem to be only for one side. I worked very hard to \ntry to get this done. We are going to continue to try for some basic \nfairness. We have an obligation ourselves. All of the nominations don't \ncome from the White House. We have nominations ourselves to fill \nvarious positions. We will have a new President in 7 months. I have the \nobligation and the honor of submitting names to the White House. We \nhave some people we wish to get, too. It is not just a one-way street, \neven though they may think it is.\n  I think that what we have seen here is outlandish, unfair, \nunreasonable, and\n\n[[Page S5017]]\n\nnot in keeping with this body. I have been here a while, and we work on \ncomity. We work together. That isn't the way it is now. I understand \nhow upset the Republicans were in November of 2006 when we got the \nmajority. Quite frankly, Senator Schumer and I worked closely, and we \nthought we might be able to get the majority, but we weren't certain. \nWe got the majority and we were happy--but it is a slim majority. My \nfriends on the Republican side have to get over it. We are in the \nmajority, as slim as it might be. For the next 7 months, I am committed \nand I will try to work with the President. It has been difficult to do \nfor 7 years and 5 months, but I am never one who is without patience. I \nwill continue to try to move forward on nominations and anything else \nwe can work on together.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4826 to Amendment No. 4825\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a perfecting amendment to the \nsubstitute at the desk and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4826 to amendment No. 4825.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the United States \n should address global climate change through the negotiation of fair \n                and effective international commitments)\n\n       At the end of title XIII, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1334. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING INTERNATIONAL \n                   NEGOTIATIONS TO ADDRESS GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) There is a scientific consensus, as established by the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and confirmed by \n     the National Academy of Sciences, that the continued buildup \n     of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threatens \n     the stability of the global climate.\n       (2) The 2007 Fourth Assessment Report of the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that most \n     of the global warming observed since the mid-20th century is \n     very likely due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and \n     that anthropogenic warming is strongly linked to many \n     observed physical and biological impacts.\n       (3) There are significant long-term risks to the economy \n     and the environment of the United States from the temperature \n     increases and climatic disruptions that are projected to \n     result from increased greenhouse gas concentrations.\n       (4) The potential impacts of global climate change, \n     including long-term drought, famine, mass migration, and \n     abrupt climatic shifts, may lead to international tensions \n     and instability in regions affected and, therefore, have \n     implications for the national security interests of the \n     United States.\n       (5) The United States has the largest economy in the world \n     and is also the largest historical emitter of greenhouse \n     gases.\n       (6) The greenhouse gas emissions of the United States are \n     projected to continue to rise.\n       (7) The greenhouse gas emissions of some developing \n     countries are rising more rapidly than the emissions of the \n     United States and will soon surpass the greenhouse gas \n     emissions of the United States and other developed countries.\n       (8) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the levels \n     necessary to avoid serious climatic disruption requires the \n     introduction of new energy technologies and other climate-\n     friendly technologies, the use of which results in low or no \n     emissions of greenhouse gases or in the capture and storage \n     of greenhouse gases.\n       (9) The 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate \n     Change commissioned by the United Kingdom and the 2008 World \n     Economic Outlook from the International Monetary Fund each \n     concluded that the economic costs of addressing climate \n     change are limited.\n       (10) The development and sale of climate-friendly \n     technologies in the United States and internationally present \n     economic opportunities for workers and businesses in the \n     United States.\n       (11) Climate-friendly technologies can improve air quality \n     by reducing harmful pollutants from stationary and mobile \n     sources and can enhance energy security by reducing reliance \n     on imported oil, diversifying energy sources, and reducing \n     the vulnerability of energy delivery infrastructure.\n       (12) Other industrialized countries are undertaking \n     measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which provides \n     the industries in those countries with a competitive \n     advantage in the growing global market for climate-friendly \n     technologies.\n       (13) Efforts to limit emissions growth in developing \n     countries in a manner that is consistent with the development \n     needs of those countries could establish significant markets \n     for climate-friendly technologies and contribute to \n     international efforts to address climate change.\n       (14) The national security of the United States will \n     increasingly depend on the deployment of diplomatic, \n     military, scientific, and economic resources for solving the \n     problem of the overreliance of the United States and the \n     world on high-carbon energy.\n       (15) The United States is a party to the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York May \n     9, 1992, and entered into force March 21, 1994 (in this \n     preamble referred to as the ``Convention'').\n       (16) The Convention sets a long-term objective of \n     stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere \n     at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic \n     interference with the climate system.\n       (17) The Convention establishes that parties bear ``common \n     but differentiated responsibilities'' for efforts to achieve \n     the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations.\n       (18) At the December 2007 United Nations Climate Change \n     Conference in Bali, the United States and other parties to \n     the Convention adopted the Bali Action Plan with the aim of \n     reaching a new global agreement in 2009.\n       (19) The Bali Action Plan calls for a shared vision on \n     long-term cooperative action, increased mitigation efforts \n     from developed and developing countries that are measurable, \n     reportable, and verifiable, and support for developing \n     countries in addressing technology transfers, adaptation, \n     financing, deforestation, and capacity-building.\n       (20) The Major Economies Process on Energy Security and \n     Climate Change, initiated by President George W. Bush, seeks \n     a consensus among the countries with the world's major \n     economies on how those countries can contribute to a new \n     agreement under the Convention.\n       (21) In April 2008, President Bush called for a ``binding \n     international agreement'' with participation by all countries \n     with major economies in ``goals and policies that reflect \n     their unique energy resources and economic circumstances''.\n       (22) An effective global effort to address climate change \n     must provide for commitments and actions by all countries \n     that are major emitters of greenhouse gases, developed and \n     developing alike, and the widely varying circumstances among \n     developed and developing countries may require that such \n     commitments and actions vary.\n       (23) The latest scientific evidence suggests that \n     anthropogenic climate change is increasing and the United \n     States has supported the goal of achieving a new \n     international agreement during 2009, both lending urgency to \n     the need for renewed United States leadership in the effort \n     to counter global climate change.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should act to reduce the health, \n     environmental, economic, and national security risks posed by \n     global climate change and to foster sustained economic growth \n     through a new generation of technologies by participating in \n     negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on \n     Climate Change, done at New York May 9, 1992, and entered \n     into force March 21, 1994, and leading efforts in other \n     international fora, with the objective of securing United \n     States participation in binding agreements, consistent with \n     the Bali Action Plan, that--\n       (A) advance and protect the economic and national security \n     interests of the United States;\n       (B) establish mitigation commitments by all countries that \n     are major emitters of greenhouse gases, consistent with the \n     principle of common but differentiated responsibilities;\n       (C) establish flexible international mechanisms to minimize \n     the cost of efforts by participating countries; and\n       (D) achieve a significant long-term reduction in global \n     greenhouse gas emissions; and\n       (2) the President should support the establishment of a \n     bipartisan Senate observer group, the members of which should \n     be designated by the chairman and ranking member of the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, to--\n       (A) monitor any international negotiations on climate \n     change; and\n       (B) ensure that the responsibility of the Senate under \n     article II, section 2 of the Constitution of the United \n     States to provide advice and consent to the President with \n     respect to treaties be carried out in a manner to facilitate \n     timely consideration of any applicable treaty submitted to \n     the Senate.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the United States \n should address global climate change through the negotiation of fair \n                and effective international commitments)\n\n       For the amendment, strike all after the word ``SEC'' on \n     line 2 and insert the following:\n\n     1334. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS TO \n                   ADDRESS GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) There is a scientific consensus, as established by the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and confirmed by \n     the National Academy of Sciences, that the continued buildup \n     of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threatens \n     the stability of the global climate.\n       (2) The 2007 Fourth Assessment Report of the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that most \n     of the global warming observed since the mid-20th century is \n     very likely due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and \n     that anthropogenic warming is strongly linked to many \n     observed physical and biological impacts.\n       (3) There are significant long-term risks to the economy \n     and the environment of the United States from the temperature \n     increases and climatic disruptions that are projected to \n     result from increased greenhouse gas concentrations.\n       (4) The potential impacts of global climate change, \n     including long-term drought, famine, mass migration, and \n     abrupt climatic shifts, may lead to international tensions \n     and instability in regions affected and, therefore, have \n     implications for the national security interests of the \n     United States.\n       (5) The United States has the largest economy in the world \n     and is also the largest historical emitter of greenhouse \n     gases.\n       (6) The greenhouse gas emissions of the United States are \n     projected to continue to rise.\n       (7) The greenhouse gas emissions of some developing \n     countries are rising more rapidly than the emissions of the \n     United States and will soon surpass the greenhouse gas \n     emissions of the United States and other developed countries.\n       (8) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the levels \n     necessary to avoid serious climatic disruption requires the \n     introduction of new energy technologies and other climate-\n     friendly technologies, the use of which results in low or no \n     emissions of greenhouse gases or in the capture and storage \n     of greenhouse gases.\n       (9) The 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally \ndebating legislation, S. 3036, addressing the serious problem of \nclimate change. For years, Congress and the White House have ignored or \ndownplayed the scientific consensus and failed to act on this pressing \nissue. That delay is inexcusable.\n  The details of S. 3036 are as complicated as they are important, and, \ngiven the potential implications for our economy, our energy policies \nand our planet, we need to take the time to make sure we get them \nright. A number of questions have been raised about elements of the \nbill we are considering, and I look forward to considering amendments \nto address some of these concerns. But one thing is clear, and that is \nthe need to establish a cap-and-trade program to reduce total domestic \ngreenhouse emissions.\n  To avoid the significant costs and consequences of climate change, \nleading scientists inform us that we must stabilize global atmospheric \nconcentrations of greenhouse gases below 450 parts per million and \nprevent the temperature from increasing above 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit \nabove pre-industrial levels. To achieve these reductions, I am a \ncosponsor of legislation introduced by Senator Sanders, S. 309, that \nwould require that such emissions be reduced by 80 percent from 1990 \nlevels by 2050.\n  I hope that this debate marks a new recognition of the need for \nmeaningful Federal action to address a threat that has been neglected \nfor far too long. Though the challenge before us is great, the cost of \ninaction is even greater.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the amendment I am filing to S. 3036, the \nLieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2008, is aimed at preserving \nthe legislative process. With an issue as complex and wide-ranging as \nclimate change, there are several committees within the Senate that not \nonly have an interest but a responsibility to deal with some aspects of \nthe cap-and-trade system we develop. This amendment will assure that \nthe appropriate committees of the Congress will have the opportunity to \nconsider those aspects of a cap-and-trade proposal within their \njurisdiction.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am filing to S. 3036, the Lieberman-\nWarner Climate Security Act of 2008, is designed to use the revenues \ngenerated from the auctioning of the greenhouse gas allowances for tax \nrelief.\n  A cap-and-trade system proposed in this legislation will generate \nbillions of dollars. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the \nBoxer substitute will generate $902 billion in revenues during the \ninitial 10 years of the program.\n  As chairman of the Finance Committee, I have a responsibility to \ndirect Federal revenues to the purposes that the committee, initially, \nand the Senate, ultimately, consider in the best interest of the \ncountry.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthe Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act. This bill addresses the most \nsignificant environmental challenge facing our country. The scientific \nevidence clearly demonstrates the human contribution to climate change. \nAccording to recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, increases in greenhouse gas emissions have already increased \nglobal temperatures, and likely contributed to more extreme weather \nevents such as droughts and floods. These emissions will continue to \nchange the climate, causing warming in most regions of the world, and \nlikely causing more droughts, floods, and many other societal problems.\n  In the United States alone, emissions of the primary greenhouse gas, \ncarbon dioxide, have risen more than 20 percent since 1990. Climate \nchange is the most daunting environmental challenge we face and we must \ndevelop reasonable solutions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.\n  I have observed in person the dramatic effects of climate change and \nhad the opportunity to be briefed by the preeminent experts. In 2006, \non a trip to Antarctica and New Zealand, for example, I learned more \nabout research by scientists at the University of Maine. Distinguished \nNational Academy of Sciences member George Denton took us to sites in \nNew Zealand that had been buried by massive glaciers at the beginning \nof the 20th century, but are now ice free. Fifty percent of the \nglaciers in New Zealand have melted since 1860--an event unprecedented \nin the last 5,000 years. We could clearly see the glacial moraines, \nwhere dirt and rocks had been pushed up in piles around the glacial \nterminus in 1860. I thought it was remarkable to stand in a place where \nsome 140 years ago I would have been covered in tens or hundreds of \nfeet of ice, and then to look far up the mountainside and see how \ndistant the edge of the ice is today.\n  In Antarctica, I visited the Clean Air Station at the South Pole. \nBeing the farthest place on Earth from major emissions sources, the \nSouth Pole has the cleanest air on Earth, and thus provides an \nexcellent place to measure the background quality of the Earth's air.\n\n[[Page S5020]]\n\nBy analyzing carbon dioxide in ice cores, scientists have been able to \ncreate reliable measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide going back \nover hundreds of thousands of years. The measurements of carbon dioxide \nat Clean Air Station provide a reliable comparison to document the \nimpact of human activity on increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in \nrecent years compared to the last hundreds of thousands of years. The \nmelting is even more dramatic in the Northern Hemisphere. In the last \n30 years, the Arctic has lost sea ice cover over an area 10 times as \nlarge as the State of Maine, and at this rate will be ice free by 2050. \nIn 2005 in Barrow, AK, I witnessed a melting permafrost that is causing \ntelephone poles, planted years ago, to lean over for the first time \never.\n  I also learned about the potential impact of sea level rise during my \ntrips to these regions. If the West Antarctica Ice Sheet were to \ncollapse, for example, sea level would rise 15 feet, flooding many \ncoastal cities. In their 2007 report, the IPCC found that due even just \nto gradual melting of ice sheets, the average predicted sea level rise \nby 2100 will be 1.6 feet, but could be as high as 1 meter, or almost 3 \nfeet. In Maine a 1-meter rise in sea level will cause the loss of \n20,000 acres of land, include 100 acres of downtown Portland--including \nCommercial Street, a major business thoroughfare along the water. \nAlready in the past 94 years, a 7 inch rise in sea level has been \ndocumented in Portland.\n  The time has come to take meaningful action to respond to climate \nchange. My colleagues worked tirelessly in recent months to develop \nlegislation that will preserve our environment for future generations \nwhile providing reasonable emission reduction goals, offsets, and \nincentives for the industries covered by the bill.\n  I applaud the leadership of my colleagues from Virginia, Connecticut, \nand California in bringing this bill to the floor this week.\n\n\n                           Rural Cooperatives\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy \nwith my friend, the junior Senator from Connecticut. I was pleased to \ncosponsor the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act shortly after it \nwas introduced last October, and I followed its progress through the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee with interest.\n  Today, the full Senate will begin considering that bill, and Senator \nBoxer, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, will \noffer a substitute amendment that she has worked out with Senators \nLieberman and Warner. I have a question for my friend from Connecticut \nregarding this substitute amendment.\n  As the Senator from Connecticut knows, many rural electric \ncooperatives in this country serve the role of local distribution \ncompanies. The committee-reported version of the Climate Security Act \nincluded rural electric cooperatives among the local distribution \ncompanies that receive emission allowances over the entire 42-year life \nof the program. In Florida, electric cooperatives serve more than \n1,000,000 Floridians in 58 of our 67 counties. Most of these rural \nelectric cooperatives own fossil fuel-fired powerplants.\n  I was recently in Florida and held a series of town hall meetings \nacross the State and heard from rural cooperatives that are concerned \nabout the way emission allocations are distributed under the substitute \namendment.\n  Can my friend from Connecticut address their concern and explain how \nallowances are available to rural cooperatives under the Boxer-\nLieberman-Warner substitute amendment?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Florida, for his question.\n  I would be glad to address the concern that rural electric \ncooperatives in Florida have brought to him.\n  Let me reassure him, and them, that the substitute amendment does \ninclude rural electric cooperatives among the local distribution \ncompanies that receive free emission allowances over the entire 42-year \nlife of the program.\n  And let me reassure him, and them, that the substitute amendment does \ninclude rural electric cooperatives among the fossil fuel-fired \npowerplant owners that receive free emission allowances over a \ntransitional period that lasts from 2012 through 2030. As in the \ncommittee-reported version of the bill, the separate allocation of free \nemission allowances that is exclusive to rural electric cooperatives in \nthe substitute amendment is additional to the free emission allowances \nthat rural electric cooperatives receive as local distribution \ncompanies and as fossil-fuel-powerplant owners. Under the substitute \namendment, as under the committee-reported bill, rural electric \ncooperatives in Montana and Virginia are the only rural electric \ncooperatives in the country that receive free emission allowances \nsolely from an exclusive allocation and not also from the bill's local-\ndistribution-company and fossil-fuel-powerplant allocations. Indeed, \nthere is a provision in the substitute amendment, section 552(c)(2)(C) \nthat would be mere surplussage if the case were otherwise.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank my friend from \nConnecticut for the clarification.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5020-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONSUMER-FIRST ENERGY ACT OF 2008--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me explain, this is the never-ending \nfarm bill. We are going to try it again. Tomorrow we hope we can pass \nit and send it to the President quickly. We hope to send it to the \nWhite House in the next day or so. The House has already approved it. \nThis will take care of the clerical error we had previously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I hardly know where to start, but let \nme start with the issue of judges.\n  The reason it was necessary to make our hard-working and dedicated \nclerical staff here read the amendment today was to make the Senate \nunderstand that commitments are important. The most important thing \nSenators have--the currency of the realm, if you will, in the Senate--\nis their word. When you give your word, you are supposed to keep your \nword.\n  On the issue of judicial confirmations, my good friend the majority \nleader and I discussed this matter publicly at the beginning of this \nCongress, and we agreed that President Bush, in the last 2 years of his \nterm, should be treated as well as President Reagan, Bush 41, and \nPresident Clinton were treated in the last 2 years of their tenures in \noffice because there was one common thread, and that was that the \nSenate was controlled by the opposition party.\n  What has become contentious around here in recent years is the \nconfirmation of circuit judges. So we agreed we ought to try to hit the \naverage for each of those Presidents in the last 2 years of their \nterms, and the average was 17. The low number was President Clinton, \nwith 15. That was the goal. It was clear by April of this year that \nthere was no intent to meet that goal, and so we had a skirmish here on \nthe floor over going to a bill. We reached an agreement. The majority \nleader indicated we would do three circuit judges before the Memorial \nDay recess. We did one. That commitment was not kept.\n  Now, the Senate is not the House. The minority does have rights in \nthe Senate. Most things that are accomplished in the Senate are \naccomplished on a bipartisan, cooperative basis. Members of the \nRepublican conference believe strongly that commitments ought to be \nkept. So by the reading of the amendment today, people got a chance to \nthink about the importance of commitments in this body that can only \nfunction when our word is kept. Other efforts will be made to drive \nthat point home.\n  And just keeping the commitment that was made for May--that was not \nkept--is not enough. We are seven judges away from equaling President \nClinton in the last 2 years of his term--15. Time is ticking away. That \ncommitment should be kept for the good of this institution.\n  I think it is important to remind our good friends on the other side \nof the aisle that the shoe might be on the other foot. They might be \nmaking the nominations. Why would they want to set a precedent such as \nthis that could come back to bite them so quickly? There is a growing \nsense of anger on this side of the aisle over this issue, and what \ntends to go around comes around in the Senate. This is a precedent we \nought not to set, and I think the adults on the other side of the aisle \nunderstand that this is a precedent that ought not to be set for the \ngood of either party. So we will be continuing to look for \nopportunities to make the point that commitments ought to be kept.\n  Now, with regard to the underlying bill, let me disabuse our \ncolleagues or anyone else who may be listening of the notion that \nmembers of the Republican conference are not interested in having \namendments on this bill. This is the most massive reorganization of the \nAmerican economy since the 1930s--some believe a $6.7 trillion tax \nincrease. Looking at Kentucky alone, it could mean up to $6,000 a year \nfor my people, and the GAO says a 53-cents-a-gallon gas tax increase \nover the next 20 years.\n  No matter how you look at this--my good friend the majority leader \nsays this is necessary to save the planet--no matter how you look at \nit, it is an important bill. This is an important bill. This is no \nsmall bill, and we are being put in the position, with the tree being \nfilled tonight and with cloture being filed, to have this massive, \nsignificant bill in effect voted on without any amendments.\n  An interesting parallel--and I see my good friend the Senator from \nVirginia, who is actually a supporter of this bill and a cosponsor of \nit, sitting here in the Chamber. He and I were here in 1990, as was the \nmajority leader, when we did the clean air amendments, which was a \nmajor piece of legislation. It was not as big as this bill but a big, \nimportant bill. The Democrats were in control of the House and Senate. \nThere was a Republican in the White House. How did we handle the clean \nair amendments of 1990 under George Mitchell, then the Democratic \nleader? We had 5 weeks of debate on the floor of the Senate and we had \n180 amendments. Everybody knew it was an important measure. It deserved \nthe attention and the participation of 100 Members of the Senate, not 1 \nMember--the majority leader--determining which amendments would get to \nbe offered and in the end asking the Senate to accept a procedure under \nwhich no amendments would be offered. Now, Mr. President, by any \nobjective standard, that is not a serious effort to legislate. You \ncan't cram a measure of this magnitude down the throat of the Senate or \nthe American people with that little scrutiny or observation.\n  With regard to the notion that somehow everybody had a chance to look \nat this bill, we got it at 11:15 this morning--the substitute at 11:15 \nthis morning. You could argue that the vast majority of the Members on \nthis side of the aisle were reading it for the first time along with \nthe clerks. So this hasn't been laying around for months. The idea that \nwe would go to such a measure may have been around for a while, and it \nwas--and the majority leader did indicate we would go to this bill \nafter the Memorial Day recess, but what was going to be in it? We \nlearned about that this morning.\n  Thirdly, with regard to nominations, we were prepared to move a \nnominations package tonight, but the nominations package that was \npresented was basically negotiated between the Democratic majority and \nthe White House. There is another entity, and that is the Republicans \nin the Senate. We sought to make some adjustments to the nominations \npackage, which, interestingly enough, included some district judges who \nare on the Executive Calendar. Now, district judges have not typically \nbeen controversial. Are we now to believe that even district judges who \nhave come out of the committee and are on the calendar are a matter of \ncontroversy? Is there nothing on which we can agree? Is that the Senate \ntoday?\n  Somebody needs to--and I think it is incumbent upon the majority \nleader and myself--to restore a certain level of comity around here so \nwe can function. How in the world did the situation deteriorate to the \npoint where district judges who have been reported out of the committee \nand are sitting here on the calendar are a matter of controversy?\n  That is where we are as of the evening of June 4, and I think we need \nto have some serious discussions off the floor of the Senate as to how \nwe can unravel the problems that have been created by the mistreatment \nof the circuit judge nominations of the President of the United States. \nI think we need to remind ourselves that when we make commitments to \nour colleagues here in the Senate, they need to be kept. And it is time \nto stop this sort of spiral downward that has developed as a result of \nthe apparent refusal to make any serious effort to keep commitments \nwhich have been made, which colleagues depend on, and which are \nessential to the Senate functioning the way it needs to function.\n  Mr. President, one final observation about the underlying bill. We \nhave enjoined the debate on this bill and would love to be able to \namend it. We think it is not a 1-week bill; we think it is\n\n[[Page S5022]]\n\nclearly a multiweek bill. If the Clean Air Act of 1990 was a 5-week \nbill, this is certainly at least a month bill. And at whatever point \nthe majority gets serious about climate change legislation, then we \nneed to set aside enough time to give the entire Senate an opportunity \nfirst of all to read it and, second, to offer serious amendments to the \nmeasure.\n  I think probably enough has been said today about where we are. \nHopefully, tomorrow, after a good night's sleep, we can take a look at \nall these matters and see if we can get the Senate back on track to \ndevelop a level of comity necessary for us to function in the way in \nwhich the Senate has historically functioned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would hope my friend the distinguished \nRepublican leader would stay on the floor a brief time. The chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee is here, the Democratic assistant leader is \nhere, and they have a few things to say and I have a few things to say.\n  Mr. President, let me say, first of all, with all due respect to my \nfriend the distinguished Republican leader, the substitute has been \naround for 2 weeks. The summary has been around. Anyone who had a \nquestion about this, all they had to do was call Senator Boxer, Senator \nLieberman, or Senator Warner. They know this bill upside and downside. \nSo to say they just got it today, that is how we do things here; the \nsummary has been around a couple of weeks. Anyone who wanted to see the \nguts of the bill could look at it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the leader yield just for an observation?\n  Mr. REID. I will in a short time, but let me also say this. I only \npoint this out to show how Orwellian my friend's statements are. They \nwish they could offer amendments on the bill? Now, think about that for \na minute. Why aren't we offering amendments on the bill? Because they \nwon't let us. We have tried working, as I have indicated, in every \npossible way--two amendments, germane, relevant, five amendments. No.\n  So I would also say, with judges, let the world understand that there \nis no crisis in the judiciary. The Federal judiciary vacancy rate is \nthe lowest it has been in decades--not a few days, weeks, months, \nyears--decades.\n  I, with the consent and understanding of my friend, Pat Leahy, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, pledged that I would use my good \nfaith to have the Senate consider three court of appeals nominees \nbefore the Memorial Day recess. I didn't say who they would be. And we \ntried very hard.\n  I stated explicitly that we couldn't guarantee--and that is in the \nrecord--I couldn't guarantee the outcome because it depended on factors \nbeyond my control. The Senate did in fact confirm Virginia Supreme \nCourt Judge Steven Agee to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in May. \nIn addition, Chairman Leahy expedited Judiciary Committee consideration \nof two seats to the Michigan Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in light of \nthe pledge I made. These nominations were the result of many years of \nnegotiations between the White House and Michigan Senators. This has \nbeen going on for 6 years.\n  Unfortunately, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee objected to \nexpedited consideration of the Michigan nominees. One of them had \nalready been approved to be a Federal district court judge. This is now \nto be a circuit court judge. He already had an ABA approval of high \nranking, high approval. They said: No, we want the ABA findings again \nbefore we are allowed to do anything. As a result, it was impossible to \nhave the Senate consider these two additional nominees before the \nrecess, despite my best efforts.\n  We have treated President Bush's judicial nominations with far \ngreater deference than President Clinton was afforded by a Republican-\ncontrolled Senate. Mr. President, 70 Clinton nominees were denied \nhearings or floor consideration. Three-quarters of President Bush's \ncourt of appeals nominees have been confirmed while only half of \nPresident Clinton's appellate nominations were confirmed. My friend \nsays what goes around comes around. We are not following that because \nwe believe we should not treat them like they treated us. I said that a \nlong time ago, and we have not. We have been generous in what we have \ndone. The lowest vacancy rate in the Federal system for decades is what \nwe now have.\n  Last year the Senate confirmed 40 judges, more than during any of the \nthree previous years with Republicans in charge. Let me say to my \nfriend, and I am going to yield to the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee--let me say to my friend, the distinguished Republican \nleader: Everyone knows, even though it sometimes has been painful for \nall of us, that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee wants a \nrecorded vote on these judges. That has been a standard rule that we \nhave had.\n  We have three on the calendar, and I understand two more you reported \nout today, or very recently. We have five district court judges. I say \nto my friend, the Judiciary Committee member who takes as much guff as \nany Member of the Senate because of this committee, he has the most \nsensitive issues that come before this body, and he holds up very well \nand is a patient man. But as I say, I ask the question through the \nChair to my friend: Has anyone come to you in the last week and said \nthey wanted to do a district court judge?\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield without losing his right to the \nfloor, nobody has. In fact, as I listen to this colloquy, I was \nwondering what was going on until I read in the Washington Times the \nRepublican fixation on judges is part of an effort to bolster Senator \nJohn McCain's standing among conservatives--which is unfortunate; to \nbring in the judiciary, the independent Federal judiciary, and make \nthem a political tool.\n  I was reminded once when my children were young, one of them asked \nme, they said: Dad, what is the expression ``crocodile tears''? I tried \nto explain to them what crocodile tears are, and I couldn't help but \nthink tonight, listening to our good friends on the other side--if my \nchildren were still young, I would say: There, now you understand what \ncrocodile tears are.\n  We had, last year--and the distinguished leader has referred to this; \nthe Democrats were in charge, me as chairman, Senator Reid as majority \nleader--we reported 40 judicial nominations to the Senate, and all 40 \nwere confirmed each of the 3 years prior, with a Republican majority, \nRepublican chairman. That is more than they did.\n  It is interesting, in fact, since President Bush has been in office \nthis is the third time we have been in the majority--one of those times \nvery briefly. Republicans have been in the majority three times. Guess \nwho moved----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Did the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I can answer my question----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Parliamentary inquiry: Is it permissible to yield for \na statement?\n  Mr. LEAHY. To further answer the question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is it permissible to yield----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may only yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is a question being asked by the Senator from Vermont?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not ask how the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky would define crocodile tears, but I ask this \nquestion of the distinguished majority leader: Was he aware that during \nthe time when Democrats have been in charge, during President Bush's \ntenure, we have confirmed judges at a faster pace than when the \nRepublicans were in charge? Was the distinguished majority leader aware \nof that?\n  Mr. REID. There is no question about that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, just one other point, if I might. Was the \nmajority leader aware that on at least a couple of occasions, for \ncircuit court of appeals judges, when I came back from Vermont during a \nrecess to hold a hearing at the request of Republicans because they \nwere anxious to get these court of appeals judges through, that the \nRepublicans then criticized me for coming back and holding the hearings \nand getting them confirmed? Is the leader aware of that?\n  Mr. REID. I very definitely am.\n  Mr. President, let me say this. I would say through the Chair to my \nfriend, the distinguished Republican leader, the district court judges, \nthe\n\n[[Page S5023]]\n\nfirst I heard about them was tonight, whatever time it was--late this \nevening. Senator Leahy and I are happy to take a look at these district \ncourt judges. We will work together and see what can be done with them. \nBut I say to my friend, I would hope that you would reconsider taking \nus at our word. We will take a look at the district court judges. \nSenator Leahy has said he has never been talked to about it. I never \nhave been. We focused on the circuit court judges. I say to my friend, \nyou want to talk about ``let's get back to doing things the way we used \nto,'' let's do the Executive Calendar. And the district court judges, \nwe will take a look at those.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am aware of the rules of the Senate. Three judges on \nthe calendar have been there since April 24. These are not people who \njust popped out of the committee yesterday.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been here for a long time--with \nSenator Daschle, I was here on the floor for 6 years. I have been here \nfor almost 4 years now in my capacity as Democratic leader. The \nstandard operating procedure--and this is in the hearing range of the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee who was the ranking member \nduring part of that time--it always happened. Somebody brings to our \nattention: We have a judge. Can you help me with it? We don't \nautomatically do the judges.\n  Nobody asked me. We never worked that way with the judges. We have a \nvery heavy calendar, and Senator Leahy--and I support it every step of \nthe way. We don't do it in wrap-up. We have votes on these judges.\n\n  I say to my friend, the Republican leader, we will be happy to look \nat the district court judges. In the entire conversations we have had \ndealing with circuit court judges--I understand why they are probably \nmore important than district court judges. They are all lifetime \nappointments, a pretty good deal.\n\n  I hope he would take us at our word, and we will work to try to move \nthrough these at some reasonable fashion and get these done because if \nwe don't do it tonight, tomorrow somebody is going to object to \nsomething else. I don't think you lose one----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Can I further inquire of the majority leader, what \ndoes ``take a look at'' mean?\n  Mr. REID. First of all, I literally mean that. I don't know what \nStates they are from. I don't know whether the Senators are Democrats, \nRepublicans, States with both. We have not let that stand in our way in \nthe past with district court judges, but there may be somebody who \ndoesn't like one of them for some reason. You know how things go around \nhere. I can't imagine it would be all of them.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would ask my friend further, are district judges now \ncontroversial, too, particularly those who have been reported out of \nthe committee and been on the calendar for 6 weeks or so?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it was just shown to me by my valiant \nstaff--we have a judge from Virginia. We have Warner and we have Webb \nfrom Virginia. They get along very well. I am sure that is something we \nwill take a look at. Missouri, the Senators there work well together. \nWe have another Senator from Mississippi--these are things we can take \na look at. I can say--we are not here under oath, but I never heard of \nthese judges until just now. We will take a look at them. I can't see \nwhy we can't work out something and get them approved in the next \nlittle bit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the distinguished majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is the leader aware this is the first I heard that anybody \nwanted to? Not a single member of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the \nRepublican side even raised to me that they wanted to move forward with \nthem. Is the distinguished majority leader aware that when the \nRepublicans were in the majority, when they had judges they wanted \nmoved they usually waited to put them on until after the request had \ncome from our side to put them on? Was the leader aware of that? Was \nthe leader aware of the fact that nobody--nobody--has raised this? In \nfact, the first I heard about it was an hour ago.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the Republican leader, we have no \nintention of stalling, not taking care of district court judges. But \nlet us take a look at them. I don't know if there is some--I don't \nknow. They are reported out of the committee, they are on the floor, \nthere should be no problems with them, and we will do our best to look \nat them. But I say to my friend, these things I want to get done \ntonight--this is a Cabinet officer. We have a man, Jim Glassman, Under \nSecretary of State, who--the President's Chief of Staff says he is \ngoing to withdraw his name. He is tired of waiting. He has to get a job \nsomeplace. I want to get these done.\n  As I say, there are some 80 of them or more. We will work on these. I \ntell you I would even give my friend, the Republican leader--Senator \nLeahy and I will work on these three district court judges. I read the \nnames. We will try to do them in the next week or so. OK?\n  Mr. LEAHY. As I said, at least I would like to discuss them with the \nranking member.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My assumption is if they are on the calendar and made \nit out of the committee, they are not controversial. How about \nscheduling a vote? We don't have to do it tomorrow. Can we even \nschedule one?\n  Mr. REID. The Republican leader said we want to work the way we used \nto in the Senate. Take our word for it. We are not trying to deep six \nthese people. This is the first time I ever heard about it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the many challenges the majority leader \nhas, and a lot of difficult people. Sometimes cats are hard to herd, as \nTrent Lott used to say. But the deal and the concern was so great--if I \ncould ask the majority leader--what about the understanding we thought \nexisted that there would be confirmed an average number of circuit \ncourt of appeals judges this Congress, which would be 17 or so \nnominees? Is that still afoot or is that somehow being forgotten? We \nhear talk that maybe few if any more circuit judges will be confirmed. \nThat is what has caused a great deal of angst on this side of the \naisle.\n  Mr. REID. We committed to do the three judges. We got one done. We \nwill do our best to get two done. But we have been held up doing that \nas the member of the Judiciary Committee understands. We had to wait \nfor the ABA report to come in again. I don't know where that stands, \nbut we are moving forward on those, and we are going to try to do our \nvery best to get those done as soon as we can.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the majority leader will yield, that wasn't \nprecisely my question. The overall question is--and there are quite a \nnumber of judges pending, and more should be moved out of committee if \nthere is not a blockage going on. Are we going to reach--is it the \nmajority leader's intention to reach the average as we thought an \nunderstanding existed to do?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I try to be a very patient man. I know my \nfriend, whom I complimented publicly on the floor, didn't mean what he \nsaid this morning about me.\n  I am sure if that were brought to his attention, he would ask that to \nbe taken from the Record because it is in violation of the rules; \nbasically, that I was clueless. I am sure he did not mean that, but \nthat is what he said. And people said it is a violation of rule XIX.\n  I say first to my friend from Alabama, he said that. Was it something \nhe did not really mean, that I was clueless? Because that is an insult. \nI would ask my friend, did you really mean that I was clueless?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If I was violating a rule or saying anything to insult \nthe majority leader, I would apologize because I do respect the \nmajority leader. He always treated me fairly, as I think he does most \npeople in the Senate. I think he is so recognized.\n  But we have a difficult challenge. But my response, the reason I was \na little bit aggressive on that was because the majority leader knows \nthat on Monday afternoon in his speech, he was very hard on the \nRepublican leader, Senator McConnell, and he said\n\n[[Page S5024]]\n\nsome things about him that I thought went too far because I guess we \nwere involved in some big important issues and we are all a little bit \ntense about that.\n  Mr. REID. I want to be careful. It is late tonight. I certainly do \nnot want to get involved in any friction. I appreciate what my friend \nsaid because even though he and I disagree on a lot of things, I do not \nknow of a Member of the Senate who is more sincere in what he does than \nthe Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Can I ask a question, and maybe we can make some \nprogress here? If we can schedule some of these I think completely \nnoncontroversial district judges--the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee is here. We would like to move the nominations package.\n  Mr. REID. Let me say to my friend the Republican leader----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We are not talking about clearing the judges in \nconnection with this package, we are talking about scheduling votes, \nand the man you have to clear it with is right there.\n  Mr. REID. They are on the calendar. Let me say this one thing to my \nfriend. We have a Judiciary Committee member here. I pride myself in \nnot running my committees. Some leaders have tried to do that; I do not \ndo that. I want to do the best I can in moving circuit court judges, \nand we have done fairly well in very trying circumstances.\n  So I say to my friend the Senator from Alabama, I have made a \ncommitment to do three circuit court judges. I will live up to that to \nthe best of my ability. I said prior to the May recess: I cannot \nguarantee that, but I am going to do my best. I think that it is \nsomething Senator Leahy and I have to move forward on.\n  I ask my friend and I say to the Republican leader, trust us on this. \nI said publicly here that we will do something to try to schedule these \nwithin the next week. We have a few important things, but that does not \ntake long to do that--an hour, an hour and a half.\n  I ask my friend the Judiciary Committee chairman whether we can work \nto try to get some votes scheduled on these three whom I noted in the \nnext week.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Well, Mr. President, to answer the distinguished leader, \nas I always assume the Republican leader to do because this has been \nthe practice, certainly as long as he has been in the Senate--perhaps \nhe has forgotten--is that the chairman of these committees sets a time \nfor a vote, and it is almost always, as a matter of courtesy, at least, \ndiscussed with the ranking minority member. I realize the hour is late \nand the Republican leader may have forgotten that. But it has been my \npractice to always discuss the time of the vote with the ranking \nmember, as he did with me when he was chairman.\n  To answer the majority leader's question, of course I will be happy \nto talk with the distinguished ranking member of the committee and find \ntime when they might be scheduled. I might point out, each one of those \nwas expedited.\n  I would ask two brief questions--and then I will leave--of the \ndistinguished majority leader. Was he aware that, when talking \nstatistics, I committed not to follow the precedent of the Republicans \nwhen President Clinton was the President, their precedent of pocket \nfilibustering over 60 of President Clinton's nominees? Was the \ndistinguished majority leader aware that I will not follow that \nprecedent and we will not pocket filibuster 60 or anywhere near that?\n  Mr. REID. I would answer my friend in addition to that, the Thurmond \nRule is after June 1. There is no Thurmond Rule, is there?\n  Mr. LEAHY. He is right.\n  I ask the leader one last question on why I mentioned the Washington \nTimes story about the motivation for this. Was he aware that one of the \ncircuit court nominees whom we held up for a number of appropriate \nreasons--that even after that nominee was convicted of criminal fraud \nthat occurred while his nomination was pending, we were still \ncriticized for holding up that nominee? It is kind of you are damned if \nyou do and damned if you don't.\n  Mr. REID. I say, we will get this done.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think we are close to an understanding here that \nallows us to clear this nominations package. You have your chairman \nhere, and I am authorized to speak for the ranking member on this \nissue.\n  Did the majority leader say, in consultation with his chairman, that \nwe could expect to schedule these votes within the next week or so on \nthese noncontroversial district court judges?\n  Mr. REID. That is what I said.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Then I think we have reached an understanding that \nwould certainly lead me to think we ought to go forward with the \nnominations package you have been working on with the administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5024-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5024-S5026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, difficult day. Tomorrow is not going to be \nthat easy either. We are almost into the morrow, in another minute or \nso. Hopefully, tomorrow will be less contentious. There are some \ndifficult things we have to work through tomorrow. But hopefully we \nwill get the farm bill passed again, we will have some good debate on \nglobal warming.\n  Everyone knows I have moved to the Energy bill to see what is with \nthat. I would hope we can move forward--we have 3 more weeks left in \nthis work period--and get some things done. We have some extremely \nimportant things to get done, not only the global warming thing, we \nhave the bill that the Democrats and Republicans want to do extending a \nnumber of tax extensions which has to be done. Part of it includes \nthings related to global warming and renewable energy. We have a \ndoctor's Medicare fix and some other things that are extremely \nimportant we have to do this work period. Senators Shelby and Dodd have \nworked out an agreement on housing and reported it out of the Banking \nCommittee on a 9-to-2 vote. So I would hope we can move forward. I am \ndisappointed in today.

I was hoping that I could engage my friend the majority \nleader as the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nHe has entrusted me, and my colleagues have, and I do not think we \nshould leave here without me asking you a couple of questions because I \nthink people who were watching this debate were very confused. I wanted \nto make sure I ask a series of questions to my friend, and then we will \nall go home because it is time to go home.\n  We expected to have a robust debate on the global warming bill and \nfinally get this country off of fossil fuel, off of foreign oil, off of \nbig oil. And we found that although my understanding was the majority \nleader had no idea about this, the Republican side, of course, forced \nthe clerks to read the amendment, which took us 6 to 7 hours or so and \ntook us all the way into the night; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I have had the good fortune to be \nchairman of your committee twice; one of them was a very short period \nof time because we were in the majority for a little while. It is a \nwonderful committee, and I do\n\n[[Page S5027]]\n\nnot know of a better committee in the whole Congress--so many important \nthings to do and deal with. Not only is the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, who represents almost 40 million people--she is a person \nwho is suited to be the chairman of this committee like no other \ncommittee chairman we have ever had. I know where your heart is. I have \nknown you for 26 years. We came here in 1982 together. And this piece \nof legislation--you worked on it on a bipartisan basis--is a good piece \nof legislation. Is it perfect? The chairman acknowledged it is not a \nperfect bill.\n  But I would only say to the chairman of the Committee, I do not think \nthe American people are confused at all. I think they know what has \nhappened. We have seen today a situation where we have read into the \nRecord the Republican's play book; that is, they are playing political \ngames, they are stalling, they do not want to deal with the most \nimportant issues we face in the world today--global warming. They want \nto wait, hoping above hope that something will happen in November and \nthat they will be in the majority.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Isn't it true that as a result of these dilatory tactics \nand slowing us down and making us waste 30 hours to proceed, to get to \na motion to proceed and then doing all this, isn't it true it puts us \ninto a terrible bind here? We know the days have to be filled with \nlegislative work. They have stopped work to fight for the status quo. \nThey have stopped us in our tracks on this issue. I guess what I would \nlike to say, yes, we will go to a vote. Because the Republicans don't \nseem--there is a few of them over there who help us, but most of them \nwon't help us. We may not be able to move forward on this bill. At this \nlate time of night, I ask the majority leader to comment, and that will \nbe the end of my questions, I know there are a lot of people out there \nwho are still up and watching, believe me, especially a lot of people \nin your home State and my home State. They understand this. They \nunderstand what is happening. Eighty-nine percent of the people polled \nsaid: Do something about global warming. The faith-based groups want \nit. The scientists are telling us this is right.\n  Tomorrow or I should say later today, we will have an amazing press \nconference with John Warner, myself and others, with former military \npeople testifying to the fact that global warming is one of the looming \nthreats to our national security. Still, the other side would stop us \nfrom getting to energy independence, stopping us from getting off \nforeign oil, stopping us from getting off big oil and using these \nludicrous arguments about gas prices when, under George Bush's watch \nand their watch, gas prices went up 250 percent in 7 years and, in less \nthan 1 year, 82 cents. It is ridiculous.\n  I hope the people hearing us tonight will pick up their phones and \ncall their Senators first thing in the later hours of the morning and \ntell them to vote yes to allow this debate to move forward.\n  I thank my leaders, my majority leader and the assistant majority \nleader, for their courage in scheduling this, for standing up for the \nAmerican people, and for doing everything they could to get us to a \nfull debate. If we don't have it now, we will have it when we have a \nPresident in the White House--and you know where I come down on that \none--who is going to send over a bill here, and we will get started on \nthis work and get it done.\n  I guess, because I have to ask the question, I will ask you, my \nfriend, if you look forward to that day.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, if not now, when? If not now, when are \nwe going to debate this most important issue? I feel very good that \nthis committee, led by Senator Boxer, was able to report out of that \ncommittee, under the most trying circumstances, because of the courage \nof one Republican by the name of John Warner of Virginia, was able to \nget enough votes to put this bill on the floor. I go to the playbook of \nthe Republicans on this. Listen to this:\n\n       The focus is much more on making political points than \n     amending the bill.\n\n  I didn't make this up. That is what they said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Because it is after midnight and the staff has gone \nthrough so much today reading this bill, I will make my comments brief. \nIt is hard to believe how much time we wasted today when we could have \nbeen considering the global warming bill and passing and considering \nimportant amendments. Now we find ourselves past midnight, after \nwasting hour after hour, when the Republican minority asked the \namendment be read, every word of it read into the record, when that was \ntotally unnecessary, an amendment which was available to us days ago, \nat least in summary form weeks ago, a total waste of time. It is a \ncontinued effort by the Republican side of the aisle to slow down and \nstop any effort to make progress on legislation people care about \nacross America.\n  It is all their party has left. GOP stands for graveyard of progress. \nThey don't want us to do anything. Today they wasted an entire day of \nthe Senate.\n  I will close by saying, what troubles me the most is that the \nRepublican minority leader would come to the floor with this sense of \nurgency about three district court Federal judges, a sense of urgency, \nyet does not share that same sense of urgency about the global warming \nthat is changing the world we live in. The world will little note nor \nlong remember those three judges, as good as they may be individually, \nbut it will remember that we wasted an entire day and perhaps wasted \nour best efforts this session to take up the single most important \nissue for the survival of the planet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will add my thoughts that it is an \nimportant issue for us to deal with, global warming, and energy \nsecurity and elimination of pollution and a healthy economy not being \ndamaged by excessive imports of oil or high prices of oil. We wish to \ndeal with that. This bill is a tremendously large bill that dwarfs the \nprior Clean Air Act of 1990 in significance. I wish to say what \nhappened tonight was the majority leader, utilizing the power of his \nrecognition, has now filled the tree and not one amendment can be \noffered, as I understand the procedures, he does not agree to. When we \ndid the Clean Air Act, some 200 or more amendments were offered, 5 \nweeks was spent on it, and 130 amendments, as I recall, were disposed \nof in some fashion. So we have this tremendous bill we want to talk \nabout.\n  I would suggest it is as plain as day that as people learn more about \nit, they are going to be even more concerned than they are today and \nless supportive of it and hostile to it. That is why it looks to me \nlike an effort is under way to put the Republican Members who would \nlike to offer amendments and discuss the bill in a position where they \nhave no realistic possibility to do so in a meaningful way. This will \nend with a whimper. The bill can be withdrawn because the majority does \nnot want to stay on it because they can't defend the massive nature of \nit, the incredible intervention into the economy by Washington \nbureaucracies that will be created, the trillions of dollars that will \nhave to be raised through this cap and trade, which is nothing more \nthan a way to tax carbon. I wish to protest a moment. We know what is \nhappening. Anybody who is sophisticated here knows this bill is not \ngoing to pass. It is losing what support it had. An effort is underway \nby the Democratic majority to figure a way to pull the bill and then \nblame the Republicans because we want to talk about it, and we want to \nentertain a discussion about it. We wish to offer amendments to make it \nbetter. That is the truth.\n  It disturbs me a little bit to hear the comments that have been made \nearlier. I know we have had a long day. But I wish to make clear this \nis not an itty-bitty issue. This is a tremendous issue of great \nimportance, both to the world, our economy, and to the environment. We \nneed to do better. We can do better. I hope maybe in the morning things \nwill be in a better posture. I don't think, with regard to the cap-and-\ntrade bill, that the majority is going to want to see it go forward. \nThat indicates a lack of confidence in their own legislation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Record speaks for itself. First, the Republicans \ninsisted on the entire 30 hours, that the 30 hours be set aside for \ngeneral debate on the bill before we could reach an amendment. We gave \nthem their 30 hours for general debate and asked them during that \nperiod of time to produce the list of amendments that they wanted to \nconsider on the bill. We gave them a list of amendments we would start \nwith. The first was a bipartisan amendment, Senators Biden and Lugar. \nWhen we asked them for amendments to the bill, once again, they failed \nto produce the list. It was very clear what was going on.\n  Then they proceeded, unfortunately, to tax the energy and stamina of \nthe staff by having them read every word of the bill into the record, a \ncomplete waste of time. First, we burned off 30 hours in general debate \nwith no amendments being produced by the Republican side. Then they \ncame to the floor and took another 5 or 6 hours, maybe more, for the \nstaff to read this into the record. This was not a good-faith effort in \namending the bill or even debating the bill. That, unfortunately, is a \nreflection of what we have seen over and over and over, a record number \nof filibusters, a record number of Republican attempts to stop or slow \ndown the debate on pending legislation. It is because, of course, they \ndon't want us to see us enact legislation. They don't want to see us \naddress the issues of the day. They are hoping this Congress will be as \nunproductive as the last Republican Congress.\n  We are not going to let that happen. We are still going to fight for \nimportant legislation. On this particular bill, on a global warming \nbill, we will have another vote. But if it goes down, if it doesn't \nmove forward, it is because the Republicans are following their \nstrategy that has been read into the Record, a strategy which focuses, \nas they say, ``much more on making political points than amending the \nbill.''\n  That is their strategy. It has been made a part of the Record. It is \nvery clear what has happened.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5028-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr President, I am pleased to acknowledge a significant \nmilestone this week in Chicago's bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympic \nand Paralympic Games.\n  On Wednesday, June 4, the International Olympic Committee announced \nthat it had selected Chicago as one of the four finalists for 2016.\n  The Chicago 2016 organizers, the U.S. Olympic Committee, and the \npeople of Chicago deserve praise for a job well done.\n  Because of their fine efforts, Chicago is well prepared to face stiff \ncompetition from the three remaining cities--Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, \nand Tokyo.\n  Chicago is a diverse city with culture and history to inspire people \naround the world. From our beautiful downtown parks to magnificent \nlakefront to terrific sports venues, Chicago is a world-class city that \nhas what it takes to bring the Olympics back to the Midwest for the \nfirst time in over 100 years.\n  Last October, Chicago demonstrated its ability to host a major \ninternational sporting event, when 557 boxers and several thousand \nother visitors from more than a hundred countries traveled to Chicago \nfor the World Boxing Championships, a qualifying event for this \nsummer's Beijing Olympics.\n  Many of these people were first-time visitors who hadn't known what \nto expect going in, but who fell in love with the city. Those of us who \nknow Chicago, who have lived and worked there, were not at all \nsurprised by the visitors' rave reviews.\n  As the Chicago 2016 organizing committee has so eloquently put it:\n\n       Chicago is built on a bold tradition of dreams that we turn \n     into reality. From rebuilding our city to even greater glory \n     after the 1871 Fire, hosting the World's Columbian Exposition \n     and the 1933 World's Fair and transforming an old rail yard \n     into Millennium Park, dreaming and achieving is part of \n     Chicago's DNA.\n\n  The U.S. Government is working on several fronts to help support the \nU.S. bid. The Departments of State and Homeland Security are working to \nmake the travel of legitimate Olympic athletes, coaches, and fans as \nsmooth and hassle-free as possible.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently held a hearing on \nratification of the United Nations Convention Against Doping in Sport. \nThe International Olympic Committee expects adherence to this \nConvention by countries that will host future Olympic Games.\n  I look forward to working with the Chicago 2016 organizing committee, \nthe U.S. Olympic Committee, and my colleagues here in Congress as we \nmove forward over the next 16 months preparing for the IOC's final \ndecision in October 2009.\n  Again, I congratulate the great city of Chicago on its achievements \nto date, and I look forward to welcoming the 2016 Olympics to Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5028-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WILLIAM T.

I was hoping to be here in time to cast my \nvote in favor of this agreement, but I was a few minutes late. I want \nmy colleagues to know, and the record to reflect, that I was paying \nlast respects to one of Delaware's finest citizens and a man who was a \ngood friend to me for the past four decades. I am speaking of William \nT. ``Bill'' McLaughlin, also known as ``Mr. Mayor,'' who passed away \nlast Friday. He presided as Mayor of Wilmington from 1977 to 1984 and \nshaped it as the financial center it is today.

CON. RES. 21\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 308(a) of S. Con. Res. 21, the \n2008 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate \nlevels and limits in the resolution for energy legislation that meets \ncertain conditions, including that such legislation not worsen the \ndeficit over the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 \nor the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.\n  I find that SA 4825, a complete substitute for S. 3036, the \nLieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2008, satisfies the conditions \nof the deficit-neutral reserve fund for energy legislation. Therefore, \npursuant to section 308(a), I am adjusting the aggregates in the 2008 \nbudget resolution, as well as the allocation provided to the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S. Con.

KEYS, III\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today on a sad note--to inform \nthe Senate of the recent death of a model public servant who served our \ncountry well. John W. Keys, III, was the 16th Commissioner of the \nBureau of Reclamation. He served in that capacity from July 17, 2001, \nto April 15, 2006, and worked closely with the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources which I have the privilege of chairing. Commissioner \nKeys retired 2 years ago to return to Utah and pursue his favorite \npastimes which included flying. Tragically, he was killed on May 30, \n2008, when the airplane he was piloting crashed in Canyonlands National \nPark, UT, with one passenger aboard.\n  Commissioner Keys' appointment by President Bush to lead the Bureau \nof Reclamation was actually his second stint with the agency. He \nreturned to Federal service after previously retiring from a 34-year \ncareer with reclamation. During that time, he worked as a civil and \nhydraulic engineer in various positions throughout the western United \nStates. Ultimately, he served as reclamation's Pacific Northwest \nregional director for 12 years before his initial retirement in 1998.\n  Commissioner Keys was a dedicated public servant whose knowledge, \nexperience, and demeanor were key factors in his successful leadership \nof the Bureau of Reclamation. Those same skills, combined with his \nwillingness to work with Congress on a bipartisan basis, were \ninstrumental in addressing a wide range of water resource issues across \nthe West. He will be sorely missed, but left a legacy of \naccomplishments that will ensure that he is long-remembered. I offer my \ncondolences to his wife, Dell, and their daughters, Cathy and Robyn.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of John W. \nKeys, III, who died tragically in a plane crash on Friday, May 30, \n2008. John was a long-time Federal official, and a kind and thoughtful \nman.\n  John Keys was born in Sheffield, AL. He earned a bachelor's degree in \ncivil engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology and a \nmaster's degree from Brigham Young University. John was dedicated to \nhis community, and spent much of his spare time serving as a search-\nand-rescue pilot for Utah County and as a college and high school \nfootball referee.\n  The majority of John Keys' life, however, was centered on his \nmarriage to his wife Dell and his professional career at the Bureau of \nReclamation, an agency of the Department of the Interior. John spent \nnearly 40 years working with Reclamation. From 1964 to 1979, he worked \nas a civil and hydraulic engineer in the Great Basin, Missouri River \nBasin, Colorado River Basin, and Columbia River Basin. I first met John \nwhen he served as Reclamation's Pacific Northwest regional director. In \n1995, he was awarded Interior's highest honor--the Distinguished \nService Award--for maintaining open lines of communication and keeping \ninterest groups focused on solutions. After 12 years as Northwest \nregional director, John retired in 1998.\n  In 2001, John emerged from retirement to take a position as the 16th \nCommissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation. As Commissioner, John \noversaw a venerable agency charged with the operation and maintenance \nof water storage, water distribution, and electric power generation \nfacilities in 17 Western States. John placed great emphasis on \noperating and maintaining Reclamation projects to ensure continued \ndelivery of water and power benefits to the public, consistent with \nenvironmental and other requirements. He was committed to honoring \nState water rights, interstate compacts, and contracts with \nReclamation's users. This commitment helped the agency develop creative \nsolutions to address the water resource challenges of the West.\n  John had retired as Commissioner in 2006. He was a highly respected \nand dedicated public servant. I stand today to express my appreciation \nfor his service to the Northwest and to our country. I want to offer my \nsincere condolences to his wife, his daughters, and those he leaves \nbehind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5029-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5029-S5033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PAYMENTS TO PHYSICIANS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, starting last year, I started looking at \nthe financial relationships between physicians and drug companies. I \nfirst began this inquiry by examining payments from Astra Zeneca to Dr. \nMelissa DelBello, a professor of psychiatry at the University of \nCincinnati.\n  In 2002, Dr. DelBello published a study that found that Seroquel \nworked for kids with bipolar disorder. The study was paid for by Astra \nZeneca, and the following year that company paid Dr. DelBello around \n$100,000 for speaking fees and honoraria. In 2004, Astra Zeneca paid \nDr. DelBello over $80,000.\n  Today, I would like to talk about three physicians at Harvard Medical \nSchool--Drs. Joseph Biederman, Thomas Spencer, and Timothy Wilens. They \nare some of the top psychiatrists in the country, and their research is \nsome of the most important in the field. They have also taken millions \nof dollars from the drug companies.\n  Out of concern about the relationship between this money and their \nresearch, I asked Harvard and Mass General Hospital last October to \nsend me the conflict of interest forms that these doctors had submitted \nto their institutions. Universities often require faculty to fill these \nforms out so that we can know if the doctors have a conflict of \ninterest.\n  The forms I received were from the year 2000 to the present. \nBasically, these forms were a mess. My staff had a hard time figuring \nout which companies the doctors were consulting for and how much money \nthey were making. But by looking at them, anyone would be led to \nbelieve that these doctors were not taking much money. Over the last 7 \nyears, it looked like they had taken a couple hundred thousand dollars.\n  But last March, Harvard and Mass General asked these doctors to take \na second look at the money they had received from the drug companies. \nAnd this is when things got interesting. Dr. Biederman suddenly \nadmitted to over $1.6 million dollars from the drug companies. And Dr. \nSpencer also admitted to over $1 million. Meanwhile, Dr. Wilens also \nreported over $1.6 million in payments from the drug companies.\n  The question you might ask is: Why weren't Harvard and Mass General \nwatching over these doctors? The answer is simple: They trusted these \nphysicians to honestly report this money.\n  Based on reports from just a handful of drug companies, we know that \neven these millions do not account for all of the money. In a few \ncases, the doctors disclosed more money than the drug companies \nreported. But in most cases, the doctors reported less money.\n  For instance, Eli Lilly has reported to me that they paid tens of \nthousands of dollars to Dr. Biederman that he still has not accounted \nfor. And the same goes for Drs. Spencer and Wilens.\n  What makes all of this even more interesting is that Drs. Biederman \nand Wilens were awarded grants from the National Institutes of Health \nto study the drug Strattera.\n  Obviously, if a researcher is taking money from a drug company while \nalso receiving Federal dollars to research that company's product, then \nthere is a conflict of interest. That is why I am asking the National \nInstitutes of Health to take a closer look at the grants they give to \nresearchers. Every year, the NIH hands out almost $24 billion in \ngrants. But nobody is watching\n\n[[Page S5030]]\n\nto ensure that the conflicts of interest are being monitored.\n  That is why Senator Kohl and I introduced the Physician Payments \nSunshine Act. This bill will require companies to report payments that \nthey make to doctors. As it stands right now, universities have to \ntrust their faculty to report this money. And we can see that this \ntrust is causing the universities to run afoul of NIH regulations. This \nis one reason why industry groups such as PhRMA and Advamed, as well as \nthe American Association of Medical Colleges, have all endorsed my \nbill. Creating one national reporting system, rather than relying on a \nhodge-podge of state systems and some voluntary reporting systems, is \nthe right thing to do.\n  Before closing, I would like to say that Harvard and Mass General \nhave been extremely cooperative in this investigation, as have Eli \nLilly, Astra Zeneca and other companies. I ask unanimous consent that \nmy letters to Harvard, Mass General, and the NIH be printed the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 2008.\n     Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D.\n     Director, National Institutes of Health,\n     Bethesda, Maryland.\n       Dear Director Zerhouni: As a senior member of the United \n     States Senate and the Ranking Member of the Committee on \n     Finance (Committee), I have a duty under the Constitution to \n     conduct oversight into the actions of executive branch \n     agencies, including the activities of the National Institutes \n     of Health (NIH/Agency). In this capacity, I must ensure that \n     NIH properly fulfills its mission to advance the public's \n     welfare and makes responsible use of the public funding \n     provided for medical studies. This research often forms the \n     basis for action taken by the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n       Over the past number of years, I have become increasingly \n     concerned about the lack of oversight regarding conflicts of \n     interest relating to the almost $24 billion in annual \n     extramural funds that are distributed by the NIH. In that \n     regard, I would like to take this opportunity to notify you \n     about five problems that have come to my attention on this \n     matter.\n       First, it appears that three researchers failed to report \n     in a timely, complete and accurate manner their outside \n     income to Harvard University (Harvard) and Massachusetts \n     General Hospital (MGH). By not reporting this income, it \n     seems that they are placing Harvard and MGH in jeopardy of \n     violating NIH regulations on conflicts of interest. I am \n     attaching that letter for your review and consideration.\n       Second, I am requesting an update about a letter I sent you \n     last October on problems with conflicts of interest and NIH \n     extramural funding regarding Dr. Melissa DelBello at the \n     University of Cincinnati (University). In that letter, I \n     notified you that Dr. DelBello receives grants from the NIH, \n     however, she was failing to report her outside income to her \n     University.\n       Third, the Inspector General for the Department of Health \n     and Human Services Office (HHS OIG) released a disturbing \n     report last January which found that NIH provided almost no \n     oversight of its extramural funds. But your staff seemed to \n     show little interest in this report. In fact, Norka Ruiz \n     Bravo, the NIH deputy director of extramural programs was \n     quoted in The New York Times saying, ``For us to try to \n     manage directly the conflict-of-interest of an NIH \n     investigator would be not only inappropriate but pretty much \n     impossible.''\n       Fourth, I am dismayed to have read of funding provided to \n     several researchers from the Foundation for Lung Cancer: \n     Early Detection, Prevention & Treatment (Foundation). Dr. \n     Claudia Henschke and Dr. David Yankelevitz are two of the \n     Foundation's board members. As reported by The New York \n     Times, the Foundation was funded almost entirely with monies \n     from tobacco companies, and this funding was never fully \n     disclosed. Monies from the Foundation were then used to \n     support a study that appeared in The New England Journal of \n     Medicine (NEJM) back in 2006 regarding the use of computer \n     tomography screening to detect lung cancer. The NEJM \n     disclosure states that the study was supported also by NIH \n     grants held by Drs. Henschke and Yankelevitz.\n       Regarding the lack of transparency by Dr. Henschke and Dr. \n     Yankelevitz, National Cancer Institute Director John \n     Niederhuber told the Cancer Letter, ``[W]e must always be \n     transparent regarding any and all matters, real or perceived, \n     which might call our scientific work into question.''\n       The NEJM later published a clarification regarding its \n     earlier article and a correction revealing that Dr. Henschke \n     also received royalties for methods to assess tumors with \n     imaging technology. There is no evidence that the \n     Foundation's tobacco money or Dr. Henschke's royalties \n     influenced her research. But I am concerned that the funding \n     source and royalties may have not been disclosed when the NIH \n     decided to fund Dr. Henschke.\n       Fifth, I sent you a letter on April 15, outlining my \n     concerns about a report on the National Institute of \n     Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). That report found 45 \n     cases at the NIEHS where extramural grants had not receiving \n     sufficient peer review scores but were still funded. This \n     finding is yet another example that the NIH provides little \n     oversight for its extramural program.\n       Dr. Zerhouni, you faced similar scandals back in 2003 when \n     it came to light that many NIH intramural researchers enjoyed \n     lucrative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies. It took \n     you some time, but you eventually brought some transparency, \n     reform and integrity back to NIH. As you told Congress during \n     one hearing, ``I have reached the conclusion that drastic \n     changes are needed as a result of an intensive review by NIH \n     of our ethics program, which included internal fact-finding \n     as well as an external review by the Blue Ribbon Panel.''\n       NIH oversight of the extramural program is lax and leaves \n     people with nothing more than questions--$24 billion worth of \n     questions, to be exact. I am interested in understanding how \n     you will address this issue. American taxpayers deserve \n     nothing less.\n       In the interim, I ask you to respond to the following \n     requests for information and documents. In responding to each \n     request, first repeat the enumerated question followed by the \n     appropriate response. Your responses should encompass the \n     period of January 1, 2000 to April 1, 2008. I would \n     appreciate receiving responses to the following questions by \n     no later than June 18, 2008:\n       1. Please explain what actions the NIH has or will initiate \n     to provide better oversight and transparency for its \n     extramural funding program.\n       2. Please explain how often the NIH has investigated and/or \n     taken action regarding a physician's failure to report a \n     ``significant financial interest,'' as defined by NIH \n     regulation.

Since receiving notice that the University of Cincinnati \n     was provided incomplete information from Dr. DelBello \n     regarding her outside income, what steps has/will NIH take to \n     address this issue? Please be specific.\n       4. Please provide a list of all NIH grants received by Dr. \n     DelBello. For each grant, please provide the following:\n       a. Name of grant;\n       b.

Slavin,\n     President, Massachusetts General Hospital (Partners \n         Healthcare), Boston, MA.\n       Dear Drs. Faust and Slavin: The United States Senate \n     Committee on Finance (Committee) has jurisdiction over the \n     Medicare and Medicaid programs and, accordingly, a \n     responsibility to the more than 80 million Americans who \n     receive health care coverage under these programs. As Ranking \n     Member of the Committee, I have a duty to protect the health \n     of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and safeguard taxpayer \n     dollars appropriated for these programs. The actions taken by \n     thought leaders, like those at Harvard Medical School who are \n     discussed throughout this letter, often have a profound \n     impact upon the decisions made by taxpayer funded programs \n     like Medicare and Medicaid and the way that patients are \n     treated and funds expended.\n       Moreover, and as has been detailed in several studies and \n     news reports, funding by pharmaceutical companies can \n     influence scientific studies, continuing medical education, \n     and the prescribing patterns of doctors. Because I am \n     concerned that there has been little transparency on this \n     matter, I have sent letters to almost two dozen research \n     universities across the United States. In these letters, I \n     asked questions about the conflict of interest disclosure \n     forms signed by some of their faculty. Universities require \n     doctors to report their related outside income, but I am \n     concerned that these requirements are disregarded sometimes.\n       I have also been taking a keen interest in the almost $24 \n     billion annually appropriated to the National Institutes of \n     Health to fund grants at various institutions such as yours. \n     As you know, institutions are required to manage a grantee's \n     conflicts of interest. But I am learning that this task is \n     made difficult because physicians do not consistently report \n     all the payments received from drug companies.\n       To bring some greater transparency to this issue, Senator \n     Kohl and I introduced the Physician Payments Sunshine Act \n     (Act). This Act will require drug companies to report \n     publicly any payments that they make to doctors, within \n     certain parameters.\n       I am writing to try and assess the implementation of \n     financial disclosure policies of Harvard University (Harvard) \n     and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH/Partners), (the \n     Institutions). In response to my letters of June 29, October \n     25, and October 26, 2007, your Institutions provided me with \n     the financial disclosure reports that Drs. Joseph Biederman, \n     Thomas Spencer, and Timothy Wilens (Physicians) filed during \n     the period of January 2000 through June 2007.\n       My staff investigators carefully reviewed each of the \n     Physicians' disclosure forms and detailed the payments \n     disclosed. I then asked that your Institutions confirm the \n     accuracy of the information. In March 2008, your Institutions \n     then requested additional information from the Physicians \n     pursuant to my inquiry. That information was subsequently \n     provided to me.\n       In their second disclosures to your Institutions, the \n     Physicians revealed different information than they had \n     disclosed initially to your respective Institutions. On April \n     29, 2008, I received notification from Harvard Medical \n     School's Dean for Faculty and Research Integrity that he has \n     referred the cases of these Physicians to the Standing \n     Committee on Conflicts of Interest and Commitment (``Standing \n     Committee''). The Chief Academic Officer (CAO), Partners \n     HealthCare System, also wrote me that Partners will look to \n     the Standing Committee to conduct the initial factual review \n     of potential non-compliance that are contained in both the \n     Harvard Medical School Policy and the Partners Policy. In \n     addition, the CAO stated that, in addition to the Standing \n     Committee's review process, Partners will conduct its own \n     independent review of conflicts of interest disclosures these \n     Physicians submitted separately to Partners in connection \n     with publicly funded research and other aspects of Partners \n     Policy. I look forward to being updated on these reviews in \n     the near future.\n       In addition, I contacted executives at several major \n     pharmaceutical companies and asked them to list the payments \n     that they made to Drs. Biederman, Spencer, and Wilens during \n     the years 2000 through 2007. These companies voluntarily and \n     cooperatively reported additional payments that the \n     Physicians do not appear to have disclosed to your \n     Institutions.\n       Because these disclosures do not match, I am attaching a \n     chart intended to provide a few examples of the data that \n     have been reported me. This chart contains three columns: \n     payments disclosed in the forms the physicians filed at your \n     Institutions, payments revealed in March 2008, and amounts \n     reported by some drug companies.\n       I would appreciate further information to see if the \n     problems I have found with these three Physicians are \n     systemic within your Institutions.\n\n\n                     INSTITUTIONAL AND NIH POLICIES\n\n       Both Harvard and MGH/Partners have established an income de \n     minimus limit. This policy forbids researchers working at \n     your Institutions from conducting clinical trials with a drug \n     or technology if they receive payments over $20,000 from the \n     company that manufactures that drug or technology. Prior to \n     2004, the income de minimus limit established by your \n     institutions was $10,000.\n       Further, federal regulations place several requirements on \n     a university/hospital when its researchers apply for NIH \n     grants. These regulations are intended to ensure a level of \n     objectivity in publicly funded research, and state in \n     pertinent part that NIH investigators must disclose to their \n     institution any ``significant financial interest'' that may \n     appear to affect the results of a study. NIH interprets \n     ``significant financial interest'' to mean at least $10,000 \n     in value or 5 percent ownership in a single entity.\n       Based upon information available to me, it appears that \n     each of the Physicians identified above received grants to \n     conduct studies involving atomoxetine, a drug that sells \n     under the brand name Strattera. For example:\n       In 2000, the NIH awarded Dr. Biederman a grant to study \n     atomoxetine in children. At that time, Dr. Biederman \n     disclosed that he received less than $10,000 in payments from \n     Eli Lilly & Company (Eli Lilly). But Eli Lilly reported that \n     it paid Dr. Biederman more than $14,000 for advisory services \n     that year--a difference of at least $4,000.\n       In 2004, the NIH awarded Dr. Wilens a 5-year grant to study \n     atomoxetine. In his second disclosure to your Institutions, \n     Dr. Wilens revealed that he received $7,500 from Eli Lilly in \n     2004. But Eli Lilly reported to me that it paid Dr. Wilens \n     $27,500 for advisory services and speaking fees in 2004--a \n     difference of about $20,000.\n       It is my understanding that Dr. Wilens' NIH-funded study of \n     atomoxetine is still ongoing. According to Eli Lilly, it paid \n     Dr. Wilens almost $65,000 during the period January 2004 \n     through June 2007. However, as of March 2008, and based upon \n     the documents provided to us to date, Dr. Wilens disclosed \n     payments of about half of the amount reported by Eli Lilly \n     for this period. Dr. Wilens also did three other studies of \n     atomoxetine in 2006 and 2007.\n       I have also found several instances where these Physicians \n     apparently received income above your institutions' income de \n     minimus limit. For instance, in 2003, Dr. Spencer conducted a \n     study of atomoxetine in adolescents. At the time, he \n     disclosed no significant financial interests related to this \n     study. But Eli Lilly reported paying Dr. Spencer over $25,000 \n     that year.\n       In 2001, Dr. Biederman disclosed plans to begin a study \n     sponsored by Cephalon, Inc. At the time; Dr. Biederman \n     disclosed that he had no financial relationship with the \n     sponsor of this study. Yet, on his conflict of interest \n     disclosure, he acknowledged receiving research support and \n     speaking fees from Cephalon, Inc., but did not provide any \n     information on the amounts paid. In March 2008, Dr. Biederman \n     revealed that Cephalon, Inc. paid him $13,000 in 2001.\n       In 2005, Dr. Biederman began another clinical trial \n     sponsored by Cephalon, Inc., which was scheduled to start in \n     September 2005 and end in September 2006. Initially, Dr. \n     Biederman disclosed that he had no financial relationship \n     with the sponsor of this study. But in March 2008, Dr. \n     Biederman revealed that Cephalon, Inc. paid him $11,000 for \n     honoraria in 2005 and an additional $24,750 in 2006.\n       In light of the information set forth above, I ask your \n     continued cooperation in examining conflicts of interest. In \n     my opinion, institutions across the United States must be \n     able to rely on the representations of its faculty to ensure \n     the integrity of medicine, academia, and the grant-making \n     process. At the same time, should the Physician Payments \n     Sunshine Act become law, institutions like yours will be able \n     to access a database that will set forth the payments made to \n     all doctors, including your faculty members. Indeed at this \n     time there are several pharmaceutical and device companies \n     that are looking favorably upon the Physician Payments \n     Sunshine Bill and for that I am gratified.\n       Accordingly, I request that your respective institutions \n     respond to the following questions and requests for \n     information. For each response, please repeat the enumerated \n     request and follow with the appropriate answer.\n       1. For each of the NIH grants received by the Physicians, \n     please confirm that the Physicians reported to Harvard and \n     MGH/Partners' designated official ``the existence of [his] \n     conflicting interest.'' Please provide separate responses for \n     each grant received for the period from January 1, 2000 to \n     the present, and provide any supporting documentation for \n     each grant identified.\n       2. For each grant identified above, please explain how \n     Harvard and MGH/Partners ensured ``that the interest has been \n     managed, reduced, or eliminated?'' Please provide an \n     individual response for each grant that each doctor received \n     from January 2000 to the present, and provide any \n     documentation to support each claim.\n       3. Please report on the status of the Harvard Standing \n     Committee and additional Partners reviews of the \n     discrepancies in disclosures by Drs. Biederman, Spencer and \n     Wilens, including what action, if any, will be considered.\n       4. For Drs. Biederman, Spencer, and Wilens, please report \n     whether a determination can be made as to whether or not any \n     doctor violated guidelines governing clinical trials and the \n     need to report conflicts of interest to an institutional \n     review board (IRB). Please respond by naming each clinical \n     trial for which the doctor was the principal investigator, \n     along with confirmation that conflicts of interest were \n     reported, if possible.\n\n[[Page S5032]]\n\n       5. Please provide a total dollar figure for all NIH monies \n     annually received by Harvard and MGH/Partners, respectively. \n     This request covers the period of 2000 through 2007.\n       6.

Mr. President, in May, I joined Governor Pawlenty, \nSenator Coleman and our Minnesota Congressional Delegation, our State \nlegislators and thousands of Minnesotans in celebrating Minnesota's 150 \nyears as a State.\n  We are proud to be a State where--in the words of our unofficial poet \nlaureate Garrison Keillor--all the women are strong, all the men are \ngood-looking, and all the sesquicentennials are above average.\n  For 150 years, our State has been built by people who knew they had \nto work hard, had to be bold, and had to persevere--to overcome the \nadversities and hardships that confronted them.\n  Each one of us here is a part of Minnesota's illustrious history. And \neach one of us has our own story about our Minnesota heritage.\n  Mine has its roots in the rough and tumble Iron Range, where my \ngrandpa worked 1,500 feet underground in the mines of Ely. He and my \ngrandma graduated from high school, but they saved money in a coffee \ncan to send my dad to college. The little house they lived in all their \nlives they got when the mine closed down in Babbitt. They loaded it on \nthe back of a flatbed truck and dynamited out a hole for the basement \nin Ely. The only problem was my grandpa used too much dynamite and the \nneighbor's wash went down a block away from all the flying rocks.\n  I told the story up north a while back and some old guy stood up and \nyelled out, ``As if we don't remember!'' They have long memories up on \nthe Range.\n  Today is a day to remember that Minnesota is recognized and admired \nboth for our natural beauty and our hard-working people.\n  We are home to the headwaters of the Mississippi River and to Lake \nSuperior, the ``greatest'' of the Great Lakes.\n  We are home to native peoples whose history stretches far before our \nstatehood.\n  We are the State that mined the iron ore for America's ships and \nskyscrapers.\n  We are the home to Fortune 500 companies that lead the way in \ninnovation--bringing the world everything from the pacemaker to the \nPost-It Note.\n  We are home to hospitals and medical institutions that heal the sick \nfrom around the world.\n  And we are now a national leader in the renewable energy that will \npower our future.\n  For 150 years, we have served our country with great honor. Back in \nthe Civil War, it was the First Minnesota that held the line during the \nBattle of Gettysburg, preventing a breach in the Union lines. The price \nthis volunteer unit paid was the highest casualty rate of any military \nunit in American history, and today their flag flies here in the \nCapitol rotunda as a reminder of their bravery and sacrifice.\n  Now, the Minnesota National Guard's 34th Infantry Regiment--the famed \nRed Bulls--traces its roots to the 1st Minnesota Volunteers and they \ncontinue to honor that tradition of service to country.\n  On the sports field, we are home to the 1987 and 1991 World Series \nChampion Minnesota Twins.\n  It was a Minnesotan, Herb Brooks, who coached the U.S. Hockey Team to \nthe gold medal in the 1980 Winter Olympics--the ``Miracle on Ice.''\n  Of course, after years of anguish, my dad, still an avid sports fan, \ncontinues to ask if the Vikings will ever win the Super Bowl.\n  We brought the world music legends from Bob Dylan to Prince to \n``Whoopie John,'' the King of Polka from New Ulm.\n  And speaking of culture, Darwin, MN, is home to the world's largest \nball of twine built by one person (my husband made me add the ``by one \nperson!''). He saw a documentary about some other ball of twine.\n  Then we have our many colorful politicians, from Senator James \nShields, who challenged Abraham Lincoln to a saber duel, to Senator \nMagnus Johnson, whose Swedish accent was so thick that his nickname \ngoing into the Senate was ``Yenerally Speaking Yohnson'', to Governor \nRudy Perpich and his polka-mass; to Governor Ventura and his feather \nboa, to Paul Wellstone and his green bus, to two of America's most \nbeloved Vice Presidents.\n  In fact, I read in a national magazine way back that ours is the only \nState where parents bounce their babies on their knees and say, ``One \nday you could grow up to be Vice President.''\n  But, Minnesota's celebration is not just about our history. It is \nalso about our future. That is why the involvement of young people is \nso important--especially our young essay winners.\n  I always think of our State as a ``work in progress.''\n  We are a State whose people have always believed--despite the cold, \nthe snow, the windswept prairies . . . Despite all that, we have always \nbelieved that anything was possible.\n  We are a State that is defined by the optimism of our people. We look \nto the future and we believe that--with hard work, education and good \nvalues--we can make tomorrow better than today.\n  I am reminded of an Ojibwe prayer passed down from the ages--the \nprayer that our leaders and our people make decisions not for their own \ngeneration but for those seven generations from now.\n  That is what that ragtag brigade of Minnesota citizen soldiers did in \n1863 when they held the line at the Battle of Gettysburg.\n  That is what Sigurd Olson was thinking as he wrote about the beauty \nof our State and this Earth and its stewardship.\n  And that is what an Iron Range miner was hoping for as he saved those \ndollars in that coffee can, never dreaming his granddaughter would end \nup in the United States Senate.\n  After 150 years, we celebrate the courage and forethought of those \nwho came before us and pray that we can live up to their expectations.\n  Happy birthday, Minnesota!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5033-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5033-S5034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING CARRIS REELS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Carris Reels \nof Rutland, VT, for receiving the 2008 ESOP Association's ``Company of \nthe Year'' award.\n  Founded in 1951 by Henry Carris, and bought by his son, Bill Carris, \nin 1980, Carris Reels sells a full line of manufactured reel products \nfor a wide variety of industries. Today, Carris Reels has about 550 \nemployee owners and\n\n[[Page S5034]]\n\neight locations nationwide. The company became 100-percent employee \nowned in January 2008.\n  One of the unique characteristics of Carris Reels is the company's \nsteering committee, which goes beyond the basic functions of most ESOP \ncommittees and takes responsibility for allocations of benefits, \nquality of work-life issues, communications, training, and governance. \nMade up of both management and corporate employees, the Committee keeps \nalive the vision of former owner Bill Carris who moved the company \ntoward employee ownership in 1995. Bill has said that organizations \nconsist of three dimensions: spiritual, emotional, and physical. The \nstrong business his family built and the employees now own is proof \npositive that these dimensions will remain a legacy at Carris Reels.\n  Carris Reels also is a strong supporter of the Vermont Employee \nOwnership Center, VEOC, a statewide nonprofit organization founded in \n2001 to provide information and resources to owners interested in \nselling their business to their employees, employee groups interested \nin purchasing a business, and entrepreneurs who wish to start up a \ncompany with broadly shared ownership. To date, the VEOC has given \ndirect assistance to over 60 Vermont businesses, employing over 1,700 \nVermonters. I applaud the VEOC for holding its Sixth Annual Employee \nOwnership Conference in Burlington later this week.\n  Once again, I congratulate all of the employees at Carris Reels for \nthis well-deserved recognition. They make great reels; they do business \nwell; and they treat their employees right--all of these \naccomplishments, I believe, are related.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of an article \nabout the award from the June 2, 2008, Rutland Herald be printed in the \nRecord so that all Senators can read about the success and admirable \nbusiness practices of this visionary Vermont company.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, June 2, 2008]\n\n               Carris Reels Wins `Company of Year' Award\n\n                           (By Bruce Edwards)\n\n       Carris Reels will occupy a special place at this week's \n     sixth annual Vermont Employee Ownership Conference in \n     Burlington.\n       The Rutland-based company was recently presented with the \n     national 2008 ESOP Company of the Year award by the ESOP \n     Association--the national trade association for companies \n     with employee stock ownership plans.\n       ``Carris Reels is an example of the value and potential \n     that employee ownership can bring to (a) company,'' J. \n     Michael Keeling, president of The ESOP Association, said in a \n     statement. ``The employee owners of Carris Reels strive to \n     make their company stronger each day and it shows in the work \n     they do and in the value they place on the individuals who \n     make up their company.''\n       Founded in 1951 by Henry Carris, the company manufactures a \n     line of reels for the wire, cable and rope industries. The \n     100-percent employee-owned company has 550 workers at eight \n     locations around the country.\n       According to Don Jamison of the Vermont Employee Ownership \n     Center, the state has the highest number of employee-owned \n     companies per capita in the country. Jamison said there are \n     approximately 10,000 ESOPs in the country, with 30 such \n     companies in Vermont and another 10 companies that are \n     workers co-operatives.\n       Jamison said one important benefit of an employee-owned \n     company is that it ensures the company stays local. ``If an \n     owner is exiting (selling) and is concerned about his or her \n     employees, it can ensure that the company will continue as it \n     has been, provided there is a new group of managers to take \n     over responsibilities.''\n       He said employee-owned companies also give a direct stake \n     to employees who reap the profits when the company performs \n     well. ``With a combination of participation and ownership, \n     you see a pretty significant boost in productivity gains,'' \n     Jamison said.\n       He also said there are tax advantages for an owner who \n     sells their company to employees with the potential of \n     getting a rollover in the capital gains tax.\n       As an example of the productivity gains that are realized \n     with an ESOP, Jamison said two recent winners of the Deane C. \n     Davis Outstanding Vermont Business Award, Resource Systems \n     Group and King Arthur Flour Co., are both majority-owned by \n     their employees.\n       Jamison said while setting up an ESOP is a complex process, \n     it can be well worth the effort in the long run for the \n     company, its employees and the owner,\n       One of the conference's workshops this week is based on a \n     Carris Reels initiative called ``Inclusive Decision-Making.''\n       ``They're really trying very hard to make their company 100 \n     percent employee governed,'' Jamison said.\n       According to the national ESOP Association, a unique \n     component of Carris Reels is its steering committee which \n     goes beyond most ESOP committees and assumes decision-making \n     for a number of functions including: allocation of benefits, \n     quality of work-life issues, communications, training and \n     governance.

BARTON\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I ask the Senate to join me \nin recognizing Dr. Thomas E. Barton on the occasion of his retirement \nas president of Greenville Technical College.\n  Dr. Barton graduated from Clemson University in 1953 with a bachelor \nof science degree and received his doctorate in higher education \nadministration from Duke University in 1972. While at Clemson, Dr. \nBarton played football under legendary coach Frank Howard. In 1987, he \nwas honored for his athletic achievements by being elected to both the \nSouth Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame and the Clemson University \nAthletic Hall of Fame.\n  After 9 years of service in the public schools of South Carolina and \nGeorgia as teacher, coach, and school superintendent, he became \npresident of Greenville Technical College in 1962. When Dr. Barton \nbegan his term as president, Greenville Tech consisted of one building \nserving 800 students. Forty-six years later, the college boasts a 42-\nbuilding, four-campus system, offering university transfer and \ntechnical programs to more than 60,000 students annually.\n  Dr. Barton was named Business Person of the Year by Greenville \nMagazine in 1995, and has consistently been chosen as one of the 50 \nmost influential residents of Greenville by the publication. He was \nalso named one of the top 25 community leaders by the Greenville News \nin 2000, 2001, and 2002. He has been awarded honorary doctorate degrees \nfrom Winthrop University, the University of South Carolina, and Clemson \nUniversity. In January 2003, he was presented with the Order of the \nPalmetto, the State's highest award for a civilian.\n  A leader in community affairs, Barton has served on the governing \nboards of the Greater Greenville Chamber of Commerce, the Historic \nGreenville Foundation, and the YMCA. He is a commissioner for the \nSouthern Association of Colleges and Schools and has chaired the board \nof directors of the Donaldson Air Force Base Museum and the South \nCarolina Technical College Presidents' Council. He has served on the \nExecutive Committee for Friends of the Greenville Hospital System, on \nthe Governor's Task Force on Education in South Carolina, and as \nhonorary chairman of the March of Dimes Team Walk for Greenville. He is \nalso an active member of the Greenville Rotary Club.\n  Dr. Barton has served his State and his community well as an educator \nand civic leader.

Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the \n125th anniversary of the founding of one of South Dakota's great \ncities, Pierre. Pierre is the capital of the State, and the county seat \nof Hughes County. Pierre boasts a robust economy and exceptional \nquality of life, and things are only getting better for this dynamic \ncity.\n  Pierre was founded in July of 1878, preceding the arrival of the \nChicago and North Western Railroads 2 years later. Taking its name from \nthe French fur trader, Pierre Chouteau, Pierre was designated the State \ncapital in 1889. Pierre's citizens are justly proud of their city's \nhistory, and they have undertaken numerous successful projects designed \nto preserve and celebrate this heritage.\n  Today, Pierre is the major trade center of central South Dakota and \nenjoys an economy mixed with government, agriculture, and plenty of \ngood hunting and fishing with nearby Oahe Dam. The Capital's many \nattractions include the Capitol Building, built in 1910, and the \nFighting Stallions, World War II, Korean, and Vietnam Memorials.\n  The 125th anniversary celebrations are to be held June 18-22, and \ninclude the 19th Annual Dakota Duck Derby, parade, fireworks, \nwatermelon eating contest, and antique car show. The Anniversary Gala \nwill bring together the current and past mayors of Pierre to reminisce \nand appreciate the history of the South Dakota capital.\n  Pierre combines the warmth and friendliness of a small town with the \nvibrancy associated with larger communities. I am pleased to recognize \nthe achievements of Pierre and to offer my congratulations to the \nresidents of the city on this historic milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5035-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF ONIDA, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 125th \nanniversary of the founding of the city of Onida, SD. As the county \nseat of Sully County, this vibrant, progressive community has been a \ncenter of commercial and civic activity since its inception.\n  The site which Onida is built on was chosen by Charles Agar, Charles \nHolmes, and Frank Brigham of Oneida NY. Within a month of raising the \nsingle place of lodging in Onida for land-seekers, the city gained a \ngrocer, hardware store, and post office. When declared the seat of \nSully County, a courthouse, permanent hotel, multiple grocers, and a \nbank were soon to follow.\n  Today, Onida is a prime example of the natural beauty and recreation \nin South Dakota that follows the Louis and Clark Trail up the Missouri \nRiver. Its business sector encompasses a wide variety of trades from \nagriculture, automotive, finance, and tourist amenities. Hunting and \nfishing are significant draws of the area, and support many local \nresorts based on such recreational activity.\n  Onida will be celebrating its quasquicentennial during the Oahe Days \nin early August. Even 125 years after its founding, Onida continues to \nbe a vital community and a great asset to South Dakota. I am proud to \npublicly honor Onida on this memorable occasion. The citizens of Onida \nare continuing to live up to their motto: miles and miles of sunflower \nsmiles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5035-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               125TH ANNIVERSARY OF ROSCOE, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ncommunity of Roscoe, SD, on reaching the 125th anniversary of its \nfounding. Located in Edmunds County, Roscoe is a rural community \ninfused with hospitality, beauty, and an exceptional quality of life.\n  Having come far since Sam Basford and Charles Purchase Morgan used a \ntent as a hotel in April 1883, Roscoe was named after Charles Morgan's \ngood friend Roscoe Conkling. The combination of Basford, Morgan, Engle, \nand Elliot's land toward the creation of Roscoe led to its importance \nas a transportation center in 1886 for the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. \nPaul Railroad. From the boom of migration westward, Roscoe persevered \nand prospered through life's trials in the great frontier.\n  Today, Roscoe is still a thriving community. There are upwards of 30 \nactive businesses operating in Roscoe, including one of the largest \nhoneybee farms in the Nation, two farm equipment dealerships, seed \ndealerships, and a post. Roscoe's school is still running, and the town \nboasts several churches and a public library.\n  The people of Roscoe celebrated this momentous occasion on the \nweekend of July 4-6. A parade, car show, and local entertainment kick \noff the celebration, with picnics, art, and games in the beautiful city \npark. One hundred and twenty five years after its founding, Roscoe \nremains a vital community and a great asset to the wonderful State of \nSouth Dakota. I am proud to honor Roscoe on this historic \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5035-4", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF GETTYSBURG, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the city of \nGettysburg, SD, and to recognize the 125th anniversary of its founding. \nSituated in Potter County, Gettysburg's history and success is a \ntestament to the great State of South Dakota.\n  Gettysburg was settled in 1883 by 200 Civil War veterans, thus \nsharing its name with the historical Pennsylvania battle. In fact, many \nstreet, township, and community names in Potter County mimic Civil War \nhistory. The Chicago and Northwestern Railroads were a significant \nboost to the Gettysburg economy, and promoted a thriving agricultural \nand economic community. Gettysburg even boasts of the first swimming \npool in the State of South Dakota being nearby.\n  The 125th anniversary celebration will be held June 27-29, kicking \noff with an all class reunion. The festivities include a parade, ping-\npong ball drop, antique car show, and banquet. For activities outside \nthe celebration weekend, the Gettysburg Country Club's fantastic golf \ncourse and Dakota Sunset Museum are a testament to the city's \nprogressive nostalgia.\n  Mr. President, it has been my honor to represent the citizens of \nGettysburg as a Member of Congress since 1986. I am proud to publicly \nrecognize Gettysburg and congratulate the community on this \nachievement. As the people of Gettysburg take this opportunity to \nappreciate how far the city has come from its beginnings, I know they \nwill understand the important role Gettysburg plays in making South \nDakota the great State that it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5035-5", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF HOVEN, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 125th \nanniversary of the founding of the community of Hoven, SD. After 125 \nyears, this progressive community in the Blue Blanket Valley will have \na chance to reflect on its past and future, and I congratulate the \npeople of Hoven for all that they have accomplished.\n  Dating back to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the establishment of \nthe Dakota Territory in 1861, and the Homestead Act of 1862, Hoven is \nlocated in Potter County of northeast South Dakota. Settled in 1883 \neast of Swan Lake, the enterprising prairie town boasted two general \nstores, a bank, a newspaper, a jewelry store, and two saloons to name \nonly a few businesses. The grand ``Cathedral of the Prairies'' has \ngraced the skyline of Hoven since its completion in the early 20th \ncentury.\n  The quasquicentennial festivities over the Fourth of July weekend \ncommence at twilight with a fireworks display. Additionally, the \ncelebration will include a 5K, softball and golf tournaments, a parade, \nand a ``Missed'' Hoven Pageant, for any males desiring to compete for a \npageant crown.\n  Known today as the ``little town with the big church,'' Hoven has \ngrown into a credit to the State of South Dakota with its business \nprosperity. The people of Hoven will celebrate their achievements July \n4-6. I am proud to join with the community members of Hoven in \ncelebrating the last 125 years and looking forward to a promising \nfuture.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5036-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5036]]\n                         HONORING JOEL SOUTHERN\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I bid farewell to a \nbroadcast journalist who has done more to keep Alaskans informed of the \nhappenings in Washington, DC, over the past 21 years than any other \nsingle journalist in the State. I rise to honor Joel Southern, the \nWashington, DC, correspondent for the Alaska Public Radio Network, and \nto wish him well in his future endeavors.\n  I entered politics in Alaska only in 1998, but by that time I had \nbeen listening to Joel's radio reports on Washington developments for \nnearly a decade. Most of my early knowledge of the political battle \nover the opening of the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge to potential oil and gas development came from Joel's reports, \nstarting in 1987--the year when the environmental impact statement on \nANWR first was released by the Department of the Interior.\n  My understanding of the efforts in Washington to change oil spill \nregulations in the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 came from \nJoel's reporting. Growing up in Wrangell, I knew a good deal about \nAlaska's southeast timber industry, still Joel's reporting over efforts \nto pass the Tongass Timber Reform Act in 1991 gave me a breadth of \nunderstanding that has been invaluable during my 6 years in the U.S. \nSenate. I could go on and on and on with other examples.\n  Joel Southern has been the eyes in the Nation's Capital for tens of \nthousands of Alaskans who live across the far-flung reaches of our \nState; where local newspaper coverage is sparse, where TV coverage \nconsists of cable coverage sometimes lacking in statewide or local \nnews, and where only public radio is the source of information and \npublic affairs.\n  Joel, a native of Winston-Salem, NC, moved to Washington in 1986, \nearning his master's degree in journalism and public affairs from \nAmerican University. While an undergrad student he worked as a student \nannouncer starting in 1981 at WFDD-FM, the Wake Forest University radio \nstation, where he learned to pronounce the names of classical composers \nfor his DJ stints, a skill that served him well when pronouncing \nInupiat and Native names, such as Tuntutaliak or Atqasuk or Atmautluak.\n  Formerly an employee of the famed Berns--News--Bureau, a starting \npoint for a number of great journalists, he moved onto the full-time \nstaff of the Alaska Public Radio Network in 1991 and since has provided \nmore radio reports for the network's main news program, Alaska News \nNightly, than any other single individual. Over time Joel has learned \nmore about the arcane areas of Alaska public land law, more about oil \nand gas production, more about commercial fishing and mining and more \nabout the complex arena of politics in the 49th State than most anyone \nelse.\n  Rather than show off his expertise simply to promote his own ego, \nJoel uses his knowledge to constantly explain complex stories in \nsimple, understandable terms. While he always asks tough, probing \nquestions of politicians and newsmakers, Joel asks them in a fair, \nbalanced and nonopinionated way. He does better at separating his \npersonal opinions from his reporting than most anyone. He has been \nfair, unbiased and totally objective for the entirety of his two \ndecades of Washington reporting--and that is a record he can be proud \nof.\n  Over the past 21 years Joel has covered everything from the \nimpeachment of a President to the contamination of Senate buildings by \nanthrax spores. He has covered the swearing in of three different \nPresidents, and reported on more changes in political leadership in \nCongress than veteran journalists twice his age. His range has been \nshown by both covering more congressional hearings than most any \ncongressional correspondent and by working in subzero degree \ntemperatures while covering the 1996 Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in \nAlaska.\n  Along the way he has covered the Supreme Court and specialized in \nagricultural news, producing the European Community Farm Line in \nconjunction with the European Union, produced stories for CBC Radio \naffiliates and the Australian Broadcasting Corp., provided pieces to \nNational Public Radio on a variety of topics, and done some stringing \nfor the AP. He has done interviews for C-SPAN and Canadian Broadcasting \nCorporation radio stations. And he has written columns on Alaska oil \nand natural gas/energy policy for a Canadian publication, Far North Oil \nand Gas Journal.\n  In between working seemingly constantly, he has found time to marry \nhis charming wife Helene, to be a devoted dad to two beautiful \nchildren, and still do more to inform Alaskans about the events in \nWashington that affect their future and the future of their children \nand grandchildren than most any other single journalist. And he has \ndone it while displaying a keen curiosity, an impressive intellect, an \ninsightful mind, a balanced sense of fairness and decency and a never-\nfailing sense of good humor that is far too lacking both inside the \nU.S. Capitol and outside its walls.\n  I will miss his presence in Washington, but I know Alaskans from \nKaktovik to Adak and from Ketchikan to Point Hope will miss him even \nmore. I can only wish Joel and his family the very best on their coming \nEuropean adventure and thank him for having done the best possible \nservice to his adopted State; that of informing the citizens of Alaska \nwith wisdom and wit for over two decades.\n  Thank you, Joel, and God's speed. I suspect I will be hearing your \nvoice from Copenhagen during next year's climate change COP 15 \nnegotiations. Just remember while Alaska is cold, the wind in Denmark's \nJutland Peninsula blowing in from the North Sea can be almost as biting \nas Alaska's North Slope. Again, best wishes and good luck in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5036-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5036-S5037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING DOLPHIN MINI GOLF\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize a small business \nfrom my home State of Maine that recently hosted the 2008 U.S. \nProMiniGolf Association's U.S. Open Tournament. Dolphin Mini Golf, an \n18-hole, par 50 miniature golf course located in the charming Midcoast \ntown of Boothbay, is the first location in the Northeast to host this \nexciting annual event.\n  Dolphin Mini Golf is no ordinary miniature golf course. A nautical \ntheme pervades the landscape, with each hole having a unique \ndecoration. Laden with challenging obstacles, from a fisherman's house \nto a whale's eye, and dotted with dolphins, lighthouses, and anchors, \nthe course is a taxing test for even the most advanced miniature \ngolfer. Additionally, the rotating ship's wheel and spinning lobster \nbuoys provide the course with an added level of difficulty.\n  A perfect attraction for tourists to the Maine coast and locals \nalike, Dolphin Mini Golf has earned its reputation as one of the \ncountry's premier miniature golf entertainment complexes. In fact, \nDolphin has been rated as one of the top 10 mini golf courses \nnationwide by several professionals on multiple occasions in USA Today. \nThis made Dolphin Mini Golf an ideal location for the recent 11th \nannual U.S. Open Tournament, which was held on May 17 and 18 and \norganized by the U.S. ProMiniGolf Association, which promotes the \nincreased play of miniature golf and sanctions several tournaments each \nyear. This year's U.S. Open featured entrants from across the United \nStates and Europe and consisted of six separate events, including a \njunior tournament, as well as senior and amateur divisions.\n  Dolphin's owner, Lee Stoddard, decided to use the opportunity of \nhosting the event to highlight something bigger than sports. He \nselected Operation Recognition, a non-profit organization that \nrecognizes America's servicemembers by providing them with a week of \nrelaxation in Maine, to receive proceeds from the U.S. Open. Operation \nRecognition was founded in May 2007, and its vacations provide military \nfamilies with all-expense-paid trips, including lodging, scenic boat \ntours, and, naturally, passes to play at Dolphin Mini Golf.\n  In addition to this year's U.S. Open, Dolphin Mini Golf hosts its own \ntournament each September. This 14-year tradition draws players from \nnear and far to benefit a good cause: the tournament raises money for \nShriners Hospitals for Children in New England. These crucial \nfacilities provide treatment for children with a variety of illnesses \nand ailments, including burn\n\n[[Page S5037]]\n\nvictims, orthopedic care, and spinal cord injury rehabilitation. Mr. \nStoddard's commitment to the welfare of the region's neediest children \nis truly admirable.\n  Dolphin Mini Golf is a fitting symbol of Maine's creative \nentrepreneurship. But under Lee Stoddard's leadership, it also \nrepresents a sincere kindness and compassion. Through sheer hard work \nand dedication, Mr. Stoddard has turned Dolphin into an exemplary \nminiature golf course and a standout small business. I congratulate \neveryone at Dolphin Mini Golf for earning the honor of playing host to \nthis year's U.S. Open Tournament and thank them for their considerable \ngenerosity to our Nation's veterans and children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5037-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5037-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CAPS EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, a treaty and a withdrawal which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5037-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.

A bill to ensure parity between the temporary duty imposed \non ethanol and tax credits provided on ethanol; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Imported \nEthanol Parity Act of 2008.\n  This legislation is cosponsored by Senators Gregg, Cantwell, Allard \nand Collins.\n  First, let me explain what this bill does. The Imported Ethanol \nParity Act instructs the President to lower the ethanol import tariff, \nso that it is no higher than the subsidy for blending ethanol into \ngasoline.\n  This legislation is necessary because the Farm Bill extended the \ntariff for two more years at $0.54 per gallon, even though the Farm \nBill reduced the ethanol blending subsidy to $0.45 per gallon.\n  In effect, the Farm Bill has turned the tariff from an ``offset'' \ninto a true trade barrier of at least $0.09 per gallon.\n  The Ethanol tariff poses many problems.\n  It increases the cost of Gasoline in the United States by making \nethanol more expensive.\n  It prevents Americans from importing ethanol made from sugarcane. \nSugar ethanol is the only available transportation fuel that works in \ntoday's cars and emits considerably less lifecycle greenhouse gas than \ngasoline;.\n  It taxes imports from our friends in Brazil, India, and Australia, \nwhile oil and gasoline imports from OPEC enter the United States tax \nfree.\n  It hinders the emergence of a global biofuels marketplace through \nwhich countries with a strong biofuel crop could sell fuel to countries \nthat suffered drought or other agricultural difficulties in the same \ncrop year. Such a global market would permit mutually beneficial trade \nbetween producing regions and stabilize both fuel and food prices.\n  It makes us more dependent on the Middle East for fuel when we should \nbe increasing the number of countries from whom we buy fuel. When it \ncomes to energy security for the United States, which has less than 3 \npercent of proven global oil reserves and 25 percent of demand, we must \ndiversify supply.\n  Bottom Line: until the tariff is lowered, the United States will tax \nthe only fuel it can import that increases energy security, reduces \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and lowers gasoline prices.\n  In 2006 I introduced legislation to eliminate the ethanol tariff \nentirely, and in 2007 I cosponsored an amendment to the Energy Bill \nwhich would have eliminated the tariff.\n  The Imported Ethanol Parity Act is a different proposal that I \nbelieve addresses the concerns of tariff defenders.\n  The advocates of the $0.54 per gallon tariff on ethanol imports have \nalways argued that the tariff is necessary in order to offset the \nblender subsidy that applies to the use of all ethanol, whether \nproduced domestically or internationally. They argue that the ethanol \nsubsidy exists to support American farmers who produce ethanol at \nhigher cost than foreign producers.\n  For instance, on May 6, 2006, the Chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee stated on the Senate floor that, ``the U.S. tariff on ethanol \noperates as an offset to an excise tax credit that applies to both \ndomestically produced and imported ethanol.''\n  On May 9, 2006, the Renewable Fuels Association stated in a press \nrelease: ``the secondary tariff exists as an offset to the tax \nincentive gasoline refiners receive for every gallon of ethanol they \nblend, regardless of the ethanol's origin.''\n  In a letter to Congress dated June 20, 2007, the American Coalition \nfor Ethanol, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Corn \nGrowers Association, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, the \nNational Sorghum Producers, and the Renewable Fuels Association stated \nthat the ``(blender) tax credit is available to refiners regardless of \nwhether the ethanol blended is imported or domestic. To prevent U.S. \ntaxpayers from subsidizing foreign ethanol companies, Congress passed \nan offset to the tax credit that foreign companies pay in the form of a \ntariff.''\n  Just this month, the Renewable Fuels Association's Executive Director \nasserted that ``The tariff is there not so much to protect the industry \nbut the U.S. taxpayer.''\n  Bottom Line: the tariff cannot be justifiably maintained at $0.54 per \ngallon if its intent is to offset a $0.45 per gallon blender subsidy, \nand it should be reduced.\n  Ethanol from Brazil or Australia should not have to overcome a trade \nbarrier that no drop of OPEC oil must face.\n  Tariff defenders either should support this legislation or explain \nhow a tariff can justifiably be higher than the subsidy it is designed \nto offset.\n  Climate Change is the most significant environmental challenge we \nface, and I believe that lowering the ethanol tariff will make it less \nexpensive for the United States to combat global warming.\n  The fuel we burn to power our cars is a major source of the \ngreenhouse gas emissions warming our planet. To reduce this impact, we \nneed to increase the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and lower the \nlifecycle carbon emissions of the fuel itself.\n  For this reason, in March 2007, I introduced the Clean Fuels and \nVehicles Act with Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins.\n  The legislation proposed a ``Low Carbon Fuels Standard,'' which would \nrequire each major oil company selling gasoline in the United States to \nreduce the average lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of \nenergy in their gasoline by 3 percent by 2015 and by 3 percent more in \n2020.\n  The legislation was modeled on the state of California's Low Carbon \nFuels Standard, which also requires a reduction in the lifecycle \ngreenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels.\n  This concept became a major aspect of the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act of 2007, in which Congress required oil companies to use \nan increasing quantity of ``advanced biofuels'' that produce at least \n50 percent less lifecycle greenhouse gas than gasoline.\n  Unfortunately the ethanol tariff puts a trade barrier in front of the \nlowest carbon fuel available, making it considerably more expensive for \nthe United States to lower the lifecycle carbon emissions of \ntransportation fuel.\n  The lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of ethanol vary depending on \nproduction methods and feedstocks, and these differences will impact \nthe degree to which ethanol may be used to meet ``low-carbon'' fuel \nrequirements under California law and the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act of 2007.\n  For instance, sugar cane ethanol plants use biomass from sugar stalks \nas process energy, resulting in less fossil fuel input compared to \ncurrent corn-to-ethanol processes. By comparison, researchers at the \nUniversity of California concluded that ``only 5 to 26 percent of the \nenergy content (in corn ethanol) is renewable. The rest is primarily \nnatural gas and coal,'' which are used in the production process.\n  The 2007 California Energy Commission Report entitled Full Fuel Cycle \nAssessment: Well-to-Wheels Energy Inputs, Emissions, and Water Impacts\n\n[[Page S5042]]\n\nconcluded that the direct lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of \nimported sugar based ethanol are 68 percent lower than gasoline, while \nthe direct lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of corn based ethanol \nfrom the Midwest are 15 to 28 percent lower than gasoline.\n  Further research released in 2008 suggests that the lifecycle \ngreenhouse gas emissions of corn based ethanol may be higher than \ngasoline, when land use change is factored into the equation.\n  The bottom line: biofuels that protect our planet may be produced \nabroad, and we should not put tariffs in front of these fuels, while we \nimport crude oil and gasoline tariff free.\n  Energy and food prices are both rising at unprecedented rates, and \nthere is a great deal of debate about whether the renewable fuels \nstandard mandating ethanol use is causing the problem.\n  I have always opposed corn ethanol mandates. But I remain concerned \nthat the blending subsidy and the ethanol tariff have as much to do \nwith rising corn prices as the ethanol mandate.\n  Corn ethanol production has considerably exceeded the renewable fuels \nstandard every year since its adoption in 2005. With oil prices this \nhigh, it is profitable to produce ethanol at record corn prices with or \nwithout the mandate. The low value of renewable fuels standard credits, \nknown as RINs, confirms that using ethanol is not a burden for oil \ncompanies.\n  To address the rising cost of corn, we have to address the underlying \neconomics of corn ethanol production, and effectively increasing the \ntariff on imports, as the Farm Bill has done, is a step in the wrong \ndirection.\n  This legislation corrects the Farm Bill's mistaken policy that \nimposed a real trade barrier on clean and climate friendly ethanol \nimports, giving gasoline imports a competitive advantage over cleaner \nfuel that simply should not exist at a time we are trying to combat \nclimate change.\n  It prevents ethanol producers abroad from receiving American ethanol \nsubsidies, which is supposedly the intent of the ethanol tariff.\n  I think it strikes the right balance, and I urge Congress to pass \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3080\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Imported Ethanol Parity \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On May 6, 2006, the Chairman of the Finance Committee \n     of the Senate stated on the Senate floor that, ``the United \n     States tariff on ethanol operates as an offset to an excise \n     tax credit that applies to both domestically produced and \n     imported ethanol.''.\n       (2) On May 9, 2006, the Renewable Fuels Association stated: \n     ``the secondary tariff exists as an offset to the tax \n     incentive gasoline refiners receive for every gallon of \n     ethanol they blend, regardless of the ethanol's origin.''. In \n     May 2008, the Renewable Fuels Association's Executive \n     Director asserted that ``The tariff is there not so much to \n     protect the industry but the United States taxpayer.''.\n       (3) In a letter to Congress dated June 20, 2007, the \n     American Coalition for Ethanol, the American Farm Bureau \n     Federation, the National Corn Growers Association, the \n     National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, the National Sorghum \n     Producers, and the Renewable Fuels Association stated that \n     the ``(blender) tax credit is available to refiners \n     regardless of whether the ethanol blended is imported or \n     domestic. To prevent United States taxpayers from subsidizing \n     foreign ethanol companies, Congress passed an offset to the \n     tax credit that foreign companies pay in the form of a \n     tariff.''.\n       (4) The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, as \n     contained in the Conference Report to accompany H.R. 2419 in \n     the 110th Congress, proposes to decrease the excise tax \n     credit for blending ethanol from $0.51 to $0.45 per gallon, \n     but extend the $0.54 per gallon temporary duty on imported \n     ethanol, increasing the competitive disadvantage of ethanol \n     imports in the United States marketplace. The legislation \n     would transform a tariff designed to offset a domestic \n     subsidy into a real import barrier of at least $0.09 per \n     gallon.\n       (5) The State of California is adopting a Low Carbon Fuels \n     Standard that requires a reduction in the lifecycle \n     greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels, and the \n     Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires the \n     United States to use increasing quantities of ``advanced \n     biofuels'' that have lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions that \n     are at least 50 percent less than lifecycle greenhouse gas \n     emissions from gasoline.\n       (6) The lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of ethanol vary \n     depending on production methods and feedstocks. These \n     differences will impact the degree to which ethanol may be \n     used to meet ``low-carbon'' fuel requirements under \n     California law and the Energy Independence and Security Act \n     of 2007.\n       (7) Sugar cane ethanol plants use biomass from sugar stalks \n     as process energy, resulting in less fossil fuel input \n     compared to current corn-to-ethanol processes.\n       (8) The 2007 California Energy Commission Report, entitled \n     ``Full Fuel Cycle Assessment: Well-to-Wheels Energy Inputs, \n     Emissions, and Water Impacts'', concluded that the direct \n     lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of imported sugar based \n     ethanol are 68 percent lower than gasoline, while the direct \n     lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of corn based ethanol from \n     the Midwest are 15 to 28 percent lower than gasoline.\n       (9) The cost to ship ethanol by sea from foreign production \n     areas to California is competitive with the cost to ship \n     ethanol by rail from the American Midwest, according to \n     ethanol producers and importers.\n       (10) Ethanol production will vary from region to region \n     each year based on crop performance, and a global biofuels \n     marketplace would permit mutually beneficial trade between \n     producing regions capable of stabilizing both fuel and food \n     prices.\n       (11) In March 2007, the United States and Brazil entered \n     into a strategic alliance to cooperate on advanced research \n     for biofuels, develop biofuel technology, and expand the \n     production and use of biofuels throughout the Western \n     Hemisphere, especially in the Caribbean and Central America.\n       (12) On March 9, 2007, President Bush stated ``it's in the \n     interest of the United States that there be a prosperous \n     neighborhood. And one way to help spread prosperity in \n     Central America is for them to become energy producers.''.\n       (13) According to a February 2008 study by the \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology, titled ``Biomass to \n     Ethanol: Potential Production and Environmental Impacts'', \n     the current ethanol distribution system in the United States \n     is not capable of efficiently supplying ethanol to the East \n     Coast markets.\n\n     SEC. 3. ETHANOL TAX PARITY.\n\n       Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, and semiannually thereafter, the President shall \n     reduce the temporary duty imposed on ethanol under subheading \n     9901.00.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \n     States by an amount equal to the reduction in any Federal \n     income or excise tax credit under section 40(h), 6426(b), or \n     6427(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and take any \n     other action necessary to ensure that the temporary duty \n     imposed on ethanol under such subheading 9901.00.50 is equal \n     to, or lower than, any Federal income or excise tax credit \n     applicable to ethanol under the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 3081. A bill to establish a Petroleum Industry Antitrust Task \nForce within the Department of Justice; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, from the skyrocketing price of crude oil, \nnow hovering well above $120 a barrel, to the $4.00 per gallon being \nsold at gas stations across the country, Americans are frustrated and \nthere appears to be no end in sight.\n  I've talked to school superintendents who have had to cut academic \nprograms because the cost of fueling school buses has gone through the \nroof. I have met with constituents who are pleading for the Federal \nGovernment to take some kind of action to provide relief. Just last \nweek, I held a field hearing in Pittsfield, Massachusetts to examine \nhow gas prices were impacting small business owners, and the testimony \nwas striking. Businesses that have been sustainable for decades are now \nwondering whether they'll be forced to shut their doors for good.\n  Congress has received testimony from energy market experts and major \noil company executives that the price of oil and gas can no longer be \nexplained or predicted by normal market dynamics or their historic \nunderstanding of supply and demand forces. An executive from Exxon \nMobil recently testified before Congress under oath that the price of \ncrude oil should be about $50 to $55 per barrel based on the supply and \ndemand fundamentals he had observed. Yet current crude oil prices are \nmore than double that.\n  We are all owed a clearer understanding as to why prices are so \ndisconnected from what normal supply and demand would indicate. Why has \nthe price of oil nearly doubled in the last year? Prices should not \nskyrocket like this in a properly functioning, competitive market. \nTwice I have written to\n\n[[Page S5043]]\n\nthe Bush Administration demanding an investigation and twice I have \nreceived a response of ``we're working on it''. Well, this response \nrings awfully hollow to Americans struggling to understand what's going \non.\n  How the Federal Government responds to the changing dynamics of \nenergy markets is vital to our continued national and economic \nsecurity. If the Enron energy crisis taught us anything it is that \nconsumers are best protected when energy markets are subject to \naggressive oversight and enforcement. Unless there is a cop on the beat \nvigilantly policing energy markets--especially when supplies are tight \nin markets with extremely inelastic demand--sophisticated companies can \nfleece consumer pocketbooks without fear of penalty.\n  Therefore, I am introducing legislation today to establish a new \ninteragency Oil and Gas Market Fraud Task Force under the leadership of \nthe Department of Justice to ensure that energy markets are free from \nillegal market manipulation or corporate corruption. This legislation \nwill allow us to root out fraud and manipulation in all corners of the \noil and gas marketplace, and restore consumer confidence. When that \nhappens, everyone wins. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. McCASKILL (for herself and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 3082. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 1700 Cleveland Avenue in Kansas City, Missouri, as \nthe ``Reverend Earl Abel Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, when I was a local elected official in \nKansas City, MO, I had the distinct honor of getting to know many of \nthe dedicated community leaders whose sole purpose for being involved \nwas to improve the lives of their fellow citizens. One of the best and \nmost beloved of these leaders was the Reverend Earl Abel.\n  Reverend Abel was born on September 12, 1930. He attended University \nof Kansas and went on to receive his Doctor of Divinity Degree from \nWestern Baptist Bible College. Reverend Abel worked as a U.S. Postal \nService mail carrier until he organized the Palestine Missionary \nBaptist Church in 1959.\n  Under Reverend Abel's leadership, what started out as a modest church \nof 11 members grew into a thriving ministry, touching the lives of \nthousands of community members across Kansas City, Missouri. While he \nwas pastor, Palestine Church built two senior citizens residences, a \nSenior Activity Center, and a church camp for both youth and adults. \nEven as he worked tirelessly to reach out through these programs, \nReverend Abel's involvement in the community did not end with his \nefforts at Palestine Church. Reverend Abel served as Chaplain for the \nKansas City Police Department, President of the Baptist Ministers \nUnion, member of the Kansas City Council on Crime Prevention, and \nauthored a book entitled If a Church is to Grow. In 1999, Missouri \nGovernor Mel Carnahan appointed Reverend Abel to the Appellate Judicial \nCommission.\n  On May 17, 2005, Reverend Abel passed away after 46 years of service \nat Palestine Missionary Baptist Church of Jesus Christ and more than 48 \nyears as a minister of God.\n  Today I rise to offer a bill to honor this man by naming a post \noffice facility in Kansas City after him. Given his early career as a \nmail carrier, it is only fitting for the location at 1700 Cleveland \nAvenue, in the heart of Kansas City, to carry his name. It is my hope \nthat this small gesture helps ensure that the legacy of Rev. Abel lives \non. A companion bill in the House of Representatives will be filed \ntoday by Rep. Cleaver, a fellow minister and selfless public servant \nwho represents Kansas City.\n  I hope my fellow colleagues will join me and my colleague Senator \nBond in recognizing Reverend Earl Abel for his loving ministry and \nlimitless dedication to serving the Kansas City, MO, community.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3082\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REVEREND EARL ABEL POST OFFICE BUILDING.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal \n     Service located at 1700 Cleveland Avenue in Kansas City, \n     Missouri, shall be known and designated as the ``Reverend \n     Earl Abel Post Office Building''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the ``Reverend Earl Abel Post Office \n     Building''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Casey, \n        and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 3083. A bill to require a review of existing trade agreements and \nrenegotiation of existing trade agreements based on the review, to set \nterms for future trade agreements, to express the sense of the Senate \nthat the role of Congress in trade policymaking should be strengthened, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the goal of our trade policy should be to \npromote fair competition and lift up workers at home and abroad.\n  Americans support trade that allows responsible businesses to thrive, \nfueling good-paying jobs and a strong, resilient economy.\n  But wrong-headed trade pacts following the failed NAFTA-model have \nbetrayed middle class families across the country, destabilizing our \neconomy and destroying communities in rural and urban areas alike.\n  In my state of Ohio, more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs have been \neliminated since 2001. Across the country, more than 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs have been eliminated in that time.\n  Our failures to modernize our Nation's trade policy, to learn from \nour mistakes, and to respond to changing dynamics in the global arena, \nhurt communities like Toledo and Steubenville and Dayton.\n  That is why voters in my state of Ohio and across the country have \nsent a message loud and clear demanding a new direction, a very \ndifferent direction, for our nation's trade policy.\n  Over the last 8 years, our approach to trade has been haphazard at \nbest.\n  In the last 2 years, since voters elected candidates who support fair \ntrade, Congress has reasserted itself in trade policy-making, with some \nimprovements to proposed deals with Peru, Panama, Colombia, and South \nKorea.\n  We also have chosen not to grant President Bush a renewal of Fast \nTrack.\n  But our approach to trade has not evolved from reactive to proactive. \nWe have not forged a new approach to trade that is results-oriented, an \napproach focused squarely on the goals of economic strength, job \ncreation, and U.S. self-sufficiency.\n  Not surprisingly, polls show that Americans reject current trade \npolicy as misguided.\n  That is because it is.\n  It is time to learn from our mistakes.\n  It is time for a change. The Trade Reform, Accountability, \nDevelopment and Employment, TRADE, Act, which Senator Dorgan, Senator \nFeingold, Senator Casey, Senator Whitehouse and I are introducing \ntoday, is a step towards that change.\n\n  This legislation will serve as a template for how to craft a trade \nagreement that works for workers, for business owners, for our country.\n  This legislation will mandate a review of all existing trade \nagreements and will require the President to submit renegotiation plans \nfor those agreements before pursuing new trade agreements.\n  The TRADE Act will create a committee comprised of House and Senate \nleaders who will review the President's plan for renegotiation.\n  This bill spells out standards for future trade agreements, standards \nbased on fostering fair competition, promoting good-paying jobs, and \naddressing unethical behavior by multinational corporations, including \nthe exploitation of people and natural resources in developing nations.\n  Trade is an exchange that relies on the integrity of its \nparticipants. We must not trade away our fundamental belief in basic \nhuman rights and our responsibility to fight the kind of exploitation \nthat threatens vulnerable peoples and vulnerable nations.\n\n[[Page S5044]]\n\n  That is why our trade policy must not sidestep the impact of lax \ntrade agreements and unethical corporations on developing nations.\n  The TRADE Act also sets out criteria for a new negotiating process--\none that would do away with the fundamentally-flawed Fast Track process \nand return power to Congress when considering our nation's trade pacts.\n  We take for granted our clean air, safe food, and safe drinking \nwater. But these blessings are not by chance: they result from laws and \nrules that foster fair wages, protect the public health, and promote \nenvironmental stewardship.\n  Flawed trade policy accelerates the import of toxic toys, \ncontaminated toothpaste, and poisonous pet food into this country.\n  It does not have to be this way.\n  We have a choice.\n  We can continue a race to the bottom in wages, worker safety, \nenvironmental protection, and health standards.\n  Or, we can use trade agreements to lift standards abroad--not \nthreaten workers and consumers.\n  We can continue down the path of the failed NAFTA model, or we can \nwrite trade agreements that sustain and grow our Nation's manufacturing \nself-sufficiency, create good-paying jobs and reduce the trade deficit \nby providing fair and transparent market access.\n  We can forsake U.S. standards and U.S. values and ignore trade abuses \nin order to mass produce trade agreements, or we can write trade \nagreements that fulfill their promises, that hold our trading partners \naccountable for abiding by the rules, and that build on the hard-fought \nbattles waged to build a strong middle class, reward good corporate \ncitizens, preserve our natural resources, and ensure that the food and \nproducts Americans purchase are safe.\n  We can continue to use trade deals to lock in protections for Wall \nStreet, the drug companies, and oil companies, or we can create a \npredictable structure for international trade without providing \ncorporations with overreaching privileges and rights of private \nenforcement that undermine our laws.\n  Middle class families, American manufacturers and farmers, and \ncommunity leaders across the country all know that we need a new \ndirection for trade.\n  I am going to ask my leadership, and my caucus, to work with me on \nthis legislation. And I look forward to working with my allies on the \nother side of the aisle to modernize U.S. trade policy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3083\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 583\n\n       Whereas, on June 20, 1782, the bald eagle was officially \n     designated as the national emblem of the United States by the \n     founding fathers at the Second Continental Congress;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is the central image of the Great \n     Seal of the United States;\n       Whereas the image of the bald eagle is displayed in the \n     official seal of many branches and departments of the Federal \n     Government, including--\n       (1) the Office of the President;\n       (2) the Office of the Vice President;\n       (3) Congress;\n       (4) the Supreme Court;\n       (5) the Department of the Treasury;\n       (6) the Department of Defense;\n       (7) the Department of Justice;\n       (8) the Department of State;\n       (9) the Department of Commerce;\n       (10) the Department of Homeland Security;\n       (11) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n       (12) the Department of Labor;\n       (13) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n       (14) the Department of Energy;\n       (15) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;\n       (16) the Central Intelligence Agency;

118 Stat. 3937) provides that each surcharge received by \n     the Secretary of the Treasury from the sale of a coin issued \n     under that Act ``shall be promptly paid by the Secretary to \n     the American Eagle Foundation of Tennessee'' to support \n     efforts to protect the bald eagle;\n       Whereas, on January 15, 2008, the Secretary of the Treasury \n     issued 3 limited edition bald eagle commemorative coins;\n       Whereas, if not for the vigilant conservation efforts of \n     concerned citizens and the enactment of strict environmental \n     protection laws (including regulations) the bald eagle would \n     be extinct;\n       Whereas the dramatic recovery of the population of bald \n     eagles is an endangered species success story and an \n     inspirational example for other wildlife and natural resource \n     conservation efforts around the world;\n       Whereas the initial recovery of the population of bald \n     eagles was accomplished by the concerted efforts of numerous \n     government agencies, corporations, organizations, and \n     individuals; and\n       Whereas the continuation of recovery, management, and \n     public awareness programs for bald eagles will be necessary \n     to ensure--\n       (1) the continued progress of the recovery of bald eagles; \n     and\n       (2) that the population and habitat of bald eagles will \n     remain healthy and secure for future generations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 20, 2008, as ``American Eagle Day'';\n       (2) applauds the issuance of bald eagle commemorative coins \n     by the Secretary of the Treasury as a means by which to help \n     generate critical funds for the protection of bald eagles;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) unchecked global climate change poses a significant \n     threat to--\n       (A) the national security of the United States;\n       (B) the economy of the United States;\n       (C) public health in the United States;\n       (D) the well-being of residents of the United States;\n       (E) the well-being of residents of other countries; and\n       (F) the global environment;\n       (2) pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on \n     Climate Change, done at New York on May 9, 1992, the United \n     States is committed to stabilizing greenhouse gas \n     concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent \n     dangerous interference with the climate system;\n       (3) according to the Fourth Assessment Report of the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, stabilizing \n     greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level \n     that will prevent dangerous interference with the climate \n     system will require a global effort to reduce worldwide \n     anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 85 percent \n     below 2000 levels by 2050;\n       (4) prompt, decisive action is critical, because greenhouse \n     gases can persist in the atmosphere for more than a century;\n       (5) global climate change represents a potentially \n     significant threat multiplier for instability around the \n     world and is likely to exacerbate competition and conflict \n     over agricultural, vegetative, marine, and water resources \n     and displace people, thus increasing hunger and poverty and \n     causing increased pressure on the most vulnerable developing \n     countries;\n       (6) the strategic, social, political, economic, cultural, \n     and environmental consequences of global climate change are \n     likely to have disproportionate impacts on the most \n     vulnerable developing countries, which have fewer industrial \n     emissions and less economic and financial capacity to \n     respond;\n       (7) less developed countries rely to a much greater degree \n     on the natural and environmental systems likely to be \n     affected by climate change for sustenance and livelihoods, as \n     well as economic growth and stability;\n       (8) the consequences of global climate change, including \n     increases in poverty and destabilization of economies and \n     societies, are likely to pose a danger to the security \n     interest and economic interest of the United States;\n       (9) it is in the national security and economic interest of \n     the United States to recognize, plan for, and mitigate the \n     international strategic, social, political, cultural, \n     environmental and economic effects of a changing climate and \n     to assist those in the most vulnerable developing countries \n     to increase resilience to those effects;\n       (10) the ingenuity of the people of the United States will \n     allow the United States to become a leader in curbing global \n     climate change;\n       (11) it is possible and desirable--\n       (A) to cap greenhouse gas emissions, from the sources that \n     together account for the majority of those emissions in the \n     United States, at or below the current level in 2012;\n       (B) to lower the cap each year between 2012 and 2050; and\n       (C) to include in the system--\n       (i) measures to contain costs;\n       (ii) measures providing for periodic reviews of the system;\n       (iii) an aggressive program for deploying advanced \n     technology that is developed and manufactured in the United \n     States;\n       (iv) programs to assist low- and middle-income energy \n     consumers; and\n       (v) programs to mitigate the impacts of that degree of \n     global climate change that now is unavoidable;\n       (12) Congress will need to update the system, including the \n     emission caps, to account for new scientific information and \n     steps taken or not taken by other countries;\n       (13) the Federal Government currently possesses adequate \n     data to support initial steps in the establishment of a \n     greenhouse gas emission trading market and to support initial \n     allocations of emission allowances based upon historical \n     emissions and other historical activities;\n       (14) the smooth functioning of a national emission trading \n     market that is based upon a national emissions cap that comes \n     into effect at the beginning of calendar year 2012 \n     necessitates the establishment, not later than January 1, \n     2011, of a Federal system for determining, recording, and \n     reporting greenhouse gas emissions at an entity-specific \n     level;\n       (15) prompt and decisive domestic climate change \n     investments represent an unprecedented economic development \n     opportunity for the United States;\n       (16) an environmental economic development policy should \n     seek to increase the per-capita income and protect the \n     interests of working families;\n       (17) the measures in this Act are not the only measures \n     that Congress will need to enact over the decades-long \n     program established by this Act in order to avert dangerous \n     climate change and avoid the imposition of hardship on United \n     States residents;\n       (18) State and local government programs, including \n     incentives, renewable portfolio standards, energy-efficiency \n     requirements, land-use policies, and other such programs \n     typically implemented at the State and local levels are \n     having and will continue to have a substantial and direct \n     beneficial effect on reducing greenhouse gas emissions;\n       (19) emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and \n     mercury in the United States continue to inflict harm on the \n     public health, economy, and natural resources of the United \n     States;\n       (20) fossil fuel-fired electric power generating facilities \n     emit approximately 67 percent of the total sulfur-dioxide \n     emissions, 23 percent of the total nitrogen-oxide emissions, \n     40 percent of the total carbon-dioxide emissions, and 40 \n     percent of the total mercury emissions in the United States;\n       (21) more than half the electricity generated in the United \n     States is generated through the burning of coal;\n       (22) the reserve of coal in the United States is larger \n     than the reserve of coal in any other country;\n       (23) while the reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide, \n     nitrogen oxides, and mercury that will occur in the presence \n     of a declining cap on the greenhouse gas emissions from coal-\n     fired electric power generating facilities are larger than \n     those that would occur in the absence of such a cap, new, \n     stricter Federal limits on emissions of sulfur dioxide, \n     nitrogen oxides, and mercury may still be needed to protect \n     public health; and\n       (24) many existing fossil fuel-fired electric power \n     generating facilities in the United States were exempted by \n     Congress from emission limitations applicable to new and \n     modified facilities of that type based on an expectation by \n     Congress that, over time, those facilities would be retired \n     or updated with new pollution control equipment, but many of \n     the exempted facilities nevertheless continue to operate and \n     emit pollution at relatively high rates and without new \n     pollution control equipment.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish the core of a Federal program that will \n     reduce United States greenhouse gas emissions substantially \n     enough to avert the catastrophic impacts of global climate \n     change; and\n       (2) to accomplish that purpose while--\n       (A) preserving robust growth in the United States economy;\n       (B) creating new jobs in the United States;\n       (C) avoiding the imposition of hardship on United States \n     residents;\n       (D) reducing the dependence of the United States on \n     petroleum produced in other countries;\n       (E) imposing no net cost on the Federal Government;\n       (F) ensuring that the financial resources provided by the \n     program established by this Act for technology deployment are \n     predominantly invested in development, production, and \n     construction of that technology in the United States; and\n       (G) encouraging complementary State and local government \n     policies and programs that promote energy efficiency and \n     technology deployment or otherwise reduce greenhouse gas \n     emissions.\n\n     SEC. 4.

and\n       (II) of the international reserve allowance requirements \n     applicable to each relevant covered foreign country, to apply \n     the requirement that requires the highest number of \n     international reserve allowances for the category of covered \n     goods.\n\n       (C) Exception.--\n       (i) In general.--The requirements of clause (i) shall not \n     apply if, on request by an importer, the Administrator \n     applies an alternate method for establishing the requirement.\n       (ii) Requirement for application.--The Administrator shall \n     apply an alternate method for establishing a requirement \n     under clause (i) only if the applicable importer demonstrates \n     in an administrative hearing by a preponderance of evidence \n     that the alternate method will establish an international \n     reserve allowance requirement that is more representative \n     than the requirement that would otherwise apply under clause \n     (i).\n       (D) Administrative hearing.--The Administrator shall \n     establish procedures for administrative hearings under \n     subparagraph (C)(ii) to ensure that--\n       (i) all evidence submitted by an importer will be subject \n     to verification by the Administrator;\n       (ii) domestic manufactures of the category of covered goods \n     subject to the administrative hearing will have an \n     opportunity to review and comment on evidence submitted by \n     the importer; and\n       (iii) appropriate penalties will be assessed in cases in \n     which the importer has submitted information that is false or \n     misleading.\n       (e) Foreign Allowances and Credits.--\n       (1) Foreign allowances.--\n       (A) In general.--A United States importer may submit, in \n     lieu of an international reserve allowance issued under this \n     section, a foreign allowance or similar compliance instrument \n     distributed by a foreign country pursuant to a cap-and-trade \n     program that constitutes comparable action.\n       (B) Commensurate cap-and-trade program.--For purposes of \n     subparagraph (A), a cap-and-trade program that constitutes \n     comparable action shall include any greenhouse gas regulatory \n     program adopted by a covered foreign country to limit the \n     greenhouse gas emissions of the covered foreign country, if \n     the Administrator certifies that the program--\n       (i)(I) places a quantitative limitation on the total \n     quantity of greenhouse gas emissions of the covered foreign \n     country (expressed in terms of tons emitted per calendar \n     year); and\n       (II) achieves that limitation through an allowance trading \n     system;\n       (ii) satisfies such criteria as the Administrator may \n     establish for requirements relating to the enforceability of \n     the cap-and-trade program, including requirements for \n     monitoring, reporting, verification procedures, and allowance \n     tracking; and\n       (iii) is a comparable action.\n       (2) Foreign credits.--\n       (A) In general.--A United States importer may submit, in \n     lieu of an international reserve allowance issued under this \n     section, an international offset that the Administrator has \n     authorized for use under subtitle B of title III or subtitle \n     B of this title.\n       (B) Application.--The limitation on the use of \n     international reserve allowances by covered entities under \n     subsection (a)(7) shall not apply to a United States importer \n     for purposes of this paragraph.\n       (f) Retirement of Allowances.--The Administrator shall \n     retire each international reserve allowance, foreign \n     allowance, and international offset submitted to achieve \n     compliance with this section.\n       (g) Termination.--The international reserve allowance \n     requirements of this section shall cease to apply to a \n     covered good of a covered foreign country if the Commission \n     places the covered foreign country on the excluded list under \n     subsection (b)(2).\n       (h) Final Regulations.--Not later than January 1, 2013, the \n     Administrator, in consultation with the Commission, shall \n     promulgate such regulations as the Administrator determines \n     to be necessary to carry out this section.\n\n     SEC. 1307. ADJUSTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RESERVE ALLOWANCE \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than January 1, 2017, and \n     annually thereafter, the Commission shall prepare and submit \n     to the President and Congress a report that assesses the \n     effectiveness of the international reserve allowance \n     requirements under section 1306 with respect to--\n       (1) covered goods entered into the United States from each \n     foreign country included on the covered list under section \n     1306(b)(3); and\n       (2) the production of covered goods in those foreign \n     countries that are incorporated into manufactured goods that \n     are subsequently entered into the United States.\n       (b) Inadequate Requirements.--If the Commission determines \n     that an applicable international reserve allowance \n     requirement is not adequate to achieve the purposes of this \n     subtitle, the Commission shall include in the report under \n     subsection (a) recommendations--\n\n[[Page S5095]]\n\n       (1) to increase the stringency or otherwise improve the \n     effectiveness of the applicable requirements in a manner that \n     ensures compliance with all applicable international \n     agreements;\n       (2) to address greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the \n     production of manufactured items for consumption that are not \n     subject to the international reserve allowance requirements \n     under section 1306; or\n       (3) to take such other action as the Commission determines \n     to be necessary to address greenhouse gas emissions \n     attributable to the production of covered goods in covered \n     foreign countries, in compliance with all applicable \n     international agreements.\n       (c) Revised Regulations.--The Administrator, in \n     consultation with the Commission, shall promulgate revised \n     regulations to implement the recommended changes to improve \n     the effectiveness of the international reserve allowance \n     requirements under subsection (b).\n       (d) Effective Date.--Any revisions made pursuant to \n     subsection (c) shall take effect on January 1 of the \n     compliance year immediately following the date on which the \n     revision is made.\n\n  Subtitle B--International Partnerships to Reduce Deforestation and \n                           Forest Degradation\n\n     SEC. 1311. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) changes in land use patterns and forest sector \n     emissions account for approximately 20 percent of global \n     greenhouse gas emissions;\n       (2) land conversion and deforestation are 2 of the largest \n     sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the developing world, \n     comprising approximately 40 percent of the total greenhouse \n     gas emissions of the developing world;\n       (3) with sufficient data, deforestation and forest \n     degradation rates and forest carbon stocks can be measured \n     with an acceptable degree of uncertainty;\n       (4) encouraging reduced deforestation and reduced forest \n     degradation in foreign countries could--\n       (A) provide critical leverage to encourage voluntary \n     participation by developing countries in emission limitation \n     regimes;\n       (B) facilitate greater overall reductions in greenhouse gas \n     emissions than otherwise would be practicable; and\n       (C) substantially benefit biodiversity, conservation, and \n     indigenous and other forest-dependent people in developing \n     countries;\n       (5) in addition to forest carbon activities that can be \n     readily measured, monitored, and verified through national-\n     scale programs and projects, there is great value in reducing \n     emissions and sequestering carbon through forest carbon \n     projects in countries that lack the institutional \n     arrangements to support national-scale accounting of forest \n     carbon stocks; and\n       (6) providing emission allowances in support of projects in \n     countries that lack fully developed institutions for \n     national-scale accounting could help to build capacity in \n     those countries, sequester additional carbon, and increase \n     participation by developing countries in international \n     climate agreements.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to reduce \n     greenhouse gas emissions by reducing deforestation and forest \n     degradation in foreign countries in a manner that reduces the \n     costs imposed by this Act on covered entities in the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 1312. CAPACITY BUILDING PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--Not later than 2 years after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of State, \n     and the Secretary of Agriculture, shall promulgate \n     regulations to establish programs under which the \n     Administrator shall provide emission allowances allocated \n     pursuant to subsection (b) to individuals and entities \n     (including foreign governments) carrying out projects in \n     foreign countries as described in sections 1313 and 1314.\n       (b) Allocation.--Not later than 330 days before January 1 \n     of each of calendar years 2012 through 2050, the \n     Administrator shall allocate for distribution under this \n     section 1 percent of the aggregate quantity of emission \n     allowances established for the applicable calendar year \n     pursuant to section 201(a).\n\n     SEC. 1313. FOREST CARBON ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Eligibility Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of State, \n     and the Secretary of Agriculture, shall promulgate \n     regulations establishing eligibility requirements for the \n     allocation of emission allowances under this subsection for \n     forest carbon activities directed at sequestration of carbon \n     through restoration of forests and degraded land, \n     afforestation, and improved forest management in countries \n     other than the United States, including requirements that \n     those activities shall be--\n       (A) carried out and managed in accordance with widely-\n     accepted environmentally sustainable forestry practices; and\n       (B) designed--\n       (i) to promote native species and restoration of native \n     forests, where practicable;\n       (ii) to avoid the introduction of invasive nonnative \n     species;\n       (iii) so as not to adversely impact or undermine the rights \n     (including internationally recognized rights) of indigenous \n     and other forest-dependent individuals residing in the \n     affected areas; and\n       (iv) in a manner that ensures that local communities--\n\n       (I) are provided the right of free, prior, informed consent \n     regarding projects or other activities;\n       (II) are able to share equitably in profits or other \n     benefits of the activities; and\n       (III) receive fair compensation for any damages resulting \n     from the activities.\n\n       (2) Quality criteria for forest carbon allocations.--The \n     regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1) shall \n     include requirements to ensure that the emission reductions \n     or sequestrations of a forest carbon activity that receives \n     emission allowances under this section are real, permanent, \n     additional, verifiable, and enforceable, with reliable \n     measuring and monitoring and appropriate accounting for \n     leakage.\n       (b) Peatland and Other Natural Land That Sequester \n     Carbon.--The Administrator may provide emission allowances \n     under this section for a project for storage of carbon in \n     peatland or other natural land if the Administrator--\n       (1) determines that--\n       (A) the peatland or other natural land is capable of \n     storing carbon; and\n       (B) the project for storage of carbon in the peatland or \n     other natural land is capable of meeting the quality criteria \n     described in subsection (a); and\n       (2) provides notice and an opportunity for public comment \n     regarding the project.\n       (c) Recognition of Forest Carbon Activities.--With respect \n     to foreign countries other than the foreign countries \n     described in subsection (a) or (b), the Administrator--\n       (1) shall recognize any forest carbon activities of the \n     foreign country, subject to the quality criteria for forest \n     carbon activities described in subsection (b); and\n       (2) is encouraged to identify other incentives, including \n     economic and market-based incentives, to encourage developing \n     countries with largely intact native forests to protect those \n     forests.\n       (d) Other Forest Carbon Activities.--A forest carbon \n     activity other than a reduction in deforestation or forest \n     degradation shall be eligible for a distribution of emission \n     allowances under this section, subject to the eligibility \n     requirements and quality criteria for forest carbon \n     activities described in subsection (a) or other regulations \n     promulgated pursuant to this Act.\n\n     SEC. 1314. ESTABLISHING AND DISTRIBUTING OFFSET ALLOWANCES.\n\n       (a) Regulations.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of State, \n     and the Secretary of Agriculture, shall promulgate \n     regulations, including quality and eligibility requirements, \n     for the distribution of offset allowances for international \n     forest carbon activities.\n       (b) Quality and Eligibility Requirements.--The regulations \n     promulgated pursuant to subsection (a) shall require that, in \n     order to be approved for use under this section, offset \n     allowances distributed for an international forest carbon \n     activity shall meet such quality and eligibility requirements \n     as the Administrator may establish, including a requirement \n     that--\n       (1) the activity shall be designed, carried out, and \n     managed --\n       (A) in accordance with widely-accepted, environmentally \n     sustainable forestry practices;\n       (B) to promote native species and conservation or \n     restoration of native forests, where practicable, and to \n     avoid the introduction of invasive nonnative species;\n       (C) in a manner that does not adversely impact or undermine \n     the rights (including internationally recognized rights) of \n     indigenous and other forest-dependent individuals residing in \n     affected areas; and\n       (D) in a manner that ensures that local communities--\n       (i) are provided the right of free, prior, informed consent \n     regarding projects or other activities;\n       (ii) are able to share equitably in profits or other \n     benefits of the activities; and\n       (iii) receive fair compensation for any damages resulting \n     from the activities;\n       (2) the emission reductions or sequestrations are real, \n     permanent, additional, verifiable, and enforceable, with \n     reliable measuring and monitoring and appropriate accounting \n     for leakage; and\n       (3) eligible offset allowances are provided only from \n     countries on a list described in subsection (c).\n       (c) Lists.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator, in consultation with \n     the Secretary of State, shall identify and periodically \n     update a list of the names of countries that have--\n       (A) demonstrated capacity to participate in international \n     forest carbon activities, including--\n       (i) sufficient historical data on changes in national \n     forest carbon stocks;\n       (ii) technical capacity to monitor and measure forest \n     carbon fluxes with an acceptable level of uncertainty; and\n       (iii) institutional capacity to reduce emissions from \n     deforestation and degradation;\n       (B) capped greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise \n     established a credible national baseline or emission \n     reference scenario that is--\n       (i) consistent with nationally appropriate mitigation \n     commitments or actions, taking into consideration the average \n     annual deforestation and degradation rates of the country \n     during a period of at least 5 years; and\n\n[[Page S5096]]\n\n       (ii) projected to result in zero-net deforestation by not \n     later than 2050; and\n       (C)(i) implemented an emission reduction program for the \n     forest sector; and\n       (ii) demonstrated those reductions using remote sensing \n     technology, taking into consideration relevant international \n     standards.\n       (2) Periodic review of national-level reductions in \n     deforestation and degradation.--The Administrator, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State, shall identify and \n     periodically update a list of the names of countries included \n     in the list under paragraph (1) that have--\n       (A) achieved national-level reductions of deforestation and \n     degradation below a historical reference scenario, taking \n     into consideration the average annual deforestation and \n     degradation rates of the country, and of all countries, \n     during a period of at least 5 years; and\n       (B) demonstrated those reductions using remote sensing \n     technology, taking into consideration relevant international \n     standards.\n       (3) Crediting and additionality.--A verified reduction in \n     greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest \n     degradation under a cap or resulting from a nationwide \n     emissions reference scenario described in paragraph (1)(B) \n     shall be--\n       (A) eligible for crediting; and\n       (B) considered to satisfy the additionality criterion.\n       (d) Facility Certification.--The owner or operator of a \n     covered entity that submits an offset allowance generated \n     under this section shall certify that the offset allowance \n     has not been retired from use in a registry of the applicable \n     foreign country.\n       (e) Use.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (3), the quantity of \n     offset allowances distributed pursuant to this section in a \n     calendar year shall not exceed 10 percent of the quantity of \n     emission allowances established for that year pursuant to \n     section 201(a).\n       (2) Use of international allowances.--\n       (A) In general.--If the quantity of offset allowances \n     distributed in a calendar year pursuant to this section is \n     less than 10 percent of the quantity of emission allowances \n     established for that calendar year pursuant to section \n     201(a), the Administrator shall allow the use, by covered \n     entities during that year, of international allowances under \n     section 322.\n       (B) Quantity.--The aggregate quantity of international \n     allowances the use of which is permitted under subparagraph \n     (A) for a calendar year shall be equal to the difference \n     between--\n       (i) the quantity of offset allowances distributed during \n     that calendar year pursuant to this section;

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING INTERNATIONAL \n                   NEGOTIATIONS TO ADDRESS GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) There is a scientific consensus, as established by the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and confirmed by \n     the National Academy of Sciences, that the continued buildup \n     of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threatens \n     the stability of the global climate.\n       (2) The 2007 Fourth Assessment Report of the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that most \n     of the global warming observed since the mid-20th century is \n     very likely due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and \n     that anthropogenic warming is strongly linked to many \n     observed physical and biological impacts.\n       (3) There are significant long-term risks to the economy \n     and the environment of the United States from the temperature \n     increases and climatic disruptions that are projected to \n     result from increased greenhouse gas concentrations.\n       (4) The potential impacts of global climate change, \n     including long-term drought, famine, mass migration, and \n     abrupt climatic shifts, may lead to international tensions \n     and instability in regions affected and, therefore, have \n     implications for the national security interests of the \n     United States.\n       (5) The United States has the largest economy in the world \n     and is also the largest historical emitter of greenhouse \n     gases.\n       (6) The greenhouse gas emissions of the United States are \n     projected to continue to rise.\n       (7) The greenhouse gas emissions of some developing \n     countries are rising more rapidly than the emissions of the \n     United States and will soon surpass the greenhouse gas \n     emissions of the United States and other developed countries.\n       (8) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the levels \n     necessary to avoid serious climatic disruption requires the \n     introduction of new energy technologies and other climate-\n     friendly technologies, the use of which results in low or no \n     emissions of greenhouse gases or in the capture and storage \n     of greenhouse gases.\n       (9) The 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate \n     Change commissioned by the United Kingdom and the 2008 World \n     Economic Outlook from the International Monetary Fund each \n     concluded that the economic costs of addressing climate \n     change are limited.\n       (10) The development and sale of climate-friendly \n     technologies in the United States and internationally present \n     economic opportunities for workers and businesses in the \n     United States.\n       (11) Climate-friendly technologies can improve air quality \n     by reducing harmful pollutants from stationary and mobile \n     sources and can enhance energy security by reducing reliance \n     on imported oil, diversifying energy sources, and reducing \n     the vulnerability of energy delivery infrastructure.\n       (12) Other industrialized countries are undertaking \n     measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which provides \n     the industries in those countries with a competitive \n     advantage in the growing global market for climate-friendly \n     technologies.\n       (13) Efforts to limit emissions growth in developing \n     countries in a manner that is consistent with the development \n     needs of those countries could establish significant markets \n     for climate-friendly technologies and contribute to \n     international efforts to address climate change.\n       (14) The national security of the United States will \n     increasingly depend on the deployment of diplomatic, \n     military, scientific, and economic resources for solving the \n     problem of the overreliance of the United States and the \n     world on high-carbon energy.\n       (15) The United States is a party to the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York May \n     9, 1992, and entered into force March 21, 1994 (in this \n     preamble referred to as the ``Convention'').\n       (16) The Convention sets a long-term objective of \n     stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere \n     at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic \n     interference with the climate system.\n       (17) The Convention establishes that parties bear ``common \n     but differentiated responsibilities'' for efforts to achieve \n     the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations.\n       (18) At the December 2007 United Nations Climate

The Bali Action Plan calls for a shared vision on \n     long-term cooperative action, increased mitigation efforts \n     from developed and developing countries that are measurable, \n

Mr. REID (for Mr. Biden) proposed an amendment to amendment \nSA 4826 proposed by Mr. Reid (for Mr. Biden) to the amendment SA 4825 \nproposed by Mrs. Boxer (for herself, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Lieberman) to \nthe bill S. 3036, to direct the Administrator of the Environment \nProtection Agency to establish a program to decrease emissions of \ngreenhouse gases, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In the amendment, strike all after the word ``SEC'' on line \n     2 and insert the following:\n\n     1334. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS TO \n                   ADDRESS GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) There is a scientific consensus, as established by the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and confirmed by \n     the National Academy of Sciences, that the continued buildup \n     of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threatens \n     the stability of the global climate.\n       (2) The 2007 Fourth Assessment Report of the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that most \n     of the global warming observed since the mid-20th century is \n     very likely due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and \n     that anthropogenic warming is strongly linked to many \n     observed physical and biological impacts.\n       (3) There are significant long-term risks to the economy \n     and the environment of the United States from the temperature \n     increases and climatic disruptions that are projected to \n     result from increased greenhouse gas concentrations.\n       (4) The potential impacts of global climate change, \n     including long-term drought, famine, mass migration, and \n     abrupt climatic shifts, may lead to international tensions \n     and instability in regions affected and, therefore, have \n     implications for the national security interests of the \n     United States.\n       (5) The United States has the largest economy in the world \n     and is also the largest historical emitter of greenhouse \n     gases.\n       (6) The greenhouse gas emissions of the United States are \n     projected to continue to rise.\n       (7) The greenhouse gas emissions of some developing \n     countries are rising more rapidly than the emissions of the \n     United States and will soon surpass the greenhouse gas \n     emissions of the United States and other developed countries.\n       (8) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the levels \n     necessary to avoid serious climatic disruption requires the \n     introduction of new energy technologies and other climate-\n     friendly technologies, the use of which results in low or no \n     emissions of greenhouse gases or in the capture and storage \n     of greenhouse gases.\n       (9) The 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate \n     Change commissioned by the United Kingdom and the 2008 World \n     Economic Outlook from the International Monetary Fund each \n     concluded that the economic costs of addressing climate \n     change are limited.\n       (10) The development and sale of climate-friendly \n     technologies in the United States and internationally present \n     economic opportunities for workers and businesses in the \n     United States.\n       (11) Climate-friendly technologies can improve air quality \n     by reducing harmful pollutants from stationary and mobile \n     sources and can enhance energy security by reducing reliance \n     on imported oil, diversifying energy sources, and reducing \n     the vulnerability of energy delivery infrastructure.\n       (12) Other industrialized countries are undertaking \n     measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which provides \n     the industries in those countries with a competitive \n     advantage in the growing global market for climate-friendly \n     technologies.\n       (13) Efforts to limit emissions growth in developing \n     countries in a manner that is consistent with the development \n     needs of those countries could establish significant markets \n     for climate-friendly technologies and contribute to \n     international efforts to address climate change.\n       (14) The national security of the United States will \n     increasingly depend on the deployment of diplomatic, \n     military, scientific, and economic resources for solving the \n     problem of the overreliance of the United States and the \n     world on high-carbon energy.\n       (15) The United States is a party to the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York May \n     9, 1992, and entered into force March 21, 1994 (in this \n     preamble referred to as the ``Convention'').\n       (16) The Convention sets a long-term objective of \n     stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere \n     at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic \n     interference with the climate system.\n       (17) The Convention establishes that parties bear ``common \n     but differentiated responsibilities'' for efforts to achieve \n     the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations.\n       (18) At the December 2007 United Nations Climate Change \n     Conference in Bali, the United States and other parties to \n     the Convention adopted the Bali Action Plan with the aim of \n     reaching a new global agreement in 2009.\n       (19) The Bali Action Plan calls for a shared vision on \n     long-term cooperative action, increased mitigation efforts \n     from developed and developing countries that are measurable, \n     reportable, and verifiable, and support for developing \n     countries in addressing technology transfers, adaptation, \n     financing, deforestation, and capacity-building.\n       (20) The Major Economies Process on Energy Security and \n     Climate Change, initiated by President George W. Bush, seeks \n     a consensus among the countries with the world's major \n     economies on how those countries can contribute to a new \n     agreement under the Convention.\n       (21) In April 2008, President Bush called for a ``binding \n     international agreement'' with participation by all countries \n     with major economies in ``goals and policies that reflect \n     their unique energy resources and economic circumstances''.\n       (22) An effective global effort to address climate change \n     must provide for commitments and actions by all countries \n     that are major emitters of greenhouse gases, developed and \n     developing alike, and the widely varying circumstances among \n     developed and developing countries may require that such \n     commitments and actions vary.\n       (23) The latest scientific evidence suggests that \n     anthropogenic climate change is increasing and the United \n     States has supported the goal of achieving a new \n     international agreement during 2009, both lending urgency to \n     the need for renewed United States leadership in the effort \n     to counter global climate change.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should act to reduce the health, \n     environmental, economic, and national security risks posed by \n     global climate change and to foster sustained economic growth \n     through a new generation of technologies by participating in \n     negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on \n     Climate Change, done at New York May 9, 1992, and entered \n     into force March 21, 1994, and leading efforts in other \n     international fora, with the objective of securing United \n     States participation in binding agreements, consistent with \n     the Bali Action Plan, that--\n       (A) advance and protect the economic and national security \n     interests of the United States;\n       (B) establish mitigation commitments by all countries that \n     are major emitters of greenhouse gases, consistent with the \n     principle of common but differentiated responsibilities;\n       (C) establish flexible international mechanisms to minimize \n     the cost of efforts by participating countries; and\n       (D) achieve a significant long-term reduction in global \n     greenhouse gas emissions; and\n       (2) the President should support the establishment of a \n     bipartisan Senate observer group, the members of which should \n     be designated by the chairman and ranking member of the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, to--\n       (A) monitor any international negotiations on climate \n     change; and\n       (B) ensure that the responsibility of the Senate under \n     article II, section 2 of the Constitution of the United \n     States to provide advice and consent to the President with \n     respect to treaties be carried out in a manner to facilitate \n     timely consideration of any applicable treaty submitted to \n     the Senate.\n       The provisions of this section shall become effective in 7 \n     days after enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4828.

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING INTERNATIONAL \n                   NEGOTIATIONS TO ADDRESS GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S5106]]\n\n       (1) There is a scientific consensus, as established by the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and confirmed by \n     the National Academy of Sciences, that the continued buildup \n     of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threatens \n     the stability of the global climate.\n       (2) The 2007 Fourth Assessment Report of the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that most \n     of the global warming observed since the mid-20th century is \n     very likely due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and \n     that anthropogenic warming is strongly linked to many \n     observed physical and biological impacts.\n       (3) There are significant long-term risks to the economy \n     and the environment of the United States from the temperature \n     increases and climatic disruptions that are projected to \n     result from increased greenhouse gas concentrations.\n       (4) The potential impacts of global climate change, \n     including long-term drought, famine, mass migration, and \n     abrupt climatic shifts, may lead to international tensions \n     and instability in regions affected and, therefore, have \n     implications for the national security interests of the \n     United States.\n       (5) The United States has the largest economy in the world \n     and is also the largest historical emitter of greenhouse \n     gases.\n       (6) The greenhouse gas emissions of the United States are \n     projected to continue to rise.\n       (7) The greenhouse gas emissions of some developing \n     countries are rising more rapidly than the emissions of the \n     United States and will soon surpass the greenhouse gas \n     emissions of the United States and other developed countries.\n       (8) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the levels \n     necessary to avoid serious climatic disruption requires the \n     introduction of new energy technologies and other climate-\n     friendly technologies, the use of which results in low or no \n     emissions of greenhouse gases or in the capture and storage \n     of greenhouse gases.\n       (9) The 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate \n     Change commissioned by the United Kingdom and the 2008 World \n     Economic Outlook from the International Monetary Fund each \n     concluded that the economic costs of addressing climate \n     change are limited.\n       (10) The development and sale of climate-friendly \n     technologies in the United States and internationally present \n     economic opportunities for workers and businesses in the \n     United States.\n       (11) Climate-friendly technologies can improve air quality \n     by reducing harmful pollutants from stationary and mobile \n     sources and can enhance energy security by reducing reliance \n     on imported oil, diversifying energy sources, and reducing \n     the vulnerability of energy delivery infrastructure.\n       (12) Other industrialized countries are undertaking \n     measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which provides \n     the industries in those countries with a competitive \n     advantage in the growing global market for climate-friendly \n     technologies.\n       (13) Efforts to limit emissions growth in developing \n     countries in a manner that is consistent with the development \n     needs of those countries could establish significant markets \n     for climate-friendly technologies and contribute to \n     international efforts to address climate change.\n       (14) The national security of the United States will \n     increasingly depend on the deployment of diplomatic, \n     military, scientific, and economic resources for solving the \n     problem of the overreliance of the United States and the \n     world on high-carbon energy.\n       (15) The United States is a party to the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York May \n     9, 1992, and entered into force March 21, 1994 (in this \n     preamble referred to as the ``Convention'').\n       (16) The Convention sets a long-term objective of \n     stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere \n     at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic \n     interference with the climate system.\n       (17) The Convention establishes that parties bear ``common \n     but differentiated responsibilities'' for efforts to achieve \n     the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations.\n       (18) At the December 2007 United Nations Climate Change \n     Conference in Bali, the United States and other parties to \n     the Convention adopted the Bali Action Plan with the aim of \n     reaching a new global agreement in 2009.\n       (19) The Bali Action Plan calls for a shared vision on \n     long-term cooperative action, increased mitigation efforts \n     from developed and developing countries that are measurable, \n     reportable, and verifiable, and support for developing \n     countries in addressing technology transfers, adaptation, \n     financing, deforestation, and capacity-building.\n       (20) The Major Economies Process on Energy Security and \n     Climate Change, initiated by President George W. Bush, seeks \n     a consensus among the countries with the world's major \n     economies on how those countries can contribute to a new \n     agreement under the Convention.\n       (21) In April 2008, President Bush called for a ``binding \n     international agreement'' with participation by all countries \n     with major economies in ``goals and policies that reflect \n     their unique energy resources and economic circumstances''.\n       (22) An effective global effort to address climate change \n     must provide for commitments and actions by all countries \n     that are major emitters of greenhouse gases, developed and \n     developing alike, and the widely varying circumstances among \n     developed and developing countries may require that such \n     commitments and actions vary.\n       (23) The latest scientific evidence suggests that \n     anthropogenic climate change is increasing and the United \n     States has supported the goal of achieving a new \n     international agreement during 2009, both lending urgency to \n     the need for renewed United States leadership in the effort \n     to counter global climate change.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should act to reduce the health, \n     environmental, economic, and national security risks posed by \n     global climate change and to foster sustained economic growth \n     through a new generation of technologies by participating in \n     negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on \n     Climate Change, done at New York May 9, 1992, and entered \n     into force March 21, 1994, and leading efforts in other \n     international fora, with the objective of securing United \n     States participation in binding agreements, consistent with \n     the Bali Action Plan, that--\n       (A) advance and protect the economic and national security \n     interests of the United States;\n       (B) establish mitigation commitments by all countries that \n     are major emitters of greenhouse gases, consistent with the \n     principle of common but differentiated responsibilities;\n       (C) establish flexible international mechanisms to minimize \n     the cost of efforts by participating countries; and\n       (D) achieve a significant long-term reduction in global \n     greenhouse gas emissions; and\n       (2) the President should support the establishment of a \n     bipartisan Senate observer group, the members of which should \n     be designated by the chairman and ranking member of the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, to--\n       (A) monitor any international negotiations on climate \n     change; and\n       (B) ensure that the responsibility of the Senate under \n     article II, section 2 of the Constitution of the United \n     States to provide advice and consent to the President with \n     respect to treaties be carried out in a manner to facilitate \n     timely consideration of any applicable treaty submitted to \n     the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4837.

and\n       Whereas the continuation of recovery, management, and \n     public awareness programs for bald eagles will be necessary \n     to ensure--\n       (1) the continued progress of the recovery of bald eagles; \n     and\n       (2) that the population and habitat of bald eagles will \n     remain healthy and secure for future generations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 20, 2008, as ``American Eagle Day'';\n       (2) applauds the issuance of bald eagle commemorative coins \n     by the Secretary of the Treasury as a means by which to help \n     generate critical funds for the protection of bald eagles; \n     and\n       (3) encourages--\n       (A) educational entities, organizations, businesses, \n     conservation groups, and government agencies with a shared \n     interest in conserving endangered species to collaborate and \n     develop educational tools for use in the public schools of \n     the United States; and\n       (B) the citizens of the United States to observe American \n     Eagle Day with appropriate ceremonies and other activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/04/senate-section/article/S5120-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 6049\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on June 4, 2008, by the President of \nthe United States: Tax Convention with Bulgaria with Proposed Protocol \nof Amendment, Treaty Document No. 110-18.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, \nthe Convention Between the Government of the United States of America \nand the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria for the Avoidance of \nDouble Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion With Respect to \nTaxes on Income, with accompanying Protocol, signed at Washington on \nFebruary 23, 2007 (the ``Proposed Treaty''), as well as the Protocol \nAmending the Convention Between the Government of the United States of \nAmerica and the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria for the \nAvoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion With \nRespect to Taxes on Income, signed at Sofia on February 26, 2008 (the \n``Proposed Protocol of Amendment''). The Proposed Treaty and Proposed \nProtocol of Amendment are consistent with U.S. tax treaty policy. Also \ntransmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the \nDepartment of State with respect to the Proposed Treaty and Proposed \nProtocol of Amendment.\n  The Proposed Treaty generally reduces the withholding tax on cross-\nborder dividend, interest, and royalty payments. Importantly, the \nProposed Treaty generally eliminates withholding tax on cross-border \ndividend payments to pension funds and cross-border interest payments \nmade to financial institutions. The Proposed Treaty also contains \nprovisions, consistent with current U.S. tax treaty policy, that are \ndesigned to prevent so-called treaty shopping. The Proposed Protocol of \nAmendment further strengthens these treaty shopping provisions.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Proposed Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification to \nboth the Proposed Treaty and the Proposed Protocol of Amendment.\n                                                      George W.
