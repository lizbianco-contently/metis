Mr. President, I just finished a meeting to try to lay out \nto a number of Senators what we are going to be doing on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. It is going to be extremely difficult \nfor us to get from where we are today to completing this legislation in \na timely fashion. There are some very complicated issues, some very \nstrong feelings by a lot of different Senators.\n  As highly controversial as is this war and this war funding, we are \ngoing to have to work together; otherwise, we are going to walk away \nfrom here this week with nothing done. That, I assume, is one \nalternative. It is not one I think most want, but that is an \nalternative.\n  The other problem we have, because of longstanding commitments, \nincluding the wedding of one of our Members, is we are going to start \nlosing Senators very quickly. Because of that, there are two Senators \nwho are going to leave sometime Thursday. They will not be here. We \nhave, of course, Presidentials out in the country someplace. We are \ngoing to have to try to figure out when they need to be here. Senator \nKennedy is still having tests run to determine when he can return.\n  So, to make a long story really short, we have a complicated path to \ncompleting our work, and we have to try to figure out a way to do the \nbudget in this time period also.\n  So, Mr. President, I wish I could tell Members to just take it easy, \neverybody can leave, but I think what we are coming to is we are going \nto have to finish our work Thursday or this war funding bill will not \nbe completed. That may not be the case; maybe we can work with less \nthan 100 Senators trying to get it done, but it is not an easy chore. \nIt is one that is necessary but difficult.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4426-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the supplemental spending request that \nwas sent to Congress last year by the President was unambiguous: the \nfunds were to be spent on forces in the field, on the men and women \nfighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, and on their families here at home.\n  Last week, the Democratic leadership of the House showed us what they \nthought of that request. They took it up, hollowed it out, and filled \nthe shell with a raft of unrelated domestic spending projects and \npolicy proposals that did not include a dime for the troops in the \nfield. House Democrats took a request meant for the troops and used it \nto fuel their own domestic spending habits. Then they sent this piece \nof legislation over to the Senate on the eve of Memorial Day and told \nus to vote for it. The Senate was being asked to vote not on troop \nfunding but on two other amendments. One included unemployment benefits \nand a Medicaid proposal. The other sought to undermine the \nconstitutional powers of the Commander in Chief by proposing a \nwithdrawal date from Iraq.\n  Unfortunately, our Democratic friends in the Senate made it even \nworse. Taking up what they got from the House, they added even more \nunrelated policy proposals. In the name of combat readiness, Senate \nDemocrats also sought to restrict the ability of our military \ncommanders to deploy forces, ignoring the fact that the surest way to \ndegrade troop readiness is to delay the delivery of funds that are used \nto prepare and train our forces in the first place.\n  Taken together, it seems the only issue unaddressed by the Democratic \nleadership in the House and Senate is the only one that matters: how \nand when we will fund our forces in the field.\n  The bottom line is this: Tasked with the responsibility of funding \nour forces in the field, Democrats in the House and Senate neglected \nthat task in favor of domestic spending and freelance policy proposals \nthat we know in the end will not be signed into law--this despite the \nfact that the House will soon take up the Defense authorization bill, \nwhich is ordinarily the vehicle for the kind of policy proposals our \nfriends on the other side have included in the supplemental spending \nrequest. The House has failed in its basic responsibility. It is my \nhope the Senate will do better.\n  While some of our friends on the other side seem to be counting on \nthe fact that most Americans are distracted by the ongoing Presidential \ncontest, the families and friends of U.S. soldiers and marines who are \nfighting overseas are, indeed, paying attention.\n  The President sent a request to fund these men and women. As long as \nthey remain in harm's way, we have a strict obligation to give them \nwhat they need. On this point, there really should not even be a \ndebate. The Senate must pass a bill funding our troops free of \nrestrictions on their ability to win and free of spending unrelated to \ntheir mission. And we must try to do it by Memorial Day. In less than a \nmonth, the Defense Department will be unable to make payroll for our \nuniformed Army unless Congress approves the President's supplemental \nspending request. Less than a month after that, funds for operations \nand maintenance will also run dry. It may be convenient for those \nfocused on the political calendar to ignore these pressing needs, but \nignoring them really does not make them go away.\n  I hope the Senate will do its duty this week. The majority leader \njust indicated it is challenging. Of course, it is always challenging \nto do that. But we need to do our duty this week. Our forces in Baghdad \nand Ramadi will not be taking a week off for a recess.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say respectfully to my friend that the \nlogic of his statement is really without foundation. Keep in mind, the \ncomplaint he has is the House sent us a bill that did not have war \nfunding in it. Bingo. Why? Because 132 Republicans walked out--did not \nvote. One hundred thirty-two Republicans in the House did not vote for \nwar funding. Don't blame it on the Democrats. Had 132 Republicans \nvoted, there would have been war funding. But they decided not to vote.\n  So don't blame the House for sending us only conditional aspects of \nthe war and sending us some other things, like the GI bill of rights. \nWe have funded this war on borrowed money, spending $5,000 a second on \nthis war--borrowed money. The House made a decision. They said: Well, \ndon't you think it is a good idea we spend some money on the troops \ncoming home, as we did in World War II, so they can get an education? \nThis bill, written by Jim Webb, was adopted by the House \noverwhelmingly. And they did something else: It is paid for, not like \nthe war. The war is not paid for. The GI bill of rights is paid for, as \nwe have it.\n  So, Mr. President, I know we have a difficult road ahead of us \nbecause we do not have war funding in this bill because the Republicans \nin the House did not vote for it. Don't blame it on the House \nDemocrats. There were enough of them to get a majority to do it. The \nRepublicans walked out.\n  But I say, Mr. President, is it any wonder that the House Republicans \nhave lost three special elections in districts that are overwhelmingly \nRepublican? In Illinois, the former Speaker of the House, Dennis \nHastert's district--they lost that. They lost a seat in a special \nelection in Louisiana that was a slam dunk Republican district. And \nthen in Mississippi, they lost one. Is it any wonder when they do \ntricks like this: ``Democrats didn't fund the war''? ``Well, don't \ncheck too closely because 132 of us just walked out and didn't vote.''\n  So I am here, Mr. President. We are going to go to this bill this \nafternoon. I spoke briefly to the distinguished Republican leader \nyesterday. We are going to have to try to figure out some way to work \ntogether to get votes. At the end of the day, we will see what happens. \nIn the past, war funding has been--after a lot of arm-twisting and \ncajoling, there have been enough votes\n\n[[Page S4427]]\n\nto get that. I don't know if the votes are here this time, but we \ncertainly recognize that we have an issue, and we are going to do the \nbest we can with my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from \nKentucky, to see what we can do to get to a point where we have this \nwar funding over with until sometime next June. If we can't get it \ndone, then we are going to have to worry about what we do in the next \nmonth, as he said, but hopefully we can complete it this week.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one additional word. The process for \ndoing this has been offensive, I know, both in the House and in the \nSenate. It is my understanding that what will happen later this week is \nthe tree will be filled and cloture will be filed. If any amendments \nare allowed on the floor of the Senate, it will be because my good \nfriend, the majority leader, decided to let us have a vote. The whole \nprocess is one that doesn't immediately engender a great level of \ncooperation.\n  Having said that, the underlying legislation is important, and \nhopefully somehow we will find our way through this process this week, \nbut I think it is pretty safe to say that 49 Republicans of the U.S. \nSenate are going to insist on being an important part of the process. \nHopefully, we will be able to sort all that out and work our way \nthrough it and get this important piece of legislation out of the \nSenate and on the way, at least, back to the House or, hopefully, if we \nare lucky, back to the President for signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4427-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration and the Senate now \nproceed to S. Res. 496.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 496) honoring the 60th anniversary of \n     the commencement of the carving of the Crazy Horse Memorial.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to speak today about the Crazy \nHorse Memorial in South Dakota. On June 3, 2008, the Crazy Horse \nMemorial will celebrate the 60th anniversary of its dedication. Gutzon \nBorglum, who was the sculptor behind Mount Rushmore, brought Korczak \nZiolkowski to South Dakota to work on Mount Rushmore. It was during \nconstruction of Mount Rushmore when Lakota Chief Henry Standing Bear \ncontacted Korczak Ziolkowski and stated ``My fellow chiefs and I would \nlike the white man to know the red man has great heroes, too.'' It is \nbelieved that this statement led Mr. Ziolkowski to construct this \nmemorial.\n  On June 3, 1948, this memorial was dedicated and construction has \ncontinued ever since. Mr. Ziolkowski worked on this memorial until the \nconclusion of his own life in 1982, when his wife, Ruth, took up the \njob that her husband began. The Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation was \nestablished and runs entirely on gifts and donations. No government \nfunds have ever been used for construction of this memorial. With no \nway to predict when completion of this memorial will take place due to \ncost and weather, construction continues. When it is completed, \nhowever, it will be the largest carving on earth, measuring some 641 \nfeet long by 563 feet high. To put that in perspective, it is said that \nall four heads on Mount Rushmore could fit into Crazy Horse's head.\n  Today, I wish to honor Korczak Ziolkowski, his wife, and their family \nfor their continued work on this monument. In addition, I would like to \nhonor those involved with the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation. Most \nimportantly, I wish to honor the memory of the great Lakota warrior to \nwhom this memorial is dedicated, Crazy Horse, as well as all Lakota \npeople for their great many contributions to our history and culture in \nSouth Dakota. It is they that this memorial is to honor.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 496) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n   The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 496\n\n       Whereas sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski, who never received any \n     formal art training but nonetheless won 1st place for \n     sculpture at the New York World's Fair in 1939, came to the \n     Black Hills of South Dakota as an assistant to Gutzon Borglum \n     to help carve Mount Rushmore;\n       Whereas Lakota Chief Henry Standing Bear contacted Korczak \n     Ziolkowski in 1939 to encourage him to create another \n     mountain memorial, saying in his letter of invitation: ``My \n     fellow chiefs and I would like the white man to know the red \n     man has great heroes, too'';\n       Whereas Crazy Horse was remembered by his people as a \n     fierce warrior and visionary leader who was committed to \n     preserving the traditional Lakota way of life;\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski was inspired to honor the \n     culture, tradition, and living heritage of North American \n     Indians, and thus designed a metaphoric tribute to the spirit \n     of Crazy Horse and his people;\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski was dedicated as well to helping \n     his country preserve freedom, enlisted in the Army, and was \n     wounded in 1944 at Omaha Beach;\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski returned to South Dakota after \n     World War II in order to find a suitable mountain to carve in \n     order to honor Crazy Horse and his people;\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski and Chief Standing Bear \n     dedicated the Crazy Horse Memorial on June 3, 1948;\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski worked until his death in 1982, \n     and his wife, Ruth, and their family have dedicated their \n     lives to carving the mountain and continuing the mission of \n     the Crazy Horse Memorial;\n       Whereas there is no way to predict when the mountain \n     carving will be completed, owing to the uncertainty of \n     weather, the availability of private funding, and the \n     challenges of mountain engineering;\n       Whereas, when completed, the Crazy Horse mountain carving \n     will be the largest carving in the world, at 641 feet long by \n     563 feet high;\n       Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski's parting words to his wife \n     were, ``You must work on the mountain--but go slowly so you \n     do it right'';\n       Whereas the Ziolkowski family and the Crazy Horse Memorial \n     Foundation have continued to do it right, have proceeded \n     without government financial support, and remain dedicated to \n     making steady progress on the Memorial's humanitarian goals; \n     and\n       Whereas the Crazy Horse Memorial will celebrate the 60th \n     anniversary of the dedication of the mountain carving on June \n     3, 2008: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate, on the 60th anniversary of the \n     commencement of the mountain carving of the Crazy Horse \n     Memorial, honors sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski, the Ziolkowski \n     family, and the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation for their \n     dedication to honoring the culture, tradition, and living \n     heritage of North American Indians and the spirit of Crazy \n     Horse and his people.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the resolution that was adopted by the \nSenate is S. Res. 496, which I introduced on April 2, 2008, along with \nmy colleague from South Dakota, Senator Tim Johnson. The resolution \nhonors the 60th anniversary of the Crazy Horse Memorial.\n  The Crazy Horse Memorial, located in the Black Hills of South Dakota, \nhonors the culture, the tradition, and the living heritage of Native \nAmericans. Once completed, the memorial will stand more than 22 stories \nhigh and be the largest mountain sculpture in the world. Every year, \nthere is an event called the Volksmarch, in which people start at the \nbase and walk up to the very top of the monument. You cannot appreciate \nthe size and the dimension of this great monument from\n\n[[Page S4428]]\n\na distance. It is only when you get up close that the true dimensions \nof this monument come into full view. I have had that opportunity on \nthe Volksmarch, with my family, to walk up and stand next to this \nmonument and to have an appreciation for its true dimension and for \nwhat it means to my State of South Dakota and to the Native American \nculture.\n  The sculptor of this monument, Korczak Ziolkowski, had no formal \ntraining and originally came to South Dakota to assist Gutzon Borglum \nin the carving of Mount Rushmore. In 1939, Chief Henry Standing Bear \ninvited him to construct another mountain monument, this one to honor a \ngreat Native American hero. However, it was not until June 3, in 1948, \nthat the project was officially dedicated.\n  Crazy Horse, a great Lakota chief, was selected as the Native \nAmerican hero worthy of the mountain monument because of his courage in \nbattle, his visionary leadership, and his commitment to the \npreservation of the traditional Lakota way of life. The memorial was \nplaced in the Black Hills of South Dakota because they are sacred to \nthe Lakota people. While Crazy Horse was never photographed, the \ncompleted monument will feature a likeness of him riding a horse and \npointing with his left hand out toward the Black Hills.\n  Ziolkowski, who worked tirelessly and without salary on the Crazy \nHorse Memorial until his death in 1982, believed in individual \ninitiative and private enterprise and worked to build the memorial \nwithout any Federal funding. As my colleagues can see from the photo we \nhave here, the face of Crazy Horse is complete, the rest of the \nmountain has been roughly blocked out, and efforts are currently \nfocused on carving the horse's head.\n  While there is no way to predict the date of completion because of \nweather, financing, and the challenges of carving a mountain, \nZiolkowski's wife Ruth, who is an amazingly determined woman, and his \nfamily, along with the help of thousands of donors and visitors, \ncontinues Ziolkowski's mission of honoring Native Americans through the \nconstruction of this monument.\n  Therefore, today I rise to honor the 60th anniversary of the Crazy \nHorse Memorial and send my best wishes to all those working to make \nKorczak Ziolkowski's vision a reality.\n  I thank the Senate for its adoption of the resolution, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4428-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4428-S4429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX POLICY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, every now and then there is an article or an \nop-ed in the newspaper that you find compelling by its clear logic and \nyou want to share it with your colleagues. I wish to do that today and \nat the conclusion of my remarks put the full text of this op-ed in the \nrecord.\n  Today's Wall Street Journal carried an op-ed by David Ranson called \n``You Can't Soak the Rich.'' I find it compelling because of the \nproposals by some that we should raise the marginal income tax rates \nand thereby theoretically increase revenues to the Treasury. What \nRanson points out is it is essentially a law of economics that raising \ntax rates not only does not bring in more revenue to the Treasury based \non the historic record, but it can have precisely the opposite effect \nbecause it can harm the economy and, in fact, it is the growth in the \neconomy that produces more revenue to the Federal Treasury.\n  Let me quote a couple of comments from his op-ed. He said:\n\n       No matter what the tax rates have been, in postwar America \n     tax revenues have remained at about 19.5 percent of GDP.\n\n  Now, there is another measure. If you go back somewhat less distance, \nthe measure is about 1 percent less than that as a percentage of GDP, \nbut the ratio remains the same and the point he is making remains the \nsame, which is that raising tax rates does not raise revenue. In fact, \nraising tax rates can hurt the economy, which then reduces tax revenue.\n  There is a chart in this op-ed that makes the point. The Federal tax \nyield, which is revenues divided by the gross domestic product, has \nremained close to 19.5 percent, even as the top tax bracket was brought \ndown from 91 percent to the present 35 percent. One would think that \nthe difference between a 91-percent top marginal rate and 35 percent \nwould represent a dramatic difference in revenues collected. In point \nof fact, it has not been. He points out why a little bit later in his \nop-ed. He says:\n\n       The data show that the tax yield has been independent of \n     marginal tax rates over this period, but tax revenue is \n     directly proportional to GDP.\n\n  In other words, the strength of the economy.\n  He goes on:\n\n       So if we want to increase tax revenue, we need to increase \n     GDP.\n       What happens if we instead raise tax rates? Economists of \n     all persuasions accept that a tax rate hike will reduce GDP, \n     in which case Hauser's Law--\n\n  The law he is citing here--\n\n     says it will also lower tax revenue. That's a highly \n     inconvenient truth for redistributive tax policy, and it \n     flies in the face of deeply felt beliefs about social \n     justice. It would surely be unpopular today with those \n     presidential candidates who plan to raise tax rates on the \n     rich--if they knew about it.\n\n  He goes on to answer the question I posed earlier: What makes this \nlaw work? I am quoting now:\n\n       As Mr. Hauser said: ``Raising taxes encourages taxpayers to \n     shift, hide and underreport income. . . . Higher taxes reduce \n     the incentives to work, produce, invest and save, thereby \n     dampening overall economic activity and job creation.''\n       Putting it a different way, capital migrates away from \n     regimes in which it is treated harshly, and toward regimes in \n     which it is free to be invested profitably and safely. In \n     this regard, the capital controlled by our richest citizens \n     is especially tax-intolerant.\n\n  The point he is making is that if you are wealthy, you have the \nability to move your income around, to hire accountants and tax lawyers \nto find ways to shield your income, and the bottom line is the \nGovernment never gets any more of it than if the rate remained at a \nlower level.\n  In fact, he points out that revenue collections by the Government \nhave remained almost constant over this 40-year period and that their \nratio to the GDP has remained almost constant; the point being that the \nrevenue collected by the Government is most in relation to the state of \nthe economy. It is mostly dependent upon the economy. As the economy \ngrows, revenues to the Federal Treasury grow. As the economy slows, tax \nrevenues slow, and that is exactly what we are seeing right now.\n  So we should take two important lessons from this. No. 1, in a time \nof economic downturn, which is what we are in right now, the last thing \nyou would want to do is to raise tax rates because you are going to \nhurt the economy and you are not going to bring in any additional \nrevenue. Secondly, this speaks to the point my colleague from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, has been making, which is that, in the long term, what \nyou want to do is reduce tax rates if you can--at least leave them \nwhere they are but not raise them--if you want to be fair both to the \nAmerican family and help the economy grow and get us out of this \neconomic downturn. Incidentally, that is what will produce the most \nrevenue for the Federal Treasury to pay for all that the Congress and \nthe President end up passing in legislation and passing on to American \ntaxpayers.\n  So I ask unanimous consent to place this op-ed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 20, 2008]\n\n                        You Can't Soak the Rich\n\n                           (By David Ranson)\n\n       Kurt Hauser is a San Francisco investment economist who, 15 \n     years ago, published fresh and eye-opening data about the \n     federal tax system. His findings imply that there are \n     draconian constraints on the ability of tax-rate increases to \n     generate fresh revenues. I think his discovery deserves to be \n     called Hauser's Law, because it is as central to the \n     economics of taxation as Boyle's Law is to the physics of \n     gases. Yet economists and policy makers are barely aware of \n     it.\n       Like science, economics advances as verifiable patterns are \n     recognized and codified. But economics is in a far earlier \n     stage of evolution than physics. Unfortunately, it is often \n     poisoned by political wishful thinking, just as medieval \n     science was poisoned by religious doctrine. Taxation is an \n     important example.\n       The interactions among the myriad participants in a tax \n     system are as impossible to unravel as are those of the \n     molecules in a gas, and the effects of tax policies are \n     speculative and highly contentious. Will increasing tax rates \n     on the rich increase revenues,\n\n[[Page S4429]]\n\n     as Barack Obama hopes, or hold back the economy, as John \n     McCain fears? Or both?\n       Mr. Hauser uncovered the means to answer these questions \n     definitively. On this page in 1993, he stated that ``No \n     matter what the tax rates have been, in postwar America tax \n     revenues have remained at about 19.5% of GDP.'' What a pity \n     that his discovery has not been more widely disseminated.\n       The chart, updating the evidence to 2007, confirms Hauser's \n     Law. The federal tax ``yield'' (revenues divided by GDP) has \n     remained close to 19.5%, even as the top tax bracket was \n     brought down from 91% to the present 35%. This is what \n     scientists call an ``independence theorem,'' and it cuts the \n     Gordian Knot of tax policy debate.\n       The data show that the tax yield has been independent of \n     marginal tax rates over this period, but tax revenue is \n     directly proportional to GDP. So if we want to increase tax \n     revenue, we need to increase GDP.\n       What happens if we instead raise tax rates? Economists of \n     all persuasions accept that a tax rate hike will reduce GDP, \n     in which case Hauser's Law says it will also lower tax \n     revenue. That's a highly inconvenient truth for \n     redistributive tax policy, and it flies in the face of deeply \n     felt beliefs about social justice. It would surely be \n     unpopular today with those presidential candidates who plan \n     to raise tax rates on the rich--if they knew about it.\n       Although Hauser's Law sounds like a restatement of the \n     Laffer Curve (and Mr. Hauser did cite Arthur Laffer in his \n     original article), it has independent validity. Because Mr. \n     Laffer's curve is a theoretical insight, theoreticians find \n     it easy to quibble with. Test cases, where the economy \n     responds to a tax change, always lend themselves to many \n     alternative explanations. Conventional economists, despite \n     immense publicity, have yet to swallow the Laffer Curve. When \n     it is mentioned at all by critics, it is often as an object \n     of scorn.\n       Because Mr. Hauser's horizontal straight line is a simple \n     fact, it is ultimately far more compelling. It also presents \n     a major opportunity. It seems likely that the tax system \n     could maintain a 19.5% yield with a top bracket even lower \n     than 35%.\n       What makes Hauser's Law work? For supply-siders there is no \n     mystery. As Mr. Hauser said: ``Raising taxes encourages \n     taxpayers to shift, hide and underreport income. . . . Higher \n     taxes reduce the incentives to work, produce, invest and \n     save, thereby dampening overall economic activity and job \n     creation.''\n       Putting it a different way, capital migrates away from \n     regimes in which it is treated harshly, and toward regimes in \n     which it is free to be invested profitably and safely. In \n     this regard, the capital controlled by our richest citizens \n     is especially tax-intolerant.\n       The economics of taxation will be moribund until economists \n     accept and explain Hauser's Law. For progress to be made, \n     they will have to face up to it, reconcile it with other \n     facts, and incorporate it within the body of accepted \n     knowledge. And if this requires overturning existing \n     doctrine, then so be it.\n       Presidential candidates, instead of disputing how much more \n     tax to impose on whom, would be better advised to come up \n     with plans for increasing GDP while ridding the tax system of \n     its wearying complexity. That would be a formula for success.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to review the op-ed and \napply it to the lessons we have today. In fact, the legislation we will \nbe taking up today increases taxes--increases the tax rate--by applying \na 0.5-cent surcharge or surtax on the top marginal rate. This is going \nto be very destructive. Over 80 percent of the people who report that \ntop marginal rate, report small business income. So we are going to be \nhurting the small businesses of this country, not the big businesses or \nthe wealthy that the surcharge is intended to hit, and we will end up \nnot increasing Federal revenues but actually decreasing them and \nhurting the economy in the process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday on the Senate floor the \ndistinguished majority leader mentioned my name and repeated a claim \nabout my service as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which I once \nagain am compelled to correct. He said: ``Sixty of President Clinton's \nnominees were denied hearings.''\n  In a letter to the distinguished minority leader and the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee dated April 30, \n2008, he similarly stated that:\n\n       Senator Hatch exercised the chairman's prerogatives freely \n     during the years in which more than 60 of President Clinton's \n     nominees were denied hearings or floor consideration.\n\n  The claim--and it has been repeated in various forms by others--is \nthat all these nominees could have been confirmed but were not because \nI simply blocked them.\n  What is not mentioned is President Clinton came within seven of \nsetting an all-time judicial appointment record while I was chairman. \nHe was treated fairly. I had hearings and moved people to the floor \nthat many on our side had real qualms about. It is true that \napproximately 60 of his judicial nominees were not confirmed, not in 1 \nyear, as the distinguished majority leader said yesterday, but in all 8 \nyears. They were not confirmed for a host of different reasons, most \nhaving nothing to do with the chairman's prerogatives.\n  President Clinton, for example, withdrew a dozen of those nominees \nhimself--actually withdrew them. That was not my prerogative as \nchairman; it was his prerogative as President. These withdrawn nominees \nincluded a nominee to the U.S. District Court whose record as a State \ncourt judge in criminal cases was so troubling that prosecutors in her \nown State, led by a Democrat, opposed her. Instead of certain defeat on \nthe Senate floor, the Republican leader at the time allowed President \nClinton to withdraw her nomination. She was not denied a hearing; she \nhad a hearing and was reported to the floor. She was not denied floor \nconsideration; she was spared floor defeat.\n  The unconfirmed Clinton nominees included an appeals court nominee \nwho, though he had raised millions for the Democratic Party, admitted \nin his hearing that he knew virtually nothing about such basic areas as \ncriminal or constitutional law. President Clinton wisely withdrew him. \nThese unconfirmed nominees included an appeals court nominee who had \nlied about his background, making claims that were politically potent \nbut patently false. President Clinton withdrew him. Was he unconfirmed? \nYes. Was he blocked by Republicans? No. These and others like them were \nnot what some on the other side of the aisle have called pocket \nfilibusters. They were not, as the distinguished majority leader has \nsaid, simply denied consideration at the chairman's prerogative.\n  The unconfirmed Clinton nominees include many who did not have the \nsupport of their home State Senators. Nominees in this situation did \nnot receive hearings under the chairmen before me as well as those who \nsucceeded me, including the current Democrat chairman who will not call \nthem up if a home State Senator opposes them. That is the policy and \ntradition of the Judiciary Committee, not simply the chairman's \nprerogative. Nor is it a pocket filibuster. That is a phony term. Yet, \nthese nominees were unconfirmed and are, therefore, lumped into this \ncategory. So are nominees who were not confirmed in the Congress during \nwhich they were nominated and President Clinton chose not to \nrenominate. That was his choice, not mine. For these and other reasons, \nthe vast majority of President Clinton's unconfirmed nominees did not \nmake it all the way through the confirmation process for reasons having \nnothing to do with my chairmanship of the committee.\n  Now, there are always, at the end of every Presidency, those nominees \nwho are put up too late, where you could not get the FBI work done or \nyou could not get the investigatory work done or you couldn't get the \nABA report done or there were nominees who had problems in their FBI \nreports. There were further reasons nominees could not make it at the \nend of President Clinton's term. I might add that is true of every \nPresidential term that I recall in my 32 years in the Senate. It is \nalso true that I put through nominees that my side had a lot of angst \nover because I believed, as I always did in my chairmanship, the \nPresident had the power of nomination. We had the power to vote, up or \ndown, against those nominees. So I brought up people who caused a lot \nof angst on our side because I believed the President deserved that--\nunlike some on our side who have been very badly mistreated. I will \ncite Peter Keisler as a perfect illustration.\n  So I had to come here and set the record straight once again. Some \njudicial nominees of every President are not eventually confirmed. My \nfriends on the other side of the aisle returned more than 50 \nunconfirmed judicial nominees to President Bush at the\n\n[[Page S4430]]\n\nclose of the 102nd Congress. But when the reasons nominees are not \nconfirmed are accurately considered, the claim that some 60 Clinton \nnominees were simply pocket filibustered or were blocked at the \nchairman's prerogative is simply not true.\n  I believe it to be a gross misrepresentation. I don't blame the \nmajority leader. He is a personal friend of mine. He read from a staff-\nprepared speech. Nevertheless, that speech was wrong.\n  Let me give you an illustration. These are people sitting right now \non the calendar. Peter Keisler has been waiting 691 days for a vote in \nthe Judiciary Committee. By any measure, he is highly competent, \ndecent, and honorable. He has the highest rating from the American Bar \nAssociation. Judge Robert Conrad has been waiting 308 days for a \nJudiciary Committee hearing. He also has the highest ABA rating. This \nbody confirmed him just three years, without a dissenting vote, to the \ndistrict court, where he is now chief judge. Steve Matthews has been \nwaiting 257 days for a hearing. He too has first-rate qualifications \nand a positive ABA rating. Many others are still awaiting a vote, as we \nhave been sitting in the Senate not doing very much regarding judicial \nnominees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4430-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4430-S4431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ELDER JUSTICE ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, since May is a month to honor and recognize \nolder Americans, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about my \nstrong commitment to having the Elder Justice Act, S. 1070, approved by \nCongress and signed into law before the conclusion of the 110th \nCongress.\n  Emily Dickinson once said, old age comes on suddenly, and not \ngradually as is thought. As someone who just celebrated a birthday a \nfew months ago, this statement has never seemed more accurate!\n  Approximately 44 million people in this country are age 60 and above \nwhich tells me that caring for older Americans must be a high priority \nof future Congresses.\n  In fact, U.S. citizens 60 years of age and above will increase \ndramatically over the next 30 years more than 76 million baby boomers \nwill be approaching retirement and old age over the next three decades. \nLet me say that one more time--more than 76 million baby boomers will \nbe approaching retirement and old age over the next three decades.\n  Earlier this Congress, Senators Lincoln, Smith, Kohl and I introduced \nthe Elder Justice Act. Congressmen Rahm Emanuel and Peter King \nintroduced a nearly identical bill in the House. Currently, the Senate \nbill has 28 cosponsors and the House bill has 113 cosponsors.\n  One person who really deserves a lot of the credit for this bill is \nour former colleague from Louisiana, Senator John Breaux. He got the \nball rolling over here in the Senate. I will never forget him coming to \nme way back in the 107th Congress and telling me that I needed to work \nwith him on the Elder Justice Act because it would make a tremendous \ndifference for older Americans throughout the country. He and I \nintroduced the Elder Justice Act back in the 107th Congress and ever \nsince then, the bill has been reintroduced each subsequent Congress.\n  I also want to acknowledge the fine work of the Elder Justice \nCoalition, led by Bob Blancato, its national coordinator.\n  To date, the Elder Justice Coalition has close to 550 members and has \ndone an incredible job advocating for the passage of this legislation.\n  This Congress, for the first time, the Elder Justice Act has been \nseriously considered by the House. Last week, the House Judiciary \nCommittee considered the Elder Justice Act and it appears that it will \nbe voted out of that committee this week. In the Senate, the \nlegislation has been reported unanimously by the Finance Committee in \nboth the 109th and 108th Congress; however, it has never been approved \nby the full Senate. As far as I am concerned, this year is going to be \ndifferent. I will do everything in my power to ensure that this \nlegislation will pass the Senate and be signed into law before the \n110th Congress adjourns.\n  Senator Lincoln and I are going to work with Finance Committee \nChairman Max Baucus and Ranking Member Chuck Grassley to schedule a \nmarkup on this bill sometime this summer.\n  Over the past couple of years, I worked very closely with Health and \nHuman Services Secretary Mike Leavitt and his staff to address the \nconcerns that the administration has raised regarding our bill. Last \nCongress, I felt like we had some fruitful discussions and progress was \nmade. Secretary Leavitt is a good friend of mine and he knows how \nimportant it is to me, Senator Lincoln and senior citizens across the \ncountry to have this legislation signed into law. The Secretary assured \nme that he and his staff would continue to work with us on this bill.\n  So I intend to initiate discussions with the administration once \nagain in the hope that we will be able to come to agreement. And I \nthink we are very close.\n  I have had many ask why does there appear to be such a dramatic \nincrease in elder abuse in the United States. Because there is so \nlittle data on elder abuse, it is difficult to know the answer to that \nquestion.\n  Quite honestly, I believe that more and more people are taking \nnotice.\n  In the past, there has been no data collection of elder abuse--I find \nthat quite disturbing. The purpose of our legislation is to make \nchanges in the law so we have more precise numbers on how many seniors \nare being exploited financially, being neglected or being physically or \nmentally abused.\n  Findings from the often cited National Elder Abuse Incidence Study \nsuggest that more than 500,000 Americans aged 60 and above were victims \nof domestic abuse in 1996. Studies show the amount of Federal dollars \nspent on abuse and neglect of elders is substantially smaller than that \nspent on child and domestic abuse.\n  Elder abuse is a profoundly personal tragedy for its victims--let me \ncite a case from my home state of Utah. In Utah and across the country, \nelderly Americans are being exploited and essentially being swindled \nout of thousands of dollars. A local news station in Salt Lake recently \nhad a story that discussed check scams and how seniors are typically \nthe target of these questionable operations.\n  In Utah alone, the money that people have lost due to these types of \nscams has quadrupled over the last 3 years. And while many of these \noperations have addresses in the U.S., they typically originate \noverseas.\n  For example, a check has been made out to a Salt Lake City senior for \nclose to $4,000. The senior is told that he has been chosen to be a \nsecret shopper and has the chance to win thousands of dollars. He is \ntold that he may keep $500, no strings attached, but he must wire more \nthan $3,000 back to them in order to get the $500. Because this senior \nsees the chance to win $500, he sends the check for $3,000 and loses \nall of his money.\n  According to the postal inspector, once a person responds to these \nscams, he or she is put on what is called a sucker's list and continues \nto be promised that hundreds and even thousands of dollars could be \ngained if a check is sent. In Utah, 6 to 700 checks are reported to be \nsent to these organizations each month.\n  The Elder Justice Act would help the Federal Government collect data \non how many senior citizens are being financially exploited, mentally \nand physically abused and neglected.\n  This chart illustrates the dramatic difference in dollars spent on \nelder abuse compared to child abuse and domestic abuse.\n  Ninety-one percent, or $6.7 billion, is spent on child abuse, 7 \npercent, or $520 million on domestic abuse and only 2 percent, or \n$153.5 million, is spent on elder abuse. Considering the high numbers \nof the population above age 60, it astounds me the small percentage the \nGovernment is willing to dedicate to ending elder abuse.\n  The Elder Justice Act aims to address this serious problem.\n  Our bill would provide Federal resources to support State and \ncommunity efforts on the front lines dedicated to fighting elder abuse \nwith scarce resources and fragmented systems.\n  It directs the Federal Government to provide leadership to the States \nand takes an important first step by calling on the Federal Government \nto create an appropriate way to collect relevant data on elder abuse so \nwe have a better handle on how prevalent elder abuse is among our \nneighbors, our friends, and our relatives.\n  It assures adequate public-private infrastructure and resources to \nprevent,\n\n[[Page S4431]]\n\ndetect, treat, understand, intervene in and, where appropriate, \nprosecute elder abuse, neglect and exploitation.\n  With more than 76 million baby boomers retiring over the next three \ndecades, we cannot wait any longer for this legislation to pass. Older \nAmericans deserve nothing less. I know that it is extremely important \nto folks back home in Utah.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so we \ncan provide older Americans the same protections that we provide to our \nchildren and victims of domestic violence. Because we are not aging \ngradually, our response must be immediate--we cannot afford to wait for \nanother Congress to end without approving this legislation.\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, men are respectable only as they \nrespect. May we strive to be more respectable people by showing respect \nto those who deserve it the most: our older Americans.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, each May, our Nation pays tribute to the \ncontribution older Americans have made to our great country as many \ncommunities all across our great Nation come together to celebrate \nOlder Americans Month.\n  Having grown up in eastern Arkansas in a small community, the \ndaughter of a farmer, I was within walking distance of both my \ngrandparents. I learned incredible lessons from them that I still carry \nwith me today. I imagine there are many of my Senate colleagues who can \nstop and think about a wonderful memory of growing up with grandparents \nor maybe an older aunt or uncle who lived nearby, perhaps it was a \nfavorite schoolteacher or a mentor in the community or in their \nneighborhood.\n  The pride and dedication older Americans have had for our country was \nimpressed upon me from a very early age, from all of those different \nfigures in my life--my grandparents, obviously, but also from wonderful \nteachers, as well as neighbors, those who shared their stories with me, \nthey shared their values with me, they helped me become the person I am \ntoday. Whether it was hearing about my grandfathers' service in World \nWar I--both of them having served as infantrymen in World War I--or \nmaybe it was the jar my grandmother left on the mantelpiece that stored \nthe coins during the Great Depression or the story of my neighbor who, \nduring World War II, flew over ``the hump'' and did tremendous feats in \nWorld War II, so many people who have affected my life. Again, I am \nsure that if any Senator takes the time, they will remember their lives \nhave been affected as well by an individual just like that.\n  Even though I didn't know it, I was a caregiver at an early age when \nit was one of my and my cousin's tasks to take dinner, nightly meals \nover to our grandparents' house. Later in my life, when my grandmother \nwas ill and lived with us in our home and I shared a room with her, \nthat time spent with my grandparents and with others, other elderly \npeople in my community and in my neighborhood--they were priceless for \nboth of us. Not only was I able to give something of my energy and my \nexperiences in the current time, but it was wonderful also for her, my \ngrandmother, who lived with us, because she was able to share her \nexperiences and values with me, and I was able to learn so many of \nlife's lessons from her and from the others in my community.\n  Today's world is so much different. Even though we no longer live \nwithin walking distance of our parents or grandparents, my husband \nSteve and I make a very conscious effort to ensure that our children \nspend quality time with their grandparents. It seems appropriate, then, \nduring Older Americans Month that I rise this morning to draw attention \nto a piece of legislation that I and my good friend and colleague from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, who has been on the Senate floor earlier this \nmorning, have introduced that seeks to protect millions of older \nAmericans. It is the Elder Justice Act.\n\n  I also want to note that Chairman Kohl and ranking member Gordon \nSmith of the Senate Special Committee on Aging have been champions of \nthis legislation as well, and I certainly appreciate all they do in \nbringing about both support as well as knowledge of this piece of \nlegislation.\n  I have been a cosponsor of the Elder Justice Act since it was \noriginally introduced in 2002, and I helped pass a version of this bill \nout of the Senate Finance Committee in 2004, in 2005, and again in \n2006. Unfortunately, the Elder Justice Act has yet to become law \ndespite the fact that our Nation continues to grow older and despite \nthe fact that the tragedy of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation \ncontinues.\n  It is hard for any of us to imagine that our elderly loved ones would \nbe victim to those types of actions, the abuse or neglect or \nexploitation that exists in this country. We have held hearings on \nelder abuse for almost 25 years. Yet not one single Federal employee \nworks full time on this issue. We are beginning to make progress. I \nencourage all my colleagues to join me, not only in this month when we \ncelebrate the wonderful heritage of older Americans, but to ensure that \nwe move a piece of legislation that will protect them.\n  The House of Representatives recently held its first hearing on this \nissue in 17 years--thanks to the hard work of Congressman Rahm Emmanuel \nand Peter King--and the Elder Justice Act is currently going through \nthe committee markup in that body. In addition to adding cosponsors, we \nare looking for opportunities to pass this legislation this year in the \nSenate.\n  Abuse of our senior citizens can be physical, it can be sexual, it \ncan be psychological, or it can be financial. The perpetrator may be a \nstranger, it may be an acquaintance, it may be a paid caregiver, it \nmight be a corporation and, sadly, even a spouse or another family \nmember. We have an obligation to the older Americans of this country \nnot to sit around for another 25 years but to come up with the \nsolutions that already exist for so many other Americans. Elder abuse \nhappens everywhere and at all levels of income and in all geographic \nareas, whether you live in an urban area or out on a county road in \nrural America. No matter how rich you are, and no matter where you \nlive, no one is immune. When we say no one is immune, it means none of \nour loved ones are immune from this horrific act.\n  Congress must make our seniors a priority and pass the Elder Justice \nAct as soon as possible. This bill represents a consensus agreement \ndeveloped by the Elder Justice Coalition, a national coalition of 547 \nmembers, including 226 organizations and 321 individuals, dedicated to \neliminating elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation in this great \ncountry of ours. This bill reminds us that Congress has already passed \ncomprehensive bills to address child abuse and violence against women \nbut has continued to ignore the fact that we have no Federal law \nenacted to date on elder abuse.\n  We have made great strides. I know, as cochairman of the Senate \nCaucus on Missing and Exploited Children, we have made great strides in \nhow we can better protect our children from exploitation and from all \nthe different fears and dangers that are out there. Why would we not \nwant to do this for the wonderful elderly people of this country who \nhave given all of us so very much?\n  Every older American has the right to enjoy his or her golden years \nfree of abuse and neglect. As Americans age--and I know and many of us \nknow from personal experience--they want to maintain their independence \nand their dignity and their pride. It is very difficult when they \nbecome exploited or abused or neglected. It is hard for them to reach \nout and ask for help and care, particularly of their children. It is \nnot something easy for them to do. It is why we have the responsibility \nin the Senate to do something about elder abuse.\n  The Elder Justice Act will enhance our knowledge about abuse of our \nseniors in all of its terrible forms. It will elevate elder abuse to \nthe national stage. We cannot solve this problem if we do not \nunderstand it, we do not know how it occurs, and we do not begin to use \nthe tools we have already to protect the seniors of this country. Too \nmany of our seniors suffer needlessly. Each year anywhere between\n\n[[Page S4432]]\n\n500,000 and 5 million seniors in our country are abused. They are \nabused, neglected, or exploited, and, sadly, most of those abuses go \nunreported.\n  This historical problem will only worsen as 77 million baby boomers \nbegin to age. The Elder Justice Act confronts elder abuse in the same \nway we combat child abuse and violence against women--through law \nenforcement, public health programs, and social services at all levels \nof government. We are not talking about reinventing the wheel, we are \ntalking about using what we have learned in the abuse of children and \nin the abuse of women and applying those tools to one of our greatest \nblessings, the elderly of this country.\n  The bill also establishes research projects to assist in the \ndevelopment of future legislation. The Elder Justice Act will take \nsteps to make older Americans safer in their own homes, in nursing home \nfacilities, in neighborhoods all across this country. It enhances the \ndetection of elder abuse, and it helps seniors recover from abuse after \nit happens. It increases collaboration between Federal agencies and \nbetween Federal, State, local, and private entities, law enforcement, \nlong-term care facilities, consumer advocates, and families to prevent \nand treat elder abuse.\n  I urge my colleagues, all of them, to remember those individuals in \nyour life, certainly in your communities, and others who have given so \nmuch to this country, whether it was somebody years ago who helped to \nbuild this great Nation through education as a teacher, perhaps, an \neducator; maybe it was building our economy in this country by building \na great company or a great effort there; perhaps it was a soldier from \nyears past who defended the rights of this country and our freedoms \ntoday. Look back and consider the special people in your life, such as \nan elderly neighbor or a grandparent. I know there is not a day that \ngoes by in my life that I don't think about those people who have so \ntremendously affected my life, who have taught me values, and who have \nshared stories with me, who have helped me become who I am. Each one of \nus needs to stop and think of those individuals.\n  Maybe it was a teacher in the first grade. Maybe it was a coach. \nMaybe it was a music instructor. Maybe it was a Sunday school teacher. \nMaybe it was a police officer. I think of all those different people \nwho have made a difference in my life, and I want to ensure that as a \nnation we respect their safety and their ability to live in this \ncountry with dignity and security.\n  I hope all my colleagues will consider whomever those special people \nwere in their lives, who helped support their dreams, provided wisdom, \nperhaps, and advice throughout their development--there are millions \nout there--and each one of us needs to take the time to remember them. \nIt is time for Congress to pass comprehensive legislation to address \nelder abuse and protect those in their twilight of life.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look in this month of May, when we \nlook in respect and admiration to the older Americans of this country, \nand provide the kind of law that we have provided for children and for \nwomen to protect them from abuse and exploitation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, a few weeks ago, I came here and said \nthat each week I was going to give a talk on the floor about another \npiece of the puzzle of why it is so important to pass climate change \nlegislation this year; about how we cannot wait as we see tremendous \nchanges to our environment and our way of life. We need to act and we \nneed to act now.\n  Last summer, I took a trip to Greenland with other members of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to see firsthand the effects of \nglobal climate change. One of the scientists traveling with us \ndescribed Greenland as a canary in the coal mine when it comes to \nglobal warming.\n  Greenland has lost an amount of ice in 1 year equal to two times all \nthe ice on the Alps. People in Greenland are planting potatoes in \nplaces where they used to run sled dogs on the ice. What we saw on that \ntrip only confirmed for us what the scientific community has now \nasserted in an overwhelming consensus. Average global temperatures are \nup 1 degree in the last century. Now, that does not sound like much, \nbut to put it in perspective, they are only up 5 degrees since the \nheight of the Ice Age.\n  The EPA forecasts an increase of 3 to 8 degrees for the next 100 \nyears. It is up 1 degree in the last century, estimated 3 to 8 degrees \nin this 100 hundred years. Ice caps are melting, ocean levels are \nrising, and glaciers are shrinking.\n  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded there is \nirrefutable evidence of climate change on every continent, with risks \nto several species and the danger of increasing violent weather events.\n  When I arrived in the Senate a little over a year ago, people were \nstill debating whether climate change was real; was it actually \nhappening? The debate is over, the facts are in, and now we are finally \ndebating solutions.\n  I am proud to say it is science that has affected our actions and \nthat this shift in our thinking is because there are people now in this \nChamber who are willing to look at and talk about the science.\n  Last year in the Energy bill, we raised fuel economy standards for \ncars and trucks and other vehicles for the first time in years and \nyears, for the first time in decades. The new standard will boost fuel \nefficiency by 40 percent and cut millions of tons in carbon emissions. \nAnd, most importantly, as we look at how much gas costs, it is going to \nsave the average family, depending on how many children they have, \nsomething like $1,000 a year.\n  So this is not only about environmental issues, this is about \neconomic pocketbook issues as well. In the farm bill agreement the \nconferees approved last week and this Senate passed, we have important \nincentives to move farmers toward the next generation of clean, \nrenewable biofuels, using cellulosic crops that can be grown on \nmarginal farmland with minimal chemical input.\n  This is the next generation of biofuels; using other parts of the \ncorn, looking at switchgrass, prairie grass, things that actually are \nconsistent with conservation and can be good for our environment and \ncan help to wean us off our dependency on foreign oil. Instead of \ninvesting in the sultans of Saudi Arabia, we can be investing in the \nfarmers and the workers of this country.\n  Now it is time for us to take the next crucial step in energy and \nconservation policy: enact strong, comprehensive climate change \nlegislation, the Lieberman-Warner bill, that will come before the \nSenate in a few weeks.\n  I referred a moment ago to our trip to Greenland last summer. But \ntoday I wish to discuss a second trip I took recently, that is, around \nmy State, visiting many small towns in the State of Minnesota.\n  I visited the campus of the University of Minnesota-Morris, where \nthey are building a biomass gasification plant. It turns farm and \nforest byproducts into gas and produces electricity. Within a year or \ntwo, it will meet the heating, cooling, and electricity needs for the \nentire campus without burning any carbon-emitting fossil fuels. I \nvisited southwestern Minnesota, where I have been many times, where \nthere is a sprawling windmill farm on the rise of land called Buffalo \nRidge. You can see towering turbines for miles, and they are now \nsupplying a significant share of Minnesota's power needs--in fact, with \nthe standard enacted on a bipartisan basis by our State legislature, 25 \npercent by 2025 for renewable energy of all kinds for the provision of \nelectricity. In tiny Starbuck, MN, 10 people left their jobs to join a \nsolar panel factory manufacturing solar panels to make electricity from \nthe Sun. These projects are reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and \ncutting our emissions of greenhouse gases.\n  The point I wish to discuss today as part of this week's discussion \nis that they are creating good jobs. I mention\n\n[[Page S4433]]\n\nthese examples because when we discuss climate change and solutions, \ntoo many people think it has only to do with doing without, cutting \nback, and doing less. It is true conservation must play a central role \nin a comprehensive energy policy to clean up our planet and reduce our \ndependency on foreign oil. This isn't the days of Jimmy Carter putting \non a sweater and going on TV and looking glum. People actually see this \nas an economic benefit, if they conserve, because they are going to \nsave money. It is also true that by adopting a strong, sensible policy \ntoward reducing greenhouse gas pollution, we can open the door to a \nworld of opportunities, which means new jobs.\n  As we prepare to discuss action on climate change, here is what we \nmust remember. There is a possibility, a strong possibility, an \nopportunity that we can get more out of this. This means manufacturing \na new generation of refrigerators, air-conditioners, and other \nhousehold appliances that meet the needs of consumers while consuming \nless electricity. It means designing buildings with ``smart glass'' and \nrooftop gardens that conserve energy and water. Some people think these \nrooftop gardens are some kind of landscaper's lark, but they aren't. \nThey keep buildings warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer and \ncapture airborne pollutants that otherwise would enter the air we \nbreathe. JPMorgan, a huge investment bank, recently redesigned its \nManhattan headquarters with a rooftop garden and estimates it will save \n30 percent on its utility bills.\n  Since cars and trucks are a major source of our greenhouse gas \nemissions, this next generation of looking at the world differently \nmeans exploiting the full potential of hybrid automotive technology. \nHybrid cars and trucks, however, have already shown themselves to be a \ngreat success story, on the sales lot and in the engineering \nlaboratory. The old version required you to plug in the car and carry \naround extra batteries. Because we invested in research and provided \nsome limited Federal incentives, we are not only seeing a better \nproduct; we are also seeing an explosion in consumer demand that would \nhave been unthinkable a few years ago.\n  Now Chevrolet has developed another breakthrough, the Chevy Volt, a \nbattery-powered car which could be on the market in less than 2 years. \nYou will be able to plug the Volt into an ordinary household outlet and \nthen drive up to 40 miles without using a drop of gasoline. Your car \nisn't going to stop when it finishes up 40 miles. It converts over to \nfuels and biofuels. The waiting list for hybrid vehicles shows \nconsumers welcome efficient designs and are buying vehicles that will \ncreate good jobs for autoworkers and other people in manufacturing.\n  Taken together, this sort of technology has the potential to create \nthousands, perhaps millions, of good jobs and spur millions of dollars \nin productive new investment.\n  Consider the potential of biomass, burning dedicated crops to produce \nelectricity. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that a concerted \neffort to develop dedicated energy crops for biomass powerplants could \ngenerate 120,000 new jobs over the next 15 years. Consider the \npotential of wind energy. Each large utility-scale wind turbine that \ngoes on line generates over $1.5 million in economic activity. Each \nturbine provides up to $5,000 in lease payments per year for 20 years \nor more to farmers, ranchers or other landowners.\n  When we start putting all the pieces of this puzzle together, a whole \nnew vista for the economy opens. The Union of Concerned Scientists \nestimated last year that merely adopting a strong national renewable \nenergy standard, one important step toward reducing greenhouse gas \npollution, would create 185,000 jobs in industries such as wind and \nsolar by the year 2020.\n  Daniel Kammen, who runs the Renewable and Appropriate Energy \nLaboratory in California, points out that $1 invested in renewable \nenergy creates three to five more jobs than $1 invested in fossil \nfuels, as we can see here. That is because renewables create jobs in \nengineering and manufacturing and because that money is invested here \nat home, instead of being shipped overseas for foreign oil producers.\n  This institute estimates that if our country met 20 percent of its \nelectricity needs from wind power, solar, biomass, and other \nrenewables, those industries would employ more than 250,000 people \nevery year, compared to fewer than 100,000 jobs if we continue to get \nall our electricity from fossil fuels.\n  This week, the U.S. Department of Energy estimated that by the year \n2030, it would be feasible for wind power to supply 20 percent of our \ncountry's electricity needs, matching the output of nuclear \npowerplants.\n  Finally, the Apollo Alliance estimates that if we made a full-bore \nnational commitment to climate change through energy-conserving \ntechnology, building design, more efficient vehicles, and renewable \nfuels, we could create 3 million new jobs and an additional $1 trillion \nof economic output in the next decade. This is our opportunity. But it \nis only that. It is only an opportunity unless we seize it because our \ncountry will not mobilize the automobile engineers, the landscape \narchitects, the building designers, the appliance manufacturers, the \npower companies, unless we send the right signal to the economy as a \nwhole, the signal that our country is committed to technologies that \nwill help us battle climate change.\n  Consider this: Despite the wind farms and solar energy companies \ncropping up here and there across the country, the United States is no \nlonger a leader in these clean energy technologies. We rank third in \nwind power, third in photovoltaic power installed. Ironically, our \ncountry has been surpassed by countries that took the technology \ndeveloped in the United States, and it has allowed foreign competition \nto leapfrog over American businesses.\n  Here is my answer: We need leaders. We need American leaders, not \nfollowers. The private sector has read the evidence and is waiting for \nus to show leadership. Last winter, the Environment Committee heard \nfrom the chief executives of 10 major corporations, including General \nElectric, DuPont and Duke Energy. They have formed the United States \nClimate Action Partnership. They seek a mandatory, market-driven \napproach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, an approach they believe \nwill drive development of new greener technology and become an engine \nfor new economic growth and job creation. They are waiting for \nleadership from Washington. In a few weeks, we will have the \nopportunity to demonstrate that leadership. My colleagues, Senators \nLieberman and Warner, have written climate change legislation that is \nbold but practical, forward thinking but pragmatic. They recognize that \nthe time for study is over, the time for hesitation has passed. The \ntime for action is upon us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a native \nPennsylvanian. Today we honor what would have been the 100th birthday \nof one of Pennsylvania's most famous sons, Jimmy Stewart. The fact that \nwe call him Jimmy tells a lot about who he was, what he meant to our \nState, what he meant to America. Jimmy Stewart is most famous for his \nunforgettable roles in movies such as ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' \n``It's a Wonderful Life,'' and on and on, so many great movies to \nremember him by. But Jimmy Stewart never forgot his Pennsylvania roots.\n  He was born in Indiana, PA, on May 20, 1908. His family owned the \nhometown hardware store where the Stewart family could trace their \nroots in Indiana County back to 1772. Stewart attended Princeton \nUniversity, where he studied architecture and graduated in 1932. \nBecause of the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that \nfollowed, Jimmy Stewart questioned whether he would find employment as \nan architect, and he accepted a position in an acting troop. Shortly \nafter joining, Stewart began working on Broadway, which eventually led \nto screen tests with major motion picture production companies. His \nwork in ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' in which he played a freshman \nSenator, earned him his first nomination for an Academy Award. He was \nalso nominated for Oscars for best actor for ``It's\n\n[[Page S4434]]\n\na Wonderful Life,'' released in 1946; ``Harvey,'' released in 1950; and \n``Anatomy of a Murder,'' released in 1959. He won his only Academy \nAward for best actor in 1940 for his role in ``The Philadelphia \nStory.''\n  I have to say, in a personal way, that every December, during the \nholiday season, I think I join a lot of Americans in trying to watch, \nyet again, ``It's a Wonderful Life.'' The reason I watch it--plenty of \nreasons--principally is because it is an American story, an American \nstory of struggle, of family love, and the positive impact one person's \nlife can have on an entire community.\n  We all know Jimmy Stewart served his country in World War II but was \ninitially rejected from service because he was 5 pounds underweight. \nBut he wouldn't let that stop him from serving. He went home to \nIndiana, added some weight, and enlisted in the Army Air Corps. He got \na whole series of commendations for his service in the Army Air Corps. \nHe retired from the Air Force in 1968, at the mandatory retirement age, \nand received the Distinguished Service Medal. The signature charity \nevent he started, the Jimmy Stewart Relay Marathon Race, held each year \nsince 1982, has raised millions of dollars for the Child and Family \nDevelopment Center at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.\n  Jimmy Stewart received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the \nAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Life Achievement \nAward from the American Film Institute for fundamentally advancing the \nart of American film. The American Red Cross presented Jimmy Stewart \nwith their humanitarian award for service to his fellow man. On his \n74th birthday, his hometown of Indiana unveiled a statue of their \nnative son in front of the Indiana County Courthouse.\n  Jimmy Stewart passed away on July 2, 1997. He was mourned by fans \nworldwide.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4434-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4434-S4435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, first, let me say how pleased I am to \nfollow the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, hearing him talk \nabout his native son, to whom I think it is fair to say he bears some \nresemblance.\n  But I have another topic today, which is the cost of gasoline in \nRhode Island. In Rhode Island today, a gallon of regular unleaded costs \n$3.84 on average, according to AAA's daily report. That price is nearly \n40 cents higher than it was 1 month ago. It is almost 77 cents higher \nthan it was a year ago. I had a Rhode Island visitor to my office last \nweek who runs a little oil company in Bristol. He reported his oil \nsupply costs have gone up 60 cents in 2 weeks. By the way, it is \nspringtime.\n  When I was home over the weekend, I saw prices for regular gas at \n$3.89 and super at $4.12. High gas prices have been over all the news \nin the last several weeks in Rhode Island and across the country. But \nthis problem did not emerge overnight. It has built up over the 7\\1/2\\ \nyears of the Bush administration.\n  Since President Bush took office in 2001, gas prices in Rhode Island \nhave more than doubled--a price hike of more than $2 for every gallon. \nSeven years of two oil men in the White House has left Rhode Islanders \nfacing the highest gas prices they have seen since the fuel crisis days \nof 1981.\n  The steady and steep rise in the price of gasoline is forcing many \nworking families in Rhode Island to make choices that would have seemed \nunimaginable only a few months ago, choices that are harsh and cold: A \nmother walks home from work through pouring rain because she can only \nafford to spend $10 a week on gasoline; a man cuts down on buying gas \nso he will have enough to pay for his prescriptions. Families in South \nCounty are hungry but have to think twice about the gas to drive to the \nfood pantry to pick up food for their families.\n  One man told the Providence Journal:\n\n       The food is expensive, the clothes are expensive--I've got \n     medication. I don't know what will happen--every week, \n     everything is more expensive.\n\n  For too many families in our Ocean State, when everything is more \nexpensive, some things get left out: Only half a tank of gas this week, \nless money for groceries, no new clothes for the kids.\n  Working Rhode Island families do not have an extra $2,000 in their \nannual family budget to spend on gas, and that is how much more they \nare paying now than they did in 2001 when Bush took office. Bush-McCain \neconomics have left these families struggling to make ends meet, \nwondering how they will pay the bills if a child gets sick or the \nplumbing breaks. They do not have an extra $30 or $40 or $50 to pour \ninto their gas tanks every week. But still gas prices go up, and \nfamilies already stretched to the limit are stretched even further.\n  These Rhode Islanders and millions like them all across this country \nneed help, and they need it now. They are looking to us in Congress for \nanswers.\n  Last week, Congress passed legislation taking a key first step--\nshutting off the gush of oil flowing into the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. This massive stockpile of crude oil owned by the Federal \nGovernment, maintained in the event of a disruption in fuel supplies or \nother such emergency, has a capacity of 727 million barrels of oil. \nRight now, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is about 97 percent full. \nYet the Bush administration continues to pump between 70,000 and 80,000 \nbarrels of oil every day into massive underground caverns. \nUnsurprisingly, the administration actually wants to double the size of \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 1.5 billion barrels, even as \nmillions of Americans struggle with record fuel prices. Amazing. At a \ntime when American families are cutting back on food and other \nnecessities in order to fill their gas tank, President Bush wants to \nreduce the supply of oil into the open market, jack up the cost of \nfuel, and further line the pockets of the big oil companies. With the \nprice of gas hitting nearly $4 a gallon, those 70,000 to 80,000 barrels \nshould flow into the market, not into the ground. And let's not forget \nthat at today's price of over $129 a barrel--a new record price for \ncrude oil as of this morning--pouring oil into the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve costs our Government millions of our precious tax dollars every \nday.\n  There are a number of things we can do right now to help provide some \nshort-term relief at the pump. I have cosponsored our majority leader \nSenator Reid's Consumer First Energy Act, a plan that gets at some of \nthe immediate root causes of these staggeringly high prices.\n  First, we must take steps to protect American consumers from market \nspeculation and price gouging. The administration's failure to regulate \nthe oil futures market has left it fertile ground for speculators who \ngame that market to reap high payoffs for themselves, while consumers \npay the price.\n  Commodities traders take advantage of lax margin requirements that \nallow them to buy oil futures for only 5 to 7 cents on the dollar \nrather than the 50-percent downpayment required for purchases of stock \nfutures. Many experts have pointed to rampant speculation as one of the \nprincipal reasons for the inflated price of crude oil in the market.\n  The Consumer First Energy Act would prevent traders of U.S. crude oil \nfrom routing transactions overseas to evade our limits on speculation, \nand it would require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to \nsubstantially increase the margin requirement for oil futures trading.\n  I particularly applaud my colleague from the State of Washington, \nSenator Cantwell, for her leadership in calling for an oil and gas \nmarket task force to investigate irregularities in the price of energy.\n  Our bill would also prevent price gouging by giving the President the \nauthority to declare an energy emergency in cases of supply disruption, \nshortage, or significant price anomalies in the market. Once such an \nemergency has been declared, it would be unlawful to set an \n``unconscionably excessive price'' for gasoline. The Federal Trade \nCommission would have the authority\n\n[[Page S4435]]\n\nto enforce this provision while State attorneys general would have new \nauthority to bring civil actions against price gougers at home.\n  Outside our borders, we need to make it clear to oil-producing \ncountries that colluding to fix the price of oil will not be tolerated. \nThe Bush administration has failed to stand up to the nations that \ncontrol the price of crude oil--nations such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, \nNigeria, Venezuela, and others that do not have America's best \ninterests at heart. OPEC nations, which produce about a third of the \nworld's oil supply, stubbornly refuse to produce more oil to curb the \nrising prices, and now OPEC has said the price of a barrel of oil could \nreach $200 this year.\n  With the American family now spending 10 percent of their income on \ngasoline, we cannot afford to let OPEC continue to manipulate world oil \nmarkets. Our plan makes it clear that colluding to fix the price of oil \nis illegal under U.S. law. The Consumer First Energy Act gives the \nAttorney General of the United States the power to bring an enforcement \naction against any company or country engaging in such conduct.\n  Finally, we need to turn the tables on the big oil companies, which \nnow pocket not only recordbreaking profits but huge taxpayer-funded \nsubsidies that they just do not need.\n  As this chart shows, the dollars we pay at the gas pump flow right \ninto big oil's pockets. Last year alone, the five biggest oil \ncompanies--ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron, and \nConocoPhillips--made $116 billion in profits. That is almost twice the \nentire budget of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Imagine if we \nwere spending twice as much on our roads and bridges and public transit \nsystems. ExxonMobil alone earned $40.6 billion last year--more than the \nentire Federal Highway Administration budget for 2007 and almost as \nmuch as the profits of the entire American credit card industry. Isn't \nit telling that as American families have struggled with the highest \nfuel costs in a generation, the biggest oil companies have celebrated \nrecordbreaking profits? As our Nation slides deeper into recession, the \noil companies' profits keep going up.\n  While the oil companies are gorged with profit, stuffed with profit, \nchoking on profit, the Bush administration and their Republican friends \nin Congress insist on funneling to them huge tax breaks. With profits \nexceeding $116 billion last year alone, I cannot think of a single \nindustry that needs extra money less than big oil, especially when that \nindustry still resists making major investments in new technology or \nrenewable fuels.\n  The Consumer First Energy Act will eliminate $17 billion in tax \nbreaks for oil and gas companies and reallocate those tax dollars to \nrenewable energy and new energy efficiency technology and would also \ncreate a 25-percent windfall profits tax on oil companies that do not \ninvest in increased capacity and renewable energy sources. If they will \nnot use their obscene profits to invest in America's energy future, \nwell, we will have to, and we will.\n  We know this is short-term action. We know we need to liberate \nourselves from our dependence on oil with new energy sources and \ntechnologies. We know we need something along the lines of a new \nManhattan Project or a new Apollo project. It is a matter of national \nurgency. But the American people need action now. We cannot stand by as \nmillions of families struggle under the weight of skyrocketing gas \nprices. For the woman walking home from work in the rain, for the man \non the bus to his doctor, for the student hoping one day for a hybrid \ncar, for the families going without food because they cannot buy gas, \nwe must take action.\n  I urge my colleagues to support legislation to ease Americans' pain \nat the pump.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4435-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Martinez, of Florida, to be a Member of the Foreign Claims \nSettlement Commission of the United States; and G. Steven Agee, of \nVirginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fourth Circuit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12:30 shall be equally divided and controlled between the \nchairman and ranking member or their designees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate continues to make progress by \nconfirming another lifetime appointment to one of our important Federal \ncircuit courts. The circuit court nomination we consider today is that \nof Justice G. Steven Agee of Virginia.\n  His nomination to a long-vacant circuit court seat is the result of a \nbreakthrough with the White House. Even more important, it fills a \nvacancy listed as a judicial emergency on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fourth Circuit. I commend the Senators from Virginia, Senator \nWarner and Senator Webb, for their work in bringing this forward. It \nwas a bipartisan exercise on their part. I thank Senator Cardin of \nMaryland for taking the time to chair the hearing on this nomination.\n  It is interesting that Judge Agee's nomination gives us an \nopportunity to be productive even in a Presidential election year, \nwhere following normal history we tend to be far less productive.\n  There has been a string of controversial nominations from Virginia. \nUntil recently, President Bush had insisted on confrontation with the \nSenate by nominating Jim Haynes, who contributed to the torture memos, \nClaude Allen, and Duncan Getchell. I think he became aware they were \nnot going to go anywhere.\n  When Republicans come to the Senate to discuss the pace at which we \nare considering judicial nominations, I am almost amused watching them \nbecause something is always wrong. It is sort of like Goldilocks. It is \nkind of like Goldilocks in the fairly tale--the porridge is too hot; \nthe porridge is too cold. When I schedule hearings and even break into \nmy recess where I should be in Vermont and come back because they are \nso insistent that they need to have hearings on this, and I come back \nand hold a hearing for nominees of President Bush, oh, golly, I am \nmoving too quickly. They have actually criticized me for doing that. Of \ncourse, if we slow the pace down, well, then we are criticized for \nmoving too slowly. I was thinking of that situation when I was reading \n``Goldilocks'' to one of my grandchildren the other night. Of course, \n``Goldilocks'' is a child's story, and they should not play childish \ngames here.\n  One thing has been apparent from the outset of the year: My friends \non the Republican side hope that by ignoring their own history--pocket \nfilibustering more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominations \nwhile they were in the majority--that somehow they can rewrite history.\n  Democrats, to their credit, have not retaliated. I think of pocket \nfilibustering 60 of President Clinton's nominees. But they say, after \nvoting one of\n\n[[Page S4436]]\n\nthose 60 out of committee, they allowed him to come to a vote on this \nfloor. This was a very prominent African-American justice of the \nMissouri Supreme Court, who later became chief justice. It is obvious \nwhy they let this African-American justice come to a vote on the floor \nof the Senate. Every single Republican, including those Republicans who \nhad voted for him in the Senate Judiciary Committee, came on the floor \nin a humiliating gesture and voted down his confirmation. It was one of \nthe low marks of this body.\n  As I said, we have not retaliated. But also the Democratic majority \nhas a responsibility not to push through the confirmation process \nnominations who are there simply to advance a political agenda instead \nof there to maintain the impartiality of our Federal judiciary.\n  In fact, in contrast with the Republican Senate majority that more \nthan doubled circuit court vacancies during the Clinton administration, \nwe have reduced vacancies by nearly two-thirds. We have reduced them in \nnearly every circuit during the Bush administration. With the \nconfirmation of Steven Agee today, the Fourth Circuit will have fewer \nvacancies than at the end of the Clinton administration, and that, of \ncourse, was when the Senate Republican majority pocket filibustered \nfive Fourth Circuit nominees. In fact, they refused to consider any \nFourth Circuit nominees during the last 2 years of President Clinton's \nPresidency.\n  Today, we will reduce vacancies among the 13 Federal circuit courts \nthroughout the country to 11. That, incidentally, is the lowest number \nof vacancies in more than a decade. When Republican Senators are ready \nto allow us to consider and confirm the President's nominations to fill \nthe last two remaining vacancies on the Sixth Circuit, if Republicans \nwill allow us to go forward with President Bush's nominees there, we \ncan reduce the total number of circuit court vacancies to single digits \nfor the first time in decades. So for all the smoke and mirrors on the \nother side, the fact remains that we have succeeded in lowering circuit \ncourt vacancies to a historically low level.\n  Let's take a moment and go to the charts. These are circuit court \nvacancies. For most of the time when President Clinton was President, \nthe Republicans were in charge. Look what they did. By their use of \npocket filibusters, they pushed the number of vacancies in the circuit \ncourts from 16 up to 32. Were there nominees for those seats? Of course \nthere were, but they were pocket filibustered.\n  I use one example, one nomination that was pocket filibustered: Well, \nwe don't know if she is really qualified. She is now the dean of the \nHarvard Law School, the most prestigious law school in this country.\n  When we came in halfway through the first year of President Bush's \nterm, people thought that maybe the Democrats might retaliate and do \nthe same thing to him. We did just the opposite. We started bringing \ndown the number of circuit court vacancies, and we continued. When I \nbecame chairman for the first time, in the summer of 2001, we quickly \nand dramatically lowered vacancies. We confirmed 100 nominations in \nonly 17 months. We set an all-time record for the Senate being \ncontrolled by one party and the Presidency by another. We confirmed 100 \nnominations in only 17 months. That was with an uncooperative White \nHouse. And we reduced vacancies by 45 percent.\n  Look at the numbers. Look how the vacancies went up when the \nRepublicans were in charge with a Democratic President, and when \nDemocrats were in charge with a Republican President, they came down. \nIt is the Democratic Senate majority that has worked hard to lower them \nin this Congress. We have gone from more than 110 vacancies to less \nthan 50. We have reversed course from the days when the Republican \nSenate majority more than doubled circuit vacancies. We have lowered \nthe circuit court vacancies that existed when I became chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee in the summer of 2001--32 vacancies--we lowered \nthem to 12. Today, we lower it to 11. Of the 178 authorized circuit \ncourt judgeships, after today's confirmation, only 11 will remain \nvacant. We took the vacancy rate Republicans gave us of 18 percent and \nbrought it down to 6 percent. With 166 active appellate judges and 104 \nsenior status judges serving on the Federal courts of appeals, there \nare 270 circuit court judges. I think that is the most in our history.\n\n  In fact, our work has led to a reduction in vacancies in nearly every \ncircuit. Both the Second and Fifth Circuits had circuit-wide \nemergencies due to the multiple simultaneous vacancies during the \nClinton years with Republicans in control of the Senate. Both the \nSecond Circuit and the Fifth Circuit now are without a single vacancy. \nWe have already succeeded in lowering vacancies in the Second Circuit, \nthe Fifth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit, the Ninth \nCircuit, the Tenth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit, the DC Circuit and \nthe Federal Circuit. With the confirmation of Justice Agee, the Fourth \nCircuit will join that list. Circuits with no current vacancies include \nthe Seventh Circuit, the Eighth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit, the \nEleventh Circuit and the Federal Circuit. When we are allowed to \nproceed with President Bush's nominations of Judge White and Ray \nKethledge to the Sixth Circuit, it will join that list of Federal \ncircuits without a single vacancy.\n  Less than 2 weeks ago, President Bush nominated Judge Glen E. Conrad \nto the second and final Virginia vacancy on the Fourth Circuit. With \nthe support of Senator Warner and Senator Webb, we may still have time \nthis year to proceed to that nomination and resolve another \nlongstanding vacancy, further reducing vacancies on the Fourth Circuit \nand on Federal circuit courts in general.\n  I remain determined to prioritize progress and focus the Judiciary \nCommittee on those nominations on which we can make progress and, in \nparticular, on those in which the White House has finally begun to work \nwith the Senate.\n  However, when I tried to expedite consideration of two Sixth Circuit \nnominations of President Bush's this month, all I got was criticism \nfrom the Republican side of the aisle. In fact, at the hearing on May \n7, Republican Senators all but attacked one of the President's \nnominees. Senator Brownback publicly apologized for his actions at the \nhearing, and I commend him for doing so. His apology was in the best \ntradition of the Senate.\n  Of course, last Wednesday, the same Republicans who were saying hurry \nup with these nominees sent scores of time-consuming questions to the \nnominees, all but ensuring the nominees cannot be considered this \nmonth. We will not hear them until they answer the questions. We will \nget the ABA reports.\n  Disputes over a handful of controversial judicial nominations have \nwasted valuable time that could be spent on the real priorities of \nevery American. I have sought, instead, to make progress where we can. \nThe result is the significant reduction in judicial vacancies. By \nturning today to the Agee nomination, we can make additional progress.\n  The alternative is to risk becoming embroiled in contentious debates \nfor months and thereby foreclose the opportunity to make progress where \nwe can. The most recent controversial Bush judicial nomination took \n5\\1/2\\ months of debate after a hearing before Senate action was \npossible. We also saw what happened during the last several months of \nthe last Congress, which was not even a Presidential election year. \nThere were many hearings on many controversial nominations. That \nresulted in a great deal of effort and conflict but not in as many \nconfirmations as might have been achieved. I prefer to make progress \nwhere we can and to work together to do so.\n  I am sure there are some who prefer partisan fights designed to \nenergize a political base during an election year, but I do not. I am \ndetermined to prioritize progress, not politics, and focus the \ncommittee on those nominations on which we can make progress. The \nRepublican Senate majority during the last 5 years of the Clinton \nadministration more than doubled vacancies on our Nation's circuit \ncourts, as they rose from 12 to 26. Those circuit vacancies grew to 32 \nduring the transition to the Bush administration. The statistics are \nworth repeating: we have been able to reverse that trend and reduce \ncircuit vacancies by almost two-thirds. Today there are fewer circuit \ncourt vacancies than at any time since\n\n[[Page S4437]]\n\nthe 1996 session. In fact, our work has led to a reduction in vacancies \nin nearly every circuit. We are heading toward reducing circuit court \nvacancies to single digits for the first time in decades.\n  I have been speaking during the last several weeks about the progress \nwe are making in repairing the terrible damage done to the confirmation \nprocess and about our progress in reducing judicial vacancies.\n  We can do a number of things. We can work as the White House finally \ndid after three strikes; they finally worked with the Senators from \nVirginia, and we have a circuit court of appeals judge going through. \nThere are other circuits where they could do the same thing, work with \nRepublican Senators, work with Democratic Senators, and they could get \nthem through. If they want to simply continue and have judges who are \nobviously nominated to carry out a political agenda, obviously \nnominated to politicize the Federal court, these people are not going \nto go through. What a waste of time. Why not realize that the American \npeople do not want judicial nominations rooted in partisan politics? \nThey want Federal judges who understand the importance of an \nindependent judiciary. Our independent courts are a source of America's \nstrength, endurance, and stability. Our judicial system has been the \nenvy of the world. The American people expect the Federal courts to be \nimpartial forums where justice is dispensed without favor to the right \nor the left or to any political party or faction. The only lifetime \nappointments in our government, these nominations matter a great deal. \nThe Federal judiciary is the one arm of our government that should \nnever be political or politicized, regardless of who sits in the White \nHouse.\n  With the Agee confirmation today, the sixth so far this year and the \nsecond circuit court confirmation, the Senate is ahead of the pace the \nRepublican Senate majority established during the 1996 session, a \nPresidential election year, in which no judicial nominations were \nconsidered or confirmed by the Senate before July. That is right--today \nwe stand six confirmations, including two circuit court confirmations, \nahead of the pace Republicans set in the 1996 session. In fact, with \nthe Agee confirmation we are already two circuit court confirmations \nbeyond the total the Republican Senate majority allowed for that entire \nsession, when they refused to proceed on any circuit court nominations.\n  So today we demonstrate progress about which I have been speaking and \non which I have been working. I continue in this Congress and I will \ncontinue with the new President in the next Congress to work with \nSenators from both sides of the aisle to guarantee we have nonpartisan \njudges.\n  Justice Agee has 7 years of judicial experience on the State bench as \na Justice on the Supreme Court of Virginia and a former judge on the \nCourt of Appeals of Virginia. For more than 20 years prior to his \njudicial service, Justice Agee worked in private practice in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia. He was elected by the people of Virginia as a \nDelegate to the Virginia General Assembly where he served for over a \ndecade. Justice Agee graduated from Bridgewater College with a B.A. and \nhe received his J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law. He \nreceived an L.L.M. degree in taxation from New York University School \nof Law.\n  I congratulate Justice Agee and his family on his confirmation today, \nand I look forward to making further progress by working together on \njudicial nominations.\n  The Virginia and Michigan vacancies on the Fourth and Sixth Circuits, \nrespectively, have proven a great challenge. I want to commend Senator \nWarner and Senator Webb, and Senator Levin and Senator Stabenow for \nworking to end these impasses. I have urged the President to work with \nthe Virginia and Michigan Senators and, after several years, he finally \nhas. During the last 3 months, our extensive efforts culminated in \nsignificant developments that can lead to filling two Virginia \nvacancies on the Fourth Circuit and two Michigan vacancies on the Sixth \nCircuit, three of which have been classified as judicial emergencies.\n\n  This accomplishment stands in sharp contrast to the actions of Senate \nRepublicans who refused to consider any of the highly qualified \nnominations to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals during the last 3 \nyears of the Clinton administration or to consider any of the highly \nqualified nominations to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals during the \nlast 2 years of the Clinton administration. The Republican Senate \nmajority left open five vacancies on the Fourth Circuit and four on the \nSixth Circuit at the end of the Clinton administration.\n  The Fourth Circuit is a good example of how much time and effort we \nhave wasted on controversial nominations by President Bush. For \nexample, there was the highly controversial and failed nomination of \nWilliam ``Jim'' Haynes II to the Fourth Circuit. As General Counsel at \nthe Department of Defense, he was the architect of many discredited \npolicies on detainee treatment, military tribunals, and torture. Mr. \nHaynes never fulfilled the pledge he made to me under oath at his \nhearing to supply the materials he discussed in an extended opening \nstatement regarding his role in developing these policies and their \nlegal justifications.\n  The Haynes nomination led the Richmond Times-Dispatch to write an \neditorial in late 2006 entitled ``No Vacancies,'' about the President's \ncounterproductive approach to nominations in the Fourth Circuit. The \neditorial criticized the administration for pursuing political fights \nat the expense of filling vacancies. According to the Times-Dispatch, \n``The president erred by renominating . . . and may be squandering his \nopportunity to fill numerous other vacancies with judges of right \nreason.''\n  The Times-Dispatch editorial focused on the renomination of Mr. \nHaynes, but could just as easily have been written about other \ncontroversial Fourth Circuit nominees.\n  The President insisted on nominating and renominating Terrence Boyle \nover the course of 6 years to a North Carolina vacancy on the Fourth \nCircuit. This despite the fact that as a sitting U.S. district judge \nand while a circuit court nominee, Judge Boyle ruled on multiple cases \ninvolving corporations in which he held investments.\n  The President should have heeded the call of North Carolina Police \nBenevolent Association, the North Carolina Troopers' Association, the \nPolice Benevolent Associations from South Carolina and Virginia, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, the Professional Fire \nFighters and Paramedics of North Carolina, as well as the advice of \nSenator John Edwards. Law enforcement officers from North Carolina and \nacross the country opposed the nomination. Civil rights groups opposed \nthe nomination. Those knowledgeable and respectful of judicial ethics \nopposed the nomination. This President persisted for 6 years before \nwithdrawing the Boyle nomination.\n  I mention these ill-advised nominations because so many Republican \npartisans seem to have forgotten this recent history and why there are \ncontinuing vacancies on the Fourth Circuit. The efforts and years \nwasted on President Bush's controversial nominations followed in the \nwake of the Republican Senate majority's refusal to consider any of \nPresident Clinton's Fourth Circuit nominees. All four nominees from \nNorth Carolina to the Fourth Circuit were blocked from consideration by \nthe Republican Senate majority. These outstanding nominees included \nU.S. District Court Judge James Beaty, Jr., U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. \nRichard Leonard, North Carolina Court of Appeals Judge James Wynn, and \nProfessor Elizabeth Gibson. The failure to proceed on these nominations \nhas yet to be explained. Had either Judge Beaty or Judge Wynn been \nconsidered and confirmed, he would have been the first African-American \njudge appointed to the Fourth Circuit.\n  In contrast, I worked with Senator Edwards to break through the \nimpasse and to confirm Judge Allyson Duncan of North Carolina to the \nFourth Circuit when President Bush nominated her. I worked to reduce \nFederal judicial vacancies in North Carolina by confirming three judges \nlast year Judge Schroeder, Judge Reidinger and Judge Osteen. Previously \nduring the Bush administration, I cooperated in the confirmation of \nJudge Whitney, Judge Conrad, Judge Dever, Judge McKnight, and Judge \nFlanagan. That totals nine Federal judges in North Carolina, including \na Fourth Circuit judge, during\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\nthe Bush Presidency. By contrast, during the entire eight years of the \nClinton administration, only one district court judge was allowed to be \nconfirmed in North Carolina.\n  We have also made progress in South Carolina. Senator Graham follows \nSenator Thurmond as South Carolina's representative on the Judiciary \nCommittee. Despite the controversy that accompanied the nomination of \nJudge Dennis Shedd, and my own opposition to it, I presided as chairman \nwhen we considered that nomination and when the Senate granted its \nconsent. I also presided over consideration of the nomination of Terry \nWooten. More recently, we acted favorably on the nominations of Harvey \nFloyd and Robert Bryan Harwell.\n  While I chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee from the summer of \n2001 to the end of 2002, I presided over the consideration and \nconfirmation of three Fourth Circuit judges nominated by President \nBush. All together, President Bush has already appointed five judges to \nthe Fourth Circuit. By contrast, President Clinton was allowed by \nSenate Republicans to appoint three and left office with five vacancies \nexisting on that court.\n  Of course, during the Clinton administration, Republican Senators \nargued that the Fourth Circuit vacancies did not need to be filled \nbecause the Fourth Circuit had the fastest docket time to disposition \nin the country. If the Agee nomination is confirmed, as I expect it \nwill be, the Fourth Circuit will have fewer vacancies than it did when \nRepublicans claimed no more judges were needed.\n  Judge Agee will succeed Judge Michael Luttig, who retired a few years \nago to take a more lucrative position in the private sector. Judge \nLuttig was known as a very conservative judge on the Fourth Circuit. He \nwas involved in the Padilla case a few years ago and condemned the \nshifting legal positions of the Bush administration in that case \ninvolving an American citizen. He noted that the Bush administration's \nmaneuvering had consequences ``not only for the public perception of \nthe war on terror but also for the government's credibility before the \ncourts in litigation ancillary to that war.'' Judge Luttig went on to \nnote that the administration's behavior in ``yield[ing] to expediency'' \nleft an impression that ``may ultimately prove to be [at] substantial \ncost to the government's credibility.'' In those independent \nobservations, Judge Luttig performed a public service.\n  I have likewise urged the President to work with the Michigan \nSenators, and, after 7 years, he finally has. Last month, our extensive \nefforts culminated in a significant development that, unless \npartisanship interferes, can lead to filling the last two vacancies on \nthe Sixth Circuit before this year ends. This accomplishment stands in \nsharp contrast to the actions of Senate Republicans who refused to \nconsider any nomination to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals during \nthe last 3 years of the Clinton administration. Ultimately, the \nRepublican-led Senate left open four vacancies on that circuit.\n  Mine has been a different approach and one that has led to \nsignificant progress. I am glad to see that progress continue today \nwith our confirmation of the nomination of Justice G. Steven Agee of \nVirginia to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the nomination of Justice Steven Agee is \npending for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Justice Agee \nhas an outstanding record; he has been a judge on the Court of Appeals \nfor Virginia for 2 years, from 2001 to 2003, and a Justice on the \nSupreme Court from 2003 until the present time.\n  The record of Michael G.

Mr. President, I will use the balance of my time on the \npending issue to discuss the agreement made between the Democratic and \nRepublican leaders to have three circuit judges confirmed before \nMemorial Day. The concerns, which I expressed at some length yesterday, \nbut will summarize very briefly today, are that there simply has been \ninsufficient time to process the nominees the majority chose according \nto standard Committee procedures. I refer specifically to the \nnomination of Michigan Court of Appeals Judge, Helene White, who was \nnominated on April 15, with only 22 days elapsing between the time of \nher nomination and her hearing.\n  The average time between a circuit court nominee's nomination and \nhearing has been 162 days during the Bush presidency. When a hearing \nwas scheduled for Peter Keisler 33 days after his nomination, there was \nan objection made by all of the Democratic Senators on the Committee. \nThis happened in 2006. At Mr. Keisler's hearing Senator Schumer had \nthis to say:\n\n       Let me reiterate some of the concerns we expressed about \n     proceeding so hastily on this nomination. First, we barely \n     had time to consider the nominee's record. Mr. Keisler was \n     named to the seat 33 days ago, so we are having this hearing \n     with astonishing and inexplicable speed. The average time for \n     a nomination to hearing for the last seven nominees to that \n     court is several times that long.\n\n  Well, the nomination of Peter Keisler was much easier with respect to \nthe\n\n[[Page S4439]]\n\npending record than the record for Judge White who has been on the \nbench for many years.\n  First, an issue arose with Judge White because her questionnaire was \nincomplete. For example, she did not provide reversed opinions that had \nnot been published, as required. During the course of the hearing, \nthere was considerable concern about what Judge White had done while \nsitting on the Michigan court with respect to the soundness of her \njudicial scholarship. Then, yesterday, an objection was raised by \nSenator Reid that so many questions were submitted for Judge White. \nHowever, the fact is, the number of questions is relatively modest by \ncomparison--73 questions for Judge White. Last year, Judge Jennifer \nElrod, nominee to the Fifth Circuit, had 108 questions submitted by the \nDemocrats. Last year, Judge Leslie Southwick had 80 questions submitted \nby Democrats. Grace Becker, a nominee for the Department of Justice, \nCivil Rights Division, had 250 questions submitted by the Democrats. \nThese are just a few examples. So the number Judge White received is \nrelatively modest in comparison to others.\n  Next, you have the situation that there is the absence of the report \nof the American Bar Association, which is still not in on Judge White, \nand is not expected until the end of the month.\n  It is unprecedented to have a hearing on a circuit judge without \nhaving the ABA report in hand--absolutely unprecedented.\n  Yesterday, I spoke at some length about the importance of a court of \nappeals judge. The courts of appeals are the last appeal before the \nSupreme Court, meaning that in virtually all of their cases, their \ndecisions are final. If there is a 2-to-1 decision and Judge White is \none of the two in the majority, then that is the law, and it has very \nprofound effects. So, it is a very serious obligation of the Senate, \nunder our constitutional responsibility, to advise and consent, and to \nbe sure we take adequate time for deliberation on the matter.\n  The concern that I expressed yesterday, and will comment on very \nbriefly today, is that there were other nominees waiting who could have \nbeen processed in this time without this rush to judgment and without \nthis unprecedented practice. For example, Peter Keisler has had a \nhearing and has been waiting over 690 days for a committee vote. He \ncould have been processed without this rush to judgment. Judge Conrad \nhas been waiting for 308 days for a hearing and could have been \nprocessed without this rush to judgment. Steven Matthews has been \nwaiting 257 days and could have been processed without this rush to \njudgment.\n  There were ample nominees available. The majority did not have to \nproceed with Judge White's nomination. Yesterday, the Senator from \nNevada commented that nobody presumed to tell Arlen Specter, when I was \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, what the scheduling should be or \nwhat the order of business should be. But, as I pointed out at some \nlength yesterday, the White House wanted to have the hearing on Chief \nJustice Roberts starting in August of 2005. I consulted with Senator \nLeahy in advance. He objected to it. I thought he was right. I, \nfrankly, thought he was right in advance of consulting him, but I still \nconsulted him. The hearing didn't start until September. Similarly, the \nWhite House wanted to have the hearing of Justice Alito concluded \nbefore Christmas. I consulted with Senator Leahy again, and Justice \nAlito's hearing started in January. Later, the President told me \npersonally that he thought my judgment was right.\n  The point I raise is--there was always consultation when I was \nchairman. But, on these matters, regrettably, there has been none. It \nis still my hope that we will be able to find some way through this \nmorass. Senator Leahy and I have had a very good record of working on a \nbipartisan basis. It is my hope that we will establish a protocol for \nconsideration of judicial nominees that so many days after a \nnomination, there will be a hearing, then so many days later, there \nwill be action by the Judiciary Committee, and then so many days later, \nthere will be floor action. That protocol would prevent this morass, \nwhich has engulfed this Senate. I look forward to working with Senator \nLeahy to accomplish that.\n  On the state of the record, I feel constrained to say that the facts \nspeak for themselves. Processing Judge White in this manner, breaking \nall of the precedents and rules, is simply not the way to conduct the \nbusiness of the Senate. The deal could have been completed with the \nother nominees who are waiting in the wings. That is the way the Senate \nought to function.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  First, let me express my support for Judge Agee's confirmation. I had \nthe opportunity to chair Judge Agee's confirmation hearing. I thank \nSenator Warner and Senator Webb for the manner in which they worked \nwith the White House to get an appointment that could go through the \nconfirmation process, and one which I hope my colleagues will support.\n  I support Judge Agee because of his experience. I am pleased he has \nlegislative experience. I think that will help him on the court. He \nrespects the rule of law and precedents, and he believes in the \nindependence of the judiciary. He has expressed concerns at times with \npolitical interference within the judicial branch of Government. I \nthink he is well qualified to be confirmed to the circuit court.\n  Let me comment very briefly on the comment made by my colleague, \nSenator Specter. Let me point out that Judge White was first appointed \non January 7, 1997. She then waited 4 years for action in this body and \nreceived none because of being held up by the Republicans. So when we \nsay we are ``rushing to judgment,'' I think waiting 4 years without any \naction is not rushing to judgment. It seems as though the majority \nleadership is being criticized at times for moving too fast and also \ntoo slow. You cannot have it both ways.\n  In regard to circuit court appointments, there have been three I have \nopposed--two because of lack of experience, and one because of his \nrecord. I was joined by other Members who opposed those nominations. \nNone of us sought to delay those confirmation votes. In fact, on one, \nthe Republican leadership asked that we hold the confirmation vote in \ncommittee until they could get some more support.\n  So I think you should be judged by the record. Let me point out the \nrecord very clearly. If you look at the record on vacancies in circuit \ncourts, starting with President Clinton, there was 17. At the end of \nhis term, it grew to 32. The record by the Democrats has been \nconsistent to reduce that so that we now have 12 vacancies. I think the \nrecord speaks for itself.\n  Obviously, we want to get as many judges confirmed as possible. I \nhope we can work in a bipartisan manner to make sure these vacancies \nare filled. If the White House would work with the local Senators and \nwith us, I think we can get more confirmations to our circuit courts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4439-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4008, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4008) to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act \n     to make technical corrections to the definition of willful \n     noncompliance with respect to violations involving the \n     printing of an expiration date on certain credit and debit \n     card receipts before the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4008) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am glad we have just passed H.R. 4008. \nI thank all of my colleagues and Representative Mahoney in the House, \nwho authored the Credit and Debt Card Receipt Clarification Act. I \nintroduced an identical bill on the Senate side, which was S. 2978. The \nHouse passed this bill last week by the unanimous vote of 407 to 0.\n  H.R. 4008 is a narrow, commonsense bill that will smooth the \ntransition to new rules for printing credit card receipts under the \nFair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act, or FACTA.\n  FACTA says the credit card receipts can only display one of two \nthings: either the last five digits of the credit card account number \nor the expiration date.\n  Unfortunately, the law was not as clear as it could have been, and \nmany companies misunderstood this requirement. They redacted account \nnumbers in order to comply with FACTA but mistakenly left expiration \ndates in place.\n  But unlike the State laws after which it is modeled, FACTA is tied to \na statutory damages provision that sparked the filing of hundreds of \nclass action lawsuits against companies whose sole error was printing \nexpiration dates on receipts.\n  Let's be clear. These lawsuits are not alleging that consumers were \nharmed in any way. I will repeat that. The lawsuits are not alleging \nthat consumers were harmed in any way. In fact, experts on identity \ntheft will tell you that printing the expiration date doesn't present \nany risk of fraud or identity theft, as long as the account number is \ntruncated.\n  Yet companies are facing sky-high liability of up to $1,000 per \nreceipt. Some of them are large retail businesses; most of them are \nsmall mom-and-pop stores. The damages in these cases are so huge that \njudges have refused to certify class actions because the lawsuits could \nactually destroy the companies--small and large.\n  The long list of defendants in these cases includes many major \ncorporations--we have all heard of the hotels, restaurant chains, et \ncetera--as well as little mom-and-pop stores.\n  It is fair to say that these lawsuits will actually hurt consumers \nbecause companies will be forced to raise prices, or even close stores, \nin order to cover the cost of legal fees and expensive settlements. \nThis is at a time when our economy and businesses--particularly those \ndealing with retail--are already struggling to rebound from tough \ntimes.\n  So the bill is a win-win proposition for everyone. It stops \ndestructive lawsuits against companies that made a harmless error in \nthe past, but it also ensures that consumers can still sue in any case \nwhere they were actually harmed.\n  Going forward, companies will still have to meet the same strict \nrules Congress originally passed in fact. I am glad the Senate was able \nto take quick action on this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4440-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I will take the time allotted on the \nDemocratic side to Senator Webb.\n  Mr. President, we have heard the sad news about our friend Ted \nKennedy. Those of us who stood by his side know that there is no better \nally and no more determined fighter. Now, as Ted Kennedy faces another \ngreat fight, we know he will bring the same courage and determination \nto the battle. We also know Ted has spent his entire life caring for \nthose in need. It is time for those of us who love Ted and his family \nto care for them and join in prayer to give them strength.\n  Mr. President, at 2:30 we will consider the nomination of Steven Agee \nof Virginia to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit. It is a lifetime appointment. He is a consensus nominee. Both \nSenators Warner and Webb support him. Of the 11 appellate court \nnominees pending before the Senate, only 6 can claim the same home \nState Senator support. That is one of the reasons some of them have \nbeen delayed. If we work more toward bipartisan consensus, more \nnominations would be approved.\n  Also, it is difficult to hear criticisms that these nominations have \nbeen delayed. The Republican minority has delayed so many bills and so \nmany matters in this Congress, they have set a new record for \nfilibusters and delay. That is a fact.\n  The Senate has confirmed 303 judges for lifetime appointments during \nthe Bush Presidency. President Bush has had 86 percent of his judicial \nnominees confirmed; President Clinton, only 75 percent. When it comes \nto circuit court nominees, President Bush has even had a higher \nconfirmation rate than President Clinton--71 percent to 57 percent. \nThere has been no mistreatment here when it comes to the nominees sent \nto us by the Bush White House. Under\n\n[[Page S4441]]\n\nPresident Clinton, 61 judicial nominees were not even given the \ncourtesy of a hearing and a vote.\n  One of the problems that faces the analysis on the Republican side is \nthat there have been fewer judicial vacancies. President Clinton had \n377 judges confirmed; President Reagan, 382, but at the present time, \nwith the 303 already confirmed, if every vacancy were filled--every one \nof them--then President Bush would have fewer than President Clinton or \nPresident Reagan had confirmed. In other words, the fact that President \nBush will have appointed fewer judges than his predecessors is a \nfunction of math, not political mischief.\n  Another complaint we have heard from my Republican colleagues is that \nwe are moving on Sixth Circuit nominee Helene White ahead of three \ncircuit court nominees whom they would prefer. Senator Leahy, chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, and the majority leader have already \naddressed this point, but I think the record should be abundantly \nclear. Helene White was originally nominated in January 1997 and was \npending as a Clinton nominee for 1,532 days--over 4 years--until March \n2001. You can even argue that she has been pending for over 11 years. \nSo in terms of a place in line, she certainly deserves consideration \nfor her patience.\n  I hope these battles will be resolved and resolved soon, but most \nimportantly I hope they are resolved with good men and women who come \nto these lifetime appointments with the appropriate background and \nappropriate temperament to serve this Nation well. I hope the Senate \nwill join on a bipartisan basis in approving this afternoon's pending \nnomination.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, today it is my distinct pleasure to offer my \nsupport--along with my colleague, Senator Warner--for the nomination of \nJustice G. Steven Agee to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fourth Circuit.\n  Justice Agee is regarded as a jurist of superior intellect and \njudicial temperament who exhibits the highest degree of integrity and \nprofessionalism. After graduating law school, Justice Agee began his \nlegal career as an associate with Martin, Hopkins & Lemon, 1977 to \n1979. In 1979, Justice Agee joined Rocovich, Dechow, Parvin & Wilson, \nP.C., where he did additional work as an associate. From 1980 to 2000 \nJustice Agee was a shareholder and director with Osterhoudt, Ferguson, \nNatt, Aheron & Agee. In 2001, Justice Agee began serving as a judge on \nthe Court of Appeals of Virginia and has been a justice on the Supreme \nCourt of Virginia since 2003.\n  Justice Agee has unparalleled support from the entire legal community \nin the Commonwealth of Virginia. Justice Agee served for 12 years in \nthe Virginia House of Delegates--1982 to 1994--and served as an \nappointed member of the Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission, 1997 \nto 2000. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has rated \nJustice Agee ``well qualified'' to sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fourth Circuit. He is active in myriad community and civic \norganizations. Justice Agee received his B.A., magna cum laude, from \nBridgewater College in 1974, his J.D. from the University of Virginia \nSchool of Law in 1977, and his L.L.M. in Taxation from New York \nUniversity School of Law in 1978. He is married to Nancy Howell Agee, \nthe chief operating officer and executive vice president of Carilion \nClinic, and together they have one child.\n  I am acutely aware of the vitally important role that the \nConstitution assigns to the Senate in the advise and consent process \nrelated to Federal judges. Judgeships on our Nation's Circuit Courts of \nAppeal are critical to the American system of jurisprudence. Senator \nWarner and I undertook a careful and deliberative process to find the \nmost qualified nominees. Our collaborative process involved a thorough \nrecords review and rigorous interviews. We are of the opinion that \nJustice Agee not only met our high standards for selection but exceeded \nthem. Justice Agee was on the joint list of recommended nominees that \nwe submitted to President Bush last year. We are pleased that President \nBush has chosen to respect our diligent bipartisan work.\n  I want to thank you for the opportunity to make these remarks about \nJustice Agee today and for the expeditious way the Senate has moved his \nnomination through the process during the 110th Congress. Again, it is \nwith pride that I join Senator Warner in commending Justice Agee to \neach of my colleagues in the Senate, and I ask my fellow Senators to \nvote to confirm his nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFourth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nVermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time remains that is controlled by \nthe Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  I would note, in all these numbers, we Democrats have worked very \nhard to erase what was done by the Republicans when there was a \nDemocratic President. They pocket filibustered over 60 of President \nClinton's nominees. They let one go through--actually voted for him in \ncommittee, one of the most distinguished African-American jurists in \nthis country. Then, in lockstep, every single Republican voted against \nhim--a humiliation for him. He went on to become chief justice of the \nMissouri Supreme Court.\n  We have not done that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for an \nextraordinary nominee to the federal bench. I welcome the opportunity \ntoday to vote in favor of confirmation for the Honorable G. Steven Agee \nto a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n  Justice Agee currently serves with distinction on the Supreme Court \nof Virginia. It was my privilege to introduce him to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee on May 1, and, as I expressed to the committee, \nJustice Agee's qualifications to serve on the Fourth Circuit are as \nimpressive as any circuit court nominee for whom I have voted in my 30 \nyears in the Senate.\n  Further, I am pleased to note that the American Bar Association \nconcurs with my assessment of this nominee. The ABA gave Justice Agee \nits highest recommendation: unanimously well-qualified.\n  Justice Agee's nomination is a product of a collaborative process \nbetween the administration and Virginia's two U.S. Senators. In early \n2007, Senator Webb and I personally, extensively interviewed more than \na dozen individuals to serve on the Fourth Circuit, and ultimately, in \nJune 2007, we submitted to the President a list of five individuals \nthat both of us would strongly support for confirmation. Justice Agee \nwas one of those five individuals.\n  A magna cum laude graduate of Bridgewater College in Virginia, Steve \nAgee subsequently earned his law degree from the University of Virginia \nSchool of Law and an L.L.M. in Taxation from New York University. For \nthe past 30 years, he has been engaged in the Virginia legal community \nas either a practicing lawyer or as a jurist.\n  In addition to his remarkable legal career, Justice Agee has been \nactively engaged in public service through the military, elected \noffice, the state bench, and other civic and volunteer causes.\n  For 11 years during his career in private practice, he served in the \nU.S. Army Reserve, Judge Advocate General Corps, completing his service \nat the rank of major in 1997.\n  From 1982 to 1994, Steve Agee was a member of the Virginia House of \nDelegates, representing the city of Salem; the Counties of Craig, \nMontgomery, and Roanoke; and the towns of Christiansburg, New Castle, \nand Vinton to Virginia's General Assembly.\n  In 2000, the Virginia General Assembly unanimously confirmed Steve \nAgee to the Virginia Court of Appeals. In January 2003, the General \nAssembly once again unanimously confirmed Judge Agee--this time to one \nof seven seats on the Virginia Supreme Court.\n  For many years, he has been a member of the Board of Trustees for \nBridgewater College; a member of the Board of Directors for the Bradley \nFree Clinic of Roanoke; a member of the Salem Rotary Club; and he has \nalso contributed his time to the Western Virginia Foundation for the \nArts and Sciences\n\n[[Page S4442]]\n\nand the Governor's Regional Economic Development Council for the New \nCentury Region.\n  Justice Agee is obviously a very accomplished American. I appreciate \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee's prompt consideration of this nominee, \nas the seat to which he has been nominated is designated as a judicial \nemergency by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.\n  I am confident that Justice Steve Agee will serve on the Fourth \nCircuit with distinction, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting \nin favor of his confirmation today.\n  I see my colleague. I would like to add just one more word, if I may.\n  We just received the news with regard to a dearly beloved Member of \nthis Chamber, Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts. It has been my \nprivilege to know the Kennedy family for many years. In 1949, when I \nwent to the University of Virginia Law School, his brother Bobby was \nthere. I first met Teddy Kennedy in conjunction with the things we did \nin those days at Virginia Law School. We have been very close friends \nall these ensuing years.\n  I send forth my prayers for his recovery. You know, as Churchill once \nsaid in the darkest days of the Battle of Britain: Never, never, never \ngive in. Those are the words that I know to be in Ted Kennedy's mind \nnow. He will take on this challenge. How many times have we been \nprivileged, in this Chamber, to listen to our colleague speak from that \nback row? He really doesn't need the microphone; his voice resonates to \nthe rafters in this Chamber. That great strength that propels his voice \nto reverberate throughout the Senate Chamber will be the same strength \nthat he will draw upon again in his recovery, for which we all pray.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, just before entering the Chamber, I heard \nthe devastating news about Senator Kennedy's diagnosis with a malignant \nbrain tumor. I have been there. A few years back, I was diagnosed with \na malignant brain tumor and given 3 to 6 weeks to live.\n  I note in the press release that it says:\n\n       How well patients fare depends on what specific tumor type \n     is determined by further testing.\n\n  The diagnosis for me, for a malignant brain tumor, turned out to be \nincorrect.\n  I note Senator Kennedy will be receiving chemotherapy and radiation. \nI know something about chemotherapy myself. I am in the middle of it \nright now for Hodgkin's.\n  But Senator Kennedy is a real fighter. We all know that. I am betting \non Senator Kennedy. He has been such a champion on so many causes--\ncivil rights, health, education, labor reform, and the judiciary, where \nhe served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee with great \ndistinction.\n  It would be my hope that what has happened today would provide some \nmotivation for both parties to find a bipartisan way to cross the aisle \nand to stop the bickering which has characterized the confirmation \nprocess for so many years. Senator Kennedy has been an example, a \nshining example. He has crossed the aisle and sponsored so many \nlegislative enactments. I have had the opportunity to cosponsor the \nKennedy-Specter bill, for example, on hate crimes and the civil rights \nbill that has been so often cited.\n  I have said all I had to say about the current matter. I spoke at \nlength yesterday and again today on Justice Agee. There is no doubt he \nis well qualified--the other two nominees are as well.\n  When you cite the statistics, you can cite them both ways. You can \ncite them in all directions. When you talk about fault, it is equal; \nthe blame is on both sides. The conduct of both parties in this Chamber \nhas been disgraceful in the last 20 years--both sides, first one side \nand then the other, and each time it exacerbates.\n  I worked very closely with Senator Leahy over the years, and we have \nhad some real bipartisan agreements. My hope is that he and I can get \ntogether again and find a way to solve this partisan morass and to \nestablish a timetable that once a nomination comes in, so many days \nlater, there is a hearing; so many days later, it comes out of \ncommittee; and so many days later, it comes to the floor.\n  In the middle of the battle over this so-called deal, which I have \nspoken on at length yesterday and today, the news of what has happened \nwith Senator Kennedy perhaps will give us some motivation to follow \nSenator Kennedy's lead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise principally to associate myself with \nthe remarks of Senator Warner, our senior Senator from Virginia, and to \nrecommend to this body the qualifications of Steven Agee for this \nposition and to emphasize that I believe Senator Warner and I have been \nable to accomplish some things in the last year and a half that I hope \nwe can sort of spread out in a broader way to the body here. We found \nthe issues on which we can work together in terms of governing this \ncountry in a responsible way. The judicial nominees are one of them. We \nhave worked not only closely together, we worked in the same room, \ninterviewing people who would be potential judges, recommending them \njointly to the White House, and supporting them thereafter.\n  I highly recommend this candidate.\n  I also would like to take a moment and associate myself with the \nremarks of others who expressed their concern about Senator Kennedy. He \nis truly a lion of the Senate.\n  Incidentally, I wish to also express my profound respect for the \nsenior Senator from Pennsylvania for the way he has addressed his own \nhealth challenges over the years and the example he has set for all of \nus.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I say to my distinguished colleague, \nthe junior Senator from Virginia, and my partner, I thank him so much \nfor the way in which, from the moment he has arrived at the Senate, we \nhave worked together on behalf of the interests of our Nation and our \nState. I think this is a very clear manifestation of how two Senators \nof different parties can come together and find that candidate they \njudge to be eminently qualified to serve--not only the State of \nVirginia but the other States served by the Fourth Circuit. As we know, \ncircuit court opinions are binding on a wide realm of cases throughout \nthe Nation.\n  I thank my colleague from Virginia for his participation with me as a \nfull partner in bringing this nomination to the floor.\n  Mr. WEBB. I thank the Senator. I thank him also for the leadership \nand example he has set for this body over the 30 years.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One and one half minute remains for Senators \nto speak.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I sat here, discussing with the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Specter, health matters. Senator \nSpecter is a longtime friend. He has gone through some terrible health \nissues. We were discussing that. I will not go further into that \nbecause it was a private conversation, except that he knows how much I \npray for his well-being and his continued health.\n  I would also say I thank Senator Warner and Senator Durbin and \nSenator Specter and others for what they said about Senator Kennedy.\n  We in New England especially feel extraordinarily close to Senator \nKennedy. I have known him for more than a third of a century. We have \nall heard bad news on the Senate floor. This is one of the most \ndifficult things I have heard in my 34 years here. I said to the people \nin my office, this is one of the worst days I have spent in the Senate, \nto hear this news.\n  Marcella and I will keep not only Senator Kennedy but his wonderful \nfamily in our prayers and will continue to pray for a full recovery.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 22 seconds remaining under the \ncontrol of the minority.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield back the time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof G. Steven Agee, of Virginia, to be U.S. circuit judge for the Fourth \nCircuit?\n\n[[Page S4443]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), \nthe Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about one of the great icons \nof the American West, the cowboy. The cowboy is an enduring symbol of \nstrong character, honesty, integrity, respect, and patriotism. I am \nproud to carry on a tradition started by my late colleague and friend, \nSenator Craig Thomas, by sponsoring S. Res. 483 which honors the men \nand women called cowboys, designating July 26, 2008, as the national \nday of the American cowboy. I am an accountant and one of the few \nelected officials from Wyoming who isn't known for riding a horse. But \nwhen anyone mentions my home State, the first image that comes to mind \nis a cowboy and a horse.\n  For many of us in the Senate, no one fits that image as well as my \nfriend Craig Thomas. As he went through his leukemia treatments and \nstill worked, he showed us what it was to cowboy up, to focus around \npain, and to do the job at hand. Having lived in Wyoming most of my \nlife, I have gotten to know the best cowboys in our country, and Craig \nsurely showed us what it meant to be a cowboy.\n  When Senator Thomas first began the tradition of designating a \nNational Day of the American Cowboy in 2005, he told us ``Cowboys come \nin any age, race, marital status, and gender.'' He knew the cowboy \nspirit was not about getting dressed in cowboy boots and a cowboy hat. \nHe said:\n\n       Trying to define a cowboy is like trying to rope the wind, \n     but you certainly recognize one when you see one.\n\n  We all recognized the cowboy spirit in Craig. It is about strength of \ncharacter, sound family values, courage, respect, and good common \nsense.\n  Since it was first established in 2005, the National Day of the \nAmerican Cowboy has been celebrated at rodeos across the Nation, \nincluding Cheyenne Frontier Days, known as the ``daddy of 'em all.''\n  Senator Thomas would find me remiss if I did not invite all of you to \nCheyenne Frontier Days at the end of July--or call my office to know \nabout other rodeos in our State.\n  Sadly, Senator Thomas passed away after finishing the resolution for \nthe National Day of the American Cowboy last year. But I am proud to \ncontinue the tradition he started to recognize the accomplishments and \ncontributions of all American cowboys.\n  The cowboy way of life has been passed down for generations, since \nthe first cowboys settled the American West. They were true pioneers \nwho came west to settle an untamed frontier. Many of the cow towns that \nsprung up around the cattle business when the West was being settled \nare still there now. They continue to live their western heritage.\n  The first cowboys relied on hard work and persistence and loyalty to \nmake their living in a tough country. Today's cowboys have not changed \nall that much from when the first wranglers and ranch hands started \nherding cattle on the Great Plains. Today's cowboys continue to rope \nand ride across the United States. There are about 720,000 ranchers in \nour Nation. They live and work in every State to manage nearly 100 \nmillion cattle. They are an integral part of Wyoming and many other \nWestern States, and they undoubtedly improve our way of life.\n  Now, you can be assured that cowboys work hard, but they also play \nhard. Rodeo is a sport that tests skill with a rope or challenges a \ncowboy's ability to stay on the back of a bucking rough stock for 8 \nlong seconds. One of the best parts of watching a rodeo is seeing the \namazing partnership between the cowboy and the horse. Rodeos across the \nNation, from big events such as Cheyenne Frontier Days and the National \nFinals Rodeo in Las Vegas, to weekly jackpots in rural communities such \nas Kaycee or Cody, WY, attract more than 27 million fans annually, \nmaking rodeo one of the most watched sports in America. The \nProfessional Bull Riders circuit, with its TV coverage, has expanded \nthe audience dramatically.\n  The cowboy legend still lives in our culture and our imaginations. \nJohn Wayne made cowboys larger than life in movies such as ``How the \nWest Was Won'' and ``She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,'' and ``The Cowboys.'' \nGene Autry, Roy Rogers, and Dale Evans entertained millions with their \nmusic, television, and movies, and Louis L'Amour's cowboy stories are \nread across the country. Audiences today continue to enjoy western \nnovels, cowboy movies, and country music.\n  We look up to cowboys because they are examples of honesty, \nintegrity, character, patriotism, and self-reliance. Cowboys have a \nstrong work ethic, they are compassionate, and they are good stewards \nof the land. We look to cowboys as role models for how to live up to \nthe best American qualities.\n  Craig Thomas told us that those of us from the West could always feel \nat home in Wyoming because we know it is, and always will be, cowboy \ncountry. I am proud to be from a State that continues to live the \ncowboy tradition every day. Their contributions have helped shape what \nit means to be an American and have created a high standard we can all \nstrive to meet.\n  Senator Thomas left some big cowboy boots to fill, and I am proud to \nbe able to continue his tradition of recognizing the many contributions \ncowboys have made to our country as we designate July 26 as National \nDay of the American Cowboy for 2008.\n\n[[Page S4444]]\n\n  I thank Senator Thomas for living the legend and involving us and \nAmerica.\n  I have a unanimous consent request to read.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of and the Senate now proceed \nto S. Res. 482.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 482) designating July 26, 2008, as \n     ``National Day of the American Cowboy.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, first of all, let me say this, before we get \ninto Senate business. I made some remarks outside the Senate Chamber, \nas I always do, following our Tuesday caucus. I had with me Senator \nChris Dodd and Senator John Kerry. The purpose of our being there was \nto talk about Senator Kennedy; and we did that.\n  Amidst the politics and partisanship that takes place in the Senate, \nthe casual observer may not realize how the Senate is a family. We are \n100 men and women who work hard during the day, each of us doing our \nvery best to make the country a better place. We argue, we debate, but \nwe approach each other with deep respect and friendship.\n  That is why, in the heat of battle, I always refer to my Republican \ncounterpart as my friend. That is just not something we do for \nprotocol. That is because Mitch McConnell is my friend. We say that as \nwe proceed through our debates.\n  But just as we, as Senators, celebrate joyous occasions--birthdays, \nweddings, new children and grandchildren--we also face hardship \ntogether.\n  Today, we learned the concerning news about our friend, an American \nicon, an American legend, Senator Ted Kennedy. I know I speak for every \nSenator that our thoughts and prayers are with Ted and his family.\n  I had a conversation on the floor with Senator McConnell. He told me \nduring the Republican caucus today they paused to say a prayer for \nSenator Kennedy, as we did in our caucus.\n  One of Senator Kennedy's brothers was killed in combat in World War \nII. Of course, we all know his brother, President Kennedy, was \nassassinated. We all know Attorney General Robert Kennedy, Senator \nRobert Kennedy, was assassinated.\n  As I said outside, the thing I remember and will always remember \nabout Senator Ted Kennedy is the speech he gave at his brother's \nfuneral. I was not a Member of Congress at that time, but I watched on \nnational television the speech he gave. It was remarkable what he said \nand how he delivered it. I will never forget that.\n  But in addition to that, we know one thing--all of us who know Ted \nKennedy--he is a fighter. We have heard this lion roar on the Senate \nfloor on so many occasions. His work ethic is unsurpassed. His \neffectiveness is legendary. The challenge Senator Kennedy now faces \nwill not be easy, but I think no one is more prepared to fight and beat \nit.\n  I spoke at 1 o'clock to Vicki, his wonderful wife, and she said he \nhas approached this like he does everything: with determination that he \nis going to beat it. She said he has a bounce in his step today that he \nhas not had in a long time.\n  So he is in good spirits. He is full of energy. If Ted happens to be \nwatching on C-SPAN, I want him to know all his brothers and sisters in \nthe Senate are thinking of him, cheering, and praying for him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Republican conference, at noon \ntoday, paused for a prayer for our friend and colleague, Ted Kennedy. \nAs the majority leader has indicated, we are, in spite of our political \ndifferences, one large family.\n  Senator Kennedy enjoys great respect and admiration on this side of \nthe aisle. He is, indeed, one of the most important figures to ever \nserve in this body in our history, and Republican Senators recognize \nthat as well.\n  On a personal basis, he came down to the University of Louisville, at \nmy request, a couple years ago to speak to students and the general \npublic on the campus. It was a speech of Presidential quality. He knew \nI had been an intern in the office of Senator John Sherman Cooper, who \nrepresented my State in the Senate for almost 20 years and who was a \nfast friend of his brother, President Kennedy, and of his. He brought \ndown with him to U of L that day a framed picture of his brother with \nSenator Cooper, carefully inscribed at the bottom with the most \nappropriate inscription you can imagine. He did not miss a thing.\n  Our prayers go out to Vicki and to the family.\n  On behalf of every member of the Republican conference of the Senate, \nI say to you, Ted, you enjoy our admiration and our respect, and our \nwishes for a speedy recovery.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this afternoon we take up legislation making \nemergency supplemental appropriations for the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and to help Americans cope with a sagging economy. One year \nago, Congress sent the President a war funding supplemental that \nincluded clear direction to bring our troops home, home, home, sweet \nhome, from Iraq by December of 2007. The President chose to do what? \nShame. He chose to veto that bill. If he had signed that bill, most of \nour troops would be home, home, home, sweet home today. Instead of \nbringing our troops home, the President demanded an increase in our \ncommitment of U.S. troops--shame--and treasure to this terrible, awful \nwar that has now entered its sixth year--sixth year. How long? How \nlong, O Lord, how long?\n  Mr. President, 4,081 American soldiers have died--died. One can only \ndie once. Over 30,000 U.S. soldiers have been wounded. By the end of \n2008, the war in Iraq will have cost over $608 billion--over $608 \nbillion. That is more than $608 for every minute since Jesus Christ was \nborn.\n  Today we are considering the President's request for another $178 \nbillion--another $178--billion for the wars at a time when the U.S. \neconomy is in trouble. Well, one thing is clear. Yes, I am sorry to say \none thing is clear in this request: American fighting men and women--\nyour brothers and sisters and mine--will continue to be in Iraq when \nthe Presidency of George W. Bush ends on January 20, 2009. Shame. I was \nagainst that terrible, horrible war from the beginning and so stated on \nthis floor time after time after time.\n  Long after our military fulfilled its mission in Iraq, the White \nHouse failed to advance a viable strategy for establishing long-term \nstability in Iraq. In response, we in the Congress will support our \ntroops--your troops, my troops, our troops--but we will also continue \nour efforts to get our troops out--O-U-T--of Iraq with honor and take \ncare of our troops after they come home.\n  In the third committee amendment, we set a goal for reducing the \nscope of the mission in Iraq by June of 2009. We ensure our troop \nreadiness levels are maintained. We limit the time our troops will \nserve in Iraq. We require Iraq to use more of its surplus oil revenues \nfor reconstruction costs, and we require that any long-term commitments \nthis lameduck President may make with the Government of Iraq be \nconsidered as treaties, subject to approval by this Senate.\n  While the war continues in its sixth year--shame--our economy at home \nis in trouble. Because of President Bush's failed fiscal leadership, in \nthe last 7 years the U.S. Government has amassed the five largest \ndeficits in the history of this great Republic. President Bush has more \nthan doubled the U.S. debt held by China, Japan, and other countries. \nEconomic growth almost came to a halt at the end of last year, with the \ngross domestic product falling from 4.9 percent in the third quarter to \n0.6 percent--0.6 percent--in the fourth quarter.\n  Growth remains at a paltry 0.6 percent this year. Since March 2007, \nthe number of unemployed has increased by 1.1 million workers up to 7.8 \nmillion workers. In April, the number of Americans who were out of work \nfor at least 27 weeks rose to 1.35 million.\n  Yet the President--your President, my President, our President--is \nsatisfied to allow unemployment benefits to expire after just 26 weeks. \nDid you hear that? Shame. I have reviewed the President's request \ncarefully, and there is no evidence--none--of the President asking for \nfunding to invest in America or to help struggling Americans deal with \nthe faltering economy.\n  Yet the President--your President, this President, our President--has \nalready thrown down the gauntlet by threatening to veto the \nsupplemental bill if the Congress has the temerity--did you hear that--\nto add one thin dime above his request in order to help our citizens at \nhome.\n  Thirty-two months after Hurricane Katrina, the President continues to \nresist efforts to help the victims of that terrible storm. The homeless \npopulation in New Orleans has doubled to nearly 12,000 since Hurricane \nKatrina. Only 48 percent of the pre-Katrina hospital beds in the region \nwere staffed as of November of 2006. Violent crime in Louisiana grew 53 \npercent last year.\n  In the last 18 months, the President has designated 61 disasters for \nfloods in 32 States. Yet the President has not--n-o-t, not--you know, \nthere was a duel between John Shot and John Not. In this case, it was \nbetter to be Shot than Not. The President has not requested funds to \nrepair levees or other flood prevention efforts, leaving our citizens \nin Arkansas--did you hear that--Missouri, Louisiana, and other States, \nvulnerable to more flooding. But when it comes to Iraq, the President \nwants the dollars to flow, flow, flow.\n  Congress has already approved $45 billion requested by the President \nfor reconstruction projects in Iraq. Despite the fact that the Iraqi \nGovernment is running a huge surplus due to excess oil revenues, our \nPresident--your President, my President, the American President--is \nasking this Congress--the buck stops here--asking you and me and the \npeople in this Congress to approve another $5.6 billion of American \ntaxpayer dollars for reconstruction in Iraq.\n  The President claims that by adding funding for America to this bill \nwe are holding hostage money for the troops. Oh, my heavens, what \nhogwash. What hogwash. Last year, we sent the President a war \nsupplemental that increased funding to provide better health care for \nour soldiers, better health care for our veterans, more funding to \nequip and train the National Guard and Reserve, more funding for mine \nresistant vehicles, and clear direction to bring our troops home--home \nsweet home. This year, we once again take care of our troops, but we \nalso invest in America.\n  Last week, the Senate Appropriations Committee met and approved \namendments that meet these objectives. Based on the committee action, \nthe Senate will consider amendments that fully fund the President's \nrequest for the war. In fact, the legislation increases funding above \nthe President's $168 billion request for the Department of Defense. We \ninclude increases for the health care of our troops, for Guard and \nReserve equipment, for repairing and constructing barracks, for the \nmission in Afghanistan, for military childcare facilities, for \nimproving contract management, and for helping--yes, Senator Webb--\nwounded troops returning home--home sweet home.\n  We honor those who have served America by increasing educational \nbenefits for our veterans. We extend unemployment benefits by another \n13 weeks. We honor promises made to the victims of Hurricane Katrina by \nfunding a 100-year levee in Louisiana, restoring barrier islands in \nMississippi, and by rebuilding hospitals, helping\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\nthe homeless, and fighting crime. We roll back Medicaid regulations \nthat our Nation's Governors believe disrupt health coverage for \nvulnerable citizens. We respond to dramatic increases in food prices by \nincreasing funding for the global food aid program.\n  We are also generous in providing humanitarian relief to disaster \nvictims in China, Bangladesh, and Burma. We reduce funding for \nreconstruction in Iraq. We limit the size of taxpayer-financed \nreconstruction projects. And we require Iraq to match our tax dollars \nwith their surplus oil revenues.\n  This legislation includes provisions that have broad bipartisan \nsupport. The veterans legislation has 58 cosponsors. The Medicaid \nlegislation passed the House by a vote of 349 to 62. I have a letter \nfrom 56 Senators seeking additional Byrne crimefighting funding. We \nfund the Rural Schools Program, which runs out of money on June 30, \n2008.\n  In total, the amendments include $194 billion for programs under the \njurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee, $10 billion above the \nPresident's request. This increase is less than what we spend in Iraq \nin 1 month.\n\n  So I say to my fellow Senators, Mr. President, this is responsible \nlegislation that supports our troops, responsible legislation that \nhonors our veterans, responsible legislation that helps our citizens \ncope with a troubled economy.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are still wrestling with the challenge \nof what to do about the supplemental appropriations that have been \nrequested by the administration.\n  This morning, in our Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, chaired \nby the distinguished Chair's State colleague, Mr. Inouye, and also led \non the Republican side by the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. \nStevens, we heard testimony from the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Gates, \nand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen. They \ndrew a very frightening picture of what is happening to the military \nforces, not just in Iraq and Afghanistan and deployed elsewhere in the \nworld, but also in our training accounts, many other support activities \nfor our military, pay and allowances--all the accounts that fund the \nDepartment of Defense that have been included in the supplemental \nbudget request are suffering and many are running dry. The accounts are \nrunning dry.\n  We are at a point that is past serious. I am not going to say it is \ndesperate, but it certainly concerns this Senator that we continue to \nwait and wait and wait on Congress to act on the President's request \nfor supplemental appropriations for our military forces at a time when \nthey are engaged in military action overseas and protecting our \nsecurity interests here at home. So I am pleased the Senate is taking \nup this request to fund activities in Afghanistan and Iraq and to \nrespond to domestic natural disasters.\n  It is important that we act expeditiously to consider this \nlegislation so we can reconcile our differences with the other body and \nwith the President. The President submitted the bulk of his \nsupplemental request in February 2007 in conjunction with his regular \nfiscal year 2008 budget submission. He did so because Congress clearly \nexpressed its desire for a full-year estimate of war costs. But \nCongress did not appropriate a full year's funding. Instead, Congress \napproved a $70 billion bridge fund to support our operations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. Enacting even that amount required a protracted \nstruggle among the House, the Senate, and the President. As a result, \nthe Department of Defense had to issue furlough notices, make a series \nof inefficient transfers and reprogrammings, and generally function in \nways that detracted from its primary duties.\n  We find ourselves today facing a very similar situation. It has been \nmore than 15 months since the President submitted this request. We have \nnot approved or otherwise acted upon some $108 billion of that request.\n  The personnel and operations and maintenance accounts that support \nour activities in Iraq and Afghanistan are running low. This morning, \nSecretary Gates was asked about the consequences of this situation, and \nI am going to read into the Record, with the permission of my \ncolleagues, some comments directly from that hearing this morning. This \nis Secretary Gates:\n\n       There is, however, a more immediate concern. Congress has \n     yet to pass the pending $102.5 billion global war on terror \n     request for fiscal year 2008. And as a result, the Defense \n     Department is currently using fourth quarter funds from the \n     base budget to cover current war costs. Shortly, two critical \n     accounts will run dry. First, Army military personnel after \n     June 15. We will run out of funds in this account to pay \n     soldiers, including those in Iraq and Afghanistan. Second, \n     operations and maintenance accounts. Around July 5, O funds \n     across the services will run out, starting with the Army. \n     This may result in civilian furloughs, limits on training, \n     and curbing family support activities.\n       If war funds are not available, the Defense Department can \n     transfer funds from Navy and Air Force military personnel \n     accounts to pay soldiers, but that would get us only to late \n     July. Using the limited transfer authority granted by \n     Congress would also help get us to late July. Doing so, \n     however, is a shell game which will disrupt existing programs \n     and push the services O accounts to the edge of fiscal \n     viability.\n\n  I could go on. He went on into some more detail about other accounts. \nI think we get the picture. I got the picture.\n  Our full subcommittee membership was in attendance for most of the \nhearing. I was disappointed that I was sitting there listening to the \nconsequences of deliberate actions by the Congress to delay the \navailability of funding for our national defense, not just war funding \nfor Iraq and Afghanistan; it has implications across the Department of \nDefense and into other accounts in other departments that are likewise \naffected by this denial of funding for our forces at a time when we \nneed them to be fully prepared, fully trained, and fully engaged to \nhelp win the war against terror.\n  According to an earlier letter, so you won't get the impression that \nwe have not been forewarned, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Gordon \nEngland, wrote us a letter on May 15 advising us that the Army would \nrun out of military personnel funds by mid-June. He said if the \nsupplemental legislation is not enacted by Memorial Day, the Department \nof Defense will be compelled to borrow funds from other services to \nfinance Army operations into July and the Army would be out of options \nto pay its soldiers. He said the Department would be compelled to \nconstrain expenditures from the Army operations and maintenance \naccounts. He said it will have to issue notices of potential furloughs \nof civilians funded from this account.\n  So we have been on notice from the Deputy Secretary and now this \nmorning from the Secretary himself, as well as the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff.\n  We have been advised that the operations and maintenance accounts \nalso fund the Commander's Emergency Response Program, a program that is \ncritical to the success of our military commanders in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. He said those funds will run out in June.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from Secretary England.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                         Department of Defense\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 2008.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cochran: I am writing you to follow up on the \n     Secretary's letter of May 5 regarding the Department's \n     financial posture and the urgent need for Congress to pass \n     supplemental funding legislation for the Global War on Terror \n     (GWOT).\n       As briefed to senior Congressional staff last week, absent \n     additional Congressional action, the Army will run out of \n     Military Personnel funds by mid-June and Operation and \n     Maintenance (O) funds by early July. Funding for civilian \n     personnel is included in the O account. Also included \n     within the O account is the authority to continue the \n     Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) activities in \n     Central Command. CERP funding is a critical enabler that our \n     ground force commanders are using on a daily basis in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan to shape the strategic environment. This \n     authority will be fully expended in June, and reprogramming \n     actions cannot extend this particular authority.\n       If GWOT supplemental legislation is not enacted by Memorial \n     Day, then the Department will submit to the Congress two \n     reprogramming actions on May 27. These reprogramming actions \n     for personnel and for\n\n[[Page S4463]]\n\n     O accounts will finance Army operations until late July by \n     borrowing money from other Services. By that point in late \n     July, the entire Department will be in extremis, having \n     exhausted all avenues of funding and will be unable to make \n     payroll for both military and civilian personnel throughout \n     the Department. Service members, including those engaged in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan, would continue to serve but without pay \n     since military personnel accounts would be exhausted.\n       Further, at that time, O funding would also be depleted, \n     and DoD activities around the globe would be reduced to \n     essential activities. Additionally, other measures would need \n     to be taken, such as civilian furloughs and limits on non-\n     essential operations. These highly disruptive steps would \n     have to begin well before late July.\n       While the Department has the reprogramming recourse on May \n     27th as discussed, if legislation is not passed by Memorial \n     Day, the Department will still be operating with less than \n     the desired effectiveness and efficiency. Therefore, I urge \n     you to provide the essential GWOT funding before the Memorial \n     Day recess.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gordon England,\n                                      Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, what are we going to do? Are we going to \nlet our men and women in the field stop their activities? Is that what \nCongress is urging be done, just sit down, stop what you are doing in \nIraq and Afghanistan? I don't believe that. That is not the message \nthis Senate wants to send or intends to send. But we should not put the \nmen and women of our Armed Forces and their families here at home \nthrough such an ordeal and a period of such unnecessary uncertainty. We \nshould not cause the Department of Defense to operate at less than peak \nefficiency or take actions that are demoralizing for Department \npersonnel simply because Congress fails to act in a timely manner.\n  I don't know why it has taken Congress so long to act. I do know the \nrequest has been before the Congress for more than 15 months. Think \nabout it: an emergency supplemental request for funds for national \nsecurity languishing in Congress for 15 months. Most people don't know \nthat.\n  We have held hearings, we have had meetings with administration \nofficials, we have heard testimony from General Petraeus, our commander \nin Iraq. Our Ambassador in Iraq has testified about the consequences on \naccounts for the Department of State which are also included in the \nlegislation. But instead of marking up a supplemental bill to respond \nto the request a month ago, as had originally been planned, the \nmajority chose to spend weeks talking with the majority in the other \nbody, trying to decide what to do, when to do it, negotiating with \nthemselves.\n  I would have hoped that the legislation could have been brought up \nunder a better parliamentary scheme designed to get the job done, not \nto just create political advantage, not just to put off the inevitable \nday of reckoning. That is an unfortunate choice to make. The fact is, \nhad we followed the regular order, we could have had a bill to the \nPresident by now. Had he chosen to veto the bill, we might well be \nworking this week to resolve differences with the administration and \nproduce a bill that could be signed or whatever the Congress decided to \ndo to work its will, but to act. Instead, we are facing the approach of \na Memorial Day recess with no clear path, no clear plan to enactment of \nlegislation and little prospect for meaningful input by Members of the \nSenate.\n  I applaud the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, my good \nfriend from West Virginia, for calling our committee to a markup of the \nsupplemental. When it became apparent that the leadership plan was to \nbypass the Appropriations Committee in both Houses, our side wrote a \nletter to the chairman expressing our preference for a committee \nmarkup. I suspected that was consistent with his views, too, and that \nwas correct.\n  We know about the prerogatives of the Appropriations Committee and \nhow the chairman safeguards those and how he respects all members of \nour committee. So he honored that request. But the other body has not \nacted in this way. There still has been no markup in the other body.\n  So we are in this dilemma. We are asked by our respective Houses--the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense--to make recommendations, to \nproduce legislation to take care of our country, to defend our \ninterests, but we have not found a pathway to enacting a bill or \nresponding in a professional way to the wishes of our Members.\n  As it stands now, the Senate amendments contain a number of \nlegislative provisions and appropriations that were not included in the \nPresident's request. The President has said very clearly he will veto \nthis bill if it includes language that unduly constrains our military \ncommanders in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan or which imposes \nartificial timelines for withdrawal. He has also said he will veto a \nbill that is too costly.\n  I am not one who thinks an appropriations request submitted by this \nPresident or any other President is written in holy tablets, somehow \nimmutable and not subject to improvement or change during the \nlegislative process. The Senate and the House have a right to work \ntheir will. Since the President saw fit to recommend certain measures \nto protect the State of Louisiana from future hurricanes in response to \nMembers' requests for those funds, I thought it appropriate to \nrecommend certain projects that would similarly be helpful to my State, \nwhich was also a victim of Katrina, to deal with the continuing \nchallenges to the security and the well-being of the citizens of that \nregion if other hurricanes strike in the future.\n  The President has every right to look at those requests and make his \ndecision. But I do not think he is going to veto this bill because of \nthose requests that are included in the bill. I think he is sympathetic \nto the needs of the Mississippi and Louisiana gulf coasts and elsewhere \nin the country, so accounts that were depleted because of the \ndestruction of the hurricane can be renewed and resupplied in this \nsupplemental. The committee has approved including those funds.\n  We need to find common ground. This is what I am saying. We have had \ndifferences of opinion with the administration--Members on my side \nhave; some on the other side have--for various reasons. But let's get \nto a point where we can work out our differences. If he wants to veto \nthe bill, he will veto the bill, and we will see whether we have the \nvotes to override it. If we do not, we can try again. Eventually these \nfunds have to be made available. These requests are too important to be \nignored any longer. We need to find common ground. That is what I am \nsaying. And we need to do it now.\n  We do not need to prolong this activity--describe it however you want \nto--any longer. We need to get down to brass tacks. We cannot allow \npolitical maneuvering on either side to obscure our core duty in this \nmatter. We need to provide our men and women in the field with the \nresources necessary to conduct successfully the mission assigned to \nthem by our Government, and to do it without undue delay.\n  I do not think the exchange of messages--strategy, or whatever you \nwant to call it--is appropriate or necessary as a substitute for \nlegislation. I do not think it will result in an enacted bill any \nsooner than had we simply acted in the regular order. But that choice \nhas been made, and we must deal with it. I will do my best. I commit \nmyself to work with the Senate leadership, with our colleagues in the \nother body, and with the President to find a way to get the job done in \na timely manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Hear, hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cochran for his views and \nhis many courtesies. Last week the Senate Appropriations Committee had \na 3\\1/2\\-hour markup of the important legislation that is now before \nthe Senate. I hope the Senate can approve this legislation to support \nthe troops and to help Americans cope with the sagging economy--this \nweek.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nengage in a colloquy with the senior Senator from Nebraska and the \nsenior Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to join two of my three \nprincipal cosponsors on S. 22 in speaking about how important this \npiece of legislation\n\n[[Page S4464]]\n\nis, and how appropriate it is to have it be placed on the supplemental \nappropriations measure. The senior Senator from Virginia has an \namendment we are going to offer. Hopefully, in the spirit of what the \nSenator from Mississippi just said, we will try to lay some of these \narguments by the wayside and get a bill that will truly provide the \nright kind of readjustment benefits to those who have been performing \nsuch exemplary service since 9/11.\n  S. 22 was introduced on the first day of this Congress. From that \npoint we have had strong bipartisan and bicameral support. We now have \n58 cosponsors in the Senate, including 11 Republicans. Among those \nRepublicans is the senior Senator from Virginia, the former chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, and the senior Senator from Nebraska, the \nonly Member of this body to have served in a high-ranking position in \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Just last week in the House, in spite of some of the debates that \nwent into pay-for provisions and tax provisions, we saw a strong vote. \nWe had 300 sponsors of this provision in the House, including more than \n90 Republicans. Even on what was largely viewed as a partisan vote in \nother areas, we had 33 Republicans vote for this bill.\n  This bill is supported by the current chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee; as I mentioned, Senator Warner, the former chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee and the former Secretary of the Navy; the \nserving chairman of the Veterans' Committee, Senator Akaka, who was \njust in the chair; the former chairman of the Veterans' Committee, \nSenator Specter. It has the strong support of all of our leading \nveterans organizations, including the American Legion, the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, the Iraq-Afghanistan Veterans. The Disabled American \nVeterans have taken a firm position, as have many more.\n  We have, I would say, at least 15 of the top veterans organizations \nhaving participated in the modification of this bill and strongly \nsupporting it. Many major higher educational institutions and \nassociations have endorsed this bill, including the American Council on \nEducation, the National Association of Independent Colleges and \nUniversities, and the National Association of State and Land Grant \nColleges.\n  This bill is carefully crafted. It has been substantially improved by \nthe participation of all of the groups that I just mentioned plus many \nof our Members. It is appropriate on this legislation as a cost of war.\n  There are people who discuss this in terms of cost. This is a bill \nthat closely resembles the benefits that we gave to our returning \nveterans in World War II--a series of educational benefits which \nleveled the playing field in America and allowed those who served a \nfirst-class opportunity to move into the future. We owe these young \nmen and women who have been serving since 9/11 no less. We owe them no \nless. This is emphatically a cost of war.\n\n  When we can spend $600 billion and, by some estimates, $3 trillion in \na life cycle as a result of this war, the least we can do is spend the \nmoney in this bill to allow these people the best opportunity they have \nto succeed in their lives.\n  There has been some resistance from some of the Members of this \nbody--some of the Republican Members of this body--and also from the \nadministration to this bill. Some have said it is too generous. I just \ndiscussed that. We worked very hard to make it fair and relevant to the \npriorities we should be having. Some have said it would be difficult to \nadminister. We have worked with the Department of Veterans Affairs and \nwith the Department of Defense on areas where they had concerns, and we \naddressed those concerns. It is interesting to point out, for those who \ntalk about the potential difficulty of administering a bill such as \nthis, that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs was able to \nadminister a very similar bill after World War II in a day where we \ndidn't have computers, and they were able to do it for 8 million \npeople. We are not talking anywhere near that number, so I believe we \nhave addressed all of those concerns.\n  The last issue that has been discussed, and it has come up again and \nagain, is the concern that provisions such as are contained in this \nbill would affect retention in the Active-Duty military. As someone who \nhas spent 5 years in the Pentagon, 1 as a marine and 4 as a defense \nexecutive working on manpower issues--and I am sure Senator Warner who \nspent more time in the Pentagon than I have would share this \ncommentary--I believe the provisions of this bill actually will \ndramatically increase recruitment and that the manpower model would \nbenefit from it.\n  With respect to retention itself, the discussion has been made that a \nbill like this should have, as a part of it, a concept called \ntransferability, which would allow Active-Duty military people to \ntransfer this educational benefit to family members.\n  I want to make a clarification as to where the main target of this \nbill is, then I want to speak very briefly about transferability, and \nthen I would like to recognize my colleague from Nebraska.\n  I believe there is a misperception in this country that because we \nhave an all-volunteer system, we actually have an all-career military. \nWe do not. A lot of people come to the military in the United States \nbecause they love their country, because they have a family tradition, \nbecause they want to soldier for a while and then move on to other \nthings. Frankly, these are the people who have not been properly taken \ncare of in the years since 9/11, and they are the principal target of \nour legislation.\n  The U.S. military has done a very good job taking care of its career \nforce. When you hear arguments about entitlement to transferability, \nagain, they are talking about managing the career force. But these are \nthe actual numbers that have been given to us by the manpower chiefs in \nthe Department of Defense.\n  In the U.S. Army, by the time a cohort group has finished its first \nenlistment, 75.5 percent of them have left or will leave the U.S. Army \nat the end of a first enlistment. In the Marine Corps, 70 percent of \nthe people who enlist will leave by the end of their first enlistment, \neither through attrition or deciding not to reenlist. For approximately \n50 percent of the Air Force and the Navy it is the same.\n  If you look at the Active-Duty military on the enlisted side, an \noverwhelming majority of them leave the military by the end of their \nfirst enlistment. These are the people who have had readjustment \ndifficulties that we have talked about. These are the people who \ndeserve to have a first-class education in order to move them into the \nfuture.\n  This group over here, about a quarter of the Army, about 30 percent \nof the Marine Corps, and about half of the Air Force and the Navy, are \nthe people who reenlist at least for one term. This is the group that \nhas received so much of the argument of this administration on issues \nof retention. We need to take care of this group. We are prepared today \nto discuss a way to address this transferability issue with this \nsmaller but very important group.\n  I point out with the issue of transferability that Senator Warner had \nintroduced a provision that was enacted into law about 6 years ago that \nallowed the Service Secretaries to provide transferability to military \npeople at the discretion of the Service Secretaries as a retention \ndevice. This has been in the law for 6 years with respect to the \nMontgomery GI bill, the bill we are going to replace. It has almost \nnever been used.\n  On the one hand, we hear all this talk from the Department of Defense \nabout how important this is and how they hear about it every day when \nthey go out to their meetings and their townhall meetings, but the \nService Secretaries have almost never used this benefit that has \nalready been on the books. So I am concerned about how widely this \nbenefit would actually be used.\n  At the same time, I believe it is important, and our principal \nsponsors believe it is important, that we continue the existing law \nwith some modification to give the U.S. Department of Defense the \nopportunity to test it again, to put it in this bill, continue it as \nlaw with some tweaks on it. As the Senator from Mississippi had said \nearlier, I hope with this gesture that we can get full support for this \nlegislation and get it into law. The clock ticks for young people after \nthey leave the military in terms of how they are going to readjust to \nthe rest of their lives. The clock has\n\n[[Page S4465]]\n\nbeen ticking for a lot of people since 9/11, and it is our duty to do \nsomething about it this year.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Nebraska, my \nlongtime friend, Vietnam combat veteran, and former official in the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am grateful to my colleague, the junior \nSenator from Virginia, for his continued leadership and years of \ncontributions to our country, especially on behalf of our veterans. I \nwould like to make some remarks focused on the general scope of what \nthis effort is about.\n  The Senator from Virginia has laid out very concisely, cogently, some \nof the realities of the force structure we have today and why it is \nimportant and in the opinion of almost 60 Senators and over 300 House \nMembers that we take the so-called GI educational benefits this country \ncommitted to beginning in 1944 when President Truman signed the first \nbill and roll those forward into the 21st century, because what has \nhappened is that we are now caught in a different kind of a world, \ndifferent kinds of wars, different kinds of requirements. But what has \nnot changed is the absolute necessity that we rely on quality \nindividuals to man our force structure. In a world that is far more \ncomplicated, combustible, and dangerous than ever before, it has \nrequired new sets of skills, obviously technologies, to defend our \ncountry, our interests in the world. It is that reality that we must \nadjust to within the framework of all of our policies.\n  What we are doing here is not adding a new benefit, we are not adding \na welfare program; what we are doing is we are bringing up to date the \nbenefits earned by men and women who have committed a good part of \ntheir lives to our country. We had that debate a long time ago, whether \nAmerica wants to do that. Now, unless there are some individuals in the \nCongress or in America who want to go back and reengage that issue, we \ncan do that, but I do not think that is the case. I think we recognize \nthose who serve. I think we also, in recognizing their service, \nunderstand they have earned certain benefits.\n  So we are rotating a GI educational benefit system forward into the \n21st century, a system that has not been changed for 25 years. And as \nreflected in Senator Webb's charts--these, by the way, I remind our \ncolleagues, as was noted by the junior Senator from Virginia, these are \nnot his numbers, these are numbers from the Defense Department. So if \nwe are to take care of our people, because we rely on our people to \ntake care of us, if we rely on that rifleman, that person at the bottom \nwho has always been the one whom we have asked to fight the war--fight \nthe war, die in the war, sacrifices by their families, those who do not \ncome back, many who come back are seriously scarred, wounded, will \nnever recover. That is the reality of the world in which we are living. \nSo we are talking about a relevant system, relevant to today's costs \nfor an education.\n  I benefited from the GI bill when I came back from Vietnam, as did \nthe junior Senator from Virginia, as did the senior Senator from \nVirginia when he came back from World War II, the Korean war, as did \nalmost every veteran in this body who has fought in a war benefitted \nfrom this program. So it is important that we get something very clear; \nthat is, this is not a new program.\n  Now, as the Senator from Virginia noted, this then fits into the \nlarger framework of a cost of war. Unless we are going to just discard \nthe people whom we count on, that rifleman at the bottom who does not \nhave much say in all of this, by the way--he is told to take the hill; \nhe takes the hill. He doesn't set policy. Our military doesn't set our \nwar policy. They have input and influence into the strategy, into the \ntactics, but we, the elected officials of America, starting with the \nPresident, his team, and the Congress, we are the ones who set policy, \nwe are the ones who engage our Nation in war.\n  By the way, just as an aside, I think we should go back to a day in \nthis country when we wanted and did, in fact, commit our Nation to war, \nwe should declare that in the Congress of the United States, we should \ndeclare war rather than these skirmishes that we kind of on the side \nfund and we on the side deal with. We on the side never really come \nclean with the reality.\n  Here is an opportunity for us to do what is right and what is wise--\nwhat is right and wise; that is, to bring this educational benefit \nprogram forward.\n  The Senator from Virginia noted something that is very important--the \nadministration of this program. That is always important, who \nadministers the program, how will it work, can it work?\n  We have worked very diligently--our staffs, with many Members \ninvolved--with the Veterans' Administration, the Department of Defense, \nto make this work. We have ample testimony, recent testimony before the \nVeterans' Committee in the Senate from senior Veterans Administration' \nofficials saying: This can work. We can now do this. We can implement \nthis.\n  The cost. The cost is an interesting debate, in my opinion, because \nif, in fact, we are a nation that can afford the cost of war, we can \nafford $12 billion a month waging the war in Iraq, we can afford all \nthe requirements it takes for a nation to go to war, but somehow we are \ndisconnected from the obligation and responsibility of taking care of \nthose who fight the wars? We somehow can't find the money for that? We \nsomehow want to look the other way? I don't think so. I don't think the \nAmerican people--and they never have been--are in agreement with that.\n  As to the retention issue, the Senator from Virginia again addressed \nthis. Even taking the Senator's arguments, as clearly as the Senator \nfrom Virginia did, and making those arguments--and I can make them \nagain, and others will--I am not sure that is even necessary because \nthis is not a retention bill. There is a consequence to this bill, of \ncourse. We should frame within the text and the context of this bill a \ndynamic of retention: How can we make it attractive for our young \npeople to serve aside from the fact that they love their country, they \nwant to be part of something larger than their own self-interest, they \nwant to make a noble contribution to freedom, to the world, to peace, \nto their families, to their future? And you can't substitute that. That \nis bigger than any benefit. Of course it is.\n  But the reality is, just as Harry Truman and just as our leaders back \nduring World War II understood, just as every leader has understood \nsince then, as we have continued to commit to our veterans, those who \nfight the wars and their families, it is wise to reinvest in our \nsociety.\n  How do you reinvest in our society? Well, one way, certainly an \nimportant way, is education. It is assuring these men and women who \ngive of themselves--in a very selfless way that very few people do, by \nthe way, especially today, when you look at less than 1 percent of the \nsociety, the American society, our population, less than 1 percent is \nbearing all of the burden. They are carrying it all for the rest of us. \nWhat do I mean by that? Because they are the few who are serving in two \nwars, rotation after rotation in Afghanistan and Iraq and on duty all \nover the world and in this country. So when they are finished, just as \nthe Senator from Virginia has noted, in the Army and Marine Corps, it \nis more than 50 percent, after the first enlistment, that leave. Would \nit not be smarter, would it not be wise to reinvest in these people, to \nhelp them get an education so they can continue to contribute to \nAmerica and strengthen America in every way?\n\n  National security is not only about the military. In fact, I think we \ncan make a pretty strong argument that the military is obviously an \nessential component, but just as important is the economic vitality, \nthis culture, the society, the commitment, the education of a society. \nThat all has an awful lot to do with the national security of a nation.\n  This makes sense. This bill makes sense. It makes sense on this \nsupplemental. This isn't divorced from that. This isn't an add-on to \nthat. This isn't something we just invented. This is part of a larger \ncontext of service and earned benefits for those who serve.\n  I am very pleased that we are finding more and more ways to enlist \nmore individuals in this effort. I think with what the Senator from \nVirginia noted as to an add-on on transferability, it\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\nmakes it more attractive. The senior Senator from Virginia, I assume, \nis going to speak to that when he takes the floor in a moment. I think \nwhen we frame up all of this, as the Senator from Virginia noted, this \nis the product of a composite of contributions from many individuals, \nfrom almost every veterans group I am aware of, from people who care \nabout their country, who care about the veterans who serve this \ncountry, and care about our future.\n  I appreciate the leadership of the junior Senator from Virginia.\n  I understand in our series of colloquies that the senior Senator from \nVirginia is prepared to make some comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Hagel, and I \nthank my distinguished partner in the Senate, Mr. Webb. We have known \neach other for a very long time, over 30 years. When I was in the \nPentagon, we were associated together at that time. He had a long and \ndistinguished career in the U.S. Marine Corps and following that in the \nDepartment of Defense in two very senior--including Secretary of the \nNavy--positions of civilian leadership. He has shown that same \nleadership from the day he crossed the threshold of the Senate, that \nthis is his No. 1 priority. And how pleased and, indeed, humbled I am \nto join him and my good friend, Senator Hagel, in making this possible.\n  What we are trying to do, very simply, is to enable this generation \nof young men and women to have, as nearly as possible, the same \nbenefits as former generations--most specifically, the generation from \nWorld War II and the Korean War generation of which I was a part.\n  Both of these gentlemen are highly decorated combat veterans. I have \na less significant career in the service. But all three of us bring our \nown experience to bear on thinking this is essential for this \ngeneration who is going out and fighting as courageously as any \nservicemember in the history of this country and, in fact, perhaps with \nan added measure of courage because they are fighting an enemy that is \nso difficult to define, an enemy that does not have any state-sponsored \nnation attached to it, which is the form of the terrorism today.\n  I wish to thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, who has graced us on this floor for the purpose of listening \nin on this debate, for guiding it through the current supplemental bill \nin the Senate, and including Senator Webb's bill in it. Indeed, I saw \nSenator Murray here and Senator Inouye, who both helped us get that \ndone.\n  Now, much has been said by my colleagues about how we are trying to \nbring up the level of funding for the GI bill from the current existing \nMontgomery GI bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis document which traces the history of what is known as the Pell \nGrant Program.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                              PELL GRANT FUNDING, FY2000-09\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          Fiscal year                             Academic year     Maximum award      Recipients       Average award     Appropriation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2000..........................................................           2001-01            $3,300         3,899,433            $2,040    $7,639,717,000\n2001..........................................................           2001-01             3,750         4,812,000             2,411     8,756,000,000\n2002..........................................................           2002-03             4,000         4,778,507             2,434    11,314,000,000\n2003..........................................................           2003-04             4,050         5,139,638             2,469    11,364,647,000\n2004..........................................................           2004-05             4,050         5,308,433             2,473    12,006,738,000\n2005..........................................................           2005-06             4,050         5,164,000             2,455    12,364,997,000\n2006..........................................................           2006-07             4,050         5,159,139             2,480  * 17,345,230,000\n2007..........................................................           2007-08             4,310         5,427,611             2,650    13,660,711,000\n2008 Discretionary............................................                               4,241                                       14,215,000,0000\n2008 Mandatory................................................                                 490                                         2,030,000,000\n2008 Total....................................................           2008-09             4,731         5,577,937             2,945    16,245,000,000\n2009 Request..................................................                               4,310                                        13,851,059,000\n2009 Mandatory................................................                                 490                                         2,090,000,000\n2009 Total Request............................................         2009-2010            $4,800         5,764,108            $3,154   $18,941,059,000\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Compiled by CRS from Department of Education tables, based on December 2007 assumptions.\nNote: Appropriations may include funds to retire previous year shortfalls. This amount inlcudes $4.3 billion in mandatory funding to eliminate the\n  program's accumulated funding shortfall.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. That is a very fine program enabling individuals who are \nqualified to go to colleges and universities all across America--all \nacross America--to any college or university that accepts them, to \nobtain a grant from the United States of America to help him or her \nwith their tuition and other expenses.\n  This is the interesting thing. The program was initiated in 2000, but \nI use as a benchmark the year 2001. There were 4.8 million individuals \nwho accessed this program. The Congress appropriated $8.7 billion to \ndefer their expenses. Fast forwarding from 2001 until 2009, the total \nrequest is as follows: roughly, a 20-percent increase in the number of \nindividuals going. It goes from 4.8 million to 5.7 million, a little \nunder 1 million. Now here is the astonishing thing. The amount of money \nCongress appropriates for the 2009 class of 5.7 million is $18.9 \nmillion.\n  Mr. WEBB. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. WEBB. My understanding of the program is that would be $18 \nbillion.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator for correcting me. In the year 2009, \nit is $18.9 billion. That is over a 100-percent increase, keeping up \nwith inflation, keeping up with added expenses. But that is not the \ncase with the existing GI bill. Although there has been a CPI \nadjustment, it doesn't compare to how Congress has treated the \ncategory, a well-deserving category, of the Pell grants. So this is \nessentially what we are trying to do.\n  My colleagues, the three of us, have worked together on the question \nof transferability. I wish to go back and acquaint the Senate with some \nhistory. I was chairman in 2001 of the Armed Services Committee, and I \nworked with a distinguished former colleague, Senator Max Cleland. He \nintroduced, along with myself, on May 23, 2001, an amendment on the \nability of a service person, after stipulating periods of time, to have \nsome transferability to his family. The cosponsors, at that time, of \nthe original amendment were Senators Bingaman, Dayton, Kennedy, Levin, \nand myself. I was the only Republican. There were several other \nSenators, four more. I was the only Republican who stepped up at that \ntime. Later it became a bipartisan effort. In the evolution of events \nthat year, we marked it up. But here is the interesting thing. On June \n28, 2001, in the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, at a full \ncommittee hearing, there was no markup or no action taken on the bill. \nSo then we decided, on the Armed Services Committee, we would act. In \nSeptember of 2001, our bill was accepted by the full Senate and became \nlaw on December 28, 2001.\n  I pay my respect to those who formulated the concept of \ntransferability originally in the Senate. It is the law today. I will \nsend to the desk later today an amendment, which Senator Webb, Senator \nHagel, and I worked on. We are joined by two other original cosponsors, \nSenator Levin, current chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and \nSenator Akaka, current chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. \nThis amendment will be filed at the desk this afternoon. We are going \nto make a technical adjustment to it. The purpose of this amendment is \nto provide a 2-year pilot program of transferability. We track as \nclosely as possible the original law I recited that was enacted on \nDecember 28, 2001. The details will be provided to the full Senate when \nwe file the amendment.\n  Essentially, we are asking an individual to complete his or her first \n4-year term of enlistment and then, if they enlist for another 6 years, \nthere is a vesting over a period of time of the\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\nfull transferability of their benefits, as a sequence of time, to their \nfamily.\n  In the letter from the Secretary of Defense to the Senate, which \ntalked about the need for transferability--and I am not sure at that \ntime whether he was referring to the existing law or a new law--he \nsaid: ``Transferability supports military families, thereby enhancing \nretention.''\n  There it is. We are meeting the Secretary of Defense's letter to the \nSenate expressing the need for this transferability.\n  In my career, winding up 30 years in the Senate, I can't think of a \npiece of legislation in which I have had a greater emotional \ninvolvement. I am so pleased to share it with my good friend, the \njunior Senator from Virginia, and my friend from Nebraska. As I said \nwhen we first began to debate this bill, with a deep sense of humility, \nit is highly unlikely I would have ever achieved the opportunity to \ncome to the Senate had it not been for the GI bill given to me by the \nUnited States in return for modest service in the last year of World \nWar II and then a second period of active duty service during the \nKorean War, this time in the Marine Corps. I feel it so strongly in my \nheart. I don't know of any time I have felt more strongly the need to \ndo something than this today.\n  Through the years, I have been to Iraq many times, Afghanistan. \nThroughout the intervening period, I visited military bases and spent \nas much time as I could with the men and women of the Armed Forces \ntoday. Each of us does the same thing, works with our military. On \nMonday, I was privileged to go into the State that Senator Webb and I \nare privileged to represent. We worked together to get funding in years \npast--and he is supporting it today--to build a new armory for the \nNational Guard in Virginia, a famous regiment that fought in World War \nI and World War II. Members of that regiment were the first to go in on \nD-Day. They fought subsequently. I felt at that time that we are doing \nthe right thing with this bill, taking care of those future guardsmen \nand reservists and active-duty individuals. This is the right thing for \nthe Senate to do.\n  I understand there are honest differences of viewpoints and \napproaches. That is true with all legislation. Other colleagues have \nput in a different bill. It had a section on transferability. In some \nways, it tracked what is existing law but not in the way we are doing \nthis. This amendment, this bill, if amended, will bring forward \nexisting law, incorporate it into the underlying amendment sponsored by \nSenator Webb and ourselves, and that will become, hopefully, at some \npoint in time the new law that will govern future benefits of our GIs \nand sailors, airmen and marines. We file it today because I do not know \nexactly how this supplemental will go through. I don't know if there \nwill be a window of opportunity put on it. If there is, we will \nexercise that opportunity. But if it is not, we are going to, as a \nteam, bring it to the attention of the Armed Services Committee in the \ncontext of the annual authorization bill, which I presume will be done \njust before the Fourth of July recess.\n  We will affix to it that bill so it will eventually be amending the \nunderlying bill, which I hope becomes law very soon as a component of \nthe supplemental process now being undertaken by the Senate and the \nHouse.\n  Again, I salute my colleague from Virginia and my colleague from \nNebraska. We have been here together. We have shared many opportunities \nto do something such as this together but none as important as this \none.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Webb, Senator Warner, and \nSenator Hagel for their leadership on this extremely critical issue of \nproviding education benefits to our veterans. I am a cosponsor of their \nlegislation and was happy to include it in the emergency supplemental \nlegislation, approved by the committee last week and now pending before \nthe Senate.\n  On another subject, for purposes of compliance with Senate rule XLIV, \nI certify that the information required by Senate rule XLIV related to \ncongressionally directed spending has been identified in the committee \nexplanatory statement filed on May 19, 2008, and that the required \ninformation has been available on a publicly accessible congressional \nWeb site in a searchable format at least 48 hours before a vote on the \npending bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my longtime friend and Member of \nthis institution, Senator Byrd, for endorsing this bill and becoming a \ncosponsor. I also thank the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, who \nworked on this legislation and seeing that it was put into the \nsupplemental.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Senator Ted Kennedy\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not wish to use much of the \nSenate's time--just a few moments--but I came to the floor to say some \nwords to my good friend, Senator Kennedy, and his family.\n  We heard the early news, and then we heard the late news, in which \nyou have been described as being a little bit more ill than we thought. \nI wish to say to you and your family, as a fellow Senator from the \nother side of the aisle: I wish for you the best and hope the Good Lord \nintends for you to get well so you can come back and accomplish some \nmore things and so you and I can have some more arguments and so you \nand I can have red faces when you argue and I argue and my wife calls \nup and says: You both are arguing so much that your faces are so red \nnobody will listen to you.\n  That happened once, and I did communicate to Senator Kennedy that my \nwife had told me I was getting too red in the face because I was \nyelling. I asked her: What about Senator Kennedy? And she said: Well, \nthat is not your business, but he is yelling too much too. So I told \nhim that, and he had a big laugh.\n  I wish to say to him that this great big bill we are working on--\nparity for the mentally ill by the insurance companies of America; \nabout a 6-year project of his and mine--the House sent us back the bill \ntoday, Senator Kennedy, believe it or not. After all these days we have \nbeen wishing we could get something, they sent us that bill today. They \ndid not send us exactly our bill, so who knows how much longer we will \nhave to work at it. But this one, big bipartisan bill you started \nhelping me with when I was in the majority, we have not got it there \nyet, but we will. It has been a pleasure working with you on that and \nmany other things.\n  But most of all, I came to the floor knowing it is not easy to get a \nhold of you, and I do not intend to try to bother anybody, but at least \nin the Senate, we are free to speak, so I am speaking how I feel: that \nI hope you get well, and I hope the Dear Lord blesses you and your \nwonderful wife, whom I have known, not as well as I know you, but what \na nice lady she is. On behalf of Nancy and myself, we say to her, we \nhope everything goes the very best it can. You are in the best of \ncare--and that is what you should have--and we hope you get well.\n  Thank you. I thank the Senate for the few moments yielded to me.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, midday today during our Democratic \nCaucus, when we learned our colleague Senator Kennedy is now facing \nsome very serious health problems, it is an understatement to say we \nwere all shocked by that news and saddened by it.\n  Senator Kennedy has for decades been a major presence in this Senate \nChamber. He is a friend, a colleague, and all of us have said prayers \ntoday for his recovery.\n\n[[Page S4468]]\n\n  Senator Kennedy has faced much adversity in his life, but he has also \ncontributed so much to this country. I know he will meet this challenge \nwith the same strength and the same grace he has met other challenges. \nIt is my purpose today to say it is my prayerful hope, and I know the \nprayerful hope of all Members of this Chamber, that in the row behind \nme and four desks to my left we will once again at some point in the \nfuture see Senator Kennedy among us to continue his service to his \ncountry.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with our colleague for a full recovery.\n  Madam President, I wish to visit for a few moments on the piece of \nlegislation in front of us which includes the GI bill. We have had a GI \nbill in this country for many decades. There is a new GI bill in the \nunderlying legislation that is brought to the floor of the Senate. I am \nso proud to be a cosponsor of it and to be a part of what so many in \nthis Chamber have put together. The GI bill is such an important part \nof what this country does and says to those who serve this country.\n  This weekend I traveled, and at an airport in Minneapolis there was a \nfamily--a man, a woman, and three children; three very young children--\ngetting on the same plane I was boarding. They were from North Dakota \nbut they lived on a military base in Georgia. The wife came up to me \nand said hello. She said: My husband has done three deployments in \nIraq. I hope--I so hope--that you can find a way to end this war.\n  This is a woman who has watched her husband leave for Iraq three \ntimes; a woman who is taking care of her three young children while her \nhusband is deployed three times to the country of Iraq. I visited with \nher husband and her children, and I know that family is proud to serve \ntheir country. I know the entire family is proud of that soldier's \nservice. But I also know the costs of that service, because you could \nsee it in the eyes of that soldier's spouse.\n  Also on Saturday morning I went to an event in one of our cities. It \nwas a homecoming event for 35 soldiers who had just come back from \ndeployment in Afghanistan. These were National Guard soldiers. They too \nwere so proud to have served their country, and some of them had been \ndeployed twice; two deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan. One or two had \nbeen on their third deployment. Their families were there and all of \nthem were enormously relieved and pleased to have their loved ones \nhome.\n  I was thinking about those events: meeting a family at an airport, a \nsoldier who is stationed in Georgia but who is a North Dakota native, \nand visiting with the family members at the National Guard event and \nsaying thank you to them from a grateful nation.\n  I was thinking about a day much earlier when I was asked to present \nmedals earned by an American Indian who served in the Second World War \nbut had never received his medals. His name was Edmund Young Eagle. He \nwas a Standing Rock Sioux Indian. He was someone who enlisted in the \nArmy in the Second World War and went to war. He served in northern \nAfrica, Normandy, and across Europe. He served with great distinction \nas an American soldier in some very difficult fighting.\n  He then came back to the Indian reservation and lived kind of a tough \nlife. He never had very much. He never married. He never had very much \nin his life, but he lived a good life nonetheless. At the end of his \nlife, he was in the veterans home and then got sick and was put in the \nveterans hospital in Fargo, ND. His sister contacted my office and \nasked if her brother could receive the medals he had earned during the \nSecond World War but had never received. We said of course. On a Sunday \nmorning in Fargo, ND, I went to the veterans hospital with the medals \nfor Edmund Young Eagle. The doctors and the nurses and others from the \nhospital crowded into his hospital room that Sunday morning. Edmund was \nsick with lung cancer. I didn't know it at the time, but he didn't have \nmany days left. He died about a week later of lung cancer. But on that \nmorning he was fully aware of what was happening, and I was there \ngranting the wish of his sister to get the medals from the Department \nof Defense that Edmund Young Eagle had earned in the Second World War. \nWe cranked his hospital bed up to a seated position and then I pinned a \nrow of medals on Edmund Young Eagle's pajama top there at the veterans \nhospital and told him: Thank you from a grateful nation for serving \nthis country in the Second World War. This very sick man looked up at \nme and said: This is one of the proudest days of my life. He died about \na week later. But he served his country and was enormously proud of it.\n\n  There are so many circumstances around this country where one by one \nor in groups we honor our soldiers because they put on America's \nuniform. This morning, soldiers halfway around the world not only put \non a uniform, but put on body armor and went out in harm's way, some to \nbe shot at. They didn't ask why; they just did what their country asked \nthem to do.\n  Now the question is: When it is all over, when they come home and \ntheir service is done, what will their country say then? What will \ntheir country say to them, other than thank you?\n  What we said in the Second World War with a GI bill was when those \nsoldiers came home, we offered them an opportunity to go to college, to \nhelp them to be able to purchase a home. So a substantial number of \nreturning soldiers went to college and got a college degree. They went \nback home and married their sweetheart. They built a home. They built a \ncommunity. They built their churches. They expanded the middle class. \nThey created an economic boom in this country. Later, it was estimated \nthat for every dollar we spent on the GI bill, $7 was returned because \nit was an unbelievably good investment for our country.\n  Senator Webb, Senator Warner, Senator Hagel, Senator Murray, and so \nmany others--myself included--as cosponsors of this bill have said it \nis time again to write a GI bill that is appropriate for wartime and \nfor returning veterans. When soldiers return and become veterans, the \nquestion is: What will the GI bill offer for them? How will we invest \nin their lives, and thereby invest in this country?\n  The previous GI bill was the Montgomery bill written during \npeacetime. Frankly, it does not do what we have historically been able \nto do and willing to do for those who serve our country, in addition to \nsaying thank you. The Montgomery bill existed--and we are pleased it \ndid--but this new GI bill is something very different. It tries to say \nto soldiers, as we did some 60 years ago, not only thank you, but we \nwant to invest in your lives and invest thereby in this country. It is \na new GI bill. It allows an opportunity to go to college and to be able \nto pay the in-State cost of college with a stipend for living during \nthat period of time that you get your college degree. It invests in the \nlives of those who have invested their lives in this country. This is a \nvery important piece of legislation.\n  I am told there are some who now come to the floor of the Senate, \nnearing three-quarters of a trillion dollars having been spent on \nemergency supplemental appropriations bills requested by President Bush \nto prosecute the war in Iraq and in Afghanistan, and say: Well, we can \nafford that and we have to do that on an emergency basis, but we don't \nhave the money to try to help veterans when they come home. A veterans \nprogram is the cost of war.\n  It is the cost of war. How does anyone say that somehow the three-\nquarters of a trillion dollars for so many hundreds and thousands of \ndifferent accounts and contractors and replenishment of various \naccounts is more important than the single account of the GI bill, \nwhich says we want to invest in our soldiers? How does anybody say \nthose myriad other accounts are more important than investing in our \nsoldiers when they become veterans? I don't understand that. It makes \nno sense.\n  It is a significant claim and priority for this country to understand \nthat part of the cost of war is to provide health care that is promised \nto veterans and a GI bill this country can be proud of, which invests \nin those veterans and our country. That is what this bill is about. \nThis new GI bill is every bit as important--perhaps more important--\nthan any other provision that exists in this large emergency \nsupplemental requested by this President.\n  The Congress undoubtedly, at some point, in some way, will enact this \nlegislation providing for some supplemental appropriations. When it \ndoes, in\n\n[[Page S4469]]\n\nmy judgment, it must do more than just say thank you to veterans, as we \ndo, but it must invest in veterans, which this new GI bill will do. \nThis makes a lot of sense for our country.\n  I commend especially those I have mentioned previously, including \nSenators Webb, Warner, Hagel, Murray, and so many others. I am proud to \nbe one among them to say that this too is a priority for this country. \nI hope when the sun sets at the end of this week, if we have passed \nthis legislation called the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, \nit will include something that ought to give all of us a reason to be \nproud and that it will include a new GI bill to say to veterans in this \ncountry: You matter. It matters to us what you did for our country. I \nhope we manifest that by passing a new GI bill in the name of their \nservice.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I know we are on the emergency \nsupplemental bill. However, I want to talk a bit about the energy \nissue, so I will begin on that. I want to make a couple of points.\n  First, we sent a bill that the President signed, I believe, this \nmorning, which I offered here along with my colleague Senator Reid in \nthe Senate last week. We passed it on Thursday. It said stop putting \noil underground when oil prices are bouncing around at $128 a barrel or \nso. We told the Department of Energy stop putting 70,000 barrels a day \nunderground. We have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve--which makes sense \nto me because if you run into trouble, you will have oil you have put \naway. But we have put that oil away, and it is now 97 percent full. Yet \nthe DOE and the Bush administration are topping it off by putting \n70,000 barrels a day every day underground.\n  Our legislation says stop that. When oil is going through the roof \nand the price of gasoline is so high, stop putting it underground. It \nmakes no sense. You are putting upward pressure on prices, which is the \nlast thing we should do.\n  I am pleased the President signed the bill today. Some have said it \nwon't make any difference, that there are factors other than the 70,000 \nbarrels going underground that are at play here, and I will talk about \nthem. But it certainly doesn't hurt to put additional oil, and \ntherefore gasoline, into the supply pipeline. That ought to bring \nprices down. It is common sense.\n  I used to teach a little economics and the supply/demand curve hasn't \nchanged. If demand remains unchanged and supply is increased, prices \nare going to be lower. So I never understood why they decided when the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve is 97 percent full, why they are taking \nsweet light crude from the Gulf of Mexico and sticking it underground \nfor a rainy day. It is raining at the gas pumps these days. Stop that \nand put it into the supply chain and put downward pressure on oil and \ngas prices.\n  I am pleased that we finally did it last week. The House passed the \nbill. We got it to the President and he signed it. That is one step in \nthe right direction. A big step, giant step? Probably not, but it is a \nstep in the right direction in dealing with the question of the price \nof gasoline.\n  Now, there is something curious going on in this country. It is not \nexplainable, frankly. This chart says oil prices nearly doubled in 1 \nyear--up, up, up, and up. They doubled in 1 year. What would cause \nthat? Well, here is speculators' activity in the oil futures market. It \nlooks like oil prices, doesn't it? It also goes up, up, and up. There \nis more and more speculation in the oil futures market. These are not \npeople who want to buy oil--oh, no. They want to buy a contract. They \ndon't ever want to take delivery or get their hands dirty with oil; \nthey want to speculate and gamble in the oil futures market. They want \nto buy what they will never get from people who never had it, and walk \naway grinning and deposit their money in the bank--big profits, by the \nway. It doesn't matter what the consequences are. The wreckage can lie \nin the gas pump lines, on the family farms, and elsewhere, because they \npush up prices with this speculation. As you can see on the chart, the \nspeculation looks exactly like the runup in the prices.\n  The senior vice president of ExxonMobil Oil, on April 1, last month, \nsaid:\n       The price of oil should be about $50 or $55 per barrel.\n\n  But it is not. It is $128 a barrel, $129 a barrel today, and is \nheaded north. So an oil company senior vice president said it ought to \nbe $50 or $55 a barrel.\n  Clarence Cazalot, CEO, Marathon Oil, said:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market.\n\n  He is president of an oil company.\n  In January, the Newark Star Ledger said:\n\n       Experts, including the former head of ExxonMobil, say \n     financial speculation in the energy markets has grown so much \n     over the last 30 years that it now adds 20 to 30 percent, or \n     more, to the price of a barrel of oil.\n\n  Fadel Gheit, 30 years with Oppenheimer Company, senior energy trader, \nsaid this:\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil. I am absolutely \n     convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a \n     barrel. I call it the world's largest gambling hall. It's \n     open 24/7. Unfortunately, it is totally unregulated. This is \n     like a highway with no cops and no speed limits, and \n     everybody is going 120 miles an hour.\n\n  Andrew Hall--I don't know him. I have said I would not know him from \na cord of wood. All I know is that the Wall Street Journal reports this \ntrader hit the jackpot on oil as the commodity boom roars on. When they \nsay commodity boom, they are not talking about oil wells, or drilling \nrigs, or oil tanks; they are talking about the commodities market. \nAgain, it is a market in which speculators abound--an orgy of \nspeculation, with people buying things they will never get from people \nwho never had it, nobody wanting the oil, but wanting to speculate in \nthis class called speculators. Mr. Hall earned a quarter of a billion \ndollars--$250 million--in 5 years. That is a pretty big payout, \nactually.\n  All of these folks who are neck deep in futures markets include hedge \nfunds, investment banks, unbelievable speculation in the futures \nmarket, which is driving up the price of gasoline and the price of oil.\n  Now, it is interesting to me, and I think important for us to \nunderstand, that as the price is going up, and it is going up again \ntoday, that more pressure will push prices higher. In this country, \npeople will drive to the pumps tonight and try to figure out, how do I \npay for this tank of gas? I need it and I have to drive to work. Or as \nthe farmer tries to figure out, how do I fill that farm gas tank and \npay for that? Or a small family trucking company tries to figure out \nhow do I make ends meet, or will I have to close the doors, perhaps, \nlike one of the CEOs of the five airlines that have filed bankruptcy at \nthis point because of fuel prices?\n  As all of this is happening, let me make a couple of points. One, we \nhave more oil in our inventory and more fuel in our inventory right now \nthan we did in January of this year. We are somewhere over 30 million \nto 40 million barrels of oil in inventory above where we were in \nJanuary. So go figure. Inventory is up. Shouldn't prices come down a \nbit? You would think so. Not only is inventory up but demand is also \ndown because our economy slowed down some, and because the price of \ngasoline and fuel is very high, people are driving a bit less. Some \nestimate that demand has dipped around 4 or 5 percent. So our \ninventories are up, demand is down, and what is happening to oil \nprices? They are continuing to go up.\n  Refiners are actually refining less at the moment, by their own \ndesign, because they believe there is an excess of inventory, so they \nwant to catch up a bit, or allow the inventory to catch up with demand. \nSo they are refining less than they previously refined. You would \nthink, then, if supply is up, with millions more barrels of oil in \ninventory, the supply of gasoline having increased sufficiently so that \nrefiners are cutting back refining capability, that the price of \ngasoline and oil would begin to come down. But it is not true. What is \nhappening today is it is reaching record highs. So what does that tell\n\n[[Page S4470]]\n\nus? It tells us there is this unbelievable amount of speculation in \nwhich speculators have taken over the commodity markets and driven oil \nprices to levels that are doing great damage to this economy, great \ndamage to this country, great damage to America's families, and great \ndamage to businesses in this country. They don't care much about that. \nAll they care about is going to the bank with a pile of money. All they \ncare about is making all this money.\n  I am telling you, at the top, take a look at the compensation of the \ntop hedge fund managers in this country. It is unbelievable. It almost \nmakes you ill. They are all making a lot of money, and they are doing \nit by speculating in a market that is driving up prices beyond where \nthe fundamentals of oil and gas supply and demand would justify. There \nis no justification for this at all.\n  American families have a right to ask the question of this Congress: \nWhat on Earth are you going to do about it? Does anybody care? Or are \nthe consumers just pawns in this big game while the speculators run off \nwith all the money?\n  It seems to me, when markets don't work we have a responsibility to \ndo something about it. If you have a computer handy, you can find a \nsearch engine and find excesses of speculation. In fact, over the last \ndecade and a half, we have seen two bubbles already, and now a third. \nWe saw the tech bubble, and it burst. We saw the housing bubble, and it \nburst. Now we see a bubble on the commodities exchanges, and it will \nburst at some point. The question is when and what damage will be done \nbetween now and then.\n  These exchanges are supposed to be regulating certain kinds of \nactivities. I have a little experience in this--not a lot, but a \nlittle. I chaired the hearings in the Senate on Enron. We did it in a \nCommerce subcommittee. I had Ken Lay come in front of me in my \ncommittee. He raised his hand and swore an oath to tell the truth, sat \ndown, and took the fifth amendment. We had Jeffrey Skilling come. He is \nnow in prison. He wouldn't stop talking, by the way. Through it all, \nthe suggestion was, there is nothing going on here.\n  There was this unbelievable runup of wholesale electricity prices on \nthe west coast during that period. We now know it was criminal \nactivity, a criminal enterprise. We now know they were fixing things. \nThey were shutting down plants. They were manipulating supply. They \nwere speculating.\n  I am not suggesting speculation is necessarily, or even in most \ncases, criminal behavior. It is not. But the combination, going back to \nEnron, of not being able to see the dark money, the money that moves in \nthe shadows behind the regulatory opportunities that some agencies \nhave, means consumers can be manipulated and injured dramatically.\n  There is a lesson, it seems to me, as we take a look at what is \nhappening in energy. I remember when President Bush came to town. He \nappointed a new Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. I \nbelieve his name was Harvey Pitt. He said when he took office there is \ngoing to be a new attitude around here. This was the Securities and \nExchange Commission, a regulatory body.\n  He said: There is going to be a new attitude around here, a business-\nfriendly attitude. And sure enough, it sure was business friendly, and \nnot just there but virtually every agency. We don't want to regulate. \nYes, we are a regulatory body, but we don't want to regulate. Yes, \nregulators are supposed to be the referees, wear the striped shirts, \ncall the fouls; we don't want to do that. We don't even like Government \nvery much. We just come here and say it is business friendly, so do \nwhat you want.\n  Over the past 7 years we have seen an unbelievable amount of avarice \nand greed and speculation. Is it any wonder that we saw the bubble \nburst with respect to housing? Who wasn't minding the store? We know \nwhat happened then.\n  We had ads on television from these mortgage companies. Anybody who \nwatched one of them would have known this doesn't work.\n  The ads said: Hey, you have been bankrupt, you can't pay your bills? \nAre you missing your house payments? Come over here. We will give you a \nnew mortgage. You don't have to worry about all that. You have bad \ncredit? Come to us. We will give you credit. In fact, we will give you \na mortgage where you don't even have to pay all the interest. In fact, \nwe will give you a mortgage loan where you don't have to pay any \ninterest the first year; we will pay the interest for you, and the \nprincipal. We will say to you: You don't even have to document your \nincome to us. You have to pay a slightly higher interest rate, but you \nget a mortgage with us, and you don't even have to document your \nincome. It is called a no doc loan.\n  So, no documents, no interest payment for the first year and no \nprincipal payment for a long while. And by the way, when we set your \ninterest rate, you pay an incredibly low interest rate.\n  I saw an advertisement that said pay one-fourth of 1 percent interest \nrate--not telling them, of course, it is going to reset at 10 percent \nin 3 years. They don't have a ghost of a chance of making those \npayments, and they are going to lose their house. We are sorry. They \nnever tell them that.\n  Where were the regulators? Were they watching? No, they weren't \nwatching. They didn't care.\n  So you have this buildup of speculation, mortgages, housing, and now \nthe entire economy pays a price for that.\n  On top of that, we have this unbelievable buildup of speculation in \nthe commodities market and oil, which is an essential commodity for \nevery part of this economy, and the cost is going through the roof. \nToday it is setting a record.\n  Think of this economy and the national result. Does it matter that \noil is different? Sure does. We suck 85 million barrels of oil out of \nthis world every single day. We take 85 million barrels and suck it out \nof this planet. We need to use one-fourth of it in this country. We use \n25 percent of all oil pulled out of this planet every day, and we only \nproduce 10 percent. We use 25 percent of the world's oil, and we \nproduce only 10 percent. That means we have to get a lot of it from \nelsewhere, and we do. Mr. President, 60 percent plus comes from \noffshore, much of it from troubled parts of the world.\n  We have a major issue with respect to oil. We have to deal with it. \nIn the short term, though, we have to deal with this. John Maynard \nKeynes said in the long run, we are all dead. In the short run, we \ndrive to the gas pumps and say: How can we possibly afford this? How \ncan we pay this price? Then we understand this price isn't even \njustified. There is nothing in supply and demand that justifies this \nprice. The supply is up, demand is down, and the price of oil is going \nthrough the roof. That is not about market system. Those are arteries \nclogged in the free market system, and this Congress has a \nresponsibility to do something about it.\n  What do we do? There are a number of approaches a group of us are \nworking on. It includes trying to find ways to make certain we know \nwhat is happening on all of these exchanges. The folks who run the \nexchanges in this country say: The problem is, if you increase the \nmargin requirement, all this stuff is going to go to the \nIntercontinental Exchange, called ICE, over in London. You can't do \nthat; it goes offshore and you never see it.\n  That is another part of the dark money strategy in this country where \nthey all make money and injure this economy. We are looking for ways, \nand I believe we will find a way in a couple of days, to get our arms \naround this issue called regulatory need with respect to excess \nspeculation on all markets. This is damaging this country's economy, \nand we cannot and should not stand for it. Speculators have had their \nday. They have made their money. They have injured this country. Now it \nis time for us to wring that speculation out of those commodity \nmarkets.\n  We need commodity exchanges. We need futures markets. We need them \nfor liquidity. We need them for hedging. But when we have speculators \ngrab these markets by the neck and pervert them, this Congress has a \nresponsibility to act.\n  I conclude by saying the price of oil is setting new records today \ndespite the fact that we in this country have an increased supply of \noil since January, month after month after month, and demand is going \ndown by the consumer because of price. So supply is up,\n\n[[Page S4471]]\n\ndemand is down, and this perversion in the marketplace is producing the \nhighest price for oil we have seen. That is an unbelievable perversion \nof what the free market ought to be.\n  We hear people say free market. There is no free market here. You \nhave an OPEC cartel sitting behind closed doors. It would be illegal in \nthis country. That does not contribute to a free market. That is a \nfixed market. And we have oil companies bigger and stronger. They \nalmost all have two names now--ExxonMobile, ConocoPhillips--because \nthey all merged and everybody thought that was fine, at least in this \nadministration. So they are bigger and stronger and have more muscle in \nthe marketplace. Then we have this perversion in the futures market.\n  That combination is a combination that I say damages this economy. We \nmean to address it. In the coming days, I intend to talk about \nlegislation that will tie into this speculation, wring it out of the \nmarkets and say: You can't continue to damage the economy of this \ncountry; you can't continue to injure the consumers in this country \nbecause we are not going to stand for it.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I am delighted to be an original \ncosponsor of the amendment offered by the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Virginia which would clarify that the provisions in current law \nregarding the transferability of educational assistance benefits to \nfamily members would apply to the new GI bill for the 21st century.\n  This amendment would further give the Department of Defense the \nability to conduct a 2-year test of somewhat expanded transferability \noptions to individuals who have completed 4 years of active duty \nservice, who agree to complete an additional 6r years of service, and \nwho meet such additional criteria as the Secretary of Defense \nestablishes.\n  I have consistently stated that I believe that transferability can be \nan important retention tool for the military and that the provisions of \ncurrent law would apply to the provisions in S. 22 as revised. However, \nI have also noted that there is no data that demonstrate the retention \nvalue of the transferability option.\n  The Army implemented a pilot program in July 2006 which allows \nsoldiers who reenlist in critical skills to transfer their Montgomery \nGI bill benefits to their spouses. Mr. President, I will ask unanimous \nconsent that the Department of Defense annual report on entitlement \ntransfers, dated March 20, 2008, be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks so that Members can see that less than two \npercent of those who were offered the opportunity to transfer benefits \ntook advantage of that option.\n  It is on this basis that I believe that this authority needs to be \ncontinued and expanded slightly in the context of this new GI bill for \nthe 21st century. But to rely on transferability solely or in lieu of \nthe legislation that has been carefully developed by Senator Webb and \nothers would be a mistake.\n  I urge the Senate to approve the amendment offered by Senator Warner.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Office of the\n\n\n                                   Under Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 2008.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Chairman, Committee on Veterans Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter serves as the annual report \n     on entitlement transfers of basic educational assistance to \n     eligible dependents under the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) as \n     required by Section 3020(1) of title 38, United States Code.\n       The Army implemented a pilot program in July 2006, allowing \n     Soldiers, who reenlist in critical skills, the ability to \n     transfer MGIB benefits to their spouse. The Army defined \n     critical skills as any Soldier who qualified for a Selective \n     Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) incentive and was entitled to a Zone \n     B or Zone C bonus under current messages at the time of their \n     reenlistment. This SRB is reduced by an amount equal to the \n     actuarial per capita cost. These payments were then deposited \n     into the DoD Education Benefit Fund for transfer to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       In Fiscal Year 2007, 296 Soldiers chose this option, or \n     less than 2 percent of the over 17K Soldiers eligible upon \n     reenlistment. Of the 296 Soldiers, the majority were mid-\n     career Soldiers (SGT/SSG) assigned to U.S. Forces Command and \n     U.S. Special Operations Command. Initial feedback from the \n     field indicates that Soldiers want to be able to transfer \n     benefits to all their dependents, including children. The \n     Army extended the program to allow eligibility for both \n     spouses and children in November 2007.\n       None of the other Services exercised their MGIB \n     transferability authority and, instead, relied on traditional \n     reenlistment/retention incentives. In spite of the fact that \n     this program was not offered by those Services, each \n     experienced a successful retention year in Fiscal Year 2007. \n     However, all the Services are closely watching the results of \n     the Army pilot and continue to retain the authority to \n     include MGIB transferability in their retention programs \n     should circumstances warrant.\n       The Department plans to include the expansion of MGIB \n     transferability in its Fiscal Year 2009 legislative proposal. \n     This expansion will support the President's State of the \n     Union address, where he called for Congress to join him in \n     ``allowing our troops to transfer their unused education \n     benefits to their spouses or children.''\n       I trust that this report will prove useful in your \n     consideration of Defense personnel programs.

Madam President, I concur with a lot of what my \ncolleague from North Dakota said, and I applaud his leadership on this \nwhole issue of outrageously high energy prices.\n  A few weeks ago, I sent an e-mail out to constituents in the State of \nVermont, and essentially I said: Please write back to me and tell me \nwhat these outrageously high gas prices and oil prices mean to you. How \nare they impacting your lives?\n  From our very small State of 630,000 people, we received, as of this \ndate, some 900 responses. Nine hundred families wrote to me to tell me \nthe impact these extraordinarily high gas and oil prices are having in \nVermont.\n  As you know, Vermont is doubly hit by these high prices because we \nare a rural State and people have to travel long distances to get to \nwork, to get to the doctor, to get to the grocery store, and with the \nweather sometimes at 30 below zero, people spend a lot of money heating \ntheir homes. Madam President, $4-plus a gallon for home heating oil has \na huge impact on their lives.\n  What I would like to do in the time I have is simply read some of the \ne-mails I have recently received from Vermont. Let me be very clear in \nsaying that while the e-mails came from Vermont, these e-mails speak \nfor millions of people throughout this country, perhaps especially in \nrural areas. It is just amazing that at a time when poverty is \nincreasing and the middle class is collapsing these high gas and oil \nprices have just taken many people over the edge. We are hearing what \ntheir stories are about.\n  As I have said on many occasions, I think we in the Congress are far \ntoo separated and isolated from the reality of American life. We are \nsurrounded by a ring of well-paid lobbyists representing large, \npowerful multinational corporations, and the voices of the people do \nnot ring out as clearly as they should in the Senate. Today I want to \nallow some of those voices to be heard.\n  Let me start off with somebody from the southwestern part of the \nState of Vermont. This is what this person writes:\n\n       I retired to this community on a fixed income, and now the \n     price of gas almost prohibits me from having any enjoyment. I \n     have to factor in the price of gas for everything I do. Most \n     of my medical appointments are at least 50 miles round-trip, \n     and the cost of gas is absolutely prohibitive. I do not know \n     how\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\n     working people who earn less than $10 an hour are able to \n     afford the gas. Something has to happen as this is a crisis \n     not only in Vermont, but throughout the country.\n\n  Here you see a story of somebody being impacted because they have to \ngo to a doctor a considerable distance away.\n  While we are on that subject, let me read an e-mail that came into \nBurlington, where our major medical center is. This story is \ninteresting. Again, it tells you one of the side impacts of these \noutrageously high gas prices--what gas prices are doing. This is from \nBurlington, VT:\n\n       My story involves my capacity as an oncology social worker \n     working with cancer patients in an outpatient clinic. I also \n     run an emergency fund for the cancer support program, which \n     provides funds for cancer patients in need during their \n     cancer journey, including initial diagnosis, surgery, and \n     treatment period in which they experience a significant \n     decrease in income during a medical leave.\n\n  These are people dealing with cancer. They cannot go to work. Their \nincomes are declining. Then she writes:\n\n       I cannot describe how devastating it has been for these \n     folks who need to travel great distances to get to and from \n     their cancer treatment and followup care with the way gas \n     prices have been. Many of these folks need to travel on a \n     daily basis to radiation therapy for several weeks, while \n     others come from surrounding counties every 1 to 2 weeks for \n     chemotherapy. It has had a tremendous impact on our ability \n     to provide the financial assistance through our emergency \n     fund to all those in need. Someone with cancer who has to get \n     treatment has no choice how many times they need to travel \n     great distances. They have to have reliable transportation \n     and thus need access to gas for their cars or other family \n     members' cars to get to their treatment and followup care. \n     This is becoming increasingly difficult as gas prices \n     continue to rise and our emergency fund cannot meet all of \n     the financial needs of these patients.\n\n  How many people think of that? We all get upset and angry when we pay \n$3.79 or $3.80 for a gallon of gas, but here is a story where this \nprice of gas is impacting the ability in rural States for people to \nactually get the cancer treatment they need.\n  Here is another story that comes from northern Vermont:\n\n       My commute is 630 miles per week. On average, I drive \n     nearly 900 miles per week. My wife also commutes 250 miles \n     per week. Two years ago, we spent between $500 to $600 per \n     month on gas. You don't need an MBA to figure out what we \n     spend a month on gas now. Our mortgage payment is less than \n     the cost of getting to work. How does this hurt all \n     Americans? We spend less on local goods and services. We wait \n     longer to fix problems with our cars. Is this doing further \n     damage to our environment? I need new tires and am scouring \n     the classifieds to find used tires. Is this putting my family \n     at risk? I don't know where this is going to end. How can \n     ExxonMobil possibly make $40 billion in profits alone? I just \n     hope that supposedly smart people in Washington [i.e., us] \n     will use all the tools in their tool boxes to stop this \n     insanity.\n\n  Here is another letter. It comes from northern Vermont again:\n\n       This is my opinion. Here in Vermont you know we face \n     challenges to heat our homes and commute to our workplaces. I \n     live in the town of Morrisville, and I travel 78 miles to \n     work round trip each day. My car gets 30 miles per gallon, \n     therefore I spend roughly $10 a day just to commute to and \n     from work. With that in mind, it costs me $2,600 per year to \n     just get a paycheck. My wages have nowhere kept up with the \n     rising cost of gasoline, much less adjust for the rise in \n     heating fuel, food prices, increases in incidental \n     necessities such as tires, oil changes, et cetera.\n\n  Once again, it is the working person and the burden that high gas \nprices are having on the ability of that person to get to work.\n  Here is another story. This is also from northern Vermont:\n\n       I am a working mother of two young children. I currently \n     pay, on average, about $80 a week for gas so that I can go to \n     work. I see the effects of the gas increases at the grocery \n     stores and at the department stores. On average, I spend \n     around $250 per week at the grocery store, and trust me when \n     I say I don't buy prime rib. I buy just enough to get us \n     through the week, and I can't afford to make sure we have \n     seven wholesome meals to eat every night of the week. Some \n     nights we eat cereal and toast for dinner because that's all \n     I have. My family has had to cancel our annual trip to the \n     zoo, and we make less trips to see our families in another \n     town due to the increase of the price of gas. The price of \n     gas has created a hardship for most average Americans. We \n     have less money to pay the living expenses which have also \n     increased.\n       It seems as if it is just a rippling effect. I am really \n     scared for what the future holds for me and my kids because I \n     just simply cannot afford to live from day to day and I am \n     getting further and further in credit card debt just trying \n     to stay afloat.\n\n  Another letter:\n\n       I am a single mother of two daughters. The gas prices are \n     affecting my life tremendously. I have a full-time job in \n     Burlington but live in Richmond and it is getting so that I \n     cannot afford my bills such as electricity and phone so that \n     I can afford to drive to work every day. I live off from what \n     I make at work and I get some food stamps to help out. \n     Welfare does not consider gas as an expense, even though you \n     need it to get to work. Right now I am 2 weeks behind in my \n     rent and pinching my pennies as far as they will go just to \n     live a low-class lifestyle.\n\n  Another story:\n\n       Personally, my 90-year-old father in Connecticut has \n     recently become ill and asked me to visit him. I want to drop \n     everything I am doing and go visit him. However, I am finding \n     it hard to save enough money to add to the extra gas I'll \n     need to get there.\n\n  Here is someone whose 90-year-old father is ill and doesn't know how \nhe is going to be able to afford to fill up the gas tank to get there.\n\n       I am self-employed with my own commercial cleaning service \n     and money is tight, not only with gas prices but everything. \n     I make more than I did a year ago, and I don't have enough to \n     pay my property taxes this quarter for the first time in many \n     years. They are due tomorrow.\n\n  Madam President, on and on it goes. As I said, we have had about 900 \nof these e-mails from the State of Vermont. We also get e-mails from \naround the country. If anybody is interested in reading these e-mails, \nthey can do it at my Web site: sanders.senate.gov.\n  That is the reality. We have the middle class which for many years \nhas been shrinking. Since Bush has been President, 5 million more \nAmericans have slipped into poverty; 8 million Americans have lost \ntheir health insurance; 3 million Americans have lost their pensions. \nThat is what is going on for ordinary people.\n  But--and we don't discuss this too often--the people on top have \nnever had it so good. In fact, the top 1 percent is doing better than \nat any time since the 1920s. Senator Dorgan a moment ago proposed some \nideas with which I concur, in terms of how we have to address this oil \nand gas crisis. I think we made some progress several weeks ago by \npassing legislation which would stop the bringing more oil into the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. That is a small step forward but an \nimportant step forward.\n  Right now I know we have dealt with, and the House is dealing with, \nthe issue of OPEC, how to deal with a cartel whose function in life is \nto limit production and artificially raise prices. Clearly, long-term, \nstarting yesterday, we have to move this country away from fossil fuel \nand our dependence on foreign oil; move us to energy efficiency and \nsustainable energy. There is unbelievable and huge potential to do \nthat. We have made some small starts, but we have a long way to go in \nenergy efficiency and in adequately funding solar energy, wind energy, \ngeothermal energy, biomass, and other forms of sustainable energy. The \npotential there is enormous if we are able to summon the courage to \ntake on the very powerful lobbyists from the fossil fuel and automobile \nindustries and move this country in the direction it should be going.\n  Right now, while we move forward to break our dependency on fossil \nfuel and foreign oil, we cannot forget these folks from Vermont and \naround this country who, today, are in desperation as a result of \ngasoline prices at $3.80 a gallon, prices which will only go higher. \nThere are several other things that, in my view, we need to do.\n\n  For a start, while Americans are paying outrageously high prices at \nthe gas pump, the oil industry, as most Americans understand, is \nenjoying recordbreaking profits. The American people simply find it \nvery hard to understand how it could be that they can no longer afford \nto fill their gas tanks, while ExxonMobil has made more profits than \nany corporation in the history of the world for the past 2 consecutive \nyears. There is no end to the greed.\n  Last year alone, ExxonMobil made $40 billion in profits and rewarded \nits CEO with $21 million in total compensation. A few years ago, \nExxonMobil gave its former CEO a $400 million retirement package.\n  All over America, people cannot afford to heat their homes, working \npeople cannot fill their gas tanks, but ExxonMobil had enough money a \nfew years ago to provide its former CEO a\n\n[[Page S4473]]\n\n$400 million retirement package and provide the current CEO with $21 \nmillion in total compensation.\n  But ExxonMobil is not alone. Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and BP \nhave been also making out like bandits, seeing huge increases in their \nprofits. In fact, the five largest oil companies in this country have \nmade over $600 billion in profits since George W. Bush has been in \noffice. Last year alone, the major oil companies in the United States \nmade over $155 billion in profits. Believe it or not, these profits \ncontinue to soar. There is apparently no end to the profitability of \nthese companies. Recently, ExxonMobil reported a 17-percent increase in \nprofits. Earlier, BP announced a 63-percent increase in profits. On and \non and on it goes, the middle class getting decimated--can't afford to \nheat their homes, can't put gas in their tanks--and oil companies \nmaking outrageous profits.\n  In 2006, Occidental Petroleum--not even one of the very major ones--\ngave its CEO a $400 million compensation package for 1 year's work. \nThey are simply sticking out their tongues, they are spitting on the \nAmerican people, they are saying: We will do anything we want; $400 \nmillion to the CEO in 1 year, and we don't care if you can fill your \ngas tank, we don't care if kids in Vermont are getting sick because \ntheir parents can't afford to adequately heat their home. That is the \nway it goes. We have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to \nCongress. We have lobbyists all over the place. You can't do anything \nabout it. That is what they are telling the American people.\n  I hope that is a wrong assertion. I hope, in fact, that Congress does \nhave the courage to stand up to these oil companies and impose a \nwindfall profits tax. It will not be easy, but that is the fight we \nhave to make.\n  Furthermore, in addition to dealing with the greed of the oil \ncompanies, we must deal with the greed of speculation. The problem with \ndealing with speculation is that by definition, at least as is \ncurrently the case, everything takes place below the radar screen. They \nare not acting transparently, which is at the heart of what the problem \nis.\n  What we do know is, the hedge funds have made huge amounts of money. \nThe top 50 hedge fund managers earned $29 billion in income last year; \n50 managers, $29 billion. That is not too bad.\n  We also know there are a lot of financial institutions investing \nheavily in oil futures and are driving up the price of oil in the \nprocess. Clearly, while it is a complicated issue--it is not an easy \nissue, and we made some progress in the ag bill by doing away with the \nEnron loophole exemption. Clearly, a lot more thought and work has to \ngo into that. But there are some experts who are arguing that literally \n50 percent of the $125-per-barrel cost of oil is a result of \nspeculation and not actually the production of oil.\n  The issue is not just addressing the crisis in high oil and gas \nprices. The issue is whether the American people will have any degree \nof confidence in their elected officials and in the U.S. Government. It \nis no great secret that President Bush is perhaps the most unpopular \nPresident--for good reasons, I should add--of any President in the \nmodern history of the United States. Congress is held in equal \ncontempt. I think the time is now, in the midst of this very serious \neconomic crisis our country faces--which includes the high price of \noil, includes our disintegrating health care system, includes a trade \npolicy which allows companies to throw American workers out on the \nstreet and move to China, and many other issues--if we are to regain \nthe faith of the American people, we had better summon the courage to \ntake on these oil companies, these speculators, these hedge fund \noperators.\n  Now is the time to do that. I certainly hope we will summon the \ncourage to go forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez).

Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to send \nSenator Ted Kennedy and Vicki and all the family my very best wishes. I \nam confident that with the fighting spirit that embodies who Ted \nKennedy is, we will soon see him back here in this Chamber of the \nSenate. Over the years, as I have worked closely with Senator Kennedy \non a number of different measures, I have seen his passion and ethic of \nservice here on the floor. Over the many years I knew about Ted \nKennedy, long before he ever knew who I was, he was one of those people \nwho always inspired me to public service. I remember well his speeches \nfrom the 1960s and into the 1970s. For me as a relative newcomer to the \nSenate, it has been one of those very unique privileges to serve with \nhim on a number of different matters.\n  Part of the reason I know he will be back here working with all of us \nis because we have often talked about some of the difficult challenges \nhe has faced in life. We have talked about the plane crash and how it \nwas that he was pulled from the wreckage. While many did not expect him \nto survive, he did, and he has gone on to provide another 40 years of \nservice to this great Nation and this world. It is that fighting spirit \nthat, again, will take Senator Kennedy in a very positive way forward \nto continue to serve this Nation, the State of Massachusetts, and the \nentire world. That ethic of service in many ways is what guides most of \nus who are here, but certainly it is the roots of Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  We have often talked about his relationship with the United Farm \nWorkers of America. In the prayer which the founder of the United Farm \nWorkers of American, Cesar Chavez, wrote, I find a lot of that prayer \nreflected in Senator Kennedy. I thought I would essentially read a part \nof that prayer. I think it is so true of Senator Kennedy, the Presiding \nOfficer, the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, and so many others \nwho get so much inspiration from this wonderful man, Ted Kennedy.\n  The prayer is as follows, in part:\n\n     Grant me courage to serve others;\n     For in service there is true life.\n     Give me honesty and patience;\n     So that the Spirit will be alive among us.\n     Let the Spirit flourish and grow;\n     So that we will never tire of the struggle.\n     Let us remember those who have died for justice;\n     For they have given us life.\n     Help us love even those who hate us;\n     So we can change the world.\n\n  That was written by Cesar Chavez, born in 1927, passed away in 1993.\n  For Ted Kennedy, the closing part of that prayer, ``so we can change \nthe world,'' I will say this to Senator Kennedy tonight from the floor \nof the Senate: We still have a lot of change to make in the world \ntogether. I look very much forward to the day when we see you back here \namong all of our colleagues, helping us move forward in a new direction \nto achieve that visionary change that had at its focal point the \npossibilities of humanity.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today, on the floor of the \nSenate, we heard distinguished colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nsupporting an effort that we pass a new GI bill of rights for the 21st \ncentury.\n  We heard the distinguished junior Senator from Virginia, Jim Webb, \nwho with his own hand, took it upon himself to author a piece of \nlegislation that would make sure we as a nation\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\nkept our promises to those who have served since 9/11 by providing them \nthe kind of educational opportunity that was provided to those who \nserved in World War II.\n  In that effort, as I presided over this Senate floor, I heard the \nvery eloquent comments of Senator Chuck Hagel, himself a great servant \nof this country and a great Senator, in support of the legislation by \nSenator Webb. During the same time, we heard the comments from Senator \nWarner, one of the most eloquent and distinguished Members to ever \nserve in the Senate.\n  So I come to the floor today to once again say all of the sponsors of \nthat legislation send a loud and unmistakable signal to everyone who \nhas a say in this emergency supplemental that at the end of the day we \nmust make sure this 21st century GI bill of rights is one that is \nincluded in this emergency supplemental that deals with Iraq and \nAfghanistan so that we, in fact, can honor our veterans who have served \nsince 9/11.\n  We can do no less as a nation. We can do no less when we think about \nthe great sacrifice of the now 1.6 million men and women who served in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  When we think about those who have served, we must first stop and pay \ntribute and honor to those who have given their lives as the ultimate \nsacrifice on behalf of their country, as well as those who have been \nwounded and hurt in those wars.\n  In Iraq, the current number I have as of today, 4,078 Americans have \nbeen killed in that war--a war that is now in its sixth year.\n  When the invasion occurred, there were predictions at the top of the \nPentagon that this war would, at most, take 50 American lives. Somehow \nnow we have surpassed the 4,000 number with 4,078 of our bravest men \nand women who have given their lives in Iraq.\n  It does not count the number of others who have been scarred either \nphysically or mentally in that war as well. Those who have been wounded \nwith physical scars, according to the current numbers we have from the \nDepartment of Defense, now exceeds 30,000 of our best.\n  For many of us in the Senate, as we have gone to Walter Reed or to \nother hospitals of the Department of Defense or veterans hospitals, we \nsee the reality of what has happened to many of those who have come \nback without limbs and with other kinds of injuries that will stay with \nthem the rest of their lives.\n  We do not have a firm count with respect to the other 1.6 million who \nhave served there as to how many of them have suffered the mental scars \nof war. We know there are some estimates that it is as high as 20, 25 \npercent of them who will suffer from some form of post-traumatic stress \nsyndrome.\n  So the number we are talking about who have borne the burden of this \nwar in Iraq, as well as the war in Afghanistan, is a number we should \nnever forget. It is not just in Iraq but also in Afghanistan. We now \nhave a casualty list which includes 497 Americans. We have about 2,000 \nwho have been physically wounded and many more who suffer the mental \nscars of war.\n  When I think about what we are trying to do with this 21st century GI \nbill of rights for those who have served since 9/11, the thing I find \nmost objectionable is that some of those on the other side and others \nwho would oppose this legislation say it is too costly, that we ought \nnot to undertake it because it is too costly.\n  In the context of what we have spent in Iraq and will be spending in \nIraq, it is a very small amount of money to make sure we are taking \ncare of our veterans once they return home. In Iraq, the total number, \nas of today, that has been spent on that war is $525 billion--$525 \nbillion. Secretary Rumsfeld, at one point in time, said no way, no how \nwill we ever spend $50 billion on this war. Yet somehow, today, some 6 \nyears later, it is $525 billion plus that has been spent on the war.\n  When you consider the expenditures the United States is projected to \nmake to bring this war to conclusion, some estimates out there are $3 \ntrillion--$3 trillion--what we are trying to do with this 21st century \nGI bill of rights is simply to provide an opportunity for those who \nhave served since 9/11 to get an opportunity for an education at a cost \nthat would be $2.5 billion to $4 billion a year.\n  When we consider the fact we are burning $12 billion a month in Iraq \ntoday, to provide this benefit to our veterans at a cost of $2.5 \nbillion to $4 billion a year is a very worthy investment, and in the \nrelative context of how much is being invested in that war effort, it \nis a very small amount.\n  I would hope at the end of the day it is not only 60 Senators who \nvote yes to include this 21st century GI bill of rights in this \nemergency supplemental, but that we could get a unanimous approval out \nof this Senate that this is the thing we should do because it is the \nright thing to make sure we are taking care of those who have served us \nsince 9/11.\n  Again, I appreciate the great leadership of our good friend, Jim \nWebb, who has worked so hard to bring together so many cosponsors of \nthis legislation both here in the Senate, as well as the House of \nRepresentatives. I urge my colleagues to fully support this legislation \nas it moves forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, economic anxiety is pervasive among the \nmiddle class in my State of Ohio and throughout our great country, and \nthere is good reason for that. The average duration of unemployment--\n17.5 weeks--is longer than at the start of the two previous recessions. \nIn 2001, it took the average unemployed worker about 12.5 weeks to find \nwork. In 1990, it took the average unemployed worker almost 12 weeks to \nfind work. The average duration of unemployment now is about 17.5 \nweeks.\n  In fact, long-term unemployment is higher now than it has been at any \nother time since Congress first extended unemployment benefits, since \n1980. The share of workers suffering long-term unemployment, meaning \nthose who remain jobless after their first 6 months of benefits run \nout--so if their benefits run out after 6 months, that defines long-\nterm unemployment by the Government--the share of those workers is \nnearly 17 percent higher than the 11 percent at the start of the 2001 \nrecession and higher than the 9.8 percent at the start of the 1990 \nrecession.\n  My State of Ohio has not added jobs since the end of the last \nrecession, even while economists and an indecisive President wonder \nwhether the country is entering another one, with all of their \ndefinitions and all of their pondering these questions and all of the \nindifference that comes out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. What I do know \nis that there are 58,000 fewer jobs in Ohio than there were in November \n2001.\n  In the past year around my State, I have attended almost 100 \nroundtables where I have convened meetings of 120, 125 people who sit \naround a table and talk to me about their hopes and dreams, what is \nhappening in their communities, ways I can help, and all of the things \nthat can help me do my job in the Senate. One of the topics that came \nup again and again during these meetings was the topic of economic \ninsecurity. Wages are stagnant, jobs are scarce, and jobs are too often \ntemporary. Sometimes, laid-off workers have seen their lives change. \nInstead of one good-paying job, they are holding two part-time or full-\ntime jobs that pay significantly less than the job they held earlier. \nMiddle-class families are struggling now and deeply worried about the \nfuture.\n  The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee held a hearing \ntoday on plant closings and workers' rights. This summer marks 20 years \nsince Congress passed major plant closing legislation known as the WARN \nAct, a bill championed by Senator Howard Metzenbaum from Ohio, who\n\n[[Page S4475]]\n\nheld this seat, and Senator Kennedy, who is our committee chair today \non the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n  One of the witnesses today was a gentleman from Senator Kennedy's \nState of Massachusetts, Joe Aguiar, who worked for a fabric \nmanufacturer for nearly 30 years. He and 900 coworkers were laid off \nwithout any notice last summer. As are so many workers in \nmanufacturing, he is about 50 years old. Like so many other workers in \nmy State of Ohio, in Springfield and Lima and Tiffin and Marietta, \ntheir lives have been upended. For most, the pensions and health care \nwhich they earned and which they desperately need and which they \nthought had been promised to them, so often the pensions and health \ncare will be slashed.\n  Mr. Aguiar, as workers do in places such as Marion, OH, and Xenia and \nZanesville--those workers need an extension of unemployment insurance. \nNow more than ever, we need to extend those unemployment benefits \nbecause so many workers see their unemployment benefits run out because \nthey can't find comparable jobs.\n  It is very simple. Economists on Wall Street and Washington and \nuniversities all say that every dollar invested in unemployment \nbenefits leads to $1.64 in growth--more than any other stimulus \npackage, any other stimulus program, any other way to put money into \nthe economy. We had this discussion, and the unemployment extension was \nblocked by congressional Republicans some months ago. In addition, we \noffered a stimulus package which will, in fact, put money in people's \npockets--a good thing. Unemployment extension would have come quicker \nand put money into the pockets of those who will spend it immediately \nbecause they are struggling. They need the money for gas for their cars \nto go out and look for jobs, for food to feed their families, and the \ndaily necessities of life.\n  The Congressional Budget Office agrees that a dollar in unemployment \nbenefits leads to $1.64 in growth, finding that extending unemployment \nbenefits is cost-effective and the single fastest acting measure.\n  The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, New York Times, and the Akron \nBeacon Journal in my State all agree. Last week, the House approved an \nextension of unemployment insurance. The Democrats are trying to--or \nare going to--include unemployment insurance extension in the stimulus \npackage. We hope the Republicans don't filibuster this, and that the \nPresident finally changes his mind and signs an extension of \nunemployment insurance. It is a reasonable extension and needs to be \ndone now.\n  As I came over here today to talk about unemployment benefits and \nextending them, my thoughts turned to Senator Kennedy and his family. \nSenator Kennedy, who we find out today has been diagnosed with a \nserious illness, has been fighting for an extension of unemployment \ninsurance certainly lately in this case, and other times, but he is \nalways fighting for workers, the poor, and the middle class. Nobody in \nthis Congress has consistently, or for a longer period of time, in the \nhistory of this institution, fought for workers or the middle class the \nway Senator Kennedy has, and the way he will continue to; he has been \ntireless about this.\n  Just last week, I stood on the Senate floor with Senator Kennedy as \nwe worked together to pass legislation that came out of his committee, \na committee on which I also sit, the Health, Education, Labor, Pension \nCommittee, to establish collective bargaining rights for firefighters \nand others. When it comes to issues facing working families, Senator \nKennedy, as recently as last week, fought for legislation to give \nworkers a civil right--the right to collective bargaining. He has been \nthe compass of this institution too. He focuses his attention and our \nattention on the insecurities so many families in this country are \nfacing. Our prayers today are with him as he heals, and with his lovely \nfamily.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are going to have to, at some time before we leave here, \nhave a vote on overriding the President's veto on the farm bill. So \nthere are things we have to do.\n  The budget has a statutory time. I am not certain we will need to use \nthe whole 10 hours. I rather doubt it. We have the veto override. That \nis very privileged. We can spend a lot of time on that or whatever time \npeople want. We hope we could get to that very quickly and see where \nthe votes are.\n  And then we still have the supplemental to dispose of. So we have a \nlot to do in the next few days, but with some cooperation I think we \ncan get to where we need to get. I certainly hope so. I hope that is \nimportant and understandable to the Senators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4476-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Ford\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of the brave Army sergeant from Knox, Indiana. Joseph Ford, 23 \nyears old, died on May 10, 2008, in Al Asad, Iraq, from injuries \nsustained when his vehicle overturned during a training operation. With \nan optimistic future before him, Joseph risked everything to fight for \nthe values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around \nthe world.\n  A lifelong Hoosier, Joseph graduated from Knox High School in 2003. \nHis teachers and friends recall a young man with a thirst for knowledge \nand a generous spirit. Shortly after finishing high school, Joseph \njoined the Indiana National Guard and was stationed in New Albany. \nJoseph was fiercely dedicated to serving his country and disciplined \nhimself to meet the high standards of military fitness. He enrolled in \nthe University of Southern Indiana, where he studied history, a passion \nhe had since high school. In June, Joseph married his wife, Karen, of \nEvansville, IN.\n  Joseph traveled to Georgia in December with his National Guard unit \nfor training before he left for his first deployment in Iraq. He was \nscheduled for deployment through 2009 but planned to return this summer \nto celebrate his first wedding anniversary with Karen. Assigned to the \n1st Squadron, 152nd Cavalry Regiment, Army National Guard in New \nAlbany, IN, Joseph served as a turret gunner with the Indiana National \nGuard's 76th Infantry Brigade in Iraq.\n  Today, I join Joseph's family and friends in mourning his death. \nJoseph will forever be remembered as a loving husband, son, and friend \nto many. He is survived by his wife Karen; his parents Sam and Dalarie; \nhis brother Matthew; and his sister Abbey Ambrose.\n  While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Joseph, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief. Today and always, \nJoseph will be remembered by family members, friends, and fellow \nHoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made \nwhile dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Joseph's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Joseph's actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Joseph A. Ford in the official \nRecord of the United States Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the pain that \ncomes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that Joseph's family can find \ncomfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow \nup death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all \nfaces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Joseph.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4476-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4476-S4477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING ALPHA COMPANY 641\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, Alpha Company, 641 Aviation Regiment is an \nArmy National Guard company that operates C-23 Sherpa cargo airplanes. \nHeadquartered in Portland, OR, the company has detachments in Oklahoma, \nWashington, and South Dakota. Commanded by MAJ David Doran, the company \nconsists of 44 soldiers and 10 C-23 airplanes. The Oregon soldiers that \nare part of the company hail from all around the State of Oregon: \nPortland, Salem, Pendleton, McMinnville, La Pine, Hermiston, and \nDallas. The company deployed to Iraq from October 2007 to May 2008.\n  The story of Alpha Company, 641 Aviation Regiment is as complex as \nthe 44 personalities that comprise the company. It is a mixture of \nexperienced combat veterans on their second or third tour and young and \neager soldiers experiencing their first deployment. The youngest is 21; \nthe oldest is 54. There are married fathers and unmarried bachelors. \nThere are full-time guardsmen and traditional National Guard, who split \ntime as electricians, students, civilian aviators, and aspiring \nattorneys. Identifying with ``Ducks,'' ``Beavers,'' ``Huskies,'' and \n``Sooners,'' the dynamics of this hodgepodge is sometimes surprising, \ngenerally humorous, and always fascinating.\n  From Oregon to Oklahoma and Washington to South Dakota, the soldiers \nin this company have interacted with individuals from all across the \ncountry, with equal parts of Midwest know-how and Northwest can-do. As \na result, those from Oregon have learned the right way to eat grits, \nand those from Oklahoma have learned 20 different words to describe \n``coffee.'' Each person in this company has brought a unique \nperspective and fresh batch of life experiences to share with the \ngroup. Everyday, a new story begins with ``back when I was a kid . . \n.'' or ``on my last deployment . . .'' This company brought together a \ncross section of America, fresh with an unflinching sense of duty, \ndeep-seated pride in their job, and an unquenchable drive to get that \njob done.\n  Alpha Company operates the C-23 Sherpa, which is the least understood \nand most underestimated aircraft in the Army inventory. With its boxy \ndimensions, it has assumed the moniker ``BOX CAR.'' As unsightly and \nunusual as it may be, pound for pound and passenger for passenger, this \nrat-nosed aircraft has moved more parts and people around Iraq than \nmost other military airframes. The crews who fly the Sherpa will tell \nyou that what it lacks in looks, it makes up for in dependability. The \nSherpa is the unsung, unappreciated, and unassuming aircraft that gets \nit done, around the clock. Whether it is a box of widgets or 14 \nsoldiers going out on R leave, this aircraft and its crews make it \nhappen.\n  In October 2007, Alpha Company mustered and deployed to Balad Air \nBase in\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\nIraq. The unit quickly assumed the mission and took over all Army \nfixed-wing cargo operations under Multi-National Forces-Iraq. This \nexpansive support covered Mosul, Kirkuk, and Basra, in addition to a \ndozen smaller air bases throughout the country. From passengers to \nblood to ammunition, Alpha Company flew six aircraft per day to get as \nmuch moved as possible. This amounted to two aircraft above and beyond \nthe mission requirement. Alpha Company implemented the first fully \nstandardized night vision goggle flight program, greatly increasing \naircrew survivability by operating in hours of darkness. This also \nenhanced the performance capabilities of the C-23 by operating in \ngenerally cooler temperatures.\n  The company's support of Other Coalition Forces-Iraq, OCF-I; Special \nOperations, was instrumental in the timely transportation of sensitive \ncargo and detained personnel. The company increased existing support by \n100 percent and developed mission support into Baghdad. This mission \nhad not existed prior to Alpha Company's arrival. It filled a crucial \ngap in aviation support for OCF-I and was pivotal to ongoing combat \noperations. LTG Stanley McChrystal, head of special operations in Iraq, \ncited the unit for their dependable and outstanding service to OCF-I.\n  In April 2008, the unit surged to increase its operational tempo by \n100 percent to support combat operations in and around Basra. During \nthe 2 weeks at the height of the operation, Alpha Company flew 377 \nhours, more hours than ever recorded by a C-23 company in a 2-week \nperiod. By the end of April, the company was preparing to redeploy back \nto home-stations, families, and loved ones. For their meritorious \nperformance of duty and courage over the dangerous skies of Iraq, the \ncompany earned 4 Bronze Star Medals, 7 Meritorious Service Medals and \n38 Air Medals. During their 6 months in Iraq, the company flew over \n4,000 flight hours, moved over 9,000,000 pounds of cargo and over \n20,000 passengers, more than any other C-23 company in a 6-month period \nsince the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Alpha Company's accomplishments are extraordinary and truly \nreflective of the distinguished service and dedication of America's \ncitizen soldier. The State of Oregon is profoundly proud and deeply \ngrateful for their sacrifice and commitment. It is with great pride \nthat I honor their service today and enter their accomplishment into \nthe Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4477-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Their contributions \ncontinue to protect and promote the values that define the United \nStates.\n  During this month of remembrance, I am continuing my work to ensure \nthat our servicemembers and veterans receive the honor and care they \nrightly deserve, and that those serving in war can return home soon.\n  In the Senate, I am working for concurrent receipt for our retired \nmilitary personnel so that disabled veterans can receive the benefits \nthey deserve. With Senators Lieberman, Bond, and Obama, I have also \nchampioned efforts to improve mental health care and services for \nActive Duty military and veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nI proudly support Senator Jim Webb's new GI bill, S. 22, to vastly \nimprove educational benefits for our newest generation of \nservicemembers and veterans. We must all remain committed to ensuring \nthat our military members, veterans, and their families are taken care \nof.\n  As Americans from across the Nation pay tribute to our military this \nmonth, I offer my appreciation and admiration for all the men and women \nwho have contributed to the history and traditions of the U.S. Armed \nForces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4477-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4477-S4478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss my \nreasons for voting for the conference report to H.R. 2419, The Farm, \nNutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007. Also known as the 2007 farm bill, \nthis legislation determines America's agriculture and domestic \nnutrition policy for the next 5 years. It has, received substantial \ncriticism because of subsidies paid to farmers of five major \ncommodities or crops: corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, and wheat. On April \n29, 2008, President Bush called the legislation a ``massive, bloated \nfarm bill'' and has said he would veto it. The bill has also drawn \ncriticism from taxpayer advocacy groups.\n  The 2007 farm bill conference report scores at $307 billion over 5 \nyears. However, this increase is fully off-set with customs users fees \nthat are collected by the Border and Transportation Security \nDirectorate--formerly the U.S. Customs Service--of the Department of \nHomeland Security for processing passengers, conveyances and \nmerchandise entering the United States. The White House has agreed that \nthis bill does not include any tax increase.\n  During my tenure in the U.S. Senate, I have fought hard for \nagriculture and nutrition programs in Pennsylvania. However, I do have \nconcerns with direct payment subsidies for farmers where the amount is \nnot based on the price of the commodity and, more importantly, with \nlarge, almost endless, payments to producers. In 2006, Riceland Foods, \nInc. located in Stuttgart, AR, received $7,710,705 for rice, soybean, \nwheat, and corn production. In 2006, the top 10 recipients of direct \nsubsidies for production of corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, and wheat \nwere, in order of rank, Iowa, Illinois, Texas, Nebraska, Kansas, \nMinnesota, Arkansas, Indiana, North Dakota, and Missouri. \nPennsylvania's agriculture producers are not the recipients of these \nlarge subsidies, as Pennsylvania is a major producer of milk, Christmas \ntrees, and specialty crops, which include mushrooms, apples, and fruits \nand vegetables. My home State ranks No. 1 in the production of \nmushrooms, No. 4 in the production of apples and freestone peaches, and \nNo. 5 in the production of milk and grapes in the U.S. Pennsylvania \nranks 32 out of 50 in terms of Federal Government agricultural \npayments, despite the fact that agriculture is PA's No. 1 industry.\n  These large subsidies were a major concern when I voted against the \n2002 farm bill conference report, even though the bill contained \ncrucial programs for Pennsylvania, including the milk income loss \ncontract, MILC, and conservation and nutrition programs. It would be my \npreference that we move toward a free market for agriculture.\n  While this legislation is not perfect, it is a much better \nalternative to an extension of the 2002 farm bill or the reversion to \nnonexpiring provisions of primarily the Agriculture Adjustment Act of \n1938 and the Agriculture Act of 1949--permanent law. The 2002 farm bill \ndid not include any reforms of program subsidies and the 1938 and 1949 \nlaws are drastically different from current policy, inconsistent with \ncurrent farming, marketing, and trade agreements, and would mandate \nhigher subsidy rates and land controls.\n  I have reviewed the pending conference report to determine its \nbenefits for the entire country, not just Pennsylvania where I have \nheard from many constituents and stakeholders expressing their support. \nThis bill is not perfect, but it still moves America in the right \ndirection. Our Nation, like Pennsylvania, will on the whole benefit \nfrom the 2007 farm bill. It makes key reforms to subsidy programs which \nI\n\n[[Page S4478]]\n\nwill discuss more in detail later. In addition, this legislation \nincludes funding for domestic nutrition programs, conservation \nprograms, programs to help rural America, and the milk income loss \ncontract, MILC, program for America's dairy producers. For the first \ntime, the farm bill would extend assistance to specialty crop producers \nthrough marketing and research programs.\n  This conference report includes significant subsidy reforms. Under \ncurrent law, producers are not eligible for payments if their adjusted \ngross income, AGI, exceeds $2.5 million. In the final 2007 farm bill, a \nproducers' nonfarm income may not exceed $500,000 in order to receive a \npayment. Further, a producers' farm income, or AGI, cannot exceed more \nthan $750,000 in order to receive a payment. One key reform is the \nelimination of the so-called ``three-entity rule,'' which enabled a \nfarmer to collect twice the maximum payment limit amount by setting up \nmultiple businesses on the same farm. The White House was influential \nin this outcome, which I support. Although the final language did not \nattain more stringent reforms as preferred by the White House or the \nDorgan/Grassley amendment to the 2007 farm bill, this AGI reform is a \nstep in the right direction. I have been a consistent supporter of \nefforts to limit payments to the major program crop producers. Further, \nthe measure includes Crop Insurance subsidy reform by reducing the \nadministrative and operating--A provided to agents by \n2.3 percentage points and increasing catastrophic--CAT--and non-insured \nassistance program--NAP--insurance fees.\n  The bill includes $209 billion for nutrition programs which is 68 \npercent of the entire cost of the bill. I have long supported nutrition \nprograms, also known as domestic food assistance programs, which are \ncrucial to help less fortunate Americans and those experiencing \ndifficult times. They include the Food Stamp Program, The Emergency \nFood Assistance Program, TEFAP, the Commodity Supplemental Food \nProgram, Community Food Projects, the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition \nProgram, and fresh fruit and vegetable initiatives.\n  The Food Stamp Program helps 26 million low-income Americans buy \nhealthy food each month. Its benefits have not been raised in 30 years \nand the conference report raises the minimum benefit from $10 to $14 \nper week, indexed for inflation. Further, the final 2007 farm bill also \nincludes $1 billion to expand the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program--\nFFVP--nationwide to reach nearly 3 million low-income children. The \nFFVP allows schools to offer and promote free fresh fruits and \nvegetables during the day.\n  The conference report includes $25 billion for conservation programs \nto help America's farmers use environmentally friendly farming \npractices in order to allow farmers to till the soil and raise \nlivestock, while still protecting the land. In Pennsylvania alone, \nabout one-quarter of all acres is farmland. The Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Grassland Reserve \nProgram, the Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program, and the Wildlife \nHabitat Incentives Program are all worthy initiatives that need \nimprovement and funding. Beyond providing funding for national \nconservation programs, the bill has $438 million for conservation \nprograms in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed which includes large sections \nof Pennsylvania.\n  Rural America, the backbone of our country, will benefit from this \ncomprehensive legislation by reducing the backlog of unfunded pending \nrural development water and wastewater loan and grant applications. \nAlso, broadband service will be expanded to rural America to allow \naccess to those businesses, farms, and families in rural areas with no \nor very limited service. Further, a new rural microenterprise \nassistance program would be established for low and moderate income \nindividuals to help develop the skills necessary to establish new small \nbusinesses in rural America. Lastly, the conference report provides \n$250 million in mandatory funding for grants and loan guarantees for \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency systems for farmers, ranchers, \nand rural small businesses. One item of note is that reduction of the \nproduction tax credit for corn ethanol from 51 cents/gallon to 45 \ncents/gallon to reduce the incentive to shift corn production from feed \nto fuel in order to ensure that we are planting enough acres for other \ncrops, including wheat and soybeans, for food.\n  Finally, our dairy producers will continue to have the safety-net \nthey deserve with a much-needed modification. The 2007 farm bill \nconference report funds the MILC program that provides countercyclical \npayments to our dairy producers when the price of milk falls below a \nset trigger price. This trigger price, as modified, will be adjusted on \na monthly basis depending on the changes in the costs of feed. \nIncreasing input costs are straining our producers and this will ensure \nthat the payment will compensate for the increasing costs incurred by \nthe dairy farmer. Also, the payment rate will be increased back to 45 \npercent from 34 percent and the cap on milk production will increase \nfrom 2.4 million pounds to 2.98 million pounds per year. Since its \ninception in the 2002 farm bill, the MILC program has provided more \nthan $220 million to Pennsylvania dairy farmers. I have been a strong \nsupporter of a mechanism to ensure that dairy farmers receive a fair \nprice for the milk they produce considering the increased input costs. \nThe bill also includes provisions to make the dairy industry more \ntransparent by requiring mandatory reporting of dairy commodities and \nestablishing a Federal Milk Marketing Order Review Commission.\n  America's specialty crop producers which include most fruits and \nvegetables will get the assistance they need to market their products. \nThe bill provides about $1.3 billion in mandatory funding for specialty \ncrop block grants, technical assistance, and farmers' market promotion. \nThis is the most ever set aside in a farm bill to assist these farmers \nwho are left out of traditional Federal farm programs. The measure \nestablishes the National Clean Plant Network consisting of centers \nacross America to efficiently produce and distribute healthy planting \nstock of critical high-value new varieties of fruit trees and \ngrapevines. These centers will be the first line of defense against \ndevastating viruses, like the Plum Plox virus outbreak in Adams County, \nPA, in 1999. Also, both nursery and Christmas trees are included in the \nTree Assistance Program which provides disaster relief for growers who \nlost their crops of trees due to natural disasters. Pennsylvania \ngrowers produce over 10 million trees every year.\n  The 2007 farm bill is good for America and good for Pennsylvania. \nTherefore, I support this crucial legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4478-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CUBAN INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the important \nwork and accomplishments of the Screen Actors Guild as the organization \ncelebrates its 75th anniversary. Founded on June 30, 1933, the Screen \nActors Guild was established in part as a reaction to the restrictive, \nlong-term studio engagement contracts. Since then, it has helped to \nprotect and improve the lives of actors and their families by fighting \nfor fair wages and health and retirement benefits.\n  The Screen Actors Guild has a unique position in labor history. It \nclaims a former Senator, George Murphy, and a former President, Ronald \nReagan, as former union presidents, as well as James Cagney, Charlton \nHeston, Edward Asner, Patty Duke, Dennis Weaver, and many other notable \nactors. Its current president is Alan Rosenberg.\n  The founding meeting of the Screen Actors Guild included just six \nactors. Yet, 75 years later, it has more than 127,000 members with 20 \noffices across the United States. It represents a broad variety of \nmembers from motion pictures, television programs and commercials, and \nnonbroadcast industries such as video games, music video, Internet, and \nother new media formats. The Screen Actors Guild has also taken a \nleading role in combating movie and new media piracy, while working \ntoward increased privacy protections, child labor laws, and health care \nreform. With the rapid expansion of so many alternative forms of \nentertainment, it has also met the challenge of representing its \nmembers in new challenging contract issues. And, of course, its \nesteemed Screen Actors Guild Awards honor its members each year for \noutstanding performances.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me in commending the Screen \nActors Guild for its dedication to improving workers' rights on its \n75th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4479-4", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4479-S4480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING LOUIS FERNANDEZ\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to ask my colleagues \nto join me in recognizing Dr. Louis Fernandez as he retires from a long \ncareer in public service as provost and vice president for academic \naffairs with California State University, San Bernardino. His service \nand commitment to the students, faculty, and staff of California State \nUniversity, San Bernardino, and to his community have provided an \nexample for us all.\n  After earning his doctorate in geology from Syracuse University, Dr. \nFernandez served at several institutions of higher learning throughout \nthe Nation. At each of these universities, Dr. Fernandez was as an \nexemplary educator and community leader. Through his career at the \nUniversity of New Orleans as a professor, dean and department chair, \nDr. Fernandez worked to secure the university's first National Science \nFoundation grant to recruit and mentor underrepresented students in the \ngeosciences. The State of Louisiana named him Educational Administrator \nof the Year in 1991, and he has since received numerous laudatory \ntitles and honors for his work in education.\n  Dr. Fernandez later joined the California State University, San\n\n[[Page S4480]]\n\nBernardino campus. By 1994 he served as acting vice president for \nacademic affairs, and was named provost a year later. Since then, Dr. \nFernandez has served the university and the surrounding communities by \nworking to secure a sound academic plan for academic growth, a \nresponsible university budget, and a university-wide commitment to \nstudent diversity.\n  For several years, Dr. Fernandez chaired the National Association of \nGeology Teachers Minority Affairs Committee. He served on the National \nScience Foundation's Advisory Committee to the Earth Sciences. He \nchaired the American Geological Institute's Minority Participation \nProgram Advisory Committee, and as a member of the Geological Society \nof America's Ad Hoc Committee on Minorities, and the National \nAssociation of Geology Teacher's Minority Scholarship Program. For his \nbroad service and leadership, the Hispanic Caucus of the American \nAssociation of Higher Education awarded him the Outstanding Support of \nHispanic Issues in Higher Education Award.\n  Throughout his long career in education and public service, Dr. Louis \nFernandez has consistently worked to foster stronger communities and \nattain higher education ideals.

Mr. President, from May 3-5, 2008, more than 1,200 \nstudents from across the country visited Washington, DC to take part in \nthe We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution National Finals. We \nthe People is the most extensive educational program in the country \ndeveloped to educate young people about the U.S. Constitution and Bill \nof Rights. Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the \nPeople program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education by act of \nCongress.\n  While in Washington, the students took part in a 3-day academic \ncompetition that simulates a congressional hearing in which they \n``testify'' before a panel of judges. Students demonstrated their \nknowledge and understanding of constitutional principles as they \nevaluated, assumed, and defended positions on relevant historical and \ncontemporary issues. It is important to note that results of \nindependent studies of this nationally acclaimed program reveal that We \nthe People students have knowledge gains that are superior to \ncomparison students. Students also display a greater political \ntolerance and commitment to the principles and values of the \nConstitution and Bill of Rights than do students using traditional \ntextbooks and approaches. With many reports and surveys indicating the \nlack of civic knowledge and civic participation, I am pleased to \nsupport such a superb program that is producing an enlightened and \nengaged citizenry.\n  I am proud to announce that a class from Elkins High School in \nMissouri City, represented the State of Texas at this prestigious \nnational event. These outstanding students, through their knowledge of \nthe U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and earned the \nchance to come to our Nation's Capital and compete at the national \nlevel.\n  Mr. President, the names of these outstanding students from Elkins \nHigh School are: Krystal Castillo, Andrea Cavazos, Deborah Choate, \nAndrew Cockroft, Lucretia Eiler, Jimmy Guerrero, Josh Hanks, Lara \nHogue, Nick Johnson, Tiffany Kell, Curtis Kelso, D.J. Kinneman, Matt \nMacKo, Colton Mendez, Jonny Murthy, Olusola Oyewuwo, Tej Pandya, Bryan \nPhilpott, Justina Rodriguez, Deepa Sabu, Nick Shipman, Piarose \nSiaotong, Ivette Soto, Achal Upadhyaya, Courtney Wiliams, Angela Wu, \nand Arif Yusuf.\n  I also wish to commend the teacher of the class, Marilyn Ellington, \nwho is responsible for preparing these young constitutional experts for \nthe National Finals. Also worthy of special recognition is Jan Miller, \nthe State coordinator who is responsible for implementing the We the \nPeople program in my State.\n  I congratulate these students on their exceptional success at the We \nthe People national finals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4480-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4480-S4481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. TIMOTHY WHITE\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am honored to recognize the close \nto 4 years of dedicated service and leadership provided by Dr. Timothy \nWhite, outgoing president of the University of Idaho. Son of immigrants \nfrom Argentina to Canada and then to the United States, Dr. White is a \nfirst-generation college graduate. He earned his Ph.D. from the \nUniversity of California, Berkeley, and is known internationally for \nhis work in kinesiology, gerontology and human biodynamics, working in \nthose fields at the University of Michigan and at Berkeley. Before \ncoming to Idaho in August 2004, Dr. White served as provost and \nexecutive vice president at Oregon State University and as interim \npresident.\n  Dr. White put his vision of excellence in research, math and science \ninto practice at the University of Idaho. Indeed, he shares my strong \nbelief in the critical importance of math and science to education, \nfrom primary school to graduate degree programs. In a recent guest \neditorial, Dr. White stated: ``Idaho will prosper in the global economy \nif our work force is better prepared in the areas of math, science, \ntechnology and engineering Critical-thinking and reasoning abilities--\ncornerstones of an educated citizenry and work force--are also \ndramatically aided by strong math and science skills.'' And Dr. White \nput ideas into action, overseeing critical programs that bridge the gap \nbetween middle and high school teachers and students and the \nUniversity. While serving as president, Dr. White oversaw both the \nGateway to Mathematics Program, which provides middle school teachers \nthe chance to improve math teaching skills through interactive distance \ntechnology, and the Gateway to Calculus Program, which offers rural \nhigh school students an opportunity to learn calculus online when their \nparticular school cannot offer such courses. He also oversaw the \ninnovative and nationally acclaimed Polya Mathematics Learning Center \nat the University which helps undergraduate students master entry-level \nmathematics in an interactive and creative way, using both advanced \ntechnology and teaching staff to help students of varied learning \nstyles overcome aversions to math.\n  Dr. White's influence reached beyond math and science programs and \ninitiatives. He created the Plan for Renewal of People, Programs and \nPlace, based on the report of a task force he established to reinforce \nand enhance the university's academic and institutional excellence in \ntoday's world. The plan centered the University's resource allocation \nand mission, vision, and values around five key academic areas: science \nand technology, liberal arts and sciences, entrepreneurial innovation, \nthe environment, and sustainable design and lifestyle. He saw the \nuniversity engage in programs such as Operation Education Scholarship, \nWater of the West, Building Sustainable Communities, Bioregional \nPlanning and Community Design and Biological Applications of \nNanotechnology. During his term as president, the University of Idaho \nhas been involved in many public-private partnerships with science and \ntechnology across the State, particularly in agriculture research. In \n2006, the university opened an aquaculture biotechnology laboratory at \nits Hagerman fish culture experiment station, and University scientists \nnow conduct cutting edge small grains germplasm research together with \nUSDA Agriculture Research Service staff at a new addition to the ARS \nAberdeen research facility, also opened in 2006. Under the direction of \nDr. White, the University of Idaho continued its efforts to open a \ncritical agriculture research endeavor the Idaho Center for Livestock \nand Environmental Studies that will serve as an environmental research \ncenter for dairy and livestock and operate as a self-sustaining animal \nfeeding operation. And agriculture is not the only science and \ntechnology partnership the university has pursued under Dr. White's \nleadership: it is a partner with the Idaho National Lab in a \nmultiuniversity public-private research and development endeavor in \nIdaho Falls called the Center for Advanced Energy Studies.\n  Dr. White has worked diligently over the past 4 years to adapt the \nUniversity of Idaho to our changing world,\n\n[[Page S4481]]\n\nmeeting students' educational needs and keeping the university on the \ncutting edge of innovative education, research, and academic \nexcellence. I wish Tim and his wife Karen all the best as they move to \nsouthern California and he assumes the chancellorship of University of \nCalifornia, Riverside, this fall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4481-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING DON BRIGHT,\n\n Mr JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Don Bright, \nwho has served as supervisor of the Nebraska National Forest since \n2001. In this capacity, Don has overseen the management of nearly 1.1 \nmillion acres of public land, including the Buffalo Gap and Fort Pierre \nNational Grasslands, in my home State of South Dakota. I have enjoyed \nworking with Don and value his hard work and leadership. I know that \nDon will carry this same degree of professionalism with him to his new \nposition at the Albuquerque Headquarters.\n  I want to take a few minutes and explain to the Senate the role Don \nhas played in shaping the relationship of the Forest Service and local \ncommunities. As supervisor of the Nebraska National Forest, Don guided \na revision of its Land Management Plan and took the lead in addressing \ncomplicated, yet important, prairie dog management issues. By working \nwith area ranchers to find solutions to managing local resources, Don \nhelped foster a spirit of collaboration that benefits all involved.\n  For the past 8 years, South Dakota has faced a devastating drought \nand continual threat of fire throughout its grasslands. In response to \nthis challenge, Don has improved fire and fuels management plans and \nworked hand-in-hand with local volunteer fire departments to form \nlasting bonds of cooperation that help protect both lands and citizens.\n  Most importantly, Don is someone that is trusted by and has worked \nwell with the many groups interested in public lands management \nthroughout South Dakota and Nebraska. His countless hours of hard work \nhave undoubtedly had a positive impact for the Forest Service.\n  In closing, I want to thank Don Bright for his professionalism, \nservice and assistance over these many years and wish him the best of \nluck in his new position. I know that Don can leave knowing that future \ngenerations will be well-served by his efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4481-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO COLONEL KENNETH O. MCCREEDY\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to publicly commend and \ncongratulate Colonel Kenneth O. McCreedy, U.S. Army, upon his \nretirement after 28 years of military service. I have come to know and \nrespect Colonel McCreedy over the last 3 years, while he served as the \ninstallation commander of Fort Meade, MD. His tenure as the \ninstallation commander was highlighted by his constant civic engagement \nwith the Fort Meade military and civilian community. During this time \nhe signed the first Army Community Covenant in Maryland, solidifying \nsupport for servicemembers and their families.\n  Colonel McCreedy was proactive in working with surrounding counties \nto prepare them for the growth challenges of BRAC 2005. Placing a heavy \nemphasis on strong community engagement, he worked closely with the \nAnne Arundel County School Board to secure the International \nBaccalaureate Program and Homeland Security Signature Program for Meade \nHigh School. Colonel McCreedy spearheaded the first two Meade Alliance \nEducation Summits that focused on working with school boards and \ncolleges to develop programs and initiatives to prepare today's \nstudents for future careers in the Federal Government. I am extremely \ngrateful for the outstanding leadership and keen sense of community \nservice that Colonel McCreedy has brought to the servicemembers, \nfamilies, and civilian employees of Fort Meade.\n  Commissioned as a military intelligence officer, Colonel McCreedy \nfirst served at Fort Riley, KS as the S2 and Scout Platoon Leader of 3-\n37 Armor and assistant S2 of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division. \nAfter completing the Post-Graduate Intelligence Program at the Defense \nIntelligence College and Spanish instruction at the Defense Language \nInstitute in Monterey, CA, Colonel McCreedy was assigned to the U.S. \nSouthern Command in Panama as a country analyst in the J2. Following \nOperation JUST CAUSE, he was assigned to Fort Hood, TX, where he was a \nG2 Operations Officer in the Third Corps, commanded a CI/IPW Company in \nthe 163rd Military Intelligence Battalion, and served as the S3 Plans \nOfficer for the 504th Military Intelligence Brigade.\n  After attending school at Fort Leavenworth, KS, Colonel McCreedy \nserved in Germany as the V Corps G2 Plans Officer, S3 of the 302nd \nMilitary Intelligence Battalion, and S3 of the 205th Military \nIntelligence Brigade. He then served as a member of the Commander's \nInitiatives Group while on duty in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina. \nReturning from Europe in 1999, he served as a Fellow at the National \nSecurity Agency at Fort Meade, prior to his assignment to Fort Gordon, \nGA, as commander of the 201st Military Intelligence Battalion. He next \nwas appointed professor of military science at Old Dominion University \nin Norfolk, VA. After attending the Army War College, Colonel McCreedy \nworked in the Force Transformation Office in the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  Colonel McCreedy holds a bachelor's degree in history from Washington \nand Lee University, master's and doctorate degrees in history from the \nUniversity of California, Berkeley, a Master of Military Art and \nScience from the Army Command and Staff College, and a Master of \nStrategic Studies from the Army War College. He is a graduate of both \nthe Army's School of Advanced Military Studies and the Advanced \nStrategic Art Program.\n  Among his awards and decorations, Colonel McCreedy has earned the \nDefense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, Joint \nService Commendation Medal, and the NATO Medal.\n  Mr. President, the Army, the State of Maryland, and the Nation are \nlucky to have had the service of such a great soldier. He will be \nsorely missed. Best wishes to Colonel McCreedy and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4481-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4481-S4482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING THE BAKER COMPANY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I congratulate the Baker \nCompany, a cutting-edge small company from my home State of Maine that \nhas earned tremendous recognition as the Maine International Trade \nCenter's 2008 Exporter of the Year. The award will be presented to the \ncompany at the Maine International Trade Day dinner this Thursday, May \n22. The company's leadership on a host of safety issues--and the loyal \ncustomer base it has earned around the world, including in Europe, \nAsia, and Africa--make the Baker Company most deserving of this award.\n  Founded in 1949, the Baker Company, headquartered in Sanford, has \nconsistently been a leader in designing and manufacturing biological \nsafety cabinets, fume hoods, and clean benches. These products make \nlaboratories worldwide safer, more efficient, and better equipped to \nfocus on essential scientific research. From its beginnings, the Baker \nCompany has always been at the forefront of crafting new and unique \nproducts to lead the industry. In 1951, the company unveiled the very \nfirst clean air cabinet. The firm's solid commitment to craftsmanship \nand its stellar reputation gained the Baker Company significant \nacknowledgement over the years. In 1979, Lockheed Aircraft Biosystems \nchose the company to build a biological safety cabinet for a NASA \nshuttle flight. Since that time, the firm has only increased its \ningenuity and has worked with enterprises worldwide to make \nimprovements to their technological safety.\n  To best promote its role at the vanguard of laboratory safety, the \nBaker Company founded the Eagleson Institute in 1989. Dedicated to the \nmemory of the firm's longtime president, John M. Eagleson, the \nnonprofit institute promotes the practice of lab safety through a \nvariety of mediums, including seminars, lectures, and interactive CD-\nROMs. The seminars comprise a vast array of topics, from fundamentals \nof laboratory safety to safety cabinet technology. The seminars are \ndelivered through a variety of instructional techniques, including role \nplaying, problem solving, and demonstrations.\n\n[[Page S4482]]\n\nWhile the firm hosts frequent sessions at its Sanford headquarters, it \noccasionally offers them at various locations across the globe. The \nEagleson Institute is the Baker Company's distinctive way of making a \ndifference in the industry and of sharing the trade's most critical \nasset--safety--with others.\n  The Maine International Trade Center, which is presenting the Maine \nExporter of the Year Award to the Baker Company, is Maine's small \nbusiness link to the world. The center is a public-private partnership \nbetween the State of Maine and the businesses that play such a crucial \nrole in expanding the State's economy. The center's goal is to increase \ninternational trade in Maine, and, in particular, to help Maine \nbusinesses export goods and services. Clearly, it sees in the Baker \nCompany the entrepreneurial spirit and innovation that make Maine's \nsmall businesses among the best in the world.\n  Throughout the decades, the Baker Company's name has been synonymous \nwith unmatched quality and exceptional safety. From its early days, the \nfirm has possessed a commitment to the pharmaceutical, life science, \nand biotechnology sectors and a determination to create a safer working \nenvironment for people in those industries. I congratulate everyone at \nthe Baker Company for their impressive accomplishment in garnering the \nMaine International Trade Center's 2008 Exporter of the Year Award and \nwish them lasting success both here and abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4482-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING DR. RUFUS JUDSON PEARSON, JR.\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Dr. Rufus Judson Pearson, Jr., of \nSouthern Pines, NC, passed away in Tamarac, Fl. on Sunday, May 11, 2008 \nafter a prolonged illness and went to be with the Lord and to the side \nof his beloved wife, Emily.\n  Dr. Pearson, the former attending physician to the U.S. Congress, was \nborn in Atlanta, GA, October 8, 1915, the son of Rufus J. Pearson, \nM.D., and Myrtle Padgett of Richland, GA. He attended the University of \nFlorida and received his doctor of medicine degree from Emory \nUniversity in 1938 at the age of 22. He trained at Kings County \nHospital in Brooklyn and at Grady Hospital in Atlanta and subsequently \nhad a year of intensive training in cardiovascular Diseases offered by \nHarvard Medical School at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, \nunder the tutelage of renowned cardiologist Dr. Paul Dudley White.\n  Dr. Pearson was fellow of the American College of Physicians, the \nAmerican College of Cardiology, the Scientific Council, American Heart \nAssociation, and member, American Medical Association. He was certified \nby the American Board of Internal Medicine and by the Sub-specialty \nBoard in Cardiovascular Disease.\n  In May of 1939, following first year of internship, he married the \nformer Emily Virginia Timmerman of Atlanta, GA, whom he met during his \nfirst year as a medical student at Emory.\n  During World War II, he served overseas as a naval medical officer, \nand after the war, he entered the private practice of internal medicine \nin Jacksonville, FL. Shortly after the outbreak of the Korean crisis in \n1950, he was recalled to Active Duty and subsequently decided to make \nthe Navy a career.\n  He rose to prominence in the Medical Corps while serving as chief of \ncardiology at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD, from \n1955 to 1961 during the period when open-heart surgery was being \npioneered. He later served as chief of medicine at the Naval Hospitals \nin Charleston, SC and Portsmouth, VA. In 1965, he returned to the al \nHospital at Bethesda to serve as director of clinical services and \nchief of medicine. To each of these assignments, he brought a high \nlevel of professional competence, coupled with dynamic leadership, \ndrive and imagination.\n  In 1966, at the request of speaker John McCormack and Senate majority \nleader Mike Mansfield and by joint concurrence of both the U.S. House \nof Representatives and the U.S. Senate, Dr. Pearson was assigned as the \nattending physician to Congress, a position he held for almost 7 years \nand only the second physician to ever hold that post. He brought to \nthis unique position exceptional skill, innovation, and farsighted \nleadership, effecting numerous improvements to the health care delivery \nsystem in the Capitol complex. He was highly regarded by Members of the \nHouse and Senate, not only as skilled physician, but also as a friend \nand confidant to many, earning the respect of the Nation's legislators \nand their staffs.\n  On numerous occasions--his praises by Members of the House and Senate \nwere made a matter of record in the Congressional Record. On such \ncomment offered by Senator Aiken from Vermont is quoted in the Record:\n\n       Dr. Pearson will probably be missed as much as anyone who \n     as ever has worked in the Capitol. It did not matter what we \n     called him. We started out calling him ``Admiral,'' and \n     pretty soon we called him ``Doctor.'' Finally, he got to be \n     known as ``Jud'' and his wife as Emily. They certainly are \n     people with whom we could be very proud to have worked.\n\n  And another quote from Senator Mansfield of Montana:\n\n       Dr. Pearson has created a medical facility in the Capitol \n     that is almost unequaled. His main purpose was our health and \n     well being, but also he was there to offer his friendship and \n     advice whether it be for us, our families, or our staffs. No \n     task was too great, no hours too late, no burden too heavy \n     for ``Jud'' Pearson. . . . Dr. Pearson's integrity, \n     dedication, and deep devotion have been the cause of his \n     excellence in his present position.\n\n  He was chosen to accompany the majority leader and minority leader of \nthe Senate on their historic trip to China in 1972 and was at that time \none the first few American physicians to enter China since World War \nII. For his exceptional service to the country while serving at the \nU.S. Capitol, the President of the United States presented him with the \nDistinguished Service Medal. Following his retirement in 1973, the \nPearsons retired to the Sandhills area of North Carolina.\n  Dr. Pearson was a most enthusiastic golfer and a member of Columbia \nCountry Club and the Whispering Pines Country Club. He was also a \nhighly skilled and avid bridge player and was invited to participate as \na member of the Wolves Club in Southern Pines.\n  Dr. Pearson was a marvelous and compassionate physician-scholar as \nwell as skilled in his profession. He was a wonderful father and strong \npatriarch, both generous and kind. But friends and relatives alike will \nattest that his many significant contributions and achievements pale in \ncomparison to the remarkable example he set as a devoted husband to his \nbeloved wife Emily, to whom he was united in marriage for 67 years, \nloving her, cherishing her and caring for her until her death at the \nage of 91. Theirs was truly a marriage made in heaven.\n  He is survived by his daughter, Mrs. Virginia P. Sudders of Tamarac, \nFL, and his son, CPT Rufus J. Pearson, III, and daughter-in-law, \nElizabeth Pearson, of Wheaton, IL; eight grandchildren: Rufus Judson \nPearson, IV, Matthew Allen Pearson, Andrew Clinton Pearson, Mrs. \nKathryn Elizabeth Pearson Dickson, Mrs. Amy Sudders Wilke, Mrs. Barbara \nSudders Andrade, Ms. Marylou Sudders, Mrs. Susan Sudders Kuper; and \nnine great-grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4482-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4482-S4483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WILFRED KADLEC\n\n Mr. THUNE.

On \nthis Memorial Day, I would like to commend him for his brave actions \nand devoted service to our country.\n  Like many of his generation, Kadlec responded honorably to the call \nof duty in the Second World War. Kadlec served his country bravely as a \nPetty Officer, Second Class, on the USS Radford and the USS Klondike. \nKadlec's sacrifice is evident as he received the Purple Heart among \nmany other medals during his service in the U.S. Navy.\n  Kadlec continued to serve his local and veterans' communities long \nafter his military service ended in 1946. He served as an officer on \nthe Liberty Township board for over 60 years. Also, he is a member of \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 3179 of Faulkton, SD, and the \nAmerican Legion Post 259 of Roscoe, SD.\n  Kadlec is one example of the great generation that carried our Nation \nthrough its most difficult times. We are indebted to their sacrifice \nand their\n\n[[Page S4483]]\n\nwillingness to fight for the American people and way of life.\n  Again, I would like to thank Wilfred for his service as we remember \nall those who have protected freedom around the world and have made \nsacrifices to keep America safe on this Memorial Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4483-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, today I recognize Dr. Charles Ruch, \noutgoing president of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology \nin Rapid City who is retiring after 5 years of service to the \nuniversity.\n  The School of Mines was established in 1885 and enjoys a nationwide \nreputation for excellence in engineering, the sciences, and computer \ntechnology. President Ruch has received praise from the South Dakota \nBoard of Regents for his keen focus on the academic, research and \npublic service missions at the university. Since his arrival in 2003, \nthe number of doctoral programs has doubled and the awards for \nresearch-related grants and contracts have increased 35 percent in the \nlast 4 years to $17.2 million. Under his tenure, a new business \nincubator on campus has created important links between higher \neducation, economic development and the Black Hills region. \nAdditionally, under his visionary leadership, the School of Mines has \nconducted ``cutting edge'' defense research projects on pressing \ncurrent day issues such as detecting and defeating improvised explosive \ndevices and developing new technologies to inexpensively repair combat \nvehicles. He has been recognized by faculty, students and alumni as a \nstrong advocate for the institution.\n  His leadership and dedication to the School of Mines will be greatly \nmissed. It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Dr. Ruch on a \nsuccessful career in higher education and wish him the best on his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4483-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SQUIRE RUDOLPH BROEL\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the 90th birthday \nof Mr. Squire Rudolph Broel.\n  A native South Dakotan, Squire was born in Lesterville, SD, on May \n29, 1918, to Rudolph and May Broel. Upon graduation from Lesterville \nHigh School in 1936, Squire was employed in various jobs throughout the \narea including at the Stuelpnagals Chicken Hatchery. On June 24, 1940, \nSquire married another Lesterville native Evelyn Hladky and they would \neventually have three children: Larry Broel, Carolyn McDonald, and Jean \nLehn. During World War II Squire served in the Army Air Corps and for \nmost of his service was stationed in Mississippi.\n  Soon after his discharge and return to South Dakota, Squire and his \nfamily moved to Sturgis, SD, where he still lives today. It was in \nSturgis, that Squire became a fireman at the Fort Meade Veterans \nHospital in 1951. He worked there until his retirement in 1978, and \nduring that time he earned many awards, including the Veterans Hospital \nCivil Service Award for South Dakota in 1964.\n  After his retirement from Fort Meade, Squire continued to serve as a \nfireman for the Sturgis Volunteer Fire Department and in 1985 he was \nhonored by the Governor of South Dakota for his 50 years of fire \nservice with the proclamation of ``Squire Broel Day'' throughout the \nState. In 1994, Squire earned the South Dakota Outstanding Fire Service \nAward. During his career as a fireman Squire was also a member of the \nBlack Hills Safety Council, the South Dakota Fire Chiefs Association, \nand the Keep South Dakota Green Association.\n  Now officially retired from the Sturgis Volunteer Fire Department, \nSquire remains active with numerous volunteer activities and in various \ncivic organizations. He also enjoys hunting, watching baseball, \ntraveling, and spending time with his five grandchildren and seven \ngreat-grandchildren.\n  It gives me great pleasure to commemorate the 90th birthday of Squire \nBroel and to wish him continued health and happiness in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4483-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4483-4", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4483-5", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13303 OF MAY 22, 2003, WITH \n              RESPECT TO THE STABILIZATION OF IRAQ--PM 50\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend the National and Community Service Act of \n1990 to improve the educational awards provided for national service, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Cochran and others \nto introduce legislation that will build on one of the best service \nsuccess stories of the last quarter century: AmeriCorps. Fifteen years \nago, as he swore in the first class of AmeriCorps members, President \nBill Clinton said, ``When it is all said and done, it comes down to \nthree simple questions: What is right? What is wrong? And what are we \ngoing to do about it?''\n  Since that time, more than a half-million AmeriCorps members have \ntaken it upon themselves to try and answer those questions in \ncommunities across this country.\n  They have done so by serving in a variety of settings from senior \ncenters and veterans' hospitals to schools and afterschool programs. \nThey have helped clean up our neighborhoods and rebuilt our houses. \nThese members have sacrificed their time and energy to meet the \nfundamental needs of our nation.\n  Last year alone, 75,000 AmeriCorps members gave back to our \ncommunities, serving in over 4,000 schools, faith-based and community \norganizations, and nonprofits across the country. They also brought \nreinforcements--recruiting another 1.7 million community volunteers to \nwork alongside them. Because of AmeriCorps, our communities have been \nstrengthened, and our democracy fortified.\n  Unfortunately, as the hours AmeriCorps members have contributed to \nour communities have increased, the Segal AmeriCorps Education Award \ncreated to help members pay for their college tuition has remained flat \nat $4,725. Meanwhile, the average college tuition has skyrocketed. The \neducation award previously paid for two years of college, but currently \nit does not even cover the cost of a single year. I am introducing the \nAmeriCorps: Together Improving Our Nation Act, ACTION, in part, to \nupdate the education award to keep pace with 15 years of tuition \nincreases.\n  The ACTION Act will raise the education award to $6,185 and increase \nthe award annually to match the average tuition at a 4-year public \nuniversity.\n\n[[Page S4489]]\n\nThat figure, $6,185 is the average cost of tuition at a four-year \npublic university according to the College Board. The act will also \nmake the education award tax exempt to ensure that students are able to \nuse their entire award to advance their education.\n  In addition, to recognize service as a national priority, this \nlegislation promotes the position of Executive Director of the \nCorporation for National and Community Service to Cabinet status and \nreestablishes the Corporation for National and Community Service's \nauthority to partner with other Federal agencies. As partners of equal \nstatus, Federal Departments will be able to coordinate their priorities \nand have AmeriCorps members work to meet their needs.\n  For example, the Department of Education could use volunteers to help \nsolve the ``Dropout Crisis'' and the Environmental Protection Agency \ncould use volunteers to increase our energy efficiency.\n  As a former Peace Corps volunteer, I know that national service ought \nnot to simply be virtuous, but rather, a resource with which we can \ncarry out our most urgent national priorities, from tackling poverty to \nmaking our communities cleaner and more vibrant. We need to recognize \nservice as a national priority, and with passage of the ACTION Act, we \nwill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 3041. A bill to establish the Foreign Intelligence and Information \nCommission to assess needs and provide recommendations to improve \nforeign intelligence and information collection, analysis, and \nreporting and for other purposes; to the Select Committee on \nIntelligence.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with \nthe senior Senator from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, to establish an \nindependent commission to address long-standing, systemic problems in \nthe collection, reporting, and analysis of foreign intelligence as well \nas diplomatic reporting and open source information. First, as the DNI \nhas testified, we continue to direct ``disproportionate'' resources \ntoward current crises, rather than toward long-term strategic issues \nand emerging threats. Second, we don't have the geographic distribution \nof resources needed to anticipate threats around the world. The lack of \n``global reach'' has also been acknowledged by the Intelligence \nCommunity leadership. And third, we lack a comprehensive strategic \napproach to the collection of information by the entire U.S. \nGovernment, including not only the Intelligence Community, but also \nState Department and other Government officers who are based in our \nembassies.\n  To put it simply, the Government does not have a process for asking \nthe following questions: What do we need to know, not only today but in \nthe future? Who is best suited to get that information and where do \nthey need to be? Is our analysis up to the task? And how do we allocate \nresources, across agencies, so that these requirements are met with \nadequate funding? These big strategic questions are critical to our \nnational security, yet they don't get asked, much less answered. These \nproblems extend well beyond the authorities of the DNI and the \njurisdiction of any one congressional committee. That is why we need an \nindependent commission to finally address them comprehensively and to \nmake recommendations for the executive branch and for Congress.\n  There are concrete reasons why this is so important. Around the \nworld, including in Africa, South and Southeast Asia, there are current \nand potential terrorist safe havens. There is also the potential for \ninstability and the persistence of political, economic and social \nconditions that can result in a crisis that threatens our national \nsecurity. Do we need more clandestine collectors in these parts of the \nworld? Do we need more embassy political officers doing more diplomatic \nreporting? After all, information gleaned from conversations with \ngovernment officials, civil society and tribal and religious leaders \ncan be critical to understanding potential terrorist safe havens and \ncan often be obtained more effectively than through the IC. What about \nother U.S. Government officials based overseas, such as FBI officers? \nWhat mix of these personnel is appropriate? What does a U.S. Embassy in \none of these countries look like, from an interagency collection and \nreporting perspective? Are more consulates and out-of-embassy posts \npart of the solution? And how do we connect the requirements of our \nembassies overseas to Washington, where administration budget requests \nand congressional budgetary allocations and appropriations should \nreflect a broad, multi-year interagency collection strategy?\n  An independent commission will be able to answer these questions. It \nwill be able to look at the Intelligence Community, the State \nDepartment, and other departments and agencies to ensure that strategic \nand budgetary planning is not only consistent with national \nrequirements, but is part of a larger, interagency process. The \ncommission will consider the role of the National Security Council and \nthe OMB in this process. It will look at the problem from top to \nbottom, interviewing NSC officials in Washington and visiting country \nmissions overseas. This would not be a confrontational or accusatory \ninvestigation. It is an inquiry intended to produce concrete \nrecommendations to fix long-standing problems. Those recommendations \nwill be of enormous benefit to whoever the next president is. It will \nhelp Congress as it conducts oversight and considers the role of the \nIntelligence Community, the DNI, the State Department, and other \nagencies in the context of broader interagency strategies.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by a broad range of people, \nincluding Zbigniew Brzezinski, Donald Gregg, Carl Ford, Larry \nWilkerson, David Kay, Gayle Smith and Rand Beers. I am pleased that the \nIntelligence Committee approved the legislation earlier this month as \nan amendment to the fiscal year 2009 intelligence authorization bill. I \nwill continue working with Senator Hagel to ensure that this important \nlegislation is enacted.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the Feingold-Hagel bill establishes an \nindependent Foreign Intelligence and Information Commission, appointed \nby Congress, to review strategies for collection, analysis, and \nreporting of intelligence and diplomatic information from our outposts \naround the world. The Commission would have a 2-year lifespan.\n  We must ensure that the United States is prepared to face the \nchallenges of the 21st Century. Our intelligence agencies and \ndiplomatic outposts must provide policymakers with information that \nhelps anticipate threats before they loom large, and our efforts must \nnot be focused solely on the ``threat of the day.''\n  As observers and veterans of the intelligence community--including \nthe\n9/11 Commission--have noted, the U.S. Government and intelligence \ncommunity obviously have to focus on current threats, many times at the \nexpense of having the ``strategic depth'' to analyze and anticipate \npotential threats and surprises lurking over the horizon. The focus \nmainly on current reporting has been cited within the Intelligence \nCommunity as inhibiting its ability to forecast significant longer term \nproblems.\n  With the creation of the Director of National Intelligence, DNI, and \nthe National Counterterrorism Center, NCTC, Congress helped move the \nIntelligence Community in the right direction, but we need strategic \nintelligence not just on terrorism, but many other threats that our \nintelligence agencies and policymakers must anticipate.\n  This bi-partisan Commission would enhance--not supplant--the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence's oversight of intelligence.\n  ``Strategic depth'' in collection and analysis is an issue that cuts \nacross the oversight responsibilities of both the Senate's Intelligence \nand Foreign Relations Committees. This Commission would examine \ndiplomatic as well as intelligence reporting, which would help provide \nan in-depth analysis of issues that are not entirely within the scope \nof responsibilities of the DNI. The Commission would be able to probe \nthese areas in depth and would have two years to issue its final \nreport.\n  We have seen how Commission reports can be useful tools to both \nCongress and the Executive branch to highlight needed reforms. For \ninstance, the 2001 Carlucci Commission report on ``State Department \nReform'' proved to be a tremendous resource for Secretary Colin Powell \nas he developed an action program to revitalize the State Department \nand make needed reforms. Secretary Powell studied the findings and \nrecommendations of this and other panels. He met extensively with \nCarlucci and other members of various\n\n[[Page S4490]]\n\ncommissions, and relied on their detailed insights in formulating his \nreform efforts.\n  The Feingold-Hagel legislation's commission report would help the \nnext administration evaluate and improve the effectiveness of key \ninstruments underlying our national power. The Commission would provide \nrecommendations on how to improve collection strategy, analysis, \ninteragency information sharing, and language training.\n  A bipartisan group of respected intelligence and national security \nexperts have endorsed the Commission, including former National \nSecurity Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski; Donald Gregg, former Ambassador \nand National Security Advisor to Vice President George H. W. Bush, and \nLarry Wilkerson, former Chief of Staff to Secretary Colin Powell. \nEarlier this month, in a bipartisan vote, the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee endorsed the Feingold-Hagel legislation setting up this \ncommission.\n  This Commission would help Congress and the Executive to better \nposition our intelligence agencies and diplomats to provide the \ninformation the United States Government needs to anticipate future \nstrategic challenges, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. McCASKILL (for herself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 3043. A bill to improve Federal land management, resource \nconservation, environmental protection, and use of Federal real \nproperty, by requiring the Secretary of the Interior to develop a \nmultipurpose cadastre of Federal and real property and identifying \ninaccurate, duplicate, and out-of-date Federal land inventories, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, have you ever flown over the heartland \nof the United States and wondered how the Midwest and West got its \ndistinctive and remarkable checkerboard pattern?\n  The reason for that extraordinary system is a law enacted on this \ndate in 1785. On May 20, 1785, Congress enacted a bill that laid the \nfoundation for American land policy. The Land Ordinance of 1785 \nprovided that from a point of beginning in East Liverpool, Ohio, the \nnew Northwest Territory was to be systematically surveyed and the lands \nsubdivided into settlements and townships. Of the thirty-six sections \nof 640 acres in each township, the sixteenth was reserved ``for the \nmaintenance of public schools.'' Congress began an extraordinary \nprocess of inventorying the lands to the west, providing for settlement \nand homesteads, surveying and subdividing the lands, and providing land \nfor Revolutionary War soldiers, as payment in lieu of compensation to \nrelieve the new Republic of its war debts to those who fought for our \nfreedom.\n  But while these early Acts of Congress, beginning with the Land \nOrdinance of 1785, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, through the \nHomestead Act of 1862 and the more recent Federal Land Policy and \nManagement Act FLPMA in 1976, all contributed to the inventorying, \nsurveying, preservation, disposal and settlement of lands of the West, \nto this day the United States does not have a current, accurate \ninventory of the lands the Federal government owns.\n  The fact is, the Federal Government does not know what it owns, where \nit owns it, what condition it is in, what its characteristics are, or \nwhat its designated use should be. This is the third consecutive \nCongress in which Congress's watchdog agency, the Government \nAccountability Office placed `Managing Federal Real Property' in the \nHigh-Risk Series, a category describing those activities with the \nhighest risk of waste, fraud or abuse.\n  The GAO, GAO-03-122, found over 30 Federal agencies control hundreds \nof thousands of real property assets worldwide, including facilities \nand land. However, the portfolio is not well managed, many assets are \nno longer consistent with agency mission or needs, and many assets are \nin an alarming state of disrepair. Also, GAO, GAO-T-RCED-95-117, told \nCongress, ``The General Services Administration, GSA, publishes \nstatistics on the amount of land managed by each federal agency. \nHowever, we found this information was not current or reliable.''\n  To remedy the lack of a current accurate inventory of all Federal \nreal property, and the duplication and inefficiency of the many \nproperty databases the government does maintain, I am today introducing \nthe Federal Land Asset Inventory Reform, FLAIR, Act, along with my \ncolleague Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah. Our bill is a companion to H.R. \n5532, introduced in the House on a bipartisan basis by Representative \nKind of Wisconsin and Representative Cannon of Utah.\n  There is no reason for the Government to lack a current, accurate \ninventory of all the land it has been entrusted to manage for the \ncitizens of the United States. With the technology available, it should \nnot happen that then-Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton would \ntestify before the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee on March \n2, 2005 that ``The Department currently uses 26 different financial \nmanagement systems and over 100 different property systems. Employees \nmust enter procurement transactions multiple times in different systems \nso that the data are captured in real property inventories, financial \nsystems, and acquisition systems. This fractured approach is both \ncostly and burdensome to manage.''\n\n  It is time the U.S. Government invested in a methodology and \ntechnology to identify and inventory its land holdings. Such a system \ncan help enhance the Federal land management, resource conservation, \nenvironmental protection, and use of Federal real property. We should \nnot be creating multiple inventories when today's technology permits us \nto do it once and use it many times. Gathering information to solve \nnational problems should not require an Act of Congress, particularly \nwhen a few keystrokes on a computer will do the job.\n  Although the Bush administration took a step toward solving this \nproblem when President Bush issued Executive Order 13327 in 2004, the \nresulting GSA inventory is neither GIS-based nor includes public lands. \nUnfortunately, this means that more than 300 million acres are exempt \nfrom the inventory currently maintained by GSA.\n  Since 1980, the National Academy of Sciences has been calling for the \ndevelopment of a multipurpose cadastre, or land registry, in its \nreport, ``Need for a Multipurpose Cadastre.'' The report said, ``There \nis a critical need for a better land-information system in the United \nStates to improve land-conveyance procedures, furnish a basis for \nequitable taxation, and provide much- needed information for resource \nmanagement and environmental planning.'' In 2007, the Academy renewed \nthis effort and recommended the idea of the FLAIR Act, in its report, \n``National Land Parcel Data: A Vision for the Future.''\n  This Federal effort will also help State and local agencies verify \ntheir ongoing efforts to identify what each level of government owns, \nand permit the fair, efficient and equitable taxation of private \nproperty. This will enable government at all levels to find missing \nlands through a gap analysis that identifies properties on which taxes \nare not being collected due to the inefficiencies in our systems. For \nexample, when the State of Wyoming used a GIS to audit the mass \nappraisal process, it found that approximately 250,000 parcels were not \non the tax rolls.\n  Over the past decade, nearly 30 Governors and State Legislatures have \ncreated State land inventories. Let me give you a few examples of what \nsome States have found.\n  In California, an inventory discovered that in 1955, the State \npurchased a golf course in Oakland to make way for a highway. The road \nwas never built, and the State still owns the land, unbeknownst to any \nState agency.\n  In South Carolina, a State commission found the University of South \nCarolina, a State university, still owned Wedge Plantation, a 1,500 \nacre tract valued at $5 million, originally used for research of \ninsect-borne diseases, but now leased to a half-dozen hunters who pay \nno rent.\n  While serving as Missouri State Auditor, my office issued a report \nnoting that the Missouri Department of Transportation lacked accurate \nand reliable records of excess property and property being held for \nfuture projects. The best MoDOT could do was estimate\n\n[[Page S4491]]\n\nthe amount and value of the land they held.\n  The FLAIR Act addresses the twin problems of a lack of a single, \ninteroperable, current and accurate Federal land inventory, and the \nproliferation of inefficient, duplicative, costly, inaccurate and out-\nof-date inventories by authorizing the Department of the Interior to \ndevelop and manage a single multipurpose, uniform Federal GIS database \nto track and account for all Federal Real Property, as called for by \nGAO and recommended by the National Academy.\n  Waste and duplication can be avoided if the Government knew what \ninventories it had. The FLAIR Act also authorizes the Secretary of the \nInterior to conduct an ``inventory of inventories'' to identify all \ninventory databases, whether efficient or inefficient. The efficient \ndatabases will be merged into a single multipurpose cadastre while the \ninefficient databases are repealed, thus preventing waste and \nduplication from continuing. By integrating the efficient databases, \nredundancy can be identified and eliminated. Resources can be applied \nto gaps in data rather than duplicative data.\n  Once a multipurpose inventory is complete, the government can become \na better real property asset manager, and a responsible steward of its \nland holdings. This will result in more efficient land management, \nagain providing savings. That is what the FLAIR Act provides.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Hatch and myself in enacting \nthis good-government bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. Cardin, Mr. \n        Conrad, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. \n        Klobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mrs. \n        McCaskill, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. Schumer, \n        Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 3044.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Border Law Enforcement \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 152. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government of the \n     United States to adequately secure the Nation's borders and \n     prevent the flow of unauthorized aliens and illegal drugs \n     into the United States.\n\n[[Page S4501]]\n\n       (2) Despite the fact that the United States Border Patrol \n     apprehends over 1,000,000 people each year trying to \n     illegally enter the United States, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service, the net growth in the number \n     of unauthorized aliens has increased by approximately 500,000 \n     each year. The southwest border accounts for approximately 94 \n     percent of all migrant apprehensions each year. Currently, \n     there are an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the \n     United States.\n       (3) The border region is also a major corridor for the \n     shipment of drugs. According to the El Paso Intelligence \n     Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \n     markets of the United States enter the country through the \n     Southwest Border.\n       (4) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n     due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n     the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n     law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n     illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n     Southwest border counties.\n       (5) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n     declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n     enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n     activity along the Southwest border.\n       (6) While the Federal Government provides States and \n     localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n     detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n     Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border \n     are provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must \n     use their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n     smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n     and other border-related crimes.\n       (7) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n     Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Many of the local law \n     enforcement agencies located along the border are small, \n     rural departments charged with patrolling large areas of \n     land. Counties along the Southwest United States-Mexico \n     border are some of the poorest in the country and lack the \n     financial resources to cover the additional costs associated \n     with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-\n     related crimes.\n       (8) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n     enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n     challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n     international border and the lack of overall border security \n     in the region.\n\n     SEC. 153.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On September 11, 2001, terrorists attacked the United \n     States, and the brave members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States were called to the defense of the Nation.\n       (2) Service on active duty in the Armed Forces has been \n     especially arduous for the members of the Armed Forces since \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (3) The United States has a proud history of offering \n     educational assistance to millions of veterans, as \n     demonstrated by the many ``G.I. Bills'' enacted since World \n     War II. Educational assistance for veterans helps reduce the \n     costs of war, assist veterans in readjusting to civilian life \n     after wartime service, and boost the United States economy, \n     and has a positive effect on recruitment for the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (4) The current educational assistance program for veterans \n     is outmoded and designed for peacetime service in the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (5) The people of the United States greatly value military \n     service and recognize the difficult challenges involved in \n     readjusting to civilian life after wartime service in the \n     Armed Forces.\n       (6) It is in the national interest for the United States to \n     provide veterans who serve on active duty in the Armed Forces \n     after September 11, 2001, with enhanced educational \n     assistance benefits that are worthy of such service and are \n     commensurate with the educational assistance benefits \n     provided by a grateful Nation to veterans of World War II.\n\n     SEC. 4003.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Post-9/11 Veterans \n     Educational Assistance Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 4002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On September 11, 2001, terrorists attacked the United \n     States, and the brave members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States were called to the defense of the Nation.\n       (2) Service on active duty in the Armed Forces has been \n     especially arduous for the members of the Armed Forces since \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (3) The United States has a proud history of offering \n     educational assistance to millions of veterans, as \n     demonstrated by the many ``G.I. Bills'' enacted since World \n     War II. Educational assistance for veterans helps reduce the \n     costs of war, assist veterans in readjusting to civilian life \n     after wartime service, and boost the United States economy, \n     and has a positive effect on recruitment for the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (4) The current educational assistance program for veterans \n     is outmoded and designed for peacetime service in the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (5) The people of the United States greatly value military \n     service and recognize the difficult challenges involved in \n     readjusting to civilian life after wartime service in the \n     Armed Forces.\n       (6) It is in the national interest for the United States to \n     provide veterans who serve on active duty in the Armed Forces \n     after September 11, 2001, with enhanced educational \n     assistance benefits that are worthy of such service and are \n     commensurate with the educational assistance benefits \n     provided by a grateful Nation to veterans of World War II.\n\n     SEC. 4003.

I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be \ndischarged from the consideration of H.R. 2517 and the Senate proceed \nto its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2517) to amend the Missing Children's \n     Assistance Act to authorize appropriations, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, tomorrow, the country will commemorate \nMissing Children's Day. Ceremonies at the Department of Justice and \nelsewhere will remember our commitment to work together in locating and \nrecovering missing children. I am proud that today, Congress has also \nrealized its obligation to our Nation's children by passing the \nProtecting Our Children Comes First Act of 2007, which takes important \nsteps toward this goal.\n  For more than 5 months, one Senator has prevented this important \nlegislation from becoming law. This is regrettable. The authorization \nfor National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, and all \nthat it does to help children and families expires at the end of this \nfiscal year. This is a bill that passed the House by a vote of 408 to \n3. There were 95 cosponsors in the House, both Democrats and \nRepublicans. I introduced a Senate companion bill with Senator Hatch, \nSenator Landrieu, and Senator Shelby last summer. The Senator Judiciary \nCommittee considered and reported our Senate bill, S. 1829, last \nDecember. We have been trying to pass it in the Senate ever since. I am \nglad the objecting Senator has reconsidered his hold on this \nlegislation. The National Center will now have the security of being \nable to plan and to maintain their services and staff for the future.\n  It pains us all to see photo after photo of missing children from all \naround our country. As a father and grandfather, I can imagine that an \nabducted child is any parent's worst nightmare. Unfortunately, it is a \nnightmare that happens all too often. Indeed, the Justice Department \nestimates that 2,200 children are reported missing each day. There are \napproximately 114,600 attempted stranger abductions every year, with \n3,000 to 5,000 of those attempts succeeding. These families need the \nassistance of the American people and a helping hand from Congress.\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children spearheads \nnational efforts to locate and recover missing children and raises \npublic awareness about ways to prevent child abduction, molestation, \nand sexual exploitation. Further, NCMEC works to make our children \nsafer by acting as a national voice and advocate for those too young to \nvote or speak up for their own rights.\n  The national center's professionals have busy, stressful and \nimportant jobs. They have worked on more than 127,700 cases of missing \nand exploited children since the national center's 1984 founding, \nhelping to recover more than 110,200 children. The national center \nreports that it raised its recovery rate from 64 percent in the 1990s \nto 96 percent today. It has set up three nationwide tip lines: a toll \nfree, 24-hour telephone hotline to take reports about missing children \nand clues that might lead to their recovery; a national child \npornography tipline to handle calls from individuals reporting the \nsexual exploitation of children through the production and distribution \nof pornography; and a cybertipline to process online leads from \nindividuals reporting the sexual exploitation of children. The national \ncenter has taken the lead in circulating millions of photographs of \nmissing children, and it serves as a vital resource for the 17,000 law \nenforcement agencies throughout the Nation who are one the frontlines \nin the search for missing children and in the pursuit of adequate child \nprotection.\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children manages to do \nall of this good work with an annual DOJ grant, which is set to expire \nafter fiscal year 2008. It is important to act now to extend its \nauthorization so that it can continue to help keep children safe and \nfamilies intact around our Nation. We should continue to do everything \nwe can to protect our children and I thank my friends on both sides of \nthe aisle for joining me in this effort.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate, and any statements be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2517) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4549-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4549-S4554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KIDS ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about final passage \nof the KIDS Act, S. 431. This bill authorizes procedures for social \nnetworking Web sites to check whether a particular email address is \nregistered to a sex offender. The bill also includes provisions that \nwould make it an offense to use the Internet to lure a victim and then \nsexually assault her, that expand the jurisdictional predicates for the \nchild-porn possession offenses, and that make it an offense to \nknowingly access child pornography on the Internet with the intent to \nview child pornography.\n  Section 7 of the bill, which expands the jurisdictional predicates \nfor offenses relating to child pornography, is of particular interest \nto me. I offered this proposal as an amendment in the Judiciary \nCommittee after it was informally proposed to me by the Justice \nDepartment. The proposal addresses a problem highlighted by United \nStates v. Schaefer, 501 F.3d 1197, 10th Circuit 2007, which dismissed a \nconviction for receipt and possession of child pornography because the \ncourt found that proof that an image traveled over the Internet is not \nsufficient to prove that the image in question moved in interstate \ncommerce. I understand that this ruling has had a substantial impact on \nprosecutions pertaining to sexually abusive images of children, \nparticularly in the Tenth Circuit.\n  In Schaefer, the Tenth Circuit found that evidence that an image had \ntraveled through servers in another State could prove that the image \nmoved across State lines. Unfortunately, this conclusion provides \nlittle help for Federal prosecutions in the State of Colorado because \nthe largest Internet service provider in Colorado maintains all of it \nservers in that State. Therefore, in Colorado it is extremely difficult \nto get the kind of evidence required by the Tenth Circuit's decision.\n  It is an irony of the Internet that the more that it grows, the \nharder that it is to prove that an image of child pornography crossed \nState lines. As in Colorado, many Internet service providers are \nsetting up server farms across the United States, so it is harder to \nget the requisite evidence that the images moved through out-of-State \nservers. Additionally, with the advent of different ways of connecting \nto the Internet, such as wireless, broadband, and DSL, it can be harder \nto trace the route that an image took across the Internet. And with \ncertain Internet-based technologies, such as instant messaging and \npeer-to-peer file sharing, it can be impossible to find out to whom or \nfrom where a defendant sent or received an image.\n  The child pornography statutes were enacted, for the most part, \nbefore Internet and cell phone technology existed. At the time the \nstatutes were originally written, there were really only two ways to \ntransport this contraband: by mailing it or by physically carrying it \non one's person. The statutes were drafted accordingly. Now, however, \nbecause of technological developments, Federal laws pertaining to \nsexually abusive images of children simply do not reach all of the \ncrimes they could under the Constitution.\n  Section 7 of the KIDS Act adds the words ``affecting interstate or \nforeign commerce'' and ``using a facility or means of interstate or \nforeign commerce'' to the child pornography laws, thereby employing \nmaximum Federal power to proscribe child pornography. The primary \nadvantage of the ``facility or means'' language is that it accurately \nreflects how sexually abusive images of children are traded today, \nwhich is to say, over the Internet and phone lines. The Supreme Court \nand courts of appeals have long recognized that the Internet and phones \nare facilities of interstate commerce, regardless of whether the actual \ntransmission goes across State lines. Finally, the ``facility or \nmeans'' language tracks that in 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  1470 and 2422(b).\n\n[[Page S4552]]\n\nThus there is already a body of case law to guide the drafting of jury \ninstructions and statutory interpretation.\n  My second favorite provision in S. 431 is section 6, which makes it a \ncrime to knowingly access child pornography with the intent to view \nchild pornography. This proposal was brought to my attention by my \ncolleague Senator Vitter, who persuaded me to offer it as an amendment \nin the Judiciary Committee. Like section 7, section 6 adapts our laws \nto address a new obstacle to child-pornography prosecutions that was \ncreated by changes in technology and that is exemplified by a recent \ncourt of appeals decision. The Vitter staff also provided me with the \nfollowing Justice Department testimony, which explains the need for \nthis provision and is worth quoting in full. It is the testimony of \nLarry Rothenberg, a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Justice \nDepartment's Office of Legal Policy, before the House Judiciary \nCommittee on October 17 of last year:\n\n       18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  2252 and 2252A currently criminalize \n     various activities related to child pornography including \n     transportation, trafficking, and possession. Some courts have \n     narrowly interpreted (incorrectly, in our view) the \n     definition of possession so that a person would not have \n     violated the statute if he, for example, viewed images of \n     child pornography on his computer but did not save them onto \n     his disk drive. Even if, in his computer's ``temporary \n     Internet cache,'' we have a record of his viewing the images, \n     and thus proof that he accessed them on a website, under this \n     narrow interpretation, he would not be guilty of violating \n     the statute if he did not know that his temporary Internet \n     cache automatically saved the images on his computer.\n       Two recent cases demonstrate the need for these changes. In \n     United States v. Teal, No. 1:04-CR-00042-CCB-1 (D. Md., \n     motion to dismiss granted Aug. 13, 2004), the Maryland U.S. \n     Attorney's Office prosecuted Marvin Teal, a former \n     administrative law judge who had prior convictions for \n     sexually abusing children, for possession and attempted \n     possession of child pornography based on his viewing child \n     pornography at a public library in Baltimore, Maryland. \n     Library police officers saw child pornography on the computer \n     Teal was using, arrested him, and printed out the images that \n     could be seen on the computer screen. Because there was no \n     evidence that the defendant had himself downloaded or saved \nanything, the District Court dismissed the case. We chose not to \nappeal, given the state of the law and the facts of the case.\n\n  In United States v. Kuchinski, 469 F.3d 853 (9th Cir. 2006), the \nNinth Circuit vacated and remanded the sentence of an offender found \nwith between 15,120 and 19,000 separate images of child pornography on \nhis computer on the basis that he did not know that they were in his \nInternet cache. The court stated, ``There is no question that the child \npornography images were found on the computer's hard drive and that \nKuchinski possessed the computer itself. Also, there is no doubt that \nhe had accessed the web page that had those images somewhere upon it, \nwhether he actually saw the images or not. What is in question is \nwhether it makes a difference that, as far as this record shows, \nKuchinski had no knowledge of the images that were simply in the cache \nfiles. It does.'' Of course we acknowledge the Ninth Circuit's \nauthority to interpret the law this way. However, we think the court's \ndistinction should not make a difference under the law.\n  Our proposal [which is identical to Section 6 of the KIDS Act] would \ncorrect these anomalies while protecting unsuspecting persons who \nunintentionally access child pornography from prosecution. \nSpecifically, the bill would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2252(a)(4) and 18 \nU.S.C. Sec.  2252A(a)(5) to criminalize not only possession of child \npornography, but also ``knowingly accessing child pornography with the \nintent to view it.'' That is, a person would be liable to prosecution \nif he purposefully clicked on a link with the intent that when the link \nopened, he would view child pornography. It would therefore be a two-\nstep test that the prosecution would have to satisfy--first, that he \npurposefully (that is, not accidentally) clicked the link, and, second, \nhe did so with the intent that by clicking on the link child \npornography would appear on his computer screen. This test would not be \ndifficult to satisfy in the case of people who really did want to view \nchild pornography. Extrinsic evidence--such as the name of the link, \nwhich would probably have terms indicating that it displayed child \npornography, and payment for the images--would be used to prove the \nviolation. But in the case of an ``innocent viewer'' who accidentally \ncame across child pornography, the two-step proof would be his \nprotection.\n  I would also like to express my appreciation to the sponsors of this \nbill for their willingness to work with the Justice Department to \naddress technical concerns with the bill. It is particularly important \nthat the bill has been modified to minimize conflict with the Justice \nDepartment's forthcoming guidelines for implementation of SORNA, which \nserve many of the same ends as the bill. Earlier versions of the KIDS \nAct used terminology inconsistent with that used in SORNA, \nunnecessarily required that sex offenders appear in person to report \ntheir e-mail addresses, did not clearly provide the Attorney General \nwith discretion to screen out ill-intentioned users of the checking \nsystem, limited access to the checking system to only commercial \nwebsites, and unnecessarily restricted to only the SORNA database the \nsources on which the checking system may rely for Internet addresses. I \nam pleased to report that all of these problems will be corrected in \nthe floor amendment for the bill. While these issues may seem like \ntechnicalities, had they not been addressed they would have degraded \nthe utility of the checking system.\n  The committee-reported bill also appeared to limit existing programs \nfor helping law enforcement and parents to determine whether the \nindividual using a particular address is a sex offender. The final \nSenate bill includes a rule of construction that makes clear that the \nbill does not limit the Attorney General's preexisting authority to \nallow such searches. The final bill also includes a compromise on how \nthe Attorney General and social networking Web sites may disseminate \nsex-offender e-mail addresses. The compromise is somewhat complicated \nand merits explanation. The bill still does bar the wholesale \ndistribution to the general public of sex offenders' e-mail information \ncontained in the system, and further requires that the AG limit how the \nsocial networking sites disseminate the information about individual \noffenders that such sites receive. I understand that some Senators \nexpressed concern that such bulk distribution of offenders' e-mail \naddresses would make it possible for malicious individuals to identify \nindividual offenders' e-mail addresses and use those addresses to \nharass an offender. Preventing the publication of lists of offenders' \ne-mail addresses also will prevent offenders from using the checking \nsystem to identify each other's e-mail addresses and communicate with \neach other. We should not allow the system's information about sex \noffenders' e-mail addresses to be used in this way. The bill creates a \ntwo-tiered limit on distribution of these e-mail addresses in proposed \nSORNA section 121(d)(4)(A) and (B). Subparagraph (A) bars bulk \ndistribution of offenders' addresses contained in the system to the \npublic at large, and subparagraph (B) further requires the AG to limit \nhow social networking sites disseminate the information that they \nreceive. Subparagraph (A) bars both the AG and the participating \nsocial-networking sites from disseminating lists of sex-offender e-mail \ninformation that are generated through the operation of the checking \nsystem unless the information is only given to a limited set of sources \nwith a particular need for the information, as opposed to the public at \nlarge. It does not limit dissemination of information generated from \nother sources, but should substantially prevent the creation of bulk \npublic lists of sex-offender e-mail information as a result of the \noperation of the checking system. Subparagraph (B) complements this \nprovision by requiring the AG to regulate how participating social \nnetworking sites use the information that they receive. It is likely \nthat some social-networking sites will come into possession of large \namounts of sex-offender e-mail information as a result of their \nparticipation in this system. It is thus important that the AG see to \nit that those sites do not liberally disseminate such information in a \nway that would allow others to create bulk public lists of sex \noffenders' e-mail information. Although subparagraph (B) contains no \nspecific mandate to the AG, I trust that he will apply this provision \nwith this purpose in mind.\n\n[[Page S4553]]\n\n  In addition, I would like to address two urgently-needed reforms to \nour Nation's child pornography laws that are not included in this bill, \nbut that I hope to amend onto future legislation. We need tougher, \nmandatory penalties for possession of child pornography, and Congress \nneeds to act to stiffen and expand penalties for electronic-\ncommunication service providers who fail to report the presence of \nchild pornography on their systems. The case for both of these \nprovisions is made in the Rothenberg testimony noted above, and I quote \nit in full:\n\n       [W]e urge Congress to establish a mandatory minimum \n     sentence for possession of child pornography. This is crucial \n     because too many people believe that child pornography is \n     ``just pictures'' and is not ``a big deal.'' That is wrong. \n     Each pornographic image of a child is the visual record of \n     the sexual exploitation of that child. It is not just a \n     picture. Every time that image is viewed, the child is \n     violated once again. Moreover, the demand for such images is \n     what fuels the physical violation of the children in these \n     images in the first place. Possession of child pornography is \n     victimization of a child and should be punished accordingly.\n       Unfortunately, since the Federal Sentencing Guidelines \n     became advisory under the Supreme Court's decision in United \n     States v. Booker the number of downward departures by judges \n     in federal child pornography possession cases has increased. \n     After enactment of the PROTECT Act of 2003, which restricted \n     in various ways the authority of courts to make non-\n     government-sponsored downward departures in sentences, the \n     rate of non-government-sponsored below-range sentences for \n     all offense types was about 5 percent. See United States \n     Sentencing Commission, Final Report on the Impact of United \n     States v. Booker on Federal Sentencing (March 2006), at p. \n     54, available at http://www.ussc.gov/booker_report/\nBooker_Report\n.pdf. Following Booker, that rate jumped up to 12.5 percent. \n     Id. at p. 47. For child pornography possession offenses, \n     however, the rate of non-government-sponsored below-range \n     sentences leapt to 26.3 percent, more than twice the average \n     rate. Id. at p. 122. By way of comparison, for drug \n     trafficking and firearms violations, the rate has increased \n     to 12.8 percent and 15.2 percent, respectively, much closer \n     to the average. Id. at table on page D-5.\n       The increase in non-government-sponsored, below-range \n     sentences for possession offenses after Booker demonstrates \n     the need for a mandatory minimum sentence for possession \n     offenses. Establishing a two-year minimum sentence will be a \n     warning to potential consumers of child pornography, prevent \n     unwarranted downward departures, and forcefully express our \n     revulsion at this type of material. This change is contained \n     in section 201 of the Department's Violent Crime and Anti-\n     Terrorism Act of 2007 and is included as section 201 of H.R. \n     3156, the Violent Crime Control Act of 2007.\n       Our second proposal would amend an existing law that \n     requires certain providers of electronic communications \n     services to report violations of the child pornography laws. \n     Currently the law provides that a provider who knowingly and \n     willfully fails to report the presence of child pornography \n     images on its computer servers shall be subject to a criminal \n     fine of up to $50,000 for the initial failure to report and \n     $100,000 for each subsequent failure to report. Prosecutors \n     and law enforcement sources report that this criminal \n     provision has been virtually impossible to enforce because of \n     the particular mens rea requirement and the low amount of the \n     potential penalty. These impediments severely hinder the \n     needed crackdown on the presence of child pornography on the \n     Internet.\n       Our legislation would triple the criminal fines available \n     for knowing and willful failures to report, making the \n     available fines $150,000 for the initial violation and \n     $300,000 for each subsequent violation.\n       Even more importantly, the legislation would add civil \n     fines for negligent failure to report a child pornography \n     offense. The civil penalty is set at $50,000 for the initial \n     violation and $100,000 for each subsequent violation. The \n     Federal Communications Commission would be provided with the \n     authority to levy the civil fines under this section and to \n     promulgate the necessary regulations, in consultation with \n     the Attorney General, for imposing the fines and for \n     providing an appropriate administrative review process.\n       These proposals would make it much more likely that service \n     providers will exercise sound practices for weeding out child \n     pornography. The images are out there, too often on \n     commercial computer servers, and law enforcement needs to \n     know about them to investigate and to prosecute the sexual \n     predators who consume them. This amendment is contained in \n     section 202 of the Department's Violent Crime and Anti-\n     Terrorism Act of 2007 and in section 202 of H.R. 3156.\n\n  Finally, I would like to thank Preet Bharara and Lee Dunn, staffers \nto Senators Schumer and McCain, respectively, who have worked \ntirelessly to see this bill through the Senate. S. 431 is a good bill, \nand I hope to see it enacted into law.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent a Schumer amendment which is at the \ndesk be agreed to, the committee amendments, as amended, be agreed to, \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, \nand any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 79\n\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE began as a civil and human rights \n     organization in 1968 in the wake of the devastating Detroit \n     riots, and was cofounded by the late Father William T. \n     Cunningham, a Roman Catholic priest, and Eleanor M. Josaitis, \n     a suburban housewife, who were inspired by the work of Dr. \n     Martin Luther King, Jr.;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE is committed to bringing together \n     people of all races, faiths, and economic backgrounds to \n     overcome injustice and build racial harmony, and it has grown \n     into one of the largest nonprofit organizations in Michigan;\n       Whereas the Focus: HOPE mission statement reads, \n     ``Recognizing the dignity and beauty of every person, we \n     pledge intelligent and practical action to overcome racism, \n     poverty and injustice.

of Focus: HOPE's early efforts was to support \n     African-American and female employees in a seminal class \n     action suit against the American Automobile Association \n     (AAA), resulting in groundbreaking affirmative action \n     commitments made by AAA;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE helped to conceive and develop the \n     Department of Agriculture's\n\n[[Page S4556]]\n\n     Commodity

Boulevard, \n     creating pocket parks, and rehabilitating homes in the \n     surrounding areas;\n       Whereas, since 1981, Focus: HOPE's Machinist Training \n     Institute has been training individuals from Detroit and \n     surrounding areas in careers in advanced manufacturing and \n     precision machining and has produced nearly 2,300 certified \n     graduates, providing an opportunity for minority youth, \n     women, and others who are often underrepresented in such \n     careers to gain access to the financial mainstream and learn \n     in-demand skills;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has recognized that manufacturing and \n     information technologies are key to the economic growth and \n     security of Michigan and the United States, and is committed \n     to designing programs to encourage the participation of \n     underrepresented urban individuals in those critical sectors;\n       Whereas, in 1982, Focus: HOPE initiated a for-profit \n     subsidiary for community economic development purposes and is \n     now designated with Federal HUBZone status (as defined in \n     section 3(p) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(p));\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE created Fast Track, a pioneering skill-\n     enhancing program designed to help individuals improve their \n     reading and math competencies by a minimum of 2 grade levels \n     in 4 to 7 weeks;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE's training and education programs have \n     moved more than 9,600 individuals out into the workforce \n     since the inception of those programs and have job placement \n     rates significantly above the national average;\n       Whereas, in 1987, Focus: HOPE reclaimed and renovated an \n     abandoned building and opened it as the Focus: HOPE Center \n     for Children, which now has served nearly 6,000 children of \n     colleagues, students, and neighbors with quality child care, \n     including latchkey, summer camp, early childhood education, \n     and other educational services;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE, through an unprecedented cooperative \n     agreement between the Departments of Defense, Commerce, \n     Education, and Labor, established a national demonstration \n     project, the Center for Advanced Technologies, which \n     integrates hands-on manufacturing training and academic \n     learning and educates advanced manufacturing engineers and \n     technologists at internationally competitive levels;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE partnered with 5 universities and 6 \n     industry partners, formerly known as the Greenfield \n     Coalition, to design a unique 21st century curriculum that \n     resulted in students receiving associate's degrees in \n     manufacturing technologies from Lawrence Technological \n     University, or bachelor's degrees in engineering technology \n     or manufacturing engineering from Wayne State University or \n     the University of Detroit Mercy, respectively;\n       Whereas, due to the unique educational pedagogy at Focus: \n     HOPE's Center for Advanced Technologies, the starting salary \n     of its graduates is higher than the national average of \n     graduates with the same degree from other universities;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has made outstanding contributions in \n     increasing diversity within the traditionally homogenous \n     science, math, engineering, and technology fields, 95 percent \n     of currently enrolled degree candidates are African-American, \n     and the Center for Advanced Technologies is one of the top \n     programs in the United States for graduating minorities with \n     bachelor's degrees in manufacturing engineering;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE's unique partnership with the \n     Department of Defense has resulted in several research and \n     development projects, including a nationally recognized \n     demonstration project, the Mobile Parts Hospital, whose Rapid \n     Manufacturing System has been deployed to Kuwait in support \n     of the Armed Forces' operations in Afghanistan, Kuwait, and \n     Iraq;\n       Whereas, in 1995, Focus: HOPE began a community arts \n     program to present multicultural arts programming and gallery \n     exhibitions designated to educate and encourage area \n     residents, while fostering integration in a culturally \n     diverse metropolitan community, and more than 70,000 people \n     have viewed sponsored exhibits or participated in the \n     program;\n       Whereas, in 1999, Focus: HOPE established an Informational \n     Technologies Center to provide Detroit students with \n     industry-certified training programs in network \n     administration, network installation, and desktop and server \n     administration, and has graduated nearly 800 students, and \n     initiated, in collaboration with industry and academia, the \n     design of a new bachelor's degree program to educate \n     information management systems engineers;\n       Whereas, in 2006, the State of Michigan designated Focus: \n     HOPE's campus and the surrounding community a ``Cool Cities'' \n     neighborhood;\n       Whereas the Secretary of Labor presented Focus: HOPE with \n     an Exemplary Public Interest Contribution Award in \n     recognition of its success in opening employment \n     opportunities for minorities and women;\n       Whereas the Village of Oakman Manor, a 55-unit senior \n     citizen apartment building sponsored by the Presbyterian \n     Village of Michigan in collaboration with Focus: HOPE, opened \n     in 2006 near the Focus: HOPE campus as the first new \n     construction in the area in more than 50 years;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE's initiatives and programs have been \n     nationally recognized for excellence and leadership by such \n     entities as the Government Accountability Office, the \n     Department of Labor, the International Standards \n     Organization, the National Science Foundation, the Cisco \n     Networking Academy Program, Fortune magazine, Forbes \n     magazine, and the Aspen Institute;\n       Whereas former Presidents George H.W. Bush and William \n     Jefferson Clinton have visited Focus: HOPE's campus;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE's cofounder Eleanor M. Josaitis \n     received honorary degrees from 13 outstanding universities \n     and colleges, was named one of the 100 Most Influential Women \n     in 2002 by Crain's Detroit Business, was inducted into the \n     Michigan Women's Hall of Fame, received the Detroit NAACP \n     Presidential Award, the Arab American Institute Foundation's \n     Kahlil Gibran Spirit of Humanity Award, the Michigan Chamber \n     of Commerce Award for Distinguished Service and Leadership, \n     and the Dr. Charles H. Wright Award for Excellence in \n     Community Activism, the Caring Institute's National Caring \n     Award, and the Clara Barton Ambassador Award from the \n     American Red Cross, as well as many other awards;\n       Whereas, through generous partnerships with and the support \n     of individuals from all walks of life, the Federal, State, \n     and local governments, and foundations and corporations \n     across the United States, the vision of Focus: HOPE will \n     continue to grow and inspire;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has been fortunate enough to have an \n     active board of directors and advisory board from the most \n     senior levels of corporations and public entities in the \n     United States and has benefitted from thousands of volunteers \n     and supporters;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE has been a tremendous force for good in \n     the city of Detroit, the State of Michigan, and in the United \n     States for the past 40 years;\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE continues to strive to eliminate \n     racism, poverty, and injustice through the use of passion, \n     persistence, and partnerships, and continues to seek \n     improvements in its quality of service and program \n     operations; and\n       Whereas Focus: HOPE and its colleagues will continue to \n     identify ways in which it can lead Detroit, the State of \n     Michigan, and the United States into the future with creative \n     urban leadership initiatives: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) congratulates and salutes Focus: HOPE for its \n     remarkable commitment and contributions to Detroit, the State \n     of Michigan, and the United States; and\n       (2) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to Focus: HOPE for \n     appropriate display.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/20/senate-section/article/S4556-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 3036 AND S. 3044\n\n  Mr. REID.
