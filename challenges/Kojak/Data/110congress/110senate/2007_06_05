Madam President, a visitor to the rodeo in Cheyenne, \nWY, just last summer would have seen a strong, confident, 73-year-old \nman holding the reins under a cowboy hat riding past the grandstand \nwith a smile. A few weeks earlier, visitors to rustic Cody, WY, would \nhave seen the same tough cowboy riding down Sheridan Avenue in the Cody \nStampede Parade. Just a few days ago, a tourist here in Washington, \ngetting an early start on the monuments, could have seen Craig Lyle \nThomas racing off 395 near the 14th Street Bridge in another kind of \nMustang on his way to the Capitol for a hard day's work.\n  In recent years, Craig Thomas led an effort here in the Senate to \nhonor the deeds and the spirit of the American cowboy, and his very \nfull American life came to a sad end last night. We, his friends and \ncolleagues, remember him as the modern-day embodiment of the cowboy \nideals he celebrated and loved.\n  He was raised on a ranch just outside Cody, the rodeo capital of the \nworld, in the Big Horn Basin, a windy town in the northwest corner of \nthe Cowboy State. He grew up in the shadow of Heart Mountain to the \nnorth and Carter Mountain to the south and under the memory of Cody's \nfounder, William Frederick Cody, known to history and to schoolchildren \nfrom Butte to Boston as Buffalo Bill.\n  He was a humble man with an adventurous spirit from a lonely corner \nof the country who put his family, his country, and his State above all \nelse. He served as a marine from 1955 to 1959, retiring as a captain. \nHe married a woman with a generous heart. My wife Elaine is a good \nfriend of Susan's, and one of the joys of Elaine's time in the last few \nyears was being invited out to Susan's school to speak to her students.\n  Craig was the proud father of four children--Lexie, Patrick, Gregg, \nand Peter--who today mourn their father's death.\n  Craig was as much at home on horseback, roping, and ranching, as he \nwas in a committee hearing room. How many times he must have daydreamed \nabout being back home, out of a suit, with a rope in his hand and a \nsteer in his sights.\n  Craig had served in public office 22 years when he fell ill at a \nchurch service with Susan last November in Casper. Shortly after that, \nthe people of Wyoming elected him to his third term in the Senate, with \n70 percent of the vote. A born fighter, Craig's doctors said he would \nbe back here in January. He beat their predictions by a month. He was \nhere in December. Craig suffered quietly over the last half year, as \nall of us hoped for the best. It wasn't to be.\n  Every year, Craig pressed for a day that would memorialize the iconic \nstatus of the cowboy in American history, a day that honored their \ncourage, hard work, honesty, and grit. I can think of no better way of \nhonoring that spirit than by honoring this man who embodied it to the \nfullest. By his devotion\n\n[[Page S7018]]\n\nto family, country, constituents, and friends, Craig Lyle Thomas showed \nus what it means to be an American. He embodied the best ideals of a \nWyoming cowboy and made the Senate and those who had the privilege of \nknowing him far better for it.\n  We mourn with Susan, Craig's children, and Craig's staff here in the \nSenate. We honor them today, too, for their model of professionalism \nand caring concern they have shown over the last difficult months. We \nwill miss Craig terribly, his calm toughness, his drive, and his cowboy \nspirit, but we are consoled by the thought that he will ride again, \nrestored in body and flashing a smile as he goes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/05/senate-section/article/S7018-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I appreciate the remarks of my \ndistinguished counterpart. I think his words convey how we feel about \nCraig Thomas.\n  Madam President, we hear it often said that this is a Senate family, \nand it is times such as these when we do realize we are a family, a \nvery small family of just 100--99 today.\n  I can remember early last December I called and talked to Craig in \nthe hospital, and he said: I am getting better. And he was. He did get \nbetter. It just didn't last, and we all feel so bad about that.\n  I remember Craig Thomas for his legislative efforts. Wyoming, like \nNevada, is a public land State. Wyoming has a lot of public land issues \ndealing with Federal agencies. I see his colleague here, Mike Enzi, and \nI can remember working with them on an issue which, to most people, \nseemed like not much, but to the two Senators from Wyoming and to the \nSenator from Nevada, it meant a lot. We were dealing with a place \ncalled Martin's Cove, and even Senators from Utah were called in to see \nif we could resolve this, and we were able to resolve it eventually. \nBut Craig was really tough when it came to public lands issues.\n  I can remember, as can Lula, whom we all know, Craig Thomas' \npersistence on a piece of legislation on an issue dealing with the \npotash of a mining company in Wyoming. He would ask us if we had been \nable to get it cleared. If he asked us once, he asked us 50 times, and \nwe eventually got it cleared. I worked hard on this side for that for a \ncouple of reasons: First, it was the right thing to do, and second, \nCraig wanted it so badly. So we were able to work that out.\n  I will miss Craig Thomas. Craig Thomas was the kind of person with \nwhom I liked to deal. He told you how he felt--he wanted this done; he \ndidn't want that done. I recognized that he was very proud of being a \nSenator.\n  I would have to say, however, that he was just as proud of being a \nmarine. His Marine Corps service was certainly commendable. He was in \nthe Marine Corps in the late 1950s, 1955 to 1959. He went in as a \nprivate and came out as a captain. He was a graduate of the University \nof Wyoming with a degree in agriculture, and that is why he was one of \nthe leading experts in the Senate--in the Congress, I should say--on \nagriculture and, of course, issues affecting rural communities.\n  Madam President, I will ask for unanimous consent in just a few \nminutes to do away with the votes we had scheduled this morning and \nreschedule them for later this afternoon so people have the opportunity \nto come and speak about Craig. And those who aren't able to come, there \nwill be a time set aside where we will recognize the service Craig \nThomas rendered to the State of Wyoming and to the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/05/senate-section/article/S7018-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, when my plane touched down last night, I \nreceived an e-mail that told of the fate of a great man. It was a \ntremendous surprise to me. I just completed a week in Wyoming of \nexplaining to people that he even timed his chemotherapy so he didn't \nhave to miss votes, and what a tough and strong man he was.\n  Craig Thomas was a marine at heart, but he was a cowboy in his soul. \nHe was quiet, he was focused, he was independent, he was hard-working. \nHe loved the Senate and he loved the Marines and he loved his horses. \nThe flags have been lowered, and there is a great deal of sadness in \nour hearts today as we mourn his loss and celebrate his life. I have \nhad a lot of thoughts, but I haven't had a chance to put them together. \nThey come gushing back, together with a lot of tears.\n  For those of us from Wyoming, Craig Thomas was more than just our \nSenator. He was our voice in the Senate, and he was never one to back \noff from a fight, especially when he was battling for two things most \ndear: what was best for Wyoming and what was best for America.\n  Craig had long Wyoming roots, and he was very proud of them. He grew \nup in Cody and became friends with Al Simpson. Later on the two of them \nwould serve together in the Senate. After he graduated from the \nUniversity of Wyoming, he immediately began his service to the country \nhe loved. He joined the Marine Corps. I am convinced that experience \nhelped to shape his character and molded his destiny. I think his \nsteely resolve and firm will took shape during those days that helped \nguide him and prepare him for the battles that would come later in his \npolitical life.\n  When Craig's service in the Marine Corps was through, he began what \nwas to be his life's work, which was serving the people of Wyoming to \nensure their best interests were taken care of and their needs were \naddressed.\n  His first efforts for Wyoming brought him to the Wyoming Farm Bureau \nand the Wyoming Rural Electric Association.\n  He was proud of his service with both of these organizations. It kept \nhim actively involved in issues that meant a great deal to him and, \nmore importantly, it kept him in touch with the people of Wyoming and \ntheir day-to-day problems. It also set him on the road to doing \nanything and everything he could to make life easier for his fellow \ncitizens in Wyoming.\n  I remember the days we served together in the Wyoming House. I was a \nmayor and had municipal electrical experience. He was with the rural \nelectric association. We worked a lot of electrical bills together at \nthat time. We\n\n[[Page S7019]]\n\ncould bring in both perspectives, find the middle ground, and make sure \nall of the people, rural and urban--I use the term ``urban'' for \nWyoming rather loosely, but urban--would be able to have low-cost and \nconsistent electricity.\n  Nobody knew energy or electricity better than Craig. That led him to \nrun for the Wyoming House. Dick Cheney was appointed Secretary of \nDefense, and Craig ran for it and won his seat. It was not an easy \nvictory, but it showed what a fighter and battler he was as he took on \nthat challenge, which was done in a relatively short period of time. \nThe executive committee just has a few days to select candidates, and \nthen there is a very short time for an election for the position in the \nWyoming House. He used his usual toughness, went around the State, \ntalked to everybody, and won that election.\n  Incidentally, the person he ran against in the primary, Tom \nSansonetti, became his chief of staff, which shows how people get along \nin Wyoming.\n  To no one's surprise, Craig focused on Wyoming issues in the House \nand he was reelected. Then when Malcolm Wallop decided to retire, Craig \nwas such a popular choice he didn't have any opposition in the primary. \nHe did face another battle in the general election, but once again his \nfighting spirit prevailed and he found a way to win. Interestingly \nenough, the person he defeated in the general election was a very \npopular Governor of Wyoming who was just ending his term. That Governor \nwas later appointed Ambassador to Ireland by President Clinton. To \nCraig Thomas's credit, the hearing was scheduled for that \nambassadorship before the papers ever got to the Capitol. Ambassador \nSullivan did a fantastic job in Ireland.\n  He won the Senate seat, and 2 years later I ran for the Senate and \nserve. He is one of the few Wyoming residents who ever served both in \nthe House and in the Senate. It has not been a tradition in Wyoming to \nmove from the House to the Senate. I was elected and then got a chance \nto work with him again. He was a remarkable man of vision on how to \nmake Wyoming and our country better places to live. He spent a good \ndeal of his time traveling Wyoming. He was one of the most ardent \ntravelers we have ever had in the Senate, going back virtually every \nweekend, traveling to a different part of the State, talking to people \nand trying to get their vision for the future.\n  One of his efforts on that was called Vision 2020. He challenged the \npeople of Wyoming. He stretched the people's imagination on what our \nState ought to be like in the year 2020. That was in 1998, but we are \ngetting a lot closer to 2020, and I think the State is moving toward \nthe vision that he predicted at that time. It was a goal he cherished \nand fought for. Many of the things he envisioned, or the people of \nWyoming envisioned, have been achieved through his efforts on the \nSenate floor.\n  Craig Thomas will long be remembered as one of Wyoming's toughest and \nfiercest advocates. Craig knew that much of our work gets done in \ncommittees, so he pursued those committees that would help him fight \nfor Wyoming in the Senate. He served on the critical Finance Committee. \nHe was a staunch fiscal conservative, and he believed very strongly \nthat people in Wyoming and across the Nation know better how to spend \ntheir hard-earned money than does the Federal Government. He used his \nposition on the committee to lighten the tax burden and to make our Tax \nCode more fair.\n  He was the ranking member on the Indian Affairs Committee. He served \nas chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee where he was a tireless \nadvocate for our park system. I think he visited most of the parks. \nEarlier, when our Republican leader was talking about horseback, it was \neven possible sometimes to see him with the park policemen on horseback \ntaking a look at the parks of the Capitol.\n  I would mention also that usually when you saw him on horseback you \nalso saw his wife Susan on horseback. She was a tireless traveler and \nan outstanding campaigner and another person who searches for the \nvisions of Wyoming. In parades, they always rode horses. They had \nspecial saddle blankets that helped to say who they were--as if people \nin Wyoming wouldn't know who they were. I would mention that she was \nthrown from a horse a couple of times, too. Bands and horses don't \nalways go well in hand. But, as Craig always said, she was the real \ncampaigner in the family. She actually liked it. She does a marvelous \njob for our State, as well as did Craig.\n\n  Craig was very active on all of the agricultural issues and \ninternational trade, particularly country-of-origin labeling. He \nsupported our cattlemen with grazing rights and responsible \nenvironmental quality incentive programs for runoff issues. He has \nworked tirelessly to get changes in the Endangered Species Act. He \nrealized that was a national program with national goals and it should \nnot punish individuals or counties or even the States, and that there \nought to be responsibility at the Federal level.\n  With energy, he was the lead sponsor of our soda ash royalty relief \nbill. He was the lead sponsor on the recreational fee demonstration \nprogram that allowed the national parks to keep a higher percentage of \nthe receipts that were received on public lands where they were \ncollected, and he specifically made efforts to include section 413 of \nthe Energy Policy Act, which authorizes Federal cost-share for the \nbuilding of a coal gasification project above 4,000 feet. That would \nhelp get a clean coal plant built in Wyoming, which would prove the \ntechnology with Wyoming coal at high altitude. We have huge resources \nof coal. We ship over one-third of the Nation's coal--over 1 million \ntons a day.\n  The reason we ship so much coal is because it is very low sulfur. He \nwas providing a mechanism to be able to have some assurance that coal \ngasification of this clean coal would be included in projects that we \ndid in the United States. It would help to prove the technology at high \naltitude and show its viability and would make a difference for all the \nUnited States in all their energy in the future.\n  He was also instrumental in writing the electricity title of EPAct. \nRecently, his efforts to get a coal-to-liquids section of whatever \nEnergy bill we will be debating, although unsuccessful thus far, \nadvanced the debate to the furthest point it had moved.\n  During the last FAA reauthorization, Craig was very instrumental in \nradar upgrades for the Jackson airport, which was imperative for the \ngrowth of the city and airport, especially related to tourism. I think \nJackson is the only city in Wyoming that has long distance direct \nflights. Most of them come through Salt Lake or Denver or Minneapolis. \nBut Jackson actually has flights that come from Houston and Atlanta \ndirect.\n  He also did a lot for Wyoming with two big transportation \nauthorization bills to ensure that the large land area, low-population \nStates, received a fair amount of highway funding. As I mentioned, on \nfiscal issues he was a staunch conservative who believed the people \nknew how to spend their money better than the Federal Government.\n  A few months ago, Craig shared his medical situation with us. He was \nin for another difficult fight, but he was used to them. He has been a \nbattler all his life. He took the fierce determination that he learned \nas a marine and brought it to this latest battle against leukemia. \nUnfortunately, it was a battle this great fighter was not to win.\n  Although that last battle of his life was lost, there were so many \nvictories in his life that we will long remember. Craig died as he \nlived, with his spurs on, fighting for Wyoming to the very end. I am \nsure we all have our favorite instant replay memories of Craig and his \nunique style.\n  I have always believed you can get a lot done if you don't care who \ngets the credit. That was Craig--never one to seek the limelight or to \ndraw attention to himself. He was the one working in committee to \nassure that the voices of the Wyoming people and America were heard and \nheard clearly.\n  For me, I will always remember Craig's spirit, for his spirit in life \nwas a great illustration of the spirit of Wyoming. His life became a \nliving portrait of the American West. He saw the world from the saddle \nof his horse and from under the brim of his cowboy hat. He was proud of \nWyoming and Wyoming was proud to be represented by him.\n  Craig was my senior Senator. He was my confidant and mentor. But most \nof\n\n[[Page S7020]]\n\nall, he was a very good friend. Diana and I will always feel \nappreciation for the fact that Craig and Susan made us part of their \nfamily. Our prayers are with Susan and their family during these \ndifficult times.\n  I will miss him. But because he was such a special presence in my \nlife and the lives of so many others, I have a long list of instant \nreplay memories I will always cherish of him: the times we were out on \nthe campaign trail, the legislation we worked on together and, more \nimportantly, the impact he had on my life personally, as he had on so \nmany others.\n  Wyoming is a different place today because of this great loss of \nours. There is great sadness in the State and also great joy as we \ncelebrate the life of one of our special citizens. He was with us for \nall too short a time, but he will never be forgotten.\n  I received a book called ``give me Mountains for my Horses,'' by Tom \nReed. But what I always ask for is that they give us men to match our \nmountains and our horses--and that would be Craig.\n  I want to share just a little piece of this because I know that Craig \nis already riding in a far better place. It says:\n\n       There is a taste to this place, this time. Nothing is \n     behind you. Everything is ahead. But you don't really think \n     about what is ahead, you only think of now, for this \n     partnership you have entered into is one of the moment, of \n     now. Now has you in a saddle on a bay horse, heading up a \n     trail of pines and spruce and mountain, of stream and meadow.\n       Behind you, connected by only your hand and a lead rope but \n     carrying everything important to you, is another bay horse, \n     an almost identical match to the one you are riding. You call \n     them nicknames as if they were human compadres, drinking \n     buddies. You cluck and coo and talk to them as if they give a \n     damn about what you have to say. You think they do and maybe, \n     just maybe [they do].\n       Right now they are stepping out, heads nodding, down the \n     trail and through the stream and all you have to do is ride. \n     So you ride.\n       That evening as dusk brings the mosquitoes out of the \n     willows--the same dusk that put the horse flies to bed--you \n     choose a camp. It is a good place, save for the bugs, with \n     room for the horses in the broad, deep green meadow and camp \n     back against the lodgepoles and your kitchen down a ways. So \n     you ease off the bay's back and stretch your muscles with \n     that stiff-good, worked-hard feeling, and you begin to unload \n     the packhorse, talking to him, thanking him. In a while he \n     has on his hobbles and is out there with his buddy, snorting \n     contentedly in the tall grass and swishing a long, coal-black \n     tail at the mosquitoes.\n       It goes like this for days, the ride, the squeak of the \n     saddle leather, the smell of dust, the taste of it on your \n     tongue. The smell of horse sweat and your own and the soft \n     muzzles nuzzling you after a long day. Good camp after good \n     camp. Muscles turning hard. Eyes becoming sharp for wildlife. \n     And riding, always riding.\n       One evening a big sow grizzly and her cub cross a broad \n     meadow far out there. A tough gal, rambling, giving you and \n     your horses a wide berth. But still the binoculars sweat in \n     your hands and your mouth is dry.\n       ``Boy, what a beautiful animal.''\n       The next morning a moose walks the same path. You have not \n     seen another human in days but there's a jet contrail \n     reminding you that yes, this is the modern world. You ride.\n\n  Craig loved the modern world. He worked hard in this body. He would \nhave liked to have been out there in those mountains on those horses \nenjoying the smell and the sounds. Now he is riding. Ride on my friend, \nride on.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/05/senate-section/article/S7020-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I got a very early phone call from my \ndaughter in Italy. Of course, their time is 6 hours ahead of ours, and \nthey heard about Craig before we did.\n  I have listened to some of my colleagues talking about Craig. You \nknow, there are some people you have more in common with than others. I \ncan recall Craig and I both came to the House of Representatives about \nthe same time. Then we both decided we would run for the Senate in \n1994. That was a decision we made. We talked to each other and we \ndecided that that would be the best thing for us to do and perhaps we \nwould be able to articulate our concerns a little bit more.\n  He was a marine, I was in the Army. We had a lot in common. I think \nit was Mitch McConnell or perhaps Harry Reid this morning who talked \nabout his calm toughness, his way of expressing himself. I have always \nbeen very envious. I would come down, and I would watch Craig Thomas on \nthe floor. He would say things as antagonistically, as offensively as I \nwould, except people loved him when he said it and they hated me when I \nsaid it. I was never able to master that. I watched him day after day, \nmonth after month, and year after year being able to do that.\n  I think Mike Enzi is right when he said Craig Thomas was the voice of \nthe Senate. Let me correct Senator McConnell on one thing he said. I \nchaired the Environment and Public Works Committee when Craig Thomas \nwas on that committee. This morning Mitch McConnell said he was as much \nat home on a horse as he was in a committee meeting. Well, let me \ncorrect you because he was much more at home on a horse than he would \nbe in that committee meeting. I can remember seeing him staring off, \nand then I would go over and visit while some people were testifying, \nperhaps on the other side, and he would tell me his stories. He was a \nreal cowboy. A lot of us ride horses in parades; he was a real cowboy \nand such a great guy.\n  Many years ago, I was mayor of Tulsa. We had our annual meeting in \nKetchum, ID. I was flying a plane up there, when we were weathered in \nin Saratoga, WY. Saratoga, WY, is a town that Lewis & Clark came \nthrough at the bend of the river. I fell in love with that town. For \nthe next 7 years that I served in the capacity of being mayor, I always \npurposefully stayed in Saratoga, WY.\n  I went up to him in the House of Representatives in the 1980s, and I \nsaid: Craig, you know when I was in--when I would stop, make my stop in \nSaratoga, WY, and stay at the Wolf Hotel--I might add, I would stay at \nthe Wolf Hotel in the presidential suite; it was the only one with a \nbathroom in it. I told him almost everyone I would run into on the \nstreets of Saratoga, WY, reminded me of Craig Thomas. These are salt-\nof-the-earth people, wonderful people, people I learned to dearly love.\n  Kay told me this morning, when we heard about Craig, she said: You \nprobably forgot this, but when you were in voting on the day that we \nhad the spouses dinner, that was 2 weeks ago today, on Tuesday, I saw \nhim walking across the parking lot while I was waiting for you to vote, \nand he was walking a little slower than usual. I said: Hey, handsome. \nAnd his whole face lit up. And he came over and he embraced Kay. That \nis the way that he was to a lot of people. So let me say this to Peter, \nPaul, Patrick and Lexie and Susan. Susan, you have some people you have \nheard from this morning who dearly love you and would love to have some \nway of comforting you. We know how difficult it is. We will pray for \nyou, for your kids. I have to say this also, I do not think it has been \nsaid yet about Craig.\n  Craig Thomas was probably the most consistent Member of the Senate \nprayer breakfast because he was always there. Mike Enzi knows this \nbecause he is the chairman now. He was always there. I give the \nScripture at this thing. So we knew that if we did not see Craig Thomas \nanyplace else during the week, we would see him at the Senate Prayer \nBreakfast.\n  The Senate Prayer Breakfast is similar to a lot of these things. It \nis based on Acts 2:42. Acts 2:42 is the genesis of these meetings you \ndo on a regular basis. You get together and you do four things: eat \ntogether, pray together, fellowship together, and talk about the \nprecepts of Jesus together. We talked about the precepts of Jesus \ntogether every Wednesday morning.\n  That is the comfort I had with Craig Thomas. Some people, you wonder \nif they are going to be there. But Thomas\n\n[[Page S7021]]\n\nyou didn't wonder, you knew. So, Craig, all I can say is, this is not \ngoodbye, this is, ``We will see you later.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition? The Senator \nfrom Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, it was with great sadness that \nCatherine and I learned of Senator Craig Thomas' passing last night. \nThe people of Wyoming have lost a tireless advocate and a skilled \nleader. Those of us in the Senate have lost a true friend and a genuine \ninspiration.\n  Craig and I remained close throughout our time as colleagues. I \nvisited with him on matters pertaining to resource development and \nranches probably more than any other Member of the Senate. These \nweren't visits concerning legislation, but simply to share experiences \nand to get advice.\n  Although Craig came to the Senate much after I did, he possessed a \nwealth of knowledge, particularly about the West. I had the privilege \nof marrying into a family with small ranches in Arizona. Craig and I \ntalked often about horses, the problems facing ranches and cowboys, and \nhow they can endure in today's economy.\n  In each of the past several years, Craig has introduced a resolution \ndesignating a National Day of the American Cowboy. More than any other \nmember of this body, Craig recognized there is more to cowboys than \nroping, riding, and branding. From the Wild West to the Last Frontier, \ncowboys have long symbolized the spirit and determination which makes \nour Nation great. It was my pleasure to help sponsor Craig's \nresolutions, and this year, on July 28, we will pay special tribute to \na man who truly embodied the American cowboy.\n  Craig was always mindful of the best interests of other Western \nStates. As a Senator from Wyoming, he represented a State with a great \nmany problems in common with those of us from Alaska. Craig was \nrenowned for his legislative efforts regarding national parks. His \nefforts to improve rural health care greatly benefitted his \nconstituents and continue to serve as a model for our Nation.\n  Above all, I remember working with Craig on resource issues related \nto coal, oil, and land management. He was steadfast in his efforts to \nincrease domestic energy production. He fought to secure funding for a \ncoal gasification plant in his home State, and he also supported \nexploration and development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  To deal with Craig Thomas was to deal with a gentleman, a person who \nhad absolute knowledge of the topics he spoke on. You couldn't talk to \nhim without becoming aware you were talking to a marine. As far as I am \nconcerned, marines have something special about them--an absolute \nsteadfastness, honesty, and integrity. Craig exemplified these \nqualities.\n  It is hard for me to realize he is now gone. Just before I left to go \nhome this past recess, I stopped Craig and told him we are praying for \nhim and to hang in there. Our great friend Susan Butcher also died of \nleukemia. She went through the same process Craig did. He told me he \nwas going to stick with it. He thought he was going to be able to beat \nit. Everyone who met with Craig in the period after he was diagnosed \nwith leukemia had to admire his courage, his absolute courage.\n  Craig's concept of life impressed me most. He lived life to the \nfullest. He had a wonderful family, four wonderful children, and a \nwonderful wife in Susan. He was also the essence of a Westerner. I have \nknown many Westerners in my day, but never one who was as consummate a \nWesterner as Craig Thomas. The people of Wyoming were blessed to have \nhim representing their interests. Whenever he went home, Craig traveled \nthroughout his State, from one small community to the next. We compared \nnotes about how Wyoming residents faced problems similar to those of \nthe people of Alaska.\n  With Craig's passing, the Senate has lost a great leader in terms of \nWestern values. But we have also lost a man who was a friend. He had \nthe qualities everyone cherishes in a friend. And as the Senator from \nOklahoma has said, he was very devout. You couldn't talk to Craig \nwithout realizing he had tremendous faith in our Maker. He was guided \nby this faith, and it kept him going during the past few months.\n  It is also hard to understand that leukemia is such a violent \ndisease. This year alone, more than 44,000 Americans will be diagnosed \nwith leukemia. The type of cancer which afflicted Craig, acute myeloid \nleukemia, has a 5-year survival rate of just 21 percent.\n  If there is anything I would add to what is going to be said today, \nit is that we must do more. We must do more to prevent this disease. We \nmust learn as much as possible, and apply as much research as possible, \nbecause very few people survive their tremendous battle with leukemia. \nOf all people, I really believed Craig might. When I left for the \nMemorial Day recess, I had a good feeling--Craig was going to make it. \nHe told me he would soon start another round of chemotherapy, but \nbecause of his strong faith, he had no fear of what lay ahead.\n  I hope the Senate takes a lesson from Craig Thomas' attitude as he \nfaced this adversity. After being diagnosed with leukemia, Craig faced \ntrials and tribulations we can hardly imagine, and we will remember him \nas an example of a man with great moral strength and great faith in \nGod. In honor of his memory, it is my hope we will join together and \nfind a way to apply more funds to research leukemia, whose devastating \nimpact has now taken a good friend from our Senate family.\n  This morning, the Casper Star-Tribune published several individuals' \nrecollections of Craig. One of his former staff members, Liz Brimmer, \nsaid, ``In unassuming and generous ways, he did more for Wyoming, more \nfor Wyoming people, than most people knew. His positive spirit \npermeated every interaction. Fiercely loyal and generous of spirit, \nCraig was funny and tenacious all in the same moment . . . He loved \npeople and loved to make a difference. What better mark of a man?'' I \nwish I could find words as eloquent and as fitting to describe this \nextraordinary Senator.\n  We all mourn his death, and we send our love and best wishes to his \nfamily. Susan had a husband, and his children had a father, without \nequal. Craig Thomas was a family man through and through, and I am \ndeeply saddened by his passing.\n  When I thought about him this morning, who he was and what he meant \nto the Senate, a few words came to mind. In a place of great debate and \nheightened political excitement, Craig Thomas was always a gentleman. \nThat says something. It certainly is something we will remember. In a \ntime and place where we often raise our voices in anger and emotion, \nCraig Thomas was always soft spoken, but he was always heard. In a time \nwhen many of us fail even our own standards in terms of integrity, he \nwas a man of high integrity, honorable and humble. In a place where \nmany show weakness, he always showed strength, that quiet strength of a \nWyoming cowboy.\n  I thought about his last battle with cancer. You could tell, when you \nsaw him on the floor or passed him in the hallway, the therapy had \ntaken its toll on him personally. Yet there was always a smile on his \nface, a determination to overcome the odds, and a very optimistic and \npositive word when you asked him how he was doing. Those are the things \nI remember about Craig Thomas.\n  We serve with many people. They come and go. The annals of history do \nnot record them all as great, but each one of us is lucky to be here \nand lucky to develop the friendships and relationships we do. \nPolitically, Craig Thomas and I were worlds apart. There might not be \nany starker contrast in voting records than Craig Thomas and mine, but \nit didn't make much difference when it came to his friendship and his \npersonal relationship. I am going to miss him. I am going to miss that \nWyoming cowboy who had the Remington bronzes in his office that I \nwalked by and looked at every time I came down the corridor. I will \nmiss his smile and his courage. But I am going to be reminded by his \nexample of how we can all be a little bit better in what we do here in \nthe Senate.\n  I extend my sympathies to his wife Susan, his family, his staff, and \nall of his friends. He was truly a great Senator. I was honored to \ncount him as a friend.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n\n[[Page S7022]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. In the third chapter of the book of Ecclesiastes, the \nBible teaches us that there is a time for everything; a time to live \nand a time to die, a time to reap and a time to sow. Last night became \nthe time that Craig Thomas left us. For that we are all sorry and \nextend our sympathy to Susan and all his family and the people of \nWyoming. But for all of us today and for years to come, it will be a \ntime for us to reap the benefits of having known Craig Thomas, having \nbenefited from his service as a colleague in the Senate, but for the \npeople of Wyoming as a great servant to that State. I don't know if \nthere are two finer people who ever served the Senate than Mike Enzi \nand Craig Thomas. To have a matched set of rock-solid, quiet but \nhumble, and strong men to serve a State is quite a unique privilege for \nthat State and a unique privilege for all of us who serve.\n  On this sad occasion of the passing of a great Senator and a great \nfriend, I know I will benefit and reap for years to come from the \nservice, the passion, and the integrity of Craig Thomas.\n  I honor his life.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I rise to address the Senate in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I am saddened by the passing of a good friend, Senator \nThomas. I express my condolences to his family, the people of Wyoming, \nSenator Enzi, and to all of us who knew him and loved him. I have not \nserved long with Senator Thomas. It was a joy to hear this morning how \nhe was described by Senator Enzi, who has known him for a long time. My \nmemories of him are as someone who always was kind, always friendly, \noffered me a helping hand on my first days in the Senate. I know he has \nbeen described as an authentic cowboy. I certainly always viewed him as \nthat. He seemed to be the real deal, the real McCoy.\n  I remember speaking before the break with the Senator, telling him \nhow good he looked. Of course, he already knew he was headed back to \nanother bout of chemo, but he didn't dwell on that. He was telling me \nthat he was feeling good, and he did look good. He looked a lot better \nthan he had been, and we were all encouraged. He certainly believed in \nthat assessment as well.\n  In the last few months, he has been ``down the road'' from us, and he \nhas been responsible for the candy drawer, a little Senate tradition. \nAs we were talking before the break, standing there, he was commenting \non his pride in the Wyoming taffy candy he had introduced to the candy \ndrawer. He was a Wyoming promoter to the very end.\n  I relish the good memories. I know we are all sad today at this \nincredible loss. My heart goes out to the members of his family. We \nwill do all we can to support all those who loved him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, on behalf of Kathy and myself, we send \nour deepest condolences and expressions of sympathy to Susan and her \nfamily on Craig's passing. Susan and Craig were good friends of ours. \nSusan is and Craig still is. They are special people. They are people \nwhom you like to call friends, the type of people who are there. And \nthey had a special relationship. I don't know how many votes we cast \ntogether. It was a lot. Craig arrived 2 years after I had. We would \nwalk out of this Chamber together very often, and Susan, because she \nwas here in Washington, would almost always be right out there, right \noutside the door, with a great smile to greet us, even though we \nprobably just lost the vote.\n  Craig was special because, as has been mentioned and said so well by \nhis partner Senator Enzi and his colleagues, Senator McConnell, Senator \nInhofe, Senator Stevens, Senator Isakson, Senator Martinez, and the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Reid, and Senator Durbin, everybody \nrespected him. You may not have agreed with him, but you could not help \nbut respect him. He was quiet but accomplished and understood the \nissues. He was a man of inordinate common sense. When he would look at \nan issue, he would cut through all the puffery, all the theater, of \nwhich there is a fair amount around here, and he would get to the \nessence of the question. Then he would bring common sense to the \nquestion. Yes, it was common sense born out of a philosophy, which is \nour side of the aisle, which is conservative, but it was a common sense \nthat cut across ideology most often because it was usually so obvious \nwhat the conclusion would be as presented by Craig.\n  I had the great good fortune--I don't know how it happened, but it \nwas good fortune for me--to end up spending almost every Tuesday lunch, \nwhere we do policy, and almost every Wednesday lunch, where we do \nsteering and get together as Members of the Republican Senate to \ndiscuss whatever is happening, to sit beside Craig. We sort of \ngravitated to each other. That is sort of ironic, me being from New \nEngland and him from Wyoming, but I think there is a certain, \nhopefully, identity of our approaches to events. I am certainly proud \nto say that. The great fun about sitting beside Craig was that not only \ndid he have this wonderful common sense, but he had an extraordinary \nsense of humor. He would listen to statements made, often by our \nleadership--I do not wish to be disparaging here; I am simply being \nkind--and he would make some smiling, thoughtful comment that was \nusually fairly humorous and a touch irreverent about comments made by \nour leadership as to what we should be doing. You couldn't help but \nlaugh because he was a person who had a sense of self, a sense of \nhumor, a focus on what was right and what was wrong and what life \nshould be about.\n  This disease attacked him, but honestly, you couldn't convince him \nthat it attacked him. You would ask him how he was doing. He would say: \nI am OK. Even though you knew he was going through extraordinary pain, \nyou would never, ever--at least I never, ever--hear him complain. He \nwas a genuine marine in that sense.\n  He will obviously be missed around here. He was a low-key person who \nhad a high-level impact. I will certainly miss him. I will miss him at \nthose lunches and I will miss seeing Susan outside the door.\n  To Susan and his family, Kathy and I say: He was a great friend, and \nwe will miss him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I rise to honor my friend Craig Thomas, the Senator from \nWyoming who passed away last night, and to express my sympathy to \nSusan, his wife, and to his family and to the people of Wyoming. Joan \nand I and my staff feel we have had a very special relationship with \nCraig and Susan and his staff.\n  Two weeks ago the Senate passed S. Res. 130 declaring July 28 as \nNational Day of the American Cowboy. This was the last piece of \nlegislation Senator Thomas pushed through the Senate. It is so true to \nhis spirit. Senator Thomas was himself a cowboy, a roper. He understood \nthat as a symbol of the American West, cowboys represent much more than \nmen on horses. They stand for courage, determination, hard work, and \nrespect for nature. They stand for the West itself and for those who \nwish to protect and preserve it.\n  His work on the Energy and Environment Committees was a testament as \nwell to his belief that the land we have been blessed with needs \nstewardship and care, and that those who live on and work with the land \nare often the best at doing so. Craig tried to take care of the land, \nespecially the Wyoming he loved so much. This connection with the West, \nhis concern for land management, and the way of life of those who lived \non the land, should be his legacy. Craig rode forward into the end of \nhis life so bravely that most of us never knew how bad his health was. \nHe told us he was seeking treatment, but the end came quickly and, for \nhim, stoically.\n\n[[Page S7023]]\n\n  It was always a pleasure serving with Senator Thomas--first in the \nHouse of Representatives, then in the Senate, where we collaborated on \na whole range of issues. The proximity of our home States and our \nshared interest and passion for natural resources and energy issues \nprovided many opportunities to partner on legislative efforts.\n  During the 2001 anthrax attack on the Hart Senate Office Building \nthat pushed several Senators out of their offices, I was happy to offer \nSenator Thomas and his staff space in my office for several months \nuntil his office was deemed safe again. During that time I was able to \nget to know him and his staff even better.\n  I offer my condolences now to his staff. He was the type of man who \nwas not just a boss but a friend as well. I know they are hurting. He \nwill be remembered for being the quintessential Wyoming cowboy, a \ngentleman with quick wit and humility of spirit that endeared him to \nhis colleagues and made him a joy to us all.\n  Any man who can list cowboy, United States marine, husband, and \nfather on his life's accomplishments lived life well. The Senate has \nlost a gentle giant who served his State and Nation with honor and \ndistinction. Joan and I are keeping Susan and the family in our \nthoughts and prayers. I will miss my friend, Craig Thomas.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask to speak for up to 10 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I first note the presence on the floor \nof the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi. I note also \npresent in the Senate is a beautiful bouquet of flowers on the desk \nthat was occupied by the other Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Craig Thomas.\n  I want to say to Senator Enzi, first, we will all have an opportunity \nin the next few days and weeks to speak about the Senator who was your \ncolleague who left us last night, and we all will have an opportunity \nto speak with you and see you on more occasions than this to express to \nyou our heartfelt sorrow for the loss of your colleague.\n  You will suffer a lot of things that will be downers during your life \nin the Senate--and because we all live our lives, things happen, go up \nand go down--but I am quite sure you will not have an opportunity to \nsuffer any more severe a loss than the loss of your colleague who was \nat the same time a cowboy, a marine, a Senator, a father, and, clearly, \na husband.\n  He had a wife named Susan. Everybody who knows her loves her. My wife \nloves her. I called my wife early this morning, after I heard, and I \nwas so pleased she answered the phone herself because I thought: Where \nwill I get her? We may get caught up in the maze of today and maybe I \nwill not be able to talk to her until tomorrow, or maybe Nancy will not \nbe able to talk to me. But, sure enough, it was at 8:30 this morning I \nwas able to talk to her.\n  Her first words, after knowing who I was, were words coming out of \nher mouth saying: He did a good job for Wyoming, didn't he? I said: You \nbet. Then: I am sure, not knowing the rest of his life, he must have \ndone a good job in a lot of other areas. Probably he was a good \nhusband--to which there was no answer because that was not intended as \na question. He obviously was a wonderful man. Quiet, sort of \nunassuming, but he was a very involved Senator, especially when it came \nto Wyoming.\n  Very early on, as he worked his way from the House, where he replaced \nDick Cheney, over to the Senate, where he had been elected, he decided \nhe would work for his State. You did not hear of him a lot on national \nnews because he was busy doing what he thought was best for him as a \nSenator, and that was, representing that great State of Wyoming. What a \nState that is, and what a Senator they had.\n  From my standpoint, I served with him on two committees. The one I \nknow the most and remember the most is the one we served the longest \non: Energy and Natural Resources, which the occupant of the chair has \nserved on with us. But when it came to this man, he frequently worked \nwith Democrats on serious issues because he wanted to get things done.\n  If there is one thing I noticed as we worked together, shoulder to \nshoulder on this committee, it was that he was impatient because he did \nnot understand when we wasted time and he did not understand why we \nwere doing some certain things. He would ask: Why don't we get on with \nwhat we are supposed to do? What are we talking about this for? This is \nnot policy. We are talking about a bunch of little things we ought not \nbe involved in. I think I remember that more than anything else: Can't \nwe get on with it?\n  I remember he was burdened with the fact there is a substance in his \nState called trona. The other Senator from Wyoming might know about it. \nHe must know about it. Apparently, they were having competition in the \nworld, and he thought the royalties were too high. I don't know. \nAnybody who served on the committee must have heard the word ``trona'' \nbecause he was all over that issue, wanting to get somebody to listen \nto him about the unfairness of it and to help solve it.\n  I did not get to serve with him on the Finance Committee and other \ncommittees he served on, but it would be my guess he was the same way \non all of them, that he showed up when he should and did his job as \nbest he could, and that when the chips were down, you could count on \nhim. When the chips were down, he did what he said. He voted the way he \nwould tell you. He worked the way a dedicated person works.\n  For me and my wife, on this day, shortly after his death, I want to \nsay in the Senate that Wyoming sent us a true man. I do not know \nwhether it was the marines who made him a man or what it was, but he \nwas truly different. He was tough minded. He was quiet. But he was \nimpatient, and he wanted to get good things done.\n  I am positive his relatives and his great State will never forget \nhim. He will be remembered by them, just as we remember him. He will \nleave them, and they will have a big void, without a question, because \na giant part of their lives leaves. That goes for Wyoming, and that \ngoes for his wife Susan and their children. I think there are four of \nthem. I did not get to meet them. But if they are like their mother and \nfather, they could not help but be great.\n  With that, I say goodbye to the Senator, and I extend my sorrows to \nhis wonderful wife, and, hopefully, I will be part of whatever ceremony \nthere is for us to send him on his way.\n  May God bless his family and him, and may whatever he aspired to get \ndone, get done by others who follow him because he set such a wonderful \nbasis to get those things completed for his State.\n  I thank the Senate and I thank the junior Senator from Wyoming for \nthe kind man he is. I will be seeing him, and I say to the Senator, if \nI can help you during these times, please call on me. I am available.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, the thoughts and prayers of my wife \nCharlene and myself are with Susan today and their four children, as we \nthink about Craig Thomas, our dear friend, our colleague, a man who has \nbeen such a wonderful presence in our lives in the Senate.\n  Much has been said, and quite correctly so, about Senator Thomas as a \ncowboy, and certainly he was, and his rich heritage of experience in \nthe Marine Corps, as he volunteered to serve his country after college. \nBut I want to stress two or three things that perhaps have not come to \nthe attention of Senators in the same way this morning, one of which is \nthat Craig Thomas was a person who was vitally interested in the Far \nEast. He served for a period of time on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and during that period of time, as I recall, was either the \nsubcommittee chairman or heavily involved in hearings and in working \nwith our Ambassadors to countries in Asia.\n\n[[Page S7024]]\n\n  For a variety of reasons, because Craig always sought opportunities \nto serve Wyoming in whatever committee assignments seemed most \nappropriate at the time, his service on the Foreign Relations Committee \nwas not a long one, but he continued that service by holding breakfasts \nin his office. I was privileged to be invited to those breakfasts in \nwhich famous people from abroad, especially the Far East, were his \nguests. These are ladies and gentlemen he had met during his foreign \ntravels or during his work in Wyoming in which they might have been of \nvalue to his State.\n  It was an extraordinary set of experiences. I stress ``experiences'' \nbecause there were many of these breakfasts. I encouraged him to \ncontinue on. I enjoyed the fellowship of the people he brought together \nas well as Senators he brought into an orbit of understanding about the \nFar East, through his own ministry in this case.\n  I have been impressed in addition--speaking of breakfasts and the \nfact that Senator Thomas was a regular at the Aspen Institute \nbreakfasts that are held right here in the Capitol on Wednesdays and \nThursdays frequently throughout the legislative year. I am advised as \nmany as 24 of these breakfasts are held on the subjects which the Aspen \nInstitute Congressional group is focusing.\n  Among the things on which the group has been focusing in recent years \nhas been problems with Russia and the Balkans and developments in \nEastern Europe, the problems certainly in education generally as a \nsubject for our schoolchildren in this country, problems in Latin \nAmerica, the problems of the environment and energy, and, \nappropriately, problems in Asia and especially China in the Far East.\n  I noticed Craig Thomas, when it came to these breakfasts, usually was \nthere on time and listened to the lecture or the paper that was being \ngiven by the speaker, and that he frequently proceeded on, perhaps, to \nanother breakfast or another appointment without severely questioning \neither other Members of Congress or the speaker at the time, but was \nintensely interested. Because we frequently saw and listened to the \nsame people, this led to many rich conversations which I was privileged \nto have with him. I would ask him: What did you think? What were your \nimpressions of that speaker today? He always had some very concise \nimpressions.\n  But a third thing I simply want to mention, in addition to these \nbreakfasts, is the sense of good humor with which those impressions \nwere cast. He had his own unique sense of humor, and yet it was clearly \nthere and very much a part of the personal association each one of us \nenjoyed with the Senator.\n  Likewise, that sense of humor was shared by Susan, appropriately. I \ncan remember so many times outside the door to this Chamber Susan would \nbe standing there at about 6:30 at night or some such time. It was \nobvious she and the Senator were going to dinner or had some activity. \nBut one of the delightful things was that so many of us had been \nvisiting with Susan over the years. We had a lot to say to her and she \nto us, always with a wonderful sense of humor, with a sense of the work \nwe are about, how unusual to some this schedule seems, how absurd it \nmay be to others, someone who had her own vocation as a very remarkable \nteacher and someone who understood the needs of children.\n\n  It is not surprising that Craig would attend the Aspen Education \nConferences in addition to his far-flung interests in Asia and most \nimportantly, obviously, the land use issues and the remarkable ability \nof people to make a living off the land in his home State. It was \nfinally in that capacity that I enjoyed the best conversations with \nCraig Thomas because he was deeply interested in agriculture, as I am. \nWe come from very different kinds of agriculture, yet there was a \nprofound understanding of the challenges and the joys of people who \nmake their living from the soil; likewise, from the husbandry of \nanimals and the combination of forestry, and even the mineral uses of \nlands--much more abundant, I must say, in the State of Wyoming than in \nIndiana. But we both understood the nature of that income, the nature \nof the challenge, and the importance of State and Federal legislation \nas it pertained to those farmers. So I will miss those conversations \nespecially because that is a heritage of land in which both of us have \nbeen involved in our families, and I suspect his will continue.\n  Our thoughts are with the family today. We are never prepared for \nsuch a day. That is why many of us perhaps are rambling on occasion in \nour thoughts as we collect them about this outstanding Senator and \nwonderful friend. But it truly is a privilege to have this opportunity \non the floor of the Senate to pay tribute to my dear friend Craig \nThomas.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, this is a sad day for all of us. Wyoming \nand the Senate have lost Craig Thomas. He was a neighbor. He was a \nfriend. He was an individual whose life was committed to his country \nand his State.\n  Often, when he would refer to my State of Nebraska, he would say: Oh, \nyes, that State of Nebraska; that is where Wyoming sends all of its \nwind. He said other things as well. Many times, he and Senator Enzi \nwere responsible for stealing Nebraska's water. Other than those \nobvious flaws, Craig Thomas was one of those unique individuals whom we \nhave heard his colleagues speak of this morning. None have exaggerated \nin their descriptions of this remarkable man. He, as has been noted, \nwas a marine. He was a straight shooter. He was born and raised on a \nranch in Wyoming. When you add all of that up, what else could he be \nbut a straight shooter?\n  He worked hard, as has been noted here this morning. Chairman Lugar \noutlined some of the participation of Craig Thomas on the Foreign \nRelations Committee where I, too, had an opportunity to serve with him. \nNo one was ever better prepared when he spoke, more knowledgeable of \nthe subject matter, and more a joy to be around because he never lost \nthe most important element of each of us; that is, a humanness, the \nhuman dynamic. He had a special humanity that is not always easy to \nretain in this town and in this business. But that is what Craig Thomas \nwas, and I think that is what most of us admired most about him.\n  If service to America is one of America's highest and most important \nvalues, then Craig Thomas's legacy speaks volumes because that was his \nlife. Lilibet and I offer our sympathy and our prayers to Susan and to \nthe family. He served with great distinction and always put others \nfirst.\n  One last comment about a memory of Craig Thomas for me. In 1996, when \nI was campaigning for my first elective office to the U.S. Senate and \nwhen there was a very legitimate question of whether I was worthy of \nelection and whether I could win, Craig Thomas flew over from Wyoming \nto central Nebraska and spent a day campaigning with me in 1996. Craig \nwas the first U.S. Senator to help me, to come into my State, and that \nday I spent with him talking about water issues, agricultural issues, \nthe Marine Corps, and service to our country inspired all who were \naround him. I noted that those ranchers and those water resource \nspecialists and others whom we visited on that campaign tour that day \nresponded to him in a way that was rather special. I later learned \nthrough my almost 11 years in the Senate why people responded to him in \nsuch a special way.\n  We will miss him. He leaves our institution, his State, and his \ncountry better than he found them.\n  Thank you.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, we will miss Craig Thomas. Craig \nThomas would want it to be said that he was a conservative. He enjoyed \nexpressing conservative views on this floor. He enjoyed expressing \nconservative views in our Energy Committee on which we served together, \nand the Senator from Louisiana and I served with Senator Thomas. He \nkept his feet firmly planted on the ground in Wyoming from which his \nconservatism came. He obviously well represented the people of Wyoming \nbecause he barely noticed there was an election last year. When Craig \nThomas ran, he was elected by an overwhelming margin.\n  Craig Thomas was a conservationist. He was chairman of the National \nParks\n\n[[Page S7025]]\n\nSubcommittee during the time I served on the Energy Committee, and he \nenjoyed that very much. I am not a bit surprised because he took great \npride in the fact that Yellowstone, a great, premier park--I can say \nthat even though we have the Great Smokies in Tennessee--but \nYellowstone, which has such a special place in the hearts of all \nAmericans, Craig Thomas took special pride in his jurisdiction of that \nresponsibility. He was honored by the National Parks Association a \ncouple of years ago. Craig Thomas was awarded the singular honor of the \nNational Parks Association for his stewardship of our national parks.\n  Craig Thomas was no-nonsense. That came from several places, I \nsuspect. One was, as the Senator from Nebraska noted, he was a marine. \nOne was that he was a cowboy, a real cowboy. I saw Senator Inhofe \ntalking about him in that respect. Another reason is he came from \nWyoming. I see that Senator Enzi from Wyoming is here. Wyoming \ncitizens, I have noticed, don't waste words. They think about them \nbefore they say them, and they often don't say them. They don't feel a \nneed to fill every vacuum with a string of words, which is an unusual \ncharacteristic on the floor of the U.S. Senate, but Craig Thomas was \nsuch a person. I think, in fact, he grew up in Wyoming, came from \nWyoming, lived in Wyoming, kept his feet planted in Wyoming, and helped \ncontribute to that no-nonsense approach to life he had which enriched \nthe Senate.\n  Craig Thomas was also interested in working across party lines. \nEarlier this year, Senator Lieberman and I and others began a breakfast \non Tuesday morning at 8 o'clock for those Senators who had time to \ncome, not for the purpose of passing legislation but for the purpose of \ngetting to know each other better across party lines so that we could \nperhaps come to solutions more quickly in other areas. It was \ninteresting to see who came to that breakfast. We all are busy. We all \nhave tremendous demands on our time. We started off with 40 Senators of \nboth parties. Sometimes it got to be 10 or 12 or 14. But almost every \nTuesday morning at the bipartisan Senators' breakfast, Craig Thomas was \nthere, and he always had a contribution to make. He was there 2 weeks \nago, in the week before our recess, which is why it was such a surprise \nto learn that he died yesterday, because when he was there, he sat \nquietly, but you could tell he had something to say, and he finally \nsaid it before he left. The subject was immigration. He had some \nquestions, and he had some comments. He looked the perfect picture of \nhealth. He looked as if he would last forever. That was the last I saw \nof Craig Thomas.\n  We are a family here in the Senate. We say that often to one another, \nbut it is true. We have breakfast together, as we did this morning at \nthe bipartisan breakfast or as we will tomorrow morning at the Prayer \nBreakfast where we will remember Craig Thomas. We have lunch together, \nwhich we are about to do, Republicans on one side and Democrats on the \nother. We have committee hearings and meetings all day long and little \nvisits, and then in the evenings, if that weren't enough, why, we get \ntogether and we go to receptions for each other. That is how we live \nour lives here. So it is a surprise to us to suddenly find ourselves \nwithout Craig Thomas, whom we saw at breakfast, whom we saw at lunch, \nwhom we saw at committee meetings, and whom we saw in the evenings. We \nwill miss him, but we greatly respect his presence here in the Senate \nfor such a long period of time.\n  When he got sick last year, we heard that he was soon doing fingertip \npushups again. So all of us thought--at least I thought--well, Craig is \ngoing to be fine. He is going to be fine. But, as will be the case with \neach of us, in the end, his life has come to a conclusion. It has been \na life of public service, one I greatly respect.\n  To Susan and to his family, Honey and I offer our sympathy and our \nrespect for his life. We will be thinking and praying for them, and we \nwill be remembering how much joy our friend Craig Thomas brought to the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to say a \nfew words about Craig Thomas. He was a friend of mine and of all of us \nin the Senate. His death is a shock to this institution and to all of \nus. I heard the news this morning on the radio, as many of us did, I \nbelieve, and I was genuinely shocked to hear that he had died. My last \nencounter with him was the week before we had our recess where I had \nthe chance to be with him in the Energy Committee, and he was there and \nvery much participating in that committee hearing. He had a great deal \nto say, as he usually did, and an interest in what was going on.\n  I think the first thing that comes to my mind about Craig is that he \nwas an example of courage in the face of adversity. I have seen several \ninterviews recently where I was very admiring of Elizabeth Edwards and \nthe tremendous example she is presenting for the entire country about \ncarrying on in the face of adversity after having been diagnosed, as \nshe has been. I think the American people appreciate that, and \nunderstandably. I appreciate it, and I am sure everyone who is aware of \nher circumstance appreciates it greatly.\n\n  The same can be said about Craig Thomas. Craig was diagnosed with \nleukemia shortly before his reelection this last fall, and I think \neverybody had to know that this was not a minor illness that was easily \novercome. Craig took it in stride. He was here working in the Senate. \nHe went through the chemotherapy and he was back, regaining his \nstrength, and all of us admired that. All of us admired the way he \nfaced that adversity, and he did all that he could, all that was \nhumanly possible, to overcome that adversity.\n  I had the good fortune to serve with Craig on two committees, \nincluding the Energy Committee, where he was chair of the National Park \nSubcommittee. He took a great interest in issues affecting not only \nnational parks but our public lands generally and, of course, our \nenergy issues as well. I also had the good fortune to serve with him on \nthe Finance Committee. The chairman of the Finance Committee this year \nappointed a new Subcommittee on Energy and Natural Resource Tax Issues. \nI was fortunate to be named chair of that, and Craig was named as the \nranking member. So he and I spent a lot of time together, both in the \nEnergy Committee and in the Finance Committee, sitting in hearings and \ntalking about the agenda of the committees and generally interacting.\n  I had the other great good fortune of taking a trip last year that \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin sponsored--a trip to Iraq and \nAfghanistan, in April of 2006, with Craig Thomas. Craig and I were both \ninvited to be on that trip. So I spent time with him and interacted \nwith him in Afghanistan and in Turkey, where we made a short stop, and \nalso in London, where we met with some British defense officials.\n  Three things came through to me that I think are my recollection of \nCraig Thomas: First, his decency as a human being. When you are with a \nperson for a substantial period of time, you get a sense of their \ndecency as a human being. I have spent a lot of time with Craig Thomas \nin this Senate and on that trip to which I just alluded. I can vouch \nfor his basic decency. He was always considerate, always civil, always \nconcerned about the feelings of others and the reaction of others.\n  The second characteristic I would allude to is his ability to ask \ntough questions. Craig liked to think of himself as a conservative. I \nwould characterize him, as much as anything, as sort of a skeptic. \nWhenever the experts were telling us what the solution to a problem \nwas, or what their analysis of a problem was, he was one who would \nstand back and say: Wait a minute, let's question some of that expert \nadvice and expert analysis that you are giving us. That is very much \nneeded by people in public office. You need people who will ask the \ntough questions, and Craig Thomas asked the tough questions.\n  Third is the characteristic that others have spoken of here--that he \nwas a straight shooter; he was straightforward in his view of the \nissues. You didn't have to guess what Craig thought about an issue. He \nwould tell you, and it was a heartfelt view that he was expressing. So \nthis is a very great loss to this Senate, to the people of Wyoming, and \nto the country. I consider him to have been a superb public\n\n[[Page S7026]]\n\nservant. The people of Wyoming were extremely well served by him, the \ncountry was well served by him, and this Senate was well served by \nhaving him as one of our distinguished members.\n  I extend my condolences to Susan and the family and, of course, to \nall of the people who are friends of his in his home State. He will be \nfondly remembered in this Senate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise this morning with a very heavy \nheart, like all the rest of my colleagues, about the loss of our dear \nfriend Craig Thomas. Craig was such an inspiration in such a quiet way \nto all of us, a guy from the true Wild West, the great State of \nWyoming. He had such an easy manner about him that is so indicative of \na lot of people who come from that part of the country. It was indeed a \nprivilege and a pleasure to have the opportunity to serve with him.\n  I had a number of interests in common with Craig. First of all, we \nserved on the Agriculture Committee together. In the past 2 years, as \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee, Craig was one of those guys I \ncalled on from time to time to seek his advice and counsel because in \nthe area of Wyoming and in the western part of the country, they grow \ndifferent kinds of crops than what we grow in the Southeast. Craig was \nalways willing to give his time to talk to me about the thoughts of \nfarmers and ranchers in his part of the country and what we needed to \ndo from a policy perspective on the Agriculture Committee relative to \nhis farmers and ranchers that would also be beneficial to my farmers \nand ranchers. I cannot overemphasize the value of that kind of \nrelationship with a Member of this body.\n  I grew up in my law practice and in the rural electrification \nbusiness. Craig was a strong advocate of rural electrification and the \nREA program and had been involved with it in Wyoming for decades. We \nhad the opportunity to talk about this issue and long-term policy \nrelative to providing electricity and other assets to people in rural \nAmerica, and whether it was rural Wyoming or rural Georgia made no \ndifference. Craig was an advocate of making sure that people in rural \nAmerica all across our great country had the opportunities that folks \nin the urban parts of America have. I had a special opportunity to work \nwith Craig.\n  Earlier, I heard folks talk about Craig's love for the country and \nhis love for the land. We were both outdoorsmen. He used to ride a \nhorse a lot, and I like to shoot a shotgun at quail, pheasant, and a \nfew other things that I have been blessed to be able to do over the \nyears. We talked about our enjoyment of the outdoors on any number of \ndifferent occasions.\n  Craig was the chairman of a major committee during the last Congress. \nHe was in charge of an issue that has been very near and dear to my \nState, an issue of designating property with a heritage designation in \nGeorgia. I worked on this for about 6 years. We got right up to the \nbrink last year, and all of a sudden we ran into a roadblock. Craig, as \nchairman, said, ``Saxby, here is the problem.'' Then he went through it \nand explained the very complex side of the issue that I had never \nthought of before.\n  What it made me realize about Craig was that he was a lover of the \nland of America, irrespective of whether it was in Wyoming, Georgia, or \nthe State of New York. He wanted to make sure future generations had \nthe same opportunity to enjoy lands as our generation and previous \ngenerations have had the opportunity to do. Once he explained his \nposition to me, we again worked through the issue. It took us a little \nlonger than I wanted it to, but I had to be patient because Craig was \nvery thoughtful. I knew his thinking was the right way of thinking on \nany issue like this, particularly with the designation of heritage \nareas, because there are other connotations to it than just saying we \nare going to leave this land for future generations.\n  Craig was such a great ally in this process. At the end of the day, I \nremember when he gave his consent through a unanimous consent \nresolution. He and I sat right here near one another. He used to sit \nright there, and he moved behind me here. We sat across the aisle, and \nwe had a long conversation that night about this particular piece of \nproperty for which he had now come to have a great appreciation. It is \nsomething that Georgians and America are going to enjoy for generations \nto come, and it simply would not have happened without Craig Thomas.\n  Lastly, the desk that is right behind my desk is one of the more \nnotable desks on this side of the aisle in this great institution \nbecause it is our candy drawer. His desk is our candy drawer. Of \ncourse, Rick Santorum from Pennsylvania had that desk in the two \nprevious Congresses, and he kept it full of candy. Craig could not wait \nto get that desk when Rick left the Senate. Now, when a lot of us walk \ninto the Senate door, the first thing we do is open that desk drawer to \nsee what kind of candy Craig has put in there for us. He has never \nfailed us. It was always a delight of his to be able to make folks \nhappy, and this was a simple and easy way to encourage and get a smile \non the faces of Senators as we walked in the door.\n  Craig's wife Susan is such a great lady. I don't know his sons, but \nSusan is such a wonderful person. Again, as this body is such a small \nbody, we all become friends regardless of our political differences. At \nthe end of the day, we are a family, and we truly do have Susan and all \nof her other family in our thoughts and prayers as they go through what \nwe know is a very difficult time.\n  Craig and I also had in common the fact that we were both cancer \nsurvivors. I went through a process about 3 years ago, and Craig was \none of the first ones to come to me and give me his thoughts and \nencouragement, which I really respected and greatly appreciated. That \nis the kind of family thought process that we go through here.\n  So as we reach this day when Craig has lost that last battle--and, \nboy, did he ever fight good ones through the years. He fought this one \nvery well, too. But as we think about him today, knowing his love of \nthe outdoors in our conversations about his riding horses--even riding \nhorses with the Capitol Police on the grounds of the Capitol--I am \nalways going to have those very fond memories of Craig Thomas as a \ngreat friend, a great Member of this institution, and a truly great \nAmerican. We know he is riding off into the sunset for a better life \neven as we speak today.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I had the great privilege of presiding \nthis morning. I got to listen to my colleagues come to the floor to pay \ntribute to our friend, an outstanding Senator and a wonderful man, \nCraig Thomas from Wyoming.\n  So many things were said this morning, but I wanted to add a few \nmore. First of all, as I sat in the chair to listen to the tributes, I \nwant to give a compliment to the Senator from Wyoming, who spoke on \nbehalf of his colleague. I have heard many tributes in the 10 years I \nhave been in the Senate but, to me, it was one of the most beautiful \ntributes that a partner and colleague has made for another. Senator \nEnzi will continue to carry on the great traditions of the State, and I \nam sure he, as we all have, will be inspired by his friend that we \nlost. It was evident in his heartfelt and beautifully executed remarks \nthis morning.\n\n  I wanted to rise as a Member who served with Senator Thomas on the \nEnergy Committee, someone who worked fairly closely with him, although \nwe are not of the same political party, to reiterate just a few things \nabout his character.\n  This life we choose to live in public life is not the easiest life to \nlive, and sometimes it is harder on our families than it is on us \nindividually. It is a life that we choose because we want to serve our \nconstituents. We believe we can do that job.\n  I heard so many of our colleagues rise to pay tribute to the Senator \nbut\n\n[[Page S7027]]\n\nmention Susan, his wife, that I wanted to restate for the record how \ninspirational their relationship has been to me and to many of us. Not \nonly did Susan wait for him, many times outside of this door, to greet \nhim always with a smile or encouragement, they often were able to \ntravel together as a couple, to share both the joys and the burdens of \nthis life. I think it is a tribute to both of them and particularly to \nCraig Thomas, who shared his life in such a special way with his \nspouse, which stands as an inspiration to us all, and Susan to him.\n  I also wanted to say what a strong and steady voice, an unflinching \nchampion for Wyoming he was, in fact, even in the twilight of his life, \nwithin the last few weeks, as was mentioned by some of us who were with \nhim at the Prayer Breakfast, some of us who were with him at the \nbipartisan conference, and some of us who were with him in one of his \nlast Energy Committee meetings. I recall the memory of his voice, \nalthough weak in body, strong in spirit, fighting for Wyoming, talking \nabout coal, talking about a new energy policy, talking about how the \ncountry depended so much on the resources of Wyoming and how he was \ndetermined to continue to fight and provide that point of view on our \ncommittee. So on the Energy Committee we will miss him, always there, \nalways on time, always steady, always strong, and never forgetting the \nState he came to represent and did so, so completely and so \nconsistently.\n  Finally, some of us have mentioned the inspiration he has been to us \nin terms of his quiet and gentle spirit, knowing that he was facing a \nvery difficult time, with his time perhaps not that long to be here. As \nmany of our colleagues have said, however, he never complained. He \nalways said how well he was feeling and how much better and how \nthankful he was for his doctors, for his family's support, and he was \nalways thanking us for being there when we could.\n  I wish to mention the strength of his spirit in having come to terms \nand making peace in his life, that God was his friend. He had a great \nfaith in God Almighty. It was evident by the way he walked, not \nagitated and not nervous, not anxious and not afraid, but basically the \nquiet confidence of a person who was at peace with God and with \nwhatever God would have in store for him. I think those of us in the \nSenate family, for all we remember of him--as a cowboy, as a marine, as \na Senator--we will always remember the last few weeks of that quiet \nconfidence of a man who knew why he was born and where he was going. \nThat was our good friend Craig Thomas.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my \ncolleagues in tribute to the memory of a wonderful friend, Senator \nCraig Thomas from Wyoming. For me, Craig Thomas was not only a member \nof the Senate family, he was a neighbor to the north. Because of the \nsimilarities between Wyoming and Colorado in terms of the rural nature \nof our States, Senator Thomas and I had the opportunity to work on many \nmatters during the time we both served in the Senate. I wish to comment \non two or three of those issues which were very important to us as we \nworked on them together.\n  I always saw Senator Craig Thomas as someone who was truly a fighter \nfor the land, water, and people of this Nation, and the people of the \nState of Wyoming. I remember very clearly the debate we had in the \nSenate Energy Committee and the National Parks Subcommittee, which he \nchaired, about whether we were going to abandon the hundred-year \nprinciple that had guided the conservation philosophy of our national \nparks. It was Senator Craig Thomas who, at the point of the spear, made \nsure that the conservation doctrine of our national parks' policy \nremained intact.\n  I also remember the leadership role Senator Thomas took in the last \nseveral years when there were efforts to try to sell off our public \nlands in order to make that part of the deficit reduction for our \nNation. While he was a true fiscal conservative, he also understood the \nimportance of the legacy of our public lands, protecting our public \nlands, and making sure those public lands were not used simply for \ndeficit reduction. It was through his leadership that we were able to \nturn back the efforts of those who wanted to sell off the public lands \nof our Nation.\n  I wish to also comment with respect to Senator Thomas's efforts for \nrural America.\n  There are some significant differences between the Senate family and \nthe House family. I think the House of Representatives, because of the \nmakeup of that body--many of them come only from metropolitan and urban \nareas. Here in our Chamber, many of our Senators represent States that \nare very rural in nature, and there are very few States that are as \nrural as that great State of Wyoming. So it was natural for Senator \nThomas to be a champion for rural America, and it was my honor to join \nwith him in working on a number of other things where we stood together \nand said that the America that had been forgotten by so many, rural \nAmerica, was never going to be forgotten on the floor of the Senate. It \nwas in that vein that Senator Thomas took a leadership role, along with \nour good friend, Senator Larry Craig from Idaho, to make sure we were \ndoing right with payment in lieu of taxes so that those rural \ncommunities in the West, which are so dependent upon payment in lieu of \ntaxes because so much of our land is owned by the Federal Government, \nthat we would be providing them with the kind of compensation needed to \nkeep them afloat.\n  It was also in that regard that I had the honor of joining Senator \nThomas last year and Senator Craig in moving forward with the creation \nof the Office of Rural Veterans Affairs. That is because Senator Thomas \nunderstood that there was a great disparity in how veterans were being \ntreated in the urban-suburban areas of our society and those in rural \ncommunities. The fact is that the VA had done a study that demonstrated \nthe great disparity in health care services that were forthcoming from \nthe VA to those veterans who lived in the urban communities as opposed \nto those who lived in rural communities. So it was his effort and his \nleadership that helped us lead to the creation of the Office of Rural \nVeterans Affairs.\n\n  Finally, his work on the Agriculture Committee. When I think about \nWyoming, a State that I often travel, a State where I have often \nworked, I think about its natural resources and I think about its \npeople, but I also think about its agricultural base. Certainly, \nSenator Craig Thomas will always be remembered for his great advocacy \nfor agriculture and making sure we have sustainable agriculture here in \nour Nation.\n  I would like to thank Senator Thomas for the contributions he made to \nmy State, even though I am a very new Senator here in this body. We \nworked on a number of different issues. It was through his leadership \nthat we were able to hold hearings and move forward on legislation that \ncreated the Sangre De Cristo National Heritage Area, the Clark County \nNational Heritage Act legislation, the Rocky Mountain National Park \nWilderness Act, and the Betty Dick Resident Protection Act, and I could \ngo on and on listing a whole host of other matters that were moved \nforward because of the advocacy of Senator Thomas.\n  Lastly, I would say this: We get to know each other in a number of \ndifferent ways here on the floor of the Senate and while working \ntogether. I fondly remember traveling with Senator Reid and with \nSenator Thomas to Iraq and spending 8 or 9 days with him in that \ntroubled part of the world. I remember the conversations about his \nyearning for a more peaceful and stronger world, where we would create \na legacy for our children that was a legacy of peace for the world.\n  I was honored to often go to the Prayer Breakfast on Wednesday \nmornings and listen to the speakers. I knew Craig Thomas was a man of \nfaith and that he was doing the duty of the people of this country and \nthe duty of the people of Wyoming.\n  So from his neighbor to the south, I conclude by simply saying that I \nam proud of that cowboy. I am proud of Craig Thomas, and I am proud of \nthe contributions he made not only to the State of Wyoming but the \ncontributions he made to this Nation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7028]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  I am sorry, the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, today I take that comment with respect \nand honor because I am here, like many of my colleagues, to join in \nspeaking about the loss of Senator Craig Thomas, a friend from the \nneighboring State of Wyoming.\n  Over the course of years in working with Craig on the floor of the \nHouse and here in the Senate, I must tell you that notice of his death \nlate yesterday evening was a real loss to me and my wife Suzanne. And I \nsay to his wife Susan and their four children that we stand in quiet \nprayer for strength for you through this difficult time in the loss of \na truly marvelous American.\n  The Senator from Colorado just mentioned the word ``cowboy,'' and I \noftentimes, when at a gathering with Craig, if the opportunity arose \nwhere we were both speakers and I was to introduce him--and that \nhappened on several occasions--I would say: And now, ladies and \ngentlemen, let me introduce the cowboy from Wyoming. And he would stand \nwith a big smile on his face because he viewed that as a statement of \nrespect. I think we westerners, who work closely together on issues \nthat are uniquely western, appreciate and understand that expression.\n  Craig came to the House in 1989, just as I was leaving the House, so \nI got to know him then. And, of course, when he came to the Senate and \ncame to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, where we both grew \nin seniority, we began to work very closely together on so many issues \nthat were important to the West but also issues that were important to \nthe Nation.\n  CQ, Congressional Quarterly, in its Political Profiles of American \nPoliticians, said this about Craig, and I think it is so typical of the \nman. They said:\n\n       While Thomas pursues his State's interests, he does it in a \n     quiet, methodical way that has made him remarkably few \n     enemies after nearly two decades in Congress. Known for his \n     courtesy and diplomacy, even on bitterly contested issues, he \n     is no pushover.\n\n  That is the Craig Thomas whom we all got to know. He could be tough \nin his position. He knew exactly where he was on almost all issues, and \nhe very seldom gave ground. But he would give ground when he knew it \nwould bring the issue to resolution. Now, I say that is the art of a \ntalented policymaker, and Craig Thomas, representing his State of \nWyoming and the Nation, was truly that.\n  He filled big shoes. When he came to the House, he filled the shoes \nof the departing Dick Cheney, and, of course, when he came over here, \nhe filled the shoes of Malcolm Wallop, who was well known here as a \nvery clear conservative and often very partisan Member of the Senate. \nBut in filling those shoes--and more importantly, he brought his own \nboots--he made his own mark for his State and for the Nation. So \nwhether it was park issues, whether it was natural resource issues, \nwhether it was differences between that boundary line that sometimes is \nfairly indistinguishable out West between Idaho and Wyoming, Craig \nThomas served the citizens of his State extremely well.\n  Oftentimes known as an open, multiple-use advocate, as both he and I \nare on the utilization of our public lands and their management, when \nit came to Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Teton National Park, \nthey were something special in Craig's mind. Oftentimes I would say: \nCraig, you are siding with the environmentalists on that issue.\n\n  He would laugh or smile and say: Larry, nothing is too good in \nprotecting Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Teton. They are the \ncrown jewels in the Nation and they are a major part of my State.\n  While we were very seldom in disagreement, there were times when \nthere was a bump-up now and then, as is typical amongst all of us who \nserve in the Senate, even though on most issues we found great \ncompatibility.\n  I am one amongst all who will miss Craig Thomas. He was a friend of \nlongstanding, a colleague. His wife Susan and my wife Suzanne had \nbecome good friends over the years, as so many of us do while working \nin the Senate. His life is taken from us and from the citizens of his \nState and from his family at a time when Craig Thomas was serving his \nState and his Nation well.\n  Again, to his wife and children, we are going to miss Craig a great \ndeal in the Senate. I, personally, as a friend, will miss Craig Thomas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I, too, rise today to pay tribute to our \nfallen friend, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Craig \nThomas. My wife Tricia and I were greatly saddened this morning when we \nrose and found out that Craig had lost his battle with this form of \nleukemia. The four of us have been together many times, socially and in \nbusiness settings. We have had some great experiences together in other \nparts of the world. We were so sad to learn he had passed away. It was \nheightened by the fact that he seemed to have done so well after his \nfirst round of treatment. It was a great pleasure to come on the floor \nover the last couple months and see him looking better every day. He \nseemed to feel good. So I was personally excited that he was going to \nwhip this thing. That was his attitude, as a true marine. He was \nfighting a battle to win.\n  He brought to the Senate a special down-to-Earth Wyoming wisdom, \nreflective of the unique part of the country he represented so well. \nCody, WY, where he was born, is a special place. Craig was the epitome \nof the people in that part of our great country. In a legislative body \nof sometimes showboats, lightning rods and mavericks, Craig was an \nengine of the Senate. He was not flamboyant. He didn't try to be. He \nkept plodding along, trying to find a way to get the right results and \nhelp the Senate do its job.\n  I have learned over the years there are some people in life, and some \nMembers of the Senate, who are tried and true, who can be depended on \nno matter what the issue is. Craig Thomas was one of those. He kept the \nSenate on point when we strayed from the big picture--with his \ngoodness, his common sense, and his affable manner. It is very easy to \nget fired up and lash out at an institution where we all come from so \nmany different backgrounds and are so passionate sometimes about \nissues. But Craig kept it cool, kept a level head, and kept moving \nforward. When we drifted off message, when we were too much into the \nweeds with our competing agendas, he didn't complain or rail or make \ndemands to fix it, he rounded up several of his colleagues, came to the \nfloor, and before long he had a way of helping us get back on track.\n  His resilience and self-reliance were emblematic of the open range \ncountry in which he was born. He was Wyoming to me, in all its rugged \nzest for community, Nation, and faith.\n  I was particularly interested in hearing our colleague, Senator Larry \nCraig, from Idaho, talk about his love of the outdoors, of Yellowstone, \nand his effort to preserve and improve that great national park. It was \none of the things he truly did love. He didn't talk about himself very \nmuch, but he spoke eloquently about the quality-of-life issues of his \nmostly rural West neighbors. He was, after all, a farmer. That is what \nhe got his degree in, in college--agriculture.\n  Of course, he served his country for 4 years in the Marines. That was \nkind of how he approached his job in the Senate. He came to get things \ndone, to get results for Wyoming, and the Nation. He was on the right \ncommittees to do that. He was on the Energy Committee, and I tangled \nwith him, one time in particular I remember, on the Energy Committee. I \ncame away knowing that, when you get in a tussle with Craig Thomas, you \nbetter bring your lunch because it will not be quick. It will take a \nlong time to work it out. But work it out we did.\n  He also served on the Finance Committee, where I had the pleasure of \nserving with him. He provided, again, good, solid, calm counsel and \nparticipation. It was that self-reliance, that selflessness that \ndiverted our attention from the tragedy his family was facing over \nrecent months. But that is how he wanted it. He was riding the Senate \nrange, keeping us on the trail, and helping us to stay with the big \npicture, to improve the quality of life of all those we represent.\n  Tricia and I extend our love, our thoughts, and our prayers to Susan,\n\n[[Page S7029]]\n\ntheir children, and Craig's loyal staff. We have lost a solid \nstatesman, and we will dedicate ourselves to keeping his spirit of \ngoodness alive in the Senate for all of those to come.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this is a sad time for the Senate. As we \ncontinue with the important business of the Nation, we pause for a few \nmoments to think about our common loss of one of our kindest, most \ndedicated, and most thoughtful colleagues, Senator Craig Thomas of \nWyoming. All of us have our own private memories of our relationship \nwith Craig. Mine is of him as a kind of silent leader, kind of an \natypical character, if you will, in the Senate.\n  When I got here 4\\1/2\\ years ago, someone alleged--and this is a \nbroad characterization--someone said: Welcome to the Senate, a place \nthat has 100 large egos and 200 sharp elbows.\n  I think what that person forgot to do was account for somebody such \nas Craig Thomas, who was never jockeying for the headlines and \nspotlight but always focused on his work and quietly, every day, made a \ndifference.\n  I learned firsthand in recent months, as I began working with a \nnumber of Senators on this side of the aisle, trying to encourage their \nactive participation in the floor debates, Craig understood it is open \ndebate and discussion in this, the world's greatest deliberative body, \nthat protects and extends democracy. Indeed, every week as we met, \nSenator Thomas would simply ask: What can I do, John? It is that \nfundamental desire to serve the public, the most basic and fundamental \nquestion of all that best characterized Senator Craig Thomas: What can \nI do?\n  He was a defender of American values. From his service in the Marine \nCorps to his time in the House and the Senate, he served with courage \nand integrity. Nowhere was that more apparent than in the way he served \nand handled his final illness. You never would have known that he had \nbeen through chemotherapy or that he was not feeling well. The only way \nyou would know is because his hair had fallen out as a result of the \nchemotherapy. It was almost back in its original form. But you never \nwould know from his attitude, which was always upbeat, always positive, \nnever looking for sympathy but simply, day in and day out, doing his \ndead level best to represent the people of Wyoming in the Senate.\n  He was known as one of the people's most staunch advocates, leading \nthe charge against Government waste and always fighting higher taxes.\n  In many ways, Senator Thomas was an example to all of us. In an \nenvironment that can sometimes turn too nasty, his friendly demeanor \nand his dedication to his country was always a reminder that public \nservice is more than a duty, it is a privilege. It can be conducted in \na way that does not turn political adversaries into personal enemies. \nIt can be done without bitterness, without anger, and with dignity.\n  I know Craig was honored to be able to represent the State of Wyoming \nand that the State of Wyoming was privileged to be served by such a \nman. Wyoming and the Nation now mourn the loss of this great Senator, \nthis great patriot, this fine husband and father, and this good man. He \nleft an indelible mark on the Halls of the Senate and America in \ngeneral. He will be missed.\n  For Susan and all the Thomas family, Sandy and I say to you, you are \nin our thoughts and prayers, as I know you are in the thoughts and \nprayers of countless millions of people all across this great land. In \nthese trying times, we are all comforted by the strong faith in God \nthat Craig exemplified, as well as the enduring legacy he left and his \npositive impact upon the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I listened to my colleague from Texas. I \ncome to the floor to add a word about my friend whom we have lost, \nSenator Craig Thomas. Craig was from the State of Wyoming. He was from \nthe northern Great Plains. Last evening, when I heard he had died, I \nspent a lot of time thinking about Craig and about this place.\n  Most Americans see the partisanship. This is actually a political \nbody, so it is not unusual there would be some partisanship. What most \nAmericans never have the opportunity to see is the friendship. This is \na small community of 100 Members of the Senate, men and women who come \nfrom every part of our country who are elected to serve. There is a \ngreat deal of friendship that exists in this Chamber, even in the \nmiddle of all of the politics that exists in our political system.\n  Senator Craig Thomas was an interesting and a wonderful man. I have \nhad, especially the last 6 months, an opportunity to work very closely \nwith him. I knew him as a Member of the House of Representatives. I \nknew him as a Member of the Senate and a colleague in both the House \nand the Senate. But the last 6 months we worked together, I as chairman \nof the Indian Affairs Committee and Craig Thomas as vice chairman of \nthe Indian Affairs Committee. We sat next to each other, hour after \nhour, hearing after hearing, and I got to know a lot about Craig Thomas \nthat I had not previously known.\n  His word was his bond. He was quick with a smile. A quiet man in many \nways, he cared deeply about his home State of Wyoming and cared deeply \nabout the future of his country.\n  Craig was a proud son of the American West who never, ever forgot \nabout the people he represented. His commitment to American Indians, \nand especially and particularly to those living on the Wind River \nReservation in Wyoming, was evident as I worked side by side with him \non the Indian Affairs Committee, as was his strong support for Indian \nhealth care and for all of the other services to Native Americans.\n  I was pleased to have the opportunity to work with him and to get to \nknow him and to admire his work. In recent months, of course, Senator \nThomas faced some very challenging health care issues with a very \nchallenging illness. He met those challenges with courage and with \ngrace. He never complained. I never heard him complain. In fact, it was \njust about 3 weeks ago at a hearing that I turned to him and said: You \nlook great. You really look terrific. He said: I feel good. I feel \ngreat.\n  He was a person with that kind of attitude. What a wonderful \ncontribution to the Senate. I think all of us here will miss a terrific \nfriend.\n  Let me end as I started by saying this is a political body. I know \nmost Americans see the evidence of that politics, so they see sometimes \nthe politics and the partisanship. What most Americans never have the \nopportunity to see is the friendship that exists on the floor of the \nSenate. Yes, even between those who from time to time are adversaries \nin debate but who understand each other and are friends with each \nother.\n  I had the privilege of working with Senator Thomas for many years in \nthe House and in the Senate, and particularly in the last 6 months as \nchairman and vice chairman of the committee. I will miss him dearly. I \nconsidered Senator Craig Thomas a friend. My thoughts and prayers today \nare with his wonderful family as well.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I join my colleagues in paying tribute \nto our friend and colleague, Senator Craig Thomas. I always said if I \ngot into a tough situation--using the allegory, a gunfight on Front \nStreet in my hometown of Dodge City, KS--I would want Craig Thomas by \nmy side. I also knew that he would be there.\n  In that regard, it was only 2 weeks ago that he and Susan, his wife, \ncorralled a group of supporters for me and we talked about his personal \nbattle. He was confident. As Senator Dorgan has indicated, he looked \ngood. And we joked with him of no longer being a member of the \nfolliclely challenged caucus.\n  His turn for the worse and sudden passing comes as a great shock to \nall of us. We served together in the House where, as in this body, he \nwas always a voice of reason, a man of trust, decency, and commitment. \nJust this morning he was described by a fellow colleague as a ``lovely \nman,'' a description that does not quite jibe with\n\n[[Page S7030]]\n\nCraig, a rough-hewn rancher with a gentle, quiet Wyoming demeanor, but \nit is a term that is true to the man.\n  I do not know of anyone who did not like or respect Craig Thomas. In \nthis day of rough and tumble public service and the Congress \noverflowing, it seems, in a cauldron of partisan discontent, Craig \ntranscended all of that.\n  In the end, the only thing any of us who have the privilege of public \ntrust has going for us is our word. Craig Thomas set the gold standard \nin keeping his word and our trust and our admiration.\n  The Senate, Wyoming, and our Nation have lost a steady hand and a man \nwho did much for his special State. He was dependable in the finest \nsense of the word. He never sought the center ring or the spotlight; \nthat was not his style. He was the epitome of a workhorse, not a show \nhorse.\n  I remember and I treasure our times together, especially when I first \ncame to the Senate. We both agreed the length of a conversation does \nnot tell anything about the size of the intellect. We also agreed that \nno matter who says what, you should not believe it if it does not make \nsense. Craig made sense. He did not need decorated words to make his \nmeaning clear. He spoke Wyoming, and Kansas for that matter.\n  Craig would take the floor during morning business, and in his calm, \nreasonable manner then discuss an issue of the day. And you sort of had \nto sit on the edge of your seat and lean forward, and as they say in \nhis beloved Marine Corps, listen up. He talked softly, he talked low, \nhe talked slowly, and he said a whole lot without saying too much.\n  To some of us in this body he was, and is, a fellow marine. In this \ncase, Semper Fidelis, always faithful, is most appropriate. As I said, \nif anyone faced trouble in their life, the one person you would want by \nyour side would be Craig Thomas. I shall miss him greatly as a personal \nfriend, confidant, and supporter.\n  Both of the offices I have occupied in the Senate were previously \noccupied by Craig. I just thought if they were good enough for Craig, I \nwould fit right in. There is a short book by Bix Bender called, ``A \nCowboy's Guide to Life.'' In it, he describes the code of the West and \nurges men of this common background to write it in hearts, to stand by \nthe code, and that it would stand by you. Ask no more and give no less \nthan honesty, courage, loyalty, generosity, and fairness.\n  Madam President, Craig Thomas embodied that code. Now, while our \nminds are full of sorrow and our hearts certainly heavy with his loss, \nCraig would not want that. In this regard, the words of Helen Steiner \nRice come to mind as our thoughts and prayers are with his supporter, \nfriend, and his wife Susan; his sons, Patrick and Greg; and his \ndaughter Lexie.\n\n     When I must leave you\n     for a little while,\n     Please go on bravely\n     with a gallant smile\n     And for my sake and in my name,\n     Live on and do all things the same.\n     Spend not your life in empty days,\n     But fill each waking hour\n     in useful ways.\n     Reach out your hand\n     in comfort and in cheer,\n     And I in turn will comfort you\n     and hold you near.\n\n  Bless Craig Thomas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, we did not think, coming back to the \nChamber a week after we had all gone our separate ways back to our \nStates, that we would come back with one of our Members not here. There \nis a drape over Craig Thomas's chair and a beautiful flower \narrangement.\n  But all of us who go through the day-to-day workings of the Senate, \nworking with our constituents at home, the pressures which we all know \nwe feel being 24/7 in a job that we love, but we all know the stresses \nand strains and therefore we bond because of the similarity of \nexperience. So when we all said goodbye at the end of last week, we did \nnot expect to come back and have one fewer Member. So I want to rise \ntoday to express my sadness for the passing of Senator Craig Thomas and \nto express my deepest sympathy for his wife Susan, their family, and \nthe people of Wyoming.\n  Senator Thomas served in Congress for 18 years, 6 years in the House \nand 12 years in the Senate. He had just been reelected to his third \nterm. But his service to the United States did not begin when he came \nto the nation's capital. It began in the Marine Corps, where he served \nfrom 1955 to 1959. Then he went back to Wyoming to work at the Wyoming \nFarm Bureau and then the Rural Electric Association. Later, he began a \ncareer in public service, winning an election to the Wyoming House of \nRepresentatives. Five years later he won a special election to succeed \nthen-Congressman Dick Cheney as a Member of the U.S. House, and 5 years \nafter that in 1994, then-Congressman Thomas won election to the Senate.\n  Craig Thomas used his real-life, rural background to champion a \npositive agenda for America's rural community. As a former chairman of \nthe National Parks Subcommittee, Craig Thomas authored legislation to \nprovide funding and management reforms to protect America's national \nparks in the 21st century.\n  He was honored by the National Parks and Conservation Association \nwith their William Penn Mott, Jr. Park Leadership Award. As a senior \nmember of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Thomas was instrumental \nin vital issues such as Social Security, trade, and tax reform. He was \nco-chair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus.\n  These are impressive accomplishments, but Senator Craig Thomas, the \nman, was just as impressive. Every time I called Craig to fill in for \nme when I was vice chairman of the Republican Conference, he was there. \nHe was on the executive committee as the vice chairman of the \nconference. Craig was the one I turned to the most to chair a meeting \nif I could not be there. He would talk on the Senate floor about the \nspecific issues that we were wanting to focus on at the time.\n  He was so well liked by everyone in this Chamber. I cannot imagine \nanyone ever saying they did not like Craig Thomas. His wife Susan is a \nvery special lady as well. She works with children who have \ndisabilities. She has made that her life-long mission. She is so loved \nand respected in the teaching community for the great work that she has \ndone.\n  So when all of us learned about Craig Thomas's illness late last \nyear, we all thought: Gosh, he is going to be a fighter. He is going to \ndo so well. And he did. He did do well. He fought it with immediate \nchemotherapy. He came back with less hair than he started with in the \nmonth of November, but we knew, as we were watching him progress, that \nhe was looking better and better and his color was getting better and \nbetter. Then when we all left last week, some knew he was going back \nfor another round of chemo. Many of us did not know. But no one in our \nbody realized how serious it was.\n  Yesterday, God did call him home. At the moment that he was called, \nhis wife Susan; his sons, Patrick and Greg; and his daughter, Lexie, \nwere all there with him. So our prayers shift now from recovery to \ncomfort, and we hope his family knows and the people of Wyoming know \nwhat a mark he made on this body. He will be remembered, and he \ncertainly is where the angels are because of his good nature and his \ngood deeds. We wish Susan and the family our condolences and our best \nwishes, and we hope all of us will be able to have the good memories \nwhen time begins to heal.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I join my colleagues in expressing my \nheartfelt condolences to Susan, the entire Thomas family, and the \npeople of Wyoming over the passing of our dear friend Senator Craig \nThomas. We have lost one of the truly great statesmen from this body \nwho always had a kind word and a smile for me in the hallway or here in \nthe well or in this body and anyone else he came across during the day. \nHe had a wonderful way of calming people down and making people feel at \nhome. I personally felt a kinship with Senator Thomas. Our offices were \nnot merely located in the same corner of the third floor of the\n\n[[Page S7031]]\n\nDirksen building, we were neighbors in every sense of the word. We also \nhad the distinction of serving together on both the Senate Finance and \nEnergy committees. Not a day would go by that we didn't share a ride in \nthe elevator or cross pathways in the hall or stand and visit with our \nstaffs together.\n  We also both came from rural States with similar needs, and we worked \ntogether to address many of the same issues the citizens of Wyoming and \nArkansas face. As one of the cochairs of the Senate rural health care \ncaucus, Senator Thomas was a true leader and a fighter, consistently \nfighting to improve access to health care for rural communities, \nespecially for seniors. We worked on several issues together to make \nsure our rural constituents had a voice on health care and many other \nimportant issues. Senator Thomas and I also were delighted to work \ntogether to improve tax fairness for the numerous disabled veterans who \nserved our country with dignity and honor and call Arkansas and Wyoming \ntheir home.\n  Senator Thomas was a tireless advocate for Wyoming and fought to \nensure that the interests of his State were always protected throughout \nthe legislative process. I can't tell you how many times I saw \ndifferent constituent groups from Wyoming lined up in the hallway to \nvisit with their very respected Senator. He was always accessible and \nalways made time for folks who traveled so far to see him. But he also \nmade time to visit with those who were there in the hallway, oftentimes \nmy constituents or staff members. He was never in too big of a hurry \nthat he couldn't stop and take the time to visit with someone, to share \nwith them a kind word or listen to what was on their mind or in their \nbusy schedule.\n  He has a tremendous staff. They all reflect the Senator's good \nnature. Working with his staff so closely in the neighborhood of the \nthird floor of Dirksen, they exemplify the courage and kindness of this \nincredible Senator they have served.\n  He was a tremendous public servant, and he served our Nation \ncourageously as a United States marine. He was a true gentleman and one \nof the kindest and most genuine people you would ever meet.\n  I am truly saddened by the loss of my friend, and my thoughts and \nprayers are with his dear wife Susan and the entire Thomas family. This \nSenate body, the State of Wyoming, and the American people have been \ntruly blessed by his life and his service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent to speak about the passing of our \ncolleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I was deeply saddened to learn last \nnight that Senator Thomas had lost his courageous battle against \nleukemia. Over the years, Craig and his wife Susan have become very \ngood friends to both me and my wife Lucy. I will greatly miss him in \nthis Chamber and, more than that, as a friend.\n  Senator Thomas and I cochaired the rural health caucus. We have \nworked closely, along with our staffs, on rural health care issues. You \ncouldn't find a more decent and honorable person than Craig Thomas. He \nis from Wyoming; I am from North Dakota. We didn't always agree \npolitically, but we always got along. I always felt I had a friend in \nCraig Thomas.\n  On health care, he and I partnered over several years to produce \ncomprehensive legislation to improve reimbursement levels for health \ncare providers in rural areas. During the legislation that passed on \ncomprehensive drug legislation, there were provisions included to, for \nthe first time in many years, improve reimbursement for rural \nproviders. It is not well known in the country or perhaps even in this \nChamber that rural institutions often get one-half as much to provide \nthe same treatment as more urban institutions. Senator Thomas and I \nfocused on those issues in the Finance Committee. Much of the \nlegislation that was included in the comprehensive drug legislation to \nfor the first time address that unfairness in reimbursement was \nlegislation Senator Thomas and I had offered.\n  We spent hours and hours together agreeing on the elements of these \nlegislative packages. Our staffs worked closely together. They became \nfriends.\n  This week we were planning to introduce together the latest version \nof our comprehensive rural health care legislation. This week will be a \npoignant one for me and my staff as we consider what might have been.\n  In the Senate Finance Committee, Craig and I worked closely together \non other issues that are important to our States. We had a shared \ninterest in the impact of trade on U.S. agriculture, whether it was \nunfairly subsidized foreign sugar or the Japanese and Koreans unfairly \nblocking exports of American beef. We also shared a deep interest on \nenergy policy because Wyoming is an energy State, as is North Dakota. \nWe worked together to boost transmission capacity and to support clean \ncoal technologies and to develop coal to liquid fuel technologies.\n  I can tell you Craig Thomas was a determined and principled Member of \nthis body. He had real convictions. They were never far from his heart. \nCraig Thomas was somebody who cared deeply about the people of Wyoming \nand the people of this country. He also was someone who could \nunderstand that others might have a different point of view. While \nCraig Thomas might not agree with you, he was willing to listen. He was \nalways willing to debate, but to do it in a gentlemanly way. I knew \nmany times when Craig and I were debating legislation we were going to \nintroduce, there were simply places he wasn't going to go. He was not \ngoing to go against certain deeply held principles. But he was willing \nto have a discussion about how we might accomplish the goal. That is \nsomething I admired deeply about Craig Thomas.\n  He was a tenacious advocate for improving health care for the many \nrural communities in his State and across the country. He was a fierce \nfighter for the people of Wyoming. Nobody could ever doubt that. He \nbrought that same strength and tenacity to his fight with leukemia. \nAlthough he must have been in pain in the last several weeks, he never \nlet it show. In fact, one of the last conversations I had with him was \nright here in the corner of this Chamber. I asked him how he was doing. \nHe was upbeat and positive. I sensed he was on the mend. So it was a \nreal shock to me to find out last night that we lost him. He continued \nto the very end to pursue his goals with courage and strength and as a \ntrue gentleman. We will miss Craig Thomas as a friend and a colleague. \nWe will miss that wry sense of humor. We will miss his ability to find \namusement in the daily workings of this body.\n  Most of all, we will miss his quiet smile and that twinkle in his \neye, because all of us know that is the Craig Thomas who became our \nvery good friend.\n  Lucy and I express our deepest condolences to Susan and to his four \nchildren and to the larger Thomas family. We also take this moment to \nexpress our condolences to his very dedicated, loyal, and highly \ncompetent staff. Craig Thomas had around him people with the same \nqualities he demonstrated, people of quiet dignity and people of real \ncompetence who worked very hard for the people of Wyoming and this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer for allowing me to come over at this point in time. I shall \ntake but a few minutes to address the Senate and the American public \nabout the passing of a dearly beloved colleague with whom I and other \nMembers of this great Senate have shared a friendship through the many \nyears.\n  Each of us is deeply saddened at the passing yesterday evening of \nthis valued friend and colleague. I first came to know him in 1995, \nwhen he took the seat of Malcolm Wallop. I had known Malcolm Wallop \nvery well, still know him quite well. He was a very strong-minded, \nable, tough U.S. Senator, tough in the sense that he was a man of \nresolute convictions.\n\n[[Page S7032]]\n\n  We wondered who would take his place. Craig Thomas took Senator \nWallop's place, and I think even Senator Wallop, were he here today to \naddress the Senate, would agree he has followed in the footsteps of \nmany great Senators who have come from the great State of Wyoming.\n  He also served as a Marine officer from 1955 to 1959. He entered as a \nprivate and was released as a captain. I say, with a sense of humility, \nI entered the Marine Corps as a private and parted, many years later, \nas a captain. Therefore, we had a special bond.\n  But he was able, through the years, to carry on I think one of the \ngreat attributes of the Corps--taught to all of us--and where I failed, \nhe succeeded. I used to have a nickname for him. I called him: Ramrod. \nHe did not have to say ``I was a marine'' because you could tell by the \nway he walked, the way he carried himself, and the way he had his chin \nalways projecting. That is the way we were taught in the Marines. It \nfell by the wayside with this humble Senator, but it never left the \nposture of that great marine and great Senator.\n  As marines served over the past 5 years on the tip of the spear \naround the world, all of our marines, particularly in Iraq and \nAfghanistan of recent, it was helpful for the Senate to have Senator \nThomas's perspective in looking out for our marines in a very special \nway.\n  He was very active in the Marine Caucus, meeting for breakfast at \n0800 in the morning, getting together, talking about years past, years \npresent, and years in the future. Each year, the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps would come over, and, quite understandably, the job fell \nto Senator Thomas, which he loved, to introduce the Commandant of the \nMarines.\n  I refer then to our Marine Corps Hymn, which all of us sing. And I \nquote one stanza:\n\n       Our flags unfurl'd to every breeze,\n       From dawn to setting sun.\n\n  The Sun has set on this great marine, and that is how I shall always \nremember him. Whatever the challenges facing us in the Senate, he was \nsteadfast, unruffled, and committed to the task at hand, like the \nmarine he was and always will be in our memories.\n  It is interesting, another characteristic of marines--our good \nfriend, Conrad Burns, being one, and to some extent myself--we tend to \nbe rather gregarious, somewhat undisciplined and rough and ready. But \nSenator Thomas was a very quiet man, very introspective in his \nthinking, with a smile on his face. But he could project his persona \nwithout some of the other attributes we marines pride ourselves in.\n  He chaired the Senate Rural Health Caucus. I am a member of that \ncaucus, and I stop to think--I do not know how many are members of it--\nit was an effective caucus. We got together particularly on issues of \nmedical care and how, through the past decades, that care has shrunk in \nthe rural areas because of the lack of young men and young women going \nin and practicing medicine and accepting the hardships and indeed the \nless pay the rural areas have. But he left his hallmark trying to \nencourage better medical care in those regions, which are in every \nState of our Union.\n  We both loved fishing. How many times we talked about trout fishing. \nHe always said to me: John, I have a very special stream, almost \nuntouched, largely unknown, but I will take you there someday, and you \nwill experience a trip you will never forget. I have missed that trip.\n  His constituents, his loving family, and, above all, his wife Susan \nare in our thoughts and prayers. I ask colleagues to stop and think on \nthose evenings when we got our evening engagements and we were, \nfortunately, going to be accompanied by our wives, that Susan would \nstand watch at the door of the Senate. I can see that spot. As you \napproach the Chamber, it is on the left, right there next to the \ncolumn. I would always see her and wave a ``hello.''\n  So I say to her and her family, thank you for sharing in our lives \nthe richness of the life of your Craig Thomas.\n  From one marine to another, I simply say: Fair Winds and Following \nSeas to you, sir. Semper Fi.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I am deeply saddened at the passing of my \ndear friend, Wyoming's senior Member, Senator Craig Thomas. We have \nlost a truly dear and courageous Member of this body, whose absence \nwill be felt. I had the pleasure of serving with Senator Thomas for \nmany years, both in the U.S. House of Representatives and here in the \nSenate since his election in 1994. I found him to be a true statesman, \nof great character, with a passion for serving others.\n  He grew up on a ranch in Cody, WY, and never forgot his roots, as he \ncontinuously advocated for rural communities and our natural resources. \nHe graduated from the University of Wyoming with a degree in \nagriculture, and served our country proudly for 4 years in the Marines.\n  During his tenure in Congress, he forged a distinguished legislative \nrecord on issues as diverse as public land management, agriculture, \nfiscal responsibility and rural health care. It was a great pleasure \nand honor to serve with Senator Thomas on the Senate Subcommittee on \nNational Parks, both when he was chairman and I was the ranking member, \nand most recently, when our roles were reversed this Congress. Working \nwith Senator Thomas was a joy and privilege due to his positive and \noptimistic attitude. We were able to accomplish many notable things \nduring our tenure together, as we always worked in a bipartisan manner, \nputting the needs and challenges of the parks and public lands before \nall else.\n  I also had the privilege of working with Senator Thomas on the Indian \nAffairs Committee. As the ranking member of the committee, he took \nseriously his responsibility to address the needs of our country's \nindigenous people. Knowing of the challenges faced by our Native \ncommunities throughout the country, he worked tirelessly to improve \ntheir quality of life.\n  I extend my heartfelt condolences and deepest aloha to Senator \nThomas's wife Susan and their four children. They should be proud that \nhe lived a full and purposeful life, and had a positive impact on the \nlives of so many. He will be sorely missed. Our prayers and support are \nwith them as they walk down this difficult path.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, words cannot express how sad I am that \nmy good friend Craig Thomas passed away last night. We will all truly \nmiss his tenacious advocacy on issues, his incredible sense of humor, \nand his upstanding character and integrity. The Senate will not be the \nsame without him.\n  I have known Craig for almost 20 years. I first became friends with \nhim when we both served in the House of Representatives. We continued \nour friendship in the Senate, where I had the great fortune of serving \nwith him on both the Senate Finance and Senate Energy Committees.\n  Craig was a tireless advocate for Wyoming issues. He was an effective \nleader in energy, public lands, tax, trade, health, and rural community \nissues. We stood side by side on many issues, and I always felt we \ncould accomplish any project because I had Craig by my side.\n  He and I worked closely on energy issues in both committees. Craig \nwas skilled at keeping his eyes on the details that mattered to the \npeople back home in Wyoming. Recently, we worked together on a small \nissue in the landmark Energy Policy Act of 2005 that he helped craft. \nWe learned that western coals, because of their naturally low sulfur \ncontent, would be excluded from certain clean coal programs for failing \nto remove the high percentage mandated by the bill. This was one of \nthose little things that slipped by many people but not Craig. We have \nalready fixed the problem in the Tax Code and are now working to do the \nsame in the Energy Committee. It was the little things he did for the \npeople of Wyoming that made him such a great Senator for his State.\n  Craig also pushed to make sure that both his State and the Nation had \nan effective energy policy. Just a couple of weeks ago, Craig and I \nsponsored an amendment during markup of the Energy Committee biofuels \nbill to attempt to push coal-to-liquids technology into reality. Thomas \nbelieved this would help both the people of Wyoming by providing more \njobs and cheaper energy costs and would help the Nation by reducing our \nreliance on Middle East oil. And although this amendment failed in \ncommittee, his dogged determination showed through\n\n[[Page S7033]]\n\nbecause he planned to continue fighting this issue on the Senate floor.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Susan and his children, \nLexie, Greg, Patrick, and Peter. They have shown incredible courage and \nstrength the past few months.\n  I am honored to have known Senator Thomas. He impacted all of our \nlives and will be sorely missed.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I appreciate this consideration. I \nrealize we must move to the legislation before us, the issue of \nimmigration, but I wanted to take just a few minutes this afternoon to \nstand in tribute to my friend, to our friend and colleague, Senator \nCraig Thomas.\n  I think it is fair to say that this is very difficult for all of us \nhere in the Senate. It has been described that we are a family. We are \nfriends. My neighbor Senator Thomas and I have sat on this back row \ntogether for this past year. I sit next to him in the Energy Committee. \nI sit next to him in the Indian Affairs Committee. He is a friend and a \nman whom I will miss very deeply. To learn this morning of his passing \nleaves me truly with a hole in my heart. I can't imagine the depth of \nloss the family and his wife Susan are feeling at this point.\n  We recognize that we were privileged to serve with a truly incredible \nman. I haven't served with him as long as many of my Senate colleagues. \nI came to know him really from a very personal perspective. I was \nfascinated with the fact that he is a true cowboy. I have always kind \nof thought that cowboys never die. He was claimed by a very terrible \ndisease, a very terrible cancer, leukemia. Alaska mourned the loss of a \nyoung woman just last year who was claimed by leukemia. She was a \nworld-famous dog musher. In Alaska, we say dog mushers, real famous dog \nmushers never die, either. So, again, my heart is very heavy.\n  When I got up this morning and saw on my BlackBerry the news of \nSenator Thomas, there was a second BlackBerry that came to me from one \nof the pages who served here in the Senate just last fall. She was one \nof the winter pages. I was very touched by the note she sent to the \nhead of the page program, and she forwarded me a copy of it as well. I \nwant to read just a paragraph from her e-mail to me because I think it \nreflects how Senator Thomas touched the lives of so many--not just his \ncolleagues and not just the people of Wyoming but a young 16-year-old \npage from Alaska. She wrote:\n\n       My class and I witnessed some of the stages of Senator \n     Thomas' sickness, but we never witnessed him getting upset or \n     angry because he was feeling down and overtired due to his \n     symptoms and treatments.\n       Senator Thomas was a cheerful man, always smiling and \n     personable, even when he was not being approached. He did not \n     have to address us at all; we were pages, mere peons in the \n     infrastructure of what we know as the Senate. Yet, every time \n     he entered the Senate, he warmed the room with his smile and \n     a warm glow that protruded gently from his kind eyes. When he \n     would speak to us, he did so with the utmost respect and \n     thoughtfulness, truly treating us as equals. He never looked \n     down on us, and I believe that is why his memory has stayed \n     with me and will continue to do so in the future.\n       What made Senator Thomas remarkable, aside from all this, \n     was that at the end of the day when we were at our lowest \n     point and we felt so tired we couldn't help but frown, he was \n     the one that no one ever caught frowning. He was a great \n     Senator, and from what I have had the chance to witness \n     firsthand, a great man. I am deeply sorry for this loss, and \n     I hope that this e-mail will attest to that. His actions and \n     his kindness were not lost on us.\n\n  This was signed:\n\n       With utmost respect and deepest sincerity, Former U.S. \n     Senate Page, Lily George\n       From Anchorage, AK.\n\n  I thought it important to share that e-mail with my colleagues \nbecause, again, Senator Thomas was one who generated warmth with \neverybody he reached out to, whether they were pages or Senators or \npeople in the airport. We will miss him very deeply here in the Senate.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, today we pay tribute to Senator Craig \nThomas, whom we unfortunately lost to cancer last night.\n  Our thoughts, prayers, and sympathy go out to his wife Susan and \ntheir children during this difficult time.\n  I had the opportunity to work closely with Senator Thomas on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  He was a leader in the energy, agriculture, water resources and \nagricultural issues that affected his State.\n  I highly respected his low-key, behind-the-scenes manner of getting \nthings done.\n  He was forward looking: he believed that ``clean technologies'' were \na solution both to environmental pollution and to our dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  On the Finance Committee, he was a dependable vote for fiscal sanity, \ntax simplification and cutting spending.\n  It is said around here that there are ``work horses'' and ``show \nhorses.'' By that measure Senator Thomas was certainly a work horse. He \ndid not aggressively seek the limelight. Instead he worked quietly and \ndiligently, with integrity, to get things done for Wyoming.\n  We will miss his knowledge, competence, and his friendship.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am deeply saddened by the death of my \nfriend, Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming.\n  Craig Thomas was a popular figure in his hoe State of Wyoming, \nwinning a third term last November with 70 percent of the vote. He was \nknown both at home and in Washington as honest, hard-working, decent, \nand effective.\n  He came to the Senate in 1989 through a special election to fill the \nvacancy left by Dick Cheney, who had been named Secretary of Defense. \nHe won that race with 52 percent of the vote. By the year 2000, Senator \nThomas's popularity had soared, and he won reelection with 74 percent \nof the vote--one of the largest margins of victory in Wyoming history.\n  Senator Thomas's record of public service reaches back well before \nhis tenure in the U.S. Senate. Prior to his election to the Senate, he \nserved 5 years in the Wyoming Legislature, and four years in the U.S. \nMarine Corps.\n  His positions on the Finance Committee, Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, and Environment and Public Works Committee allowed him to be \nan advocate for issues such as conservation and fiscal conservatism. He \nwas a champion of issues of concern to rural America such as \naffordability and access to quality health care services.\n  Senator Thomas's home State of Wyoming is not unlike my State of \nMississippi, and we often worked side-by-side on issues that face our \nStates. He fought to improve the quality of life for the people of \nWyoming and was a strong advocate for the agricultural sector of our \neconomy. He was tireless in urging the importance of public land \nmanagement and conservation of our natural resources.\n  Craig Thomas will truly be missed in the U.S. Senate. He reflected \ngreat credit on this body. It is my hope that the spirit of fairness \nand decency he represented will continue to be mighty valued in the \nSenate as a mark of our continued appreciation of him and his exemplary \nservice to our Nation.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndear colleague and a tireless advocate for the people of Wyoming, \nSenator Craig Thomas.\n  Muhammad Ali once said, ``Service to others is the rent you pay for \nyour room here on Earth.'' Senator Thomas paid his rent in full.\n  No truer to his State could a man be than Craig Thomas was. Born and \nraised on a ranch outside of Cody, WY, he grew up in the Wyoming public \nschool system, attended the University of Wyoming, served as president \nof the Wyoming Farm Bureau, general manager of the Wyoming Rural \nElectric Association. He served in both the House and Senate and \nreturned to his State every weekend, visiting hometowns and parks, \nnever losing sight of his constituents and their needs.\n  His commitment to this country led him to serve with great \ndistinction in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1955 to 1959. Before being \nelected to the U.S. Congress, he held office for 5 years in the Wyoming \nState Legislature, where he got his start in politics. And throughout \nhis distinguished political career, Craig Thomas became known for his \nleadership on issues so critical to the well-being of Wyoming, issues \nlike rural health care access, fiscal responsibility, and the \nprotection of our Nation's park lands. As cochair of the Senate Rural \nHealth Caucus, he urged Congress to continue its support for rural \nhealth programs like the Community Health Centers Program, which \nprovides services to over 16 million\n\n[[Page S7034]]\n\npeople living in underserved areas. This is only one of the many \nlegacies he leaves behind.\n  I am sorry I could have not served longer with Senator Thomas. My \nmemories of him are as a kind, quiet, and humble man. He commanded \nenormous respect from us all, and had a clarity of vision that did not \ngo unnoticed. In the face of a life-threatening illness, he returned to \nwork this year with the conviction of a cowboy who knows that if you \nget thrown from a horse, you have to get up and get back on. His \ncourage throughout this tremendous battle will continue to inspire \nthose of us who follow him.\n  On this sad occasion of his passing, Michelle and I extend our \ndeepest condolences to the members of his family, especially his wife \nSusan and his four children, to his staff, and to the people of \nWyoming. I join my colleagues and fellow Americans who are praying for \nthem and mourning their loss during this time of grief.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President. I rise to honor the memory of \nSenator Craig Thomas, who passed away last night, Monday, June 4, at \nNational Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD.\n  I knew Senator Thomas--as we all did--as a quiet gentleman, and a \ndedicated advocate for the people of Wyoming.\n  My heart goes out to his wife Susan and to their four children.\n  Senator Thomas died of acute myeloid leukemia, which he had been \nfighting for several months.\n  All of us are familiar with Senator Thomas' courage, because we saw \nit here, in the Capitol, and on the floor of the Senate.\n  He came here to do his duty, even though he was fighting a disease \nthat would ultimately take his life. That is the mark of true courage--\nnot at all surprising, coming from this son of the American West.\n  Senator Thomas was raised on a ranch near Cody, WY. He attended \npublic schools, and graduated from the University of Wyoming at \nLaramie, earning a degree in agriculture.\n  After college, he served 4 years in the Marine Corps. Then he went on \nto become vice president of the Wyoming Farm Bureau, and general \nmanager of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association.\n  He served 5 years in the Wyoming State Legislature. In 1989, he was \nelected to the House of Representatives in a special election to \nreplace Dick Cheney, who had been named Secretary of Defense. He was \nelected to his first term in the Senate in 1994.\n  Senator Thomas was reelected to his third term last year, with 70 \npercent of the vote.\n  Here, Senator Thomas was a strong voice for the people of his home \nState.\n  This included working to improve health care opportunities for rural \nfamilies, work he pursued as a senior member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, and as cochair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus.\n  Senator Thomas served as chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee, \nand his work was recognized many times by the National Parks \nConservation Association.\n  The organization honored him with its William Penn Mott Jr. \nLeadership Award, and with the National Parks Achievement Award.\n  I had the distinct pleasure of working with Senator Thomas on some \nissues close to my heart.\n  Earlier this year, he was part of a bipartisan coalition that joined \nwith me, and with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, to extend the sale of \nthe breast cancer research stamp, which has raised $54.9 million for \nbreast cancer research.\n  Last year, Senator Thomas joined with me to cosponsor legislation to \naward the Congressional Gold Medal to His Holiness, the Fourteenth \nDalai Lama, in recognition of his message of compassion and peace.\n  And Senator Thomas and I collaborated on a plan to use Wyoming Powder \nRiver Coal to produce cleaner electricity, which would be sold to \nWestern States, including California.\n  Senator Thomas served Wyoming and the Nation well. He will be greatly \nmissed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute and bid \nfarewell to my colleague and friend, my neighbor from the great State \nof Wyoming, Senator Craig Thomas.\n  Craig brought a quiet dignity to this august Chamber. He was a \nSenator with the heart of a cowboy. We all knew that he would rather \nhave been on horseback in the Wyoming prairie than in Washington, DC, \nbut this was where the people of Wyoming needed him to be. Indeed, all \ncitizens of America benefitted greatly from his presence in Washington, \nDC.\n  Craig was the champion of rural America. He quietly but tirelessly \nfought for the hard-working people of rural America, the people who \nprovide us with food and energy, the wool-growers, the cattlemen, and \nthe farmers. If ever there were a question on agriculture, Craig was \nthe man to see. During his tenure in the U.S. Senate, we all relied \nheavily on Senator Thomas's expertise and leadership on agriculture, \nrural development, and many other important topics debated by this \nbody.\n  We served together on the Senate Finance Committee where he would \noften entertain us with his stories and experiences. I truly enjoyed \nlistening to him and hearing about his great State of Wyoming. Craig \nhad a way of dealing with the complex issues facing the Finance \nCommittee that was very direct and meaningful. He had a way of \ndistilling the complex tax, trade, and health care issues down to their \ncore and ensuring that real people, with real concerns were addressed \nby the policies created in the Finance Committee.\n  I have had the distinct privilege of sitting next to Craig in \ncommittee meetings, in briefings, in lunches, on the floor, and in \nseveral other settings, and I can tell you he was always a gentlemen. \nHe was always a caring legislator, and he was always a true and loyal \nfriend.\n  Craig earned great stature and prestige in the time he spent as a \nleader in the U.S. Marine Corps, the Wyoming Farm Bureau, the Wyoming \nState Legislature, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. \nSenate. I am honored to have served beside him for so many years in the \nSenate, and I will miss my friend dearly.\n  I join with my colleagues in offering my condolences to Senator \nThomas's family, especially his widow, Susan. My thoughts and prayers \nare with them on this day as we mourn the loss of a great Senator but \ncelebrate the life of our great and dear man. The people of Wyoming \nwill certainly thank Susan and the rest of the Thomas family for \nsharing their beloved Craig with them, and I believe the entire Nation \nwould join with me in thanking Susan for sharing her great husband with \nus. He represented the good people of Wyoming in such a capable and \ndignified manner, and I know they are going to miss him. In fact, the \nentire Nation is going to miss him.\n  In this instance, I believe it is appropriate to quote the beloved \ncowboy song and say to Craig, ``Happy trails to you, till we meet \nagain.''\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I was deeply saddened to hear of the \nsudden passing of my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Craig Thomas. The \nloss we all feel at his passing is tempered by the happy memories I \nhave of working with him on so many issues of mutual interest. His \nefforts and his leadership on the panels on which we served together \nthe Senate Finance Committee, Senate Agriculture Committee, and Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee--will remain foremost in my \nmemory. I particularly admired his staunch advocacy for the needs of \nrural communities and farmers. Craig brought a special passion and \nexpertise to issues affecting ranching families. His focus on their \nunique needs spanned the trade, economic, environmental, and public \nlands management issues of rural communities.\n  Craig brought to Congress his vision for the needs of Wyoming and \nrural States, and he became a strong advocate of effective resource and \nenergy policies. I am pleased to have partnered with him in applying \ntechnologies to improving our Nation's energy generation. Although he \nlived his life modestly, he became a leader in national park \nstewardship, and the American people owe him a debt of gratitude for \nhis promotion of the underserved National Park System. I also \nappreciated his long and thoughtful counsel on ways to update the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  In recent months, Craig took a prime role on the Finance Committee in \nworking to simplify the Federal Tax\n\n[[Page S7035]]\n\nCode and improve entitlement and health care assistance to the least \nfortunate. As one who took to heart the importance of protecting the \ntaxpayers' dollars, Craig was a strong proponent of restoring the \nsustainability of our Nation's welfare system. And Craig understood \nthat economic development in rural States like Wyoming was inextricably \nlinked to trade promotion that ensured open and fair markets abroad. I \nwill miss his stalwart and consistent advocacy for farming communities \nas the Senate considered trade legislation.\n  As a man who represented a small State in population, Craig towered \nlarge over the landscape of thoughtful conservative Members of \nCongress. I think a fitting tribute and legacy to our late friend would \nbe to adopt his resolution making July 28 National Day of the Cowboy. \nMy thoughts and prayers are with Craig's family and friends. I will \nmiss my good friend and colleague.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, last night, the State of Wyoming lost a \nfine statesman and a true gentleman with the passing of Senator Craig \nThomas. Senator Thomas was a strong advocate for his State and its \ninterests. He fought hard for his priorities, and I especially admired \nhis tireless advocacy for our Nation's beautiful parks and wilderness. \nHe also worked hard for the priorities of rural Wyoming and indeed all \nof rural America, fighting hard to improve health care infrastructure.\n  Senator Thomas dedicated his life to serving his country and his \nState. After graduating from the University of Wyoming, he joined the \nMarines and began his long career of service. Even when faced with his \nfinal battle with cancer, he continued to fight on for Wyoming and \nserve with distinction.\n  But the Senate lost not only an outstanding advocate but a wonderful \nperson. More than anything, I will remember Senator Thomas as a man who \ncarried himself with dignity and who treated all of his colleagues with \nrespect, despite party differences. More than any debate, committee \nhearing or piece of legislation, it is his warm smile that I will \nremember most. I know he did a fantastic job representing the State of \nWyoming, and I am honored to have known and worked with him.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends during this \ndifficult time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President:\n\n     I saw the sun sink in the golden west\n     No angry cloud obscured its latest ray.\n     Around the couch on which it sank to rest\n     Shone all the splendor of a summer day.\n     And long though lost to view, that radiant light\n     Reflected from the skies, delayed the night.\n\n     Thus, when a good man's life draws to a close,\n     No doubts arise to cloud his soul with gloom,\n     But faith triumphant on each feature glows,\n     While benedictions fill the sacred room;\n     And long, long do men his virtues wide proclaim\n     And generations rise to praise his name.\n\n  It is with deep sorrow--deep sorrow--that I note the passing of our \ncolleague Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming. He was my friend. He always \npassed here and I would say: How are you doing today, Cowboy?\n  First elected to the Senate in 1994, Senator Thomas was twice \nreelected to the Senate by some of the widest margins in his State's \nhistory, one time reaching 75 percent of the vote. It is hard to beat \nthat.\n  As has already been mentioned today, he was one of the very few \npeople from Wyoming to have represented his State in both houses of the \nCongress, over there and over here. Here in the Senate, I found him to \nbe a most considerate and patient colleague. He was always willing to \nstep aside for another Senator who sought recognition. He was a nice \nman, a very quiet man with a radiant smile, staying out of the \nspotlight, working behind the scenes, always ready to cooperate and \nwork with others for the good of our country. He was a good, decent \nhuman being.\n  Yes, we represented different political parties. Yes, we sometimes \nheld different political views, and we came from vastly different parts \nof the country, but we shared important common interests and \nobjectives. With his State of Wyoming being the No. 1 coal-producing \nState in the Nation and my State of West Virginia being No. 2, I always \nappreciated his support for clean coal technologies and legislation \nthat promoted the use of coal. I always appreciated his interest in and \nsupport of our country's beautiful and magnificent national parks. As \nchairman of the National Parks Subcommittee on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, he sponsored legislation that both protected and \npromoted these national treasures.\n  Just as this former marine dedicated his life to his country, he \ndedicated his career in the Senate to improving the quality of life for \nrural America. As cochairman of the Senate rural health caucus, he \nworked tirelessly to improve the quality of rural health care. He was \ntruly a fine Member of this institution and a great American who will \nbe missed by his colleagues, certainly by me, and by the people of \nWyoming.\n  I express my sincere condolences to his wife Susan, to his sons and \nother members of his family, to his staff, and to the people of \nWyoming. All of us will miss Senator Thomas. But we will always retain \nour very fond memories of him, Craig Thomas. Bless his soul. May God \nbless him.\n  I repeat these few verses in his memory:\n\n     Let Fate do her worst,\n     There are relics of joy,\n     Bright dreams of the past,\n     Which she cannot destroy;\n     Which come, in the night-time\n     Of sorrow and care,\n     And bring back the features\n     That joy used to wear.\n\n     Long, long be my heart\n     With such memories filled,\n     Like the vase in which roses\n     Have once been distilled;\n     You may break, you may shatter\n     The vase, if you will,\n     But the scent of the roses\n     Will hang round it still.\n\n  Goodbye, Craig. I will miss you. But we will meet again on that far \nshore where the roses never wither and the flowers never fade.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I am going to have a statement printed in \nthe Record, but I did wish to say something this evening before the \nevening is over about our colleague, Craig Thomas. Craig was a \nwonderful friend of all of us. In my case, being a fellow Westerner, I \nhad a special affinity for Craig. He was a fellow I could talk to--\nwithout talk. Particularly a cowboy such as Craig can communicate with \nyou in a real Western way that doesn't require a whole lot of ``jibber-\njabber,'' as he would say.\n  Craig was a man of the earth. He really was a cowboy, and a good one \nat that. He took that kind of set of Western values, of not talking a \nwhole lot but meaning what he says and saying what he means, into the \npolitical life. When he came to the Senate, I think everyone \nappreciated that quality in him.\n  By the way, I would say he reminds me of my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Alabama, in that regard. You never have any doubt about where the \nSenator from Alabama stands and you never had any doubt about where \nSenator Craig Thomas stood. That is a quality we need in our public \nofficials today.\n  Craig's wife Susan is a wonderful friend of mine and of my wife \nCarol. Our hearts go out to her and their family tonight. But she does \nhave, at least, I think, the solace in knowing that people all over \nthis country--not just from their home State of Wyoming--have \ntremendous respect for the achievements of her husband Craig and the \nway in which he handled himself as a Member of the Senate, never \nletting an ego take over what he understood to be his primary \nresponsibilities.\n  He was quiet and he was humble. He was serious and he was very hard \nworking. He stood up for the interests of the people of his State. He \nwas a great patriot for the United States of America. But he never took \nhimself so seriously that he gave even a hint of pomposity or being \nsomeone who didn't understand where he was grounded.\n  We will miss Craig Thomas immensely. We will never forget him as a \nloyal friend, a patriot, and someone who was quintessential in the way \nhe represented his area of the United States and, in particular, his \nconstituents in the State of Wyoming.\n  I thank the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Kyl for his good \nremarks. I thought perhaps tomorrow I would have the ability to focus \non our\n\n[[Page S7036]]\n\nloss, but I will attempt tonight to say a few words about our \ncolleague, Craig Thomas. I loved Craig Thomas. He was a person who came \nfrom the West. He understood where he came from. He understood the \nvalues with which he was raised, and he reflected those daily in his \nwork in the Senate without ever bragging about it or talking about it. \nPeople just knew it. He was a man of character and integrity, a man \nwho, as Senator Kyl indicated, never allowed personal ego to interfere \nwith his commitment to serve his constituents and his Nation.\n  We had a visit to Iraq together not too long ago. Things had not been \ngoing well. He would ask penetrating questions. He would ask: When are \nthe Iraqis stepping up and how much are they doing so? How long do we \ncontinue to put our troops at risk if they are not carrying their load?\n  He did it in a way that was sincere and raised fundamental questions \nof great importance.\n  Craig liked issues. He believed in a series of principles that made \nAmerica great. He cared about those principles. For a time, he \nvolunteered to come to the floor and be a part of a message team for \nthe Republican Senate Members and spent a good bit of time at it--over \na year or two. During that time he would articulate the basic premises \nand values that I think are foundational for the Republican Party and \nfor most Americans.\n  I would say to our wonderful friend Susan, our prayers and our \nsympathies are with you. We can only imagine the loss you have \nsustained. We have watched in these past months the courage that Craig \nhad displayed as he suffered from the terrible disease that he had. We \nsaw the strength that he had, his refusal to stay at home but his \ndetermination to be at work. I had several examples of it in which I \ntalked to him, and I said it is not necessary for you, you need to rest \nup. He knew he was susceptible to infection. But he was determined to \nfulfill his responsibilities as a Senator and he did so in a way that \nall could be proud.\n  He ran the race and he fought the fight. He served his country with \ngreat skill and ability. Our respect and love is extended to the family \nand our prayers are with him and the family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I am aware of the hour of the \nrecess, and I will be very brief. But I wished to come and express my \ncondolences to the family of Senator Thomas and to share for them, \nspread upon the pages of the Congressional Record, the fact that a \nfaithful member of the weekly Senators Prayer Breakfast was Senator \nThomas.\n  The gathering is private, Senators only. All Senators check their \negos and check their partisanship at the door and join together as \nfriends in a spiritual setting.\n  What a delight it was for this Senator to share that collegiality \nwith Senator Thomas on a weekly basis in the proceedings of the Senate. \nFor that friendship, that collegiality, I am especially grateful.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/05/senate-section/article/S7036-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I see Senator Allard on the floor to move \nforward with his amendment, and we will be using the time between now \nand 3:30, obviously, for debate on the subjects.\n  I understand the Senator from Alaska wishes to take--how long would \nthe Senator like?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Three minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Murkowski are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1189\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 1189 \nwhich strikes the supplemental schedule for Zs. We are scheduled, I \nunderstand, to vote on it around 3:30 or so. So I wish to take a few \nmoments to talk about my amendment, which I think addresses a great \ninequity in the bill, one that rewards lawbreakers over law abiders. \nIronically, this inequity is in the same section of the bill that \nrewards would-be immigrants based on merit. To be clear, I strongly \nsupport ending chain migration. I think the bill moves us in that \ndirection, and I think that is\n\n[[Page S7037]]\n\ngreat, and then moving us to a system of merit-based immigration. \nHowever, I believe all applicants under the merit-based system should \nbe on a level playing field.\n  By now, I believe most of us are familiar with the bill's merit-based \nsystem which awards points to immigrants based on criteria such as \nemployment, education, and knowledge of the English language. What many \nof us may not know is the enormous advantage the bill's point system \ngives to people who have violated our immigration laws relative to \npeople who are seeking to enter this country legally. I am referring to \nthis so-called supplemental schedule for Zs which my amendment strikes. \nThis separate schedule awards up to 50 bonus points--points that are \nunavailable to people who have never broken our immigration laws--to \nholders of Z visas seeking permanent status.\n  Holders of Z visas are defined as lawbreakers in the bill. In fact, \nthis bill specifically requires that an alien prove that he or she \nbroke the law in order to even be eligible for the Z visa. In effect, \nthis supplemental schedule rewards people who enter the country \nillegally. Worse yet, it disadvantages other qualified people who seek \nto enter this country legally.\n  The bill's stated purpose of adopting a merit-based system is that \nthe United States benefits from a workforce that has diverse skills, \nexperience, and training, and I happen to agree. I am simply not \nconvinced that a history of breaking the law contributes to this goal \nmore than education and actual experience on the job. So my amendment \nsimply strikes the special schedule that makes people who have violated \nour immigration laws eligible for 50 percent more points than anyone \nelse. Z visa holders would, however, still be eligible for up to 100 \npoints under the regular schedule--the exact same number as anybody \nelse. We should not reward those who have broken the law, and we \ncertainly should not punish those who have abided by the law.\n  Now, an argument that has been made against this amendment is that \nsomehow or other it will strike at the heart of the AgJOB provisions. \nMy amendment does nothing to limit the number of agricultural workers. \nThe number of H-2A agricultural visas remains uncapped. Under current \nlaw and under the bill, there is no numerical limitation on \nagricultural visas. Even though it is unlimited, only about 35,000 H-\n2As are issued each year. If this bill passes, anywhere from 12 million \nto 20 million illegal aliens will instantly gain legal status. The \nquestion is: Are those people not able to fill these agricultural jobs? \nOf course they are.\n  My amendment addresses people who are applying for citizenship, not \nwork, under the new merit-based system. It puts applicants for \ncitizenship on a level playing field whether they worked in \nagriculture, whether they worked in construction, whether they worked \nin tourism, or whether they worked in any other industry. On the one \nhand, you say you want a merit-based system in the bill, and on the \nother hand, you say you want to give preferences to certain classes of \npeople. My argument is simply that you can't have it both ways, and my \namendment simply levels the playing field.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to level the playing \nfield under the merit-based evaluation system, which I think is a good \nidea. I would urge my colleagues to vote for the Allard amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Pennsylvania \nis recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for his \namendment and for his analysis. I understand the reasoning and the \npoint behind what he is seeking to do.\n  The preference, which is contained in the proposed legislation, was \nstructured in an elaborate arrangement with what has been accurately \ncalled the very fractional coalition. In order to get certain other \nconcessions in the bill, it was deemed necessary to give this \npreference to the agricultural workers. You can justifiably raise an \nissue as to why give a preference to agricultural workers, and the \nanswer, although not very satisfactory, is because it is part of an \ninterwoven accommodation on many provisions of the bill. That is why, \nas one of the managers of the bill, I am constrained to object and to \nurge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I understand and appreciate the ranking \nmember's position on this particular piece of legislation. This part of \nthe bill is not well drafted, and I hope we can get this amendment \npassed and then send a message to the conference committee that this \npart of the bill needs to be worked on so that we don't allow people \nwho are here illegally an opportunity to step ahead of those citizens \nwho have come here legally. If we can adopt my amendment, then I think \nthe will of the Senate gets clearly expressed to the conference \ncommittee, and hopefully the problem with the drafting that has \noccurred with this section of the bill can be straightened out and \npreserve the compromise that the ranking Republican from Pennsylvania \nis striving to hold on to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on the issue as to the contention by the \nSenator from Colorado that they are moving ahead of people who are here \nlegally, factually I believe that is not so. The bill is structured to \nclear up the backlog of all of those people who are waiting now, and \nthey will have their status resolved in an 8-year period--those who are \nfollowing the procedures which are legal at the present time.\n  It is after that occurs that the 12 million undocumented immigrants \nwill come in, and then there will be points preference for those among \nthe illegals who are here, who are the farm workers. I do not believe \nwe are putting anybody who is here illegally ahead of those who are \nhere legally.\n  Mr. ALLARD. If I may respond, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. This is where the issue comes up. It is not exactly clear \nin this paragraph where it provides supplemental points for \ncitizenship, or when in time it begins to apply. If it gets applied in \none way in the bill, then the argument my colleagues make is probably \nvalid. But if it gets put in another place in the bill, my arguments \napply. This is where we have a drafting problem within the bill.\n  My hope is that with the adoption of my amendment we will call this \nto the attention of the conference committee, and this can be rectified \nwhen we go to conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is the seventh day that we have been \non this legislation. We voted on 17 amendments. There are 13 others \npending to the bill. We will be voting on those very soon.\n  Over the past week, as the Senate has been in recess for Memorial \nDay, we witnessed a healthy debate across the country as Americans \nacross the political spectrum have expressed their views on this \nlegislation. Some support our legislation, others oppose it. With all \nof the editorials and newspaper articles and phone calls from the \nconstituents, one theme occurs loud and strong: Americans know our \nimmigration system is broken and they want us to fix it. This week we \nhave a chance to meet that challenge for the good of the Nation.\n  We have a bipartisan bill before us. It has the support of the \nPresident. I believe when we complete the debate in the Senate we will \nadopt it. It enforces our borders; it cracks down in the workplace by \ngoing after employers who hire illegal workers; it brings the 12 \nmillion families who are here out of the shadows; it speeds up the \nreunion of families waiting legally in line who otherwise may never \nmake it here; it sets up an immigration for the future that continues \nto reunite families, while stressing our Nation's economic needs. That \nis our program. It is strong, practical, and it is fair.\n  I know the Senator from Illinois is looking to address the Senate. \nFirst, I want to speak briefly on the Allard amendment.\n  The Allard amendment seeks to strike a blow at one of the central \npillars of comprehensive immigration reform, which is the earned \nlegalization program for undocumented people who are working and \ncontributing in the United States. Virtually every demographic snapshot \nof the American public supports a practical solution for\n\n[[Page S7038]]\n\nbringing the undocumented population into the light of day. The tough \nand practical solution contained in the bill requires undocumented \nworkers to pay hefty fines and penalties, undergo background checks, \nclear up back taxes, learn English, continue working for a period of \nyears in a probationary status, and go to the back of the line. Only \nafter 8 years, after getting right with the law and proving their \ncommitment to becoming Americans, are these workers provided an \nopportunity at legal permanent residence.\n  The Allard amendment seeks to nullify that shot at the American \ndream. It does so by eliminating the separate point schedule included \nin the bill for Z visa holders and the agricultural job applicants. The \npoint schedule for Z visa holders and AgJOB applicants is designed to \ndetermine when they can apply for permanent residence, not whether they \ncan apply. Eligibility to apply for permanent residence is earned by \ncomplying with tough requirements. I just mentioned them--paying fines, \nworking hard, learning English, going to the back of the current line, \nand reentering the country legally.\n  The intent of the Allard amendment is to require undocumented \nimmigrants to compete with other future intending immigrants under the \nnew merit-based system. There are two different merit systems, one for \nthe temporary and one for agriculture. The amendment of the Senator \nfrom Colorado eliminates the one designed for agricultural workers. But \ngiven the merit-based system and the strong preference for the highly \neducated, this amendment is an attempt to keep the undocumented workers \nfrom ever obtaining permanent residence.\n  The educational profile of the undocumented workforce is such that \nthese workers will never, ever be able to compete in a meaningful way \nfor the pool of merit-based green cards. As such, if it were to pass, \nthe amendment would create a permanent underclass of lower skilled \nworkers living here in legal limbo indefinitely without the rights or \nopportunities afforded to legal permanent residents.\n  Similar situations are played out in other countries, resulting in \nhighly problematic, even disastrous consequences. That is not the \nAmerican way. I hope people will vote no on the amendment.\n  Mr. President, the aspect of this legislation that deals with the \nagricultural workers is called the AgJOBS bill. Senators Craig and \nFeinstein are two of the principal sponsors. I have been a long-time \nsponsor. We are talking about agribusiness primarily in California but \nalso in other parts of the Nation. We are talking about an agreement \nthat was worked out between the farm workers and the agribusiness. \nThese are two groups of people who have been at each other's throats \nfor years. I was here when we abolished the Bracero Program, basically \nthe exploitation of workers in the United States. It was a shame and a \nstain on the American workforce ethic. Then we had, over a long period \nof time, with the leadership of Cesar Chavez, an attempt to get justice \nfor probably about 900,000 agricultural workers, who do some of the \ntoughest work that is done in this country. No question, half of them \nare undocumented--probably 600,000 or 700,000 is the best estimate we \nhave. They have been able to work out an agreement between agribusiness \nand these farm workers, which we basically included in this bill.\n  What we were saying, basically, under the earlier provisions is that \nthey would be able to gain the opportunity for getting a green card in \n5 years. Under this legislation, it is 8 years they have to wait. They \nhave to demonstrate that they have worked hard in the agricultural \nsector. They have to demonstrate that they paid their taxes and that \nthey are attempting to learn English, and they have to meet all of the \nother requirements. At the end of that time, this legislation says to \nthose people who have been a part of our system that they will have \nsome opportunity to get a good deal of credit for working in \nagriculture in America.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Colorado strikes that provision. So \nthese individuals who will be competing with the other provisions that \nhave been put into this legislation for the more skilled--there are \nprovisions in there for lower skilled, but it is basically for the \nhigher skills. This undermines the core part of this kind of agreement \nthat was made. There are a number of provisions in this legislation we \nhave spelled out. There is border security and the local law \nenforcement, which are important; and there is AgJOBS, the DREAM Act, \nwhich the Senator from Illinois has fought for and made sure was \nimportant. There are other very important features in this legislation.\n  What we would basically do with the Allard amendment is say we are \ngoing to change the mix, change the system. We have worked out a system \nsaying agricultural workers are important. They have been able to work \nout their agreement. There were 67 Members of the Senate who signed on, \nRepublicans and Democrats. We basically incorporated that, although we \nhave extended the time for those workers. The effect of the Allard \namendment, as I read it, is that we are saying that is not an agreement \nthat we are going to continue to be committed to. We are going to say \nthose undocumented workers are going to have to compete with those who \nare more highly skilled.\n  This legislation is a balance between the AgJOBS, the DREAM Act, and \nthe fact that we are going to permit those 12\\1/2\\ million people who \nare undocumented now to live here without fear of deportation and \ncontinue their jobs and give them, if they meet these other \nrequirements after 8 years, in the next 5 years the possibility of \ngetting a green card, and 5 years later be able to get citizenship with \na long time in between, with heavy fines. The Allard amendment would \nundermine this understanding and agreement in a way that will \ndisadvantage in a significant way the agricultural workers and other \nlow-skilled individuals in this whole process.\n  I think in that sense, as the Senator from Pennsylvania pointed out, \nit would be unwise and unfair from a policy point of view.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the Agriculture Coalition for Immigration Reform saying:\n\n       We write to urge your opposition to the Allard amendment . \n     . .\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Agriculture Coalition for\n\n\n                                           Immigration Reform,\n\n                                                     June 5, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: we write to urge your opposition to the \n     Allard amendment #1189, scheduled to be voted on late this \n     morning.\n       By striking the merit point schedule for Z-visa workers, \n     the amendment would have the practical effect of eliminating \n     incentives for all workers subject to the merit system, \n     including farm workers, from providing the work necessary to \n     sustain our economy in the future. Retaining the experienced \n     agricultural labor force is essential to stabilizing the farm \n     labor crisis while consular capacity and farmworker housing \n     are built over a period of several years to allow agriculture \n     to rely more heavily on a reformed H-2A program.\n       This amendment directly undermines the merit point system, \n     which is critical to the successful implementation. of Title \n     VI. Title VI is essential to American agriculture in ensuring \n     a stable and legal agricultural workforce.\n       ACIR urges that you oppose this amendment. We also have \n     letters from Colorado agricultural groups opposing this \n     amendment.\n       Thank you for your support for fixing America's broken \n     immigration system and solving the worsening farm labor \n     crisis.\n           Sincerely,\n     Luawanna Hallstrom,\n       ACIR Co-Chair, Harry Singh & Sons, CA.\n     Craig J. Regelbrugge,\n       ACIR Co-Chair, American Nursery & Landscape Assn., DC.\n     John Young,\n       ACIR Co-Chair, New England Apple Council, NH.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Illinois. I will \ntake a moment, if we have time, to go through this excellent letter \nthat expresses reservations and opposition to the Allard amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I have been \nallocated 18 minutes to speak on behalf of amendment No. 1231.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like the Chair to notify me when I have spoken \nfor 8\n\n[[Page S7039]]\n\nminutes, and I will reserve time for Senator Grassley who will also \ncome to the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1231\n\n  This immigration bill is long overdue. Our immigration laws in \nAmerica have failed us. Since 1986, when President Reagan issued \namnesty, we thought for a long time we had laws on the books that would \nstop the inflow of workers from overseas. We were wrong. Up to 800,000 \ncome into our country each year. Three-fourths of them stay. When you \ndo the math over a 20-year period of time, you realize how we ended up \nwith 12 million undocumented workers in America.\n  Our immigration system has failed. Let me salute Senators Kennedy, \nSpecter, and all those who worked on trying to rewrite these laws.\n  You can turn on the television any afternoon or evening and hear the \nscreamers on the cable channels telling you how terrible it is that we \nare considering this law. Think for a moment. Those people screaming \nabout this effort are endorsing what we currently have--a broken down, \nfailed system that is unfair to the workers of America, unfair to our \nNation, and unfair to those who were here working as part of our \neconomy.\n  What Senators Kennedy and Specter are trying to do is fashion a way \nthrough this madness to a law that will work. Are we sure it is going \nto succeed? Of course not. We cannot be sure. This is just the best of \na human effort. But what they have tried to do is build into this \nconcept basic principles. One of those principles that I think should \nbe the bedrock of our discussion is this: Under this bill, we will have \nhundreds of thousands of new people coming into the United States each \nyear to work. The arguments are made that we need them to pick crops \nthat Americans don't want to pick. I think that is a fact. Also, we \nneed them to fill jobs that many Americans don't want to take. Go to \nany packinghouse, whether it is a meat or poultry house in America--I \nknow a little bit about that; that is the way I worked my way through \ncollege. Those are tough, dirty, hot jobs--and you will find many \nundocumented workers there because, frankly, people don't absolutely \nwant to work in these places. We need to bring in these workers to fill \njobs that Americans are not going to take.\n  Then there is another level of workers, those who have skills that we \nneed in this country. When Bill Gates of Microsoft says: I need the \nopportunity to bring in software engineers so Microsoft can expand its \nproduction operations in America, and if you don't give me that chance \nto bring in foreign engineers, I am going to have to put a production \nfacility overseas where I can find the same engineering talents, well, \nI want those jobs in America. I want those production facilities in \nAmerica. I am willing to listen to his request for H-1B visas.\n  Whether we are talking about AgJOBS, jobs in these packing houses or \njobs in Silicon Valley, we should have one guiding principle, and the \nguiding principle is this: Hire Americans first. Hire Americans first.\n  Under this bill we are considering, the guest workers who come in are \nsubject to that requirement. Someone cannot ask for a guest worker to \ntake a job if there is an American that will take that job first. But \nthere is a glaring loophole. The loophole says: If the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Labor announces there is a labor shortage in an area, \nthen they waive the requirement to look for American workers first. But \nwe, in this bill, fail to define what a labor shortage is. What does it \nmean? It means a lot of employers will be off the hook. They will be \nable to bring in guest workers and never ask an American to take the \njob. I don't think that is right.\n  Senator Grassley and I have introduced this amendment. It eliminates \nthis loophole, eliminates this labor shortage exception, and makes it \nthe hard-and-fast rule when it comes to guest workers that we must hire \nAmericans first. I hope my colleagues will take a look at this and \nconsider it.\n  Let me say a few words about the H-1B visa. Senator Grassley and I \ntook a look at these H-1B visas. These are special visas with specialty \ntalents to come in because there are not enough Americans with those \ntalents. We took a look at those H-1B visas and, unfortunately, there \nare some companies that are gaming the system. There have been exposes \nacross America where these so-called H-1B brokerage houses have been \ncreated. These are not high-tech companies looking for people with H-1B \nvisas. These are companies, by and large in India, that try to bring in \nIndian engineers to fill jobs in the United States.\n  The H-1B visa job lasts for 3 years and can be renewed for 3 years. \nWhat happens to those workers after that? Well, they could stay. It is \npossible. But these new companies out of India have a much better idea \nfor making money. They send the engineers from India to America to fill \nspots--and get money to do it--and then after the 3 to 6 years, they \nbring them back to India to work for the companies that are competing \nwith American companies. They call it their outsourcing visa. They are \nsending their talented engineers to learn how Americans do business and \nthen bring them back and compete with those American companies. Is that \nwhat we have in mind here? Is that our goal, to create more \nopportunities for people to create businesses around the world to \ncompete with us? I think not.\n  Senator Grassley and I are trying to tighten up the H-1B visa. We \nwish to make sure that only those who are absolutely necessary are \nbrought in, and, first and foremost, that we fill job vacancies with \nAmericans who are out of work and Americans who are graduating from \nschools and developing the skills that are needed. Our first \nresponsibility, whether it is in guest workers or H-1B visas, is to \nhire Americans first.\n  The amendment the Senate will consider in a short period of time, No. \n1231, which Senator Grassley and I have offered, applies to the guest \nworker program. But it comes down to this basic concept, and I hope my \ncolleagues will support me: Shouldn't this new guest worker program \ninclude the same protections for American workers? I think they should. \nOtherwise, in the future, we are going to see companies advertising \nthat no Americans need apply for these jobs. We don't want that to \noccur. We wish to make it perfectly clear that companies doing business \nin the United States must first give priority to American workers; that \nthey are bound by law to do that.\n  Plain and simple, that is what the Durbin-Grassley amendment will do. \nThis amendment is supported by the labor community, including the AFL-\nCIO, the Laborers' Union, the Teamsters, and the Building Trades.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the AFL-CIO \nsupporting the amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2007.\n     Sen. Richard J. Durbin,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I write to \n     offer strong support for your ``Recruit Americans First'' \n     amendment to the Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity, and \n     Immigration Reform Act (S. 1348). Your amendment would \n     prevent employers from avoiding compliance with the bill's \n     domestic worker recruitment requirement.\n       S. 1348 would require employers to recruit workers from the \n     domestic workforce before hiring guest workers under the new \n     Y guest worker program. However, this recruitment requirement \n     would be waived if the Secretary of Labor determined that \n     there is a labor shortage in the occupation and geographic \n     area in which the employer seeks guest workers. The bill does \n     not specify any standards to be employed in making this \n     determination, which would be left solely to the discretion \n     of the Secretary. The Durbin amendment would strike this \n     waiver so that all employers petitioning for Y guest workers \n     would be required to recruit workers from the domestic \n     workforce before hiring Y guest workers.\n       Thank you for your continued efforts to improve the pending \n     immigration reform bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               William Samuel,\n\n                                                         Director,\n                                        Department of Legislation.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment, and I reserve any time remaining for Senator Grassley, who \nwill be coming to the floor shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 7 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S7040]]\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the quorum time be equally divided between opposing sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the pending amendment, offered by the \nSenator from Illinois, is unnecessary because American workers are \nfully protected under existing law. This amendment would simply slow \ndown the process, have a 90-day delay, require advertising, which is \nunnecessary, and would thwart the efforts of people undertaking \nimportant activities to get necessary workers.\n  The current statute and regulations provide that:\n\n       The Secretary of Labor must determine that there is a \n     shortage of U.S. workers and that the hiring of foreign \n     workers will not adversely affect the wages or working \n     conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed in the \n     following occupations: physical therapists, registered \n     nurses, and aliens of exceptional ability in the sciences or \n     art.\n\n  Now, there can hardly be any doubt, as it is a matter of common \nknowledge, about the shortage of registered nurses. That is \nillustrative of the kinds of jobs which can be filled not to the \ndetriment of American workers because there has been a determination \nmade that in these categories there are no workers available. With \nregard to the category of aliens of exceptional ability in the sciences \nor art, the regulations specify the following:\n\n       Include college and university teachers who have been \n     practicing their science or art during the period of their \n     immigrant petition and who intend to stay in the same \n     occupation in the United States.\n\n  Another category provided under the regulation:\n\n       Applicant with exceptional ability is one who possesses a \n     level of expertise above that which would normally be \n     encountered in the field.\n  Now, while that is a generalization, it can certainly be sensibly \napplied. The regulation further provides that:\n\n       Applicant would need to provide evidence of the applicant's \n     widespread acclaim and international recognition by \n     recognized experts in the alien's field, such as the Nobel \n     prize.\n\n  What we have in effect at the present time is a system which is \nadequate to protect the American workers. The Senator from Illinois is \nno more concerned about the protection of the American workers than the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, but the question is how we get there. What \nthis amendment essentially does is to delay the process. The nurse \nexample is perhaps the best. It is well-known that we have an \ninsufficient supply of nurses in this country. If we have somebody who \nis not an American citizen, an alien, who is qualified to be a nurse, \nwhy not make that nurse available to a hospital which needs a nurse? \nWhy not make that nurse available to a nursing home which needs a \nnurse, rather than have a delay and have advertising?\n  If the system offered by the Senator from Illinois works, they do no \nbetter than what the Secretary of Labor has undertaken to do. The \nSecretary of Labor can be trusted to be interested in protecting \nAmerican workers, but there is a determination that there is a \nshortage. So this amendment is not only unnecessary, it would be \ncounterproductive.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand I have 8 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is now 7 minutes, due to the quorum call.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Chair will notify me when I have 3\\1/2\\ minutes, \nI would appreciate it.\n  Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by my colleague from \nIllinois. I think it makes a needed change in the legislation, one that \nwill help provide additional protection for American workers, and I \nthank him for calling the issue to our attention.\n  The amendment is very simple. It would require every employer who \nwants to bring guest workers into the country to advertise for and \nrecruit American workers first. This is a general principle that has \nbeen agreed to, certainly by me and my colleagues, and one that I am \nsure most Members of the Senate would support.\n  Senator Durbin's language ensures this principle is implemented \nfairly and effectively with respect to all employers who are looking \nfor more workers. Specifically, it eliminates an exception in those \nareas where the Department of Labor has determined there is a shortage \nof U.S. workers in the occupation and area of intended employment.\n  The shortage occupation idea relies on an exception in existing law \nwhich applies to green cards but not in the temporary worker context. \nSo I agree with Senator Durbin that in the context of ensuring that \ntemporary workers do not unfairly compete with Americans, we do need an \nexception to this rule. This legislation is based upon the principle \nthat guest workers should only be brought in if Americans cannot be \nfound to fill these jobs, and what better way to ensure this is the \ncase than to require all employers advertise these positions broadly.\n  I know there are some Members who might say that since this exception \nonly applies when the Department of Labor says there is a shortage of \nworkers to fill these jobs, that we shouldn't require employers to \nadvertise. I would argue the opposite: Because we know employers are \nseeking more American workers, they should easily be able to meet the \nrequirements under these laws.\n  I mean, the fact remains you might have a shortage in a particular \narea or region designated by the Department of Labor, but there may be \nhospitals in those areas that have more than they need; with other \nhospitals having less. If those other health facilities are looking, \nthey are probably investing in trying to find additional workers and \nare probably advertising in any event. This makes sure they are going \nto give the first opportunity--and there are other requirements in the \nlegislation that give the first opportunity to Americans to be \nprotected.\n  It doesn't seem to me this would be onerous or more costly. It may \nbe, for example, that elsewhere in the country there are Americans who \nare willing to fill these jobs. Maybe there are groups of Americans who \nhave traditionally been overlooked or discriminated against who will \nwant to know of these opportunities so that they can have a fair \nchance. For all these reasons, I support the amendment, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do so as well. I think it makes a good deal of sense, and \nI would hope that it would be accepted.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I wish to speak on the bill for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to discuss amendment No. \n1231. I cosponsored this amendment with the senior Senator from \nIllinois to protect American workers. The amendment would require \nemployers who intend to hire foreign workers to first recruit and find \nAmericans to do the job.\n  The bill before us creates a new guestworker program, known as the \n``Y'' visa program. I support this guestworker program. In fact, I \nvoted to keep this program in the bill when the Senator from North \nDakota offered an amendment to strike it.\n  I have consistently said that I support new and expanded avenues for \nwilling workers to enter the United States and work for employers who \nneed them.\n  Our country's employers want to hire legal immigrants. They need a \nbetter program, and one that allows nonseasonal or nonagricultural \nworkers to come here.\n  We have programs--such as the H-2A and H-2B visas--to bring in \nwilling workers. But, there are some jobs that\n\n[[Page S7041]]\n\ndon't fit these categories. For example, in Iowa, we have meatpacking \nand egg processing facilities that require low-skilled workers. Yet \nthey do not have a legal channel to bring in workers. Our existing visa \ncategories don't help them. The ``Y'' visa program will.\n  But, the bill is flawed in that it doesn't require these employers to \nfirst recruit Americans. Companies who use the ``Y'' visa program \nshould try to find U.S. workers first.\n  How can anyone argue against that? Why not offer the job to U.S. \ncitizens before bringing in more foreign laborers?\n  Under the bill, employers who use the ``Y'' visa program may be \nrequired to recruit U.S. workers through their State agencies, job \nsites, and trade publications.\n  Some employers will be required to ``first offer the job with, at a \nminimum, the same wages, benefits and working conditions, to any \neligible United States worker who applies, is qualified for the job and \nis available at the time of need.''\n  But, as throughout this entire immigration bill, there are waivers, \nexceptions, and ways of ducking out of such requirements. The authors \nof this bill make it seem as though Americans will be recruited first. \nHowever, these requirements are at the discretion of the Secretary of \nLabor. The Secretary can decide who has to fulfill these requirements.\n  The Durbin-Grassley amendment will ensure that all employers who use \nthe ``Y'' visa program are looking first at U.S. citizens before \nlooking abroad. I think that is what we all want. We should agree to \nthis amendment for the sake of American workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Since nobody is seeking the floor, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum and ask that time be charged against all sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, we are drawing to a close here. I have \nmost of the time, I believe. I want to make a few comments on my \namendment and then yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to Senator Kennedy. I think he \nneeds that to wrap up arguments on his time. I will be glad to yield \nhim that time.\n  My amendment strikes the supplemental schedule for Zs. Basically this \nsection of the bill provides an advantage for those who came in \nillegally in applying for citizenship, as opposed to those who came \nlegally.\n  This is a question of basic fairness. I know there is debate related \nto one part of the workforce as to another part of the workforce. I am \nnot concerned about that. I am concerned about this as a basic fairness \nissue. I believe this supplemental schedule for Zs rewards those who \ncame here illegally, and could disadvantage those who came legally. I \nam here to ask that the Members of the Senate support my amendment, \nbecause the bill's stated purpose of adopting a merit-based system is \nthat the United States will benefit from a workforce that has diverse \nskills, experience, and training.\n  I happen to agree with that. However, I am simply not convinced that \na history of breaking the law should contribute to this goal more than \neducation or even experience. So my amendment simply strikes the \nspecial schedule for Z visas that allows people who have violated \nimmigration laws eligible an additional 50 points. Z visa holders \nwould, however, still be eligible for up to 100 points under the \nregular system, the exact same number as anybody else.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the Allard amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his graciousness \nin yielding a minute and a half.\n  I am opposed to the Allard amendment. We have in this legislation \nvery important commitments to, one, the AgJOB workers, and we have also \nsaid for the 12 million: If you pay the fines, you go to the back of \nthe line, you work hard, you demonstrate you are going to be good \ncitizens for the 8 years until all of the line is cleared up, and we \nhave a way for dealing with these individuals to permit them at least \nto get on the path for a green card and eventually citizenship.\n  The Allard amendment changes all of that framework. Under the Allard \namendment, we were basically saying to those who are working in \nagriculture, because as his amendment shows, they get a big chunk of \npoints on this kind of thing, that that would be eliminated, and that \nagricultural worker who has been playing by the rules, who is a part of \nthe AgJOB's bill, will lose out in any kind of competition in terms of \ngreen cards and the opportunity to move on into citizenship, because \nthe other one will have the skills, will have the points, and those \nagriculture workers and the other lower skilled workers will not have \nthe opportunity to do so. It will change the framework of the bill in a \nvery important way. I know he is looking for equity in terms of all \nworkers here to be able to start a new day. We have worked long and \nhard in terms of the ag workers in terms of how we are going to treat \nthe undocumented, how we are going to treat newer workers. We have \nworked that out.\n  It seems to me that is the fairer way. We can look to the future with \nthe new merit system, but we ought to be able to meet our commitments, \nwhich this bill does, to those who have been a part of this system and \nare playing by the rules, and to whom we have made a commitment.\n  I hope his amendment would not be accepted.\n  I think the time has about expired, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, on amendment No. 1189, I would ask for the \nyeas and nays, and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  All time has been yielded. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2\n\n[[Page S7042]]\n\nminutes of debate, equally divided, on the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this immigration bill will offer an \nopportunity for hundreds of thousands of people to come to the United \nStates and go to work. But I believe there should be one guiding \nprinciple behind this bill: First offer the jobs to Americans. Those \nwho are unemployed, those who are developing the skills should have the \nfirst chance to fill these jobs.\n  Senator Grassley and I have a bipartisan amendment which eliminates \nthe loophole and makes it a requirement, when it comes to guest \nworkers, that the jobs first be offered to Americans to fill. I think \nthat is a reasonable starting point for any debate on immigration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment would simply delay \nunnecessarily the hiring of important people, such as registered \nnurses. We currently have an elaborate system, where the Department of \nLabor makes a determination that there will not be a loss of American \njobs in certain special categories and that it will not depress wages.\n  This will simply impose a 90-day waiting period. For example, a \nregistered nurse who is needed in a hospital would have to wait 90 \ndays. There would be the expense of advertising.\n  The purpose of this amendment is already satisfied under existing law \nto protect American jobs, and the amendment ought to be defeated.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Under the previous order, the question occurs on agreeing to \namendment No. 1231, offered by the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) \nare necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I would like to enter a unanimous consent \nrequest, but I will wait until Senator McConnell, the Republican \nleader, arrives.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to a number of my colleagues \ntoday--in fact, within the past hour or so. There has been a concern by \nthe minority that there have not been enough votes on this bill.\n  Keeping that in mind, I am going to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest that would allow 20 votes. I will outline it as follows: I ask \nunanimous consent that at 5:45 today, the Senate vote in relation to \nSenator Kennedy's alternative to Senator Cornyn's amendment No. 1184; \nthat immediately upon the conclusion of that vote, the Senate vote in \nrelation to Senator Cornyn's amendment No. 1184.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I agree \nin concept with what is being proposed by the majority leader, and that \nis that we start voting on pending amendments. The amendments mentioned \nin the unanimous consent request are all amendments that were proposed \nprior to the recent recess of the Senate. So I am in favor of moving \nforward and allowing our colleagues votes on the various proposals, \nmany of which have been offered some time back.\n  I do not agree with the implication that, at that point, we would \nthen be finished with the bill, or that further amendments would be \nlimited. Many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle have been \npatiently waiting to get amendments in the queue. Some have waited on \nthe floor for long periods of time only to be told there would be an \nobjection to their amendments being called up.\n  I propose to the majority leader that we allow the managers to \ncontinue to set up votes on pending amendments. I even encourage \nSenators on this side of the aisle to keep their remarks quite short in \norder to process additional amendments.\n  I think it is premature to file cloture on this bill and cut off \ndebate on amendments. If we can continue to let the managers work in \ngood faith on setting votes on the amendments, we will have given this \nimportant national issue an opportunity for the kind of fair process \nthat it deserves. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to propound another request. \nBased upon my distinguished colleague's statement, that we have spent a \nlot of time on this immigration bill--and every minute of it has been \ndeserved. As Senators will recall, the vehicle that was brought to the \nfloor was the bill that passed the Senate Judiciary Committee last \nyear. It was believed that by spending more time on a bipartisan basis \na substitute could be reached, and that was done. We now have before \nthe Senate a substitute amendment that has been bipartisan in nature, \nwith 10 Senators, Democrats and Republicans, having worked this out. \nMr. President, we have had a number of votes. Keep in mind the \nsubstitute amendment that is now before the Senate is a result of a \nnumber of things, not the least of which is all the work that went into \nthe bill that did not go forward last year.\n  We had numerous votes, and the Democrats and Republicans who put \ntogether the substitute took all that into consideration when they came \nup with the substitute. So we don't need the same number of amendments \nwe had last year.\n  I think we should have amendments, and I am going to propound a \nrequest. This does not limit amendments or limit amendments in the \nfuture. As we all know, once cloture is invoked, all germane amendments \nare subject to votes following that cloture vote during the 30 hours. \nSo we have today, Tuesday, Wednesday, and you will see that we would \nalso have Thursday under one of the proposals I am going to offer. But \nmy concern is, when is enough enough? We have a number of \nconsiderations here that are so important to our country. I recognize \nthe importance of immigration, and I am going to do everything I can to \nmake sure people feel they have had an alternative to the substitute \nthat was offered. But there has to be a limit as to the amendments \nSenators offer.\n\n[[Page S7043]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that tomorrow the Senate vote \nin relation to Senator Sessions' amendment No. 1235; further, that the \nSenate vote in relation to the Feinstein amendment No. 1176; further, \nthat the Senate vote in relation to the Inhofe amendment No. 1151; \nfurther, that the Senate vote in relation to the Cornyn amendment No. \n1250; further, that the Senate vote in relation to the Menendez \namendment No. 1194; further, that the Senate vote in relation to the \nClinton amendment No. 1183; further, the Senate vote in relation to the \nSessions amendment No. 1234; further, that the Senate vote in relation \nto the Dodd amendment No. 1199; further, that the Senate vote in \nrelation to the McConnell amendment No. 1170; further, that the Senate \nvote in relation to the Lieberman amendment No. 1191; further, that \nalternative Democratic and Republican amendments be in order in \nrelation to each of the above amendments, and that the time for each \nvote be set with the concurrence of both leaders and both floor \nmanagers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object for the very same reason \nI just stated a few moments ago, the majority leader indicated that \namendments that were germane would be voted on postcloture. Of course, \nthat is only if they are pending. One of the problems we have had is \ngetting an adequate number of amendments pending. The best way to go \nforward--I remind our colleagues, and certainly my friend the majority \nleader, that it was I on the day I was chosen Republican leader who \nsaid this Congress ought to do big things, and I mentioned two. One was \nSocial Security. It appears to me that we are not getting anywhere on \nthat. The other was immigration. I commend the majority leader for \nturning to it, but the minority is not going to be shut out.\n  This is a big, contentious, complex matter. We had well over 20 \nRepublican amendments the last time this issue was before the Senate. \nThe best way to process this bill is not for the majority to try to \nstuff the majority--that won't happen, I assure you--but, rather, to go \nthrough the process in an orderly way. And with this kind of rhetorical \nback and forth, it continues to waste time that could be used in \noffering, debating, and voting on the maximum number of amendments, \nwhich would allow us to get to the point where we can get cloture on \nthe bill and to final passage. Therefore, I object.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the reason here is a little unusual. We have \n12 amendments pending. After these are voted on, other amendments will \nbe offered and should be offered. There is no reason to cut off what we \nhave talked about here as being the only amendments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is filed today \non the substitute amendment, it not ripen until 6 p.m. Thursday, June \n7.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, would the majority \nleader restate the consent request?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to do that. I ask unanimous consent that if \ncloture is filed today on the substitute amendment, it not ripen--there \nnot be a vote on it--until 6 p.m. Thursday, June 7, rather than \nThursday morning. That would give us another day.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have tried to set up 20 votes in relation \nto amendments, including Democratic and Republican alternatives. We \nalso tried to vitiate the need for a needless second cloture vote on \nthe bill itself, if the substitute amendment is ever adopted. Lastly, \nwe tried to delay the cloture vote until Thursday evening so Members \nwould have more time to debate and dispose of amendments.\n  Each effort, I am sad to report, was objected to by our Republican \ncolleagues. So as far as I am concerned, they are in no position to \ncomplain that they did not get votes on amendments prior to cloture. We \noffered them votes.\n  First of all, in this part of my presentation, I want to express my \nappreciation to those who have worked so hard on this bill, and I hope \nthey will continue to work on this bill. I made a suggestion, and here \nit is. If they can come up with something better, more power to them.\n  I have devoted a lot of the Senate's time to this measure, not only \nthis year but last year when I was working with Senator Frist. It is an \nimportant piece of legislation. The immigration system is broken and \nneeds to be fixed. We have an obligation to the American people to do \nthat. Do I think whatever we come up with will be perfect? No. But we \nhave, with the help of the President, the opportunity to take this \nmatter to the House, have them work on it, and then again with the \nPresident's assistance get to conference and come up with something \nthat would be better than what we passed out of the Senate.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues are not going to use this as an \nexcuse that they have not had enough amendments offered. That really is \nnot fair, and it is wrong. I say again that I appreciate the work of \nthe managers. Senator Kennedy has worked very hard to work his way \nthrough this bill, as have Senators Kyl, Sessions, Cornyn, and people \nwho may not be in support of the bill but at least have tried to \nimprove it.\n  Mr. President, there is one thing I didn't ask. My staff informed me \nthat I did not ask this: I ask unanimous consent that if the substitute \namendment is agreed to, the bill be read the third time, and the Senate \nvote, without intervening action or debate, on final passage of S. \n1348, as amended.\n  I have a premonition that there may be an objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, of \ncourse, the way to handle this would be to make sure that the germane \namendments that are pending get votes postcloture. The majority leader \ncould agree to a consent that it be in order to call up germane filed \namendments postcloture, which would be very comforting on this side of \nthe aisle. I understand the position he is in. He would like to move \nthis bill and, I assume, have his Members exposed to the fewest number \nof votes they don't want to cast. I have a significant number of \nMembers over here who feel very strongly that before they would allow \nus to wrap up this bill, these amendments need to be considered.\n  At the risk of being redundant, the best way to do that is for the \nmanagers to keep processing amendments as rapidly as possible, to get \nconsent that it be in order to call up germane filed amendments \npostcloture, which would be comforting to Members on this side of the \naisle. Until we decide to operate in that fashion, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one person I did not compliment--and it is \nmy negligence--is the Senator from Pennsylvania, the ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, former chair of the Judiciary Committee, who \nhas worked very hard on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, what we have heard are buzz words for this bill is \ngoing nowhere. I think that is too bad. As the day progresses, I hope \npeople have a change of heart and that we can work on amendments that \ncan be voted on. Certainly, we don't need my approval for whatever \namendments should be voted on.\n  We are going to file cloture on the bill today. There are a number of \nexigencies present in the Senate, and we have to move on. The \nRepublican leader has been told by some Senators that more amendments \nwould help. Most of the people who want more amendments have no \nintention of voting for this bill no matter what we do.\n  I have made my statement. The Republican leader has made his \nstatement. I hope the managers can figure out a way to move on. Before \nthe close of business today, I am filing cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, at the risk of unnecessarily delaying \nthe discussion, the key to finishing the bill is to have votes on an \nadequate number of amendments. A number of amendments on this side are \nbeing offered by people who may well vote for an immigration bill. I \ncertainly would like to vote for an immigration bill in the Senate. I \ndid vote for such a proposal\n\n[[Page S7044]]\n\nlast time we went through this process in the previous Congress. I \nwould like to be able to do so again. But we are going to insist on \nfundamental fairness.\n  This measure may well be the only significant accomplishment of this \nCongress. Surveys out in the Washington Post today indicate that there \nis a declining support for the new Congress, which is a considerable \nimplication that the American people have noticed that we are not doing \nmuch in this Congress. Let me repeat, it is not my desire for this \nCongress to have a record of virtually no accomplishment, and a good \nsignificant accomplishment would be to get the right kind of \nimmigration bill out of the Senate. It is still my hope that will be \nachieved. This is only Tuesday afternoon--just Tuesday afternoon. There \nis plenty of work time left this week, and I think we ought to get \nabout offering, debating, and voting on the essential amendments to \nthis bill.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my counterpart, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky, said this is a 2-week bill, and we are in the second \nweek of this bill.\n  I will also state--and I am not as much of a poll watcher as my \ncaucus would tell me I should be--that the polls also show the \nRepublican Members of Congress are not as well thought of as Democratic \nMembers of Congress.\n  As far as success, I think we have done pretty well this past 6 \nmonths. We now have a bill that has been signed by the President where, \nfor the first time in 10 years, we give a raise to the people who need \nit worst, the people who rely on the minimum wage. Keep in mind that 60 \npercent of those who draw a minimum wage are women. For the vast \nmajority of those women, that is the only money they have for \nthemselves and their families.\n  We have tried for 3 years to get disaster assistance for farmers, and \nwe were able to get that. That is now signed into law. The President \nhas made many trips to the gulf, but in this supplemental bill, which \nwe forced the President to sign, we now have monetary relief for people \nin the gulf affected by Katrina.\n  We were able to extend the SCHIP program for children's health care. \nThat is a significant accomplishment. That will take care of things \nuntil October. We were also--in the legislation that the President \nsigned, that we forced--able to get more than he gave us in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. We had more money for the troops in \nIraq and Afghanistan--$4 billion more for medicine and veterans' \nbenefits.\n  We have been trying for years to get money for homeland security. In \nthis bill, we got it, a billion dollars for homeland security that has \nlong been necessary.\n  Within the next week or two, we are going to have a conference report \nthat will come forward, sending to the President legislation on stem \ncell research that will give hope to millions.\n  I worked, in fact, as late as yesterday with the distinguished \nRepublican leader, and I think we are in a position where we can come \nup with a satisfactory conference report on ethics and lobbying reform.\n  So I think we should not be denigrating the work of this Congress and \nthe things we have been able to accomplish, which has been done on a \nbipartisan basis. We have had to push and pull a little, getting \nmotions to proceed on various pieces of legislation that were \nnecessary, but we were able to do that. So I don't think it is time to \ndenigrate or belittle the Congress based on the polls we have seen.\n  I repeat, let us not get into poll watching, because if you look at \nthe polls, Democratic Congressmen, Democrats generally, are scored much \nhigher than Republicans. But I repeat, I don't follow polls. I think we \nshould be doing a lot more by what we feel is right to do than what \npolls show.\n  I hope the immigration matter can move along. I think the two leaders \nof the Senate have stated how we feel about this, and now we turn it \nover to the good hands of our experienced managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we probably shouldn't prolong this any \nfurther, because this is keeping us from handling amendments on this \nbill, which we desperately need to do, but we haven't had a major \nimmigration reform bill in 21 years. So far on this bill we have had \nnine rollcall votes. By any objective standard that is not nearly \nenough. Let us proceed to work on the bill, and, hopefully, we can get \nsomewhere during the course of the week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I tried to offer an amendment on May \n24, before the week's recess, and I was asked by Senator Kennedy if I \nwould withhold and he would make every effort to allow me to have a \nvote on my amendment on Social Security for Z visa holders on the first \nday back, which is today.\n  Now, I know there have been intervening circumstances, and I am not \nsaying there is any blame here. However, I am asking that we set a time \nfor the vote on my amendment No. 1302, which has been filed but which I \nwas asked to withhold offering. Now I wish to have a time certain, if \npossible, where we can have a vote on that amendment.\n  I have to say I have now seen this body operate. What happens on a \nbill such as this, that is very complicated and long, and especially \nwhen you are writing the bill on the floor rather than taking it \nthrough the committee process, there are a lot of amendments which are \nlegitimate amendments, yet the distinguished majority leader said he \nwas going to file cloture on the bill tonight. That would ripen on \nThursday.\n  I have three amendments. One is on Social Security protection for \nAmerica, from any person who works illegally to get credit on Social \nSecurity when they are working illegally; another one on the future \nflow of Y visa holders; and then I have an amendment for people to \nreturn home before they come back and become legal guest workers in our \ncountry. So those are three amendments I am giving everyone notice I \nbelieve are very important, they are productive, they are positive, and \nthey are an effort to make this a bill that Americans will see is the \nright approach to handling the chaos we have with illegal immigration \nin our country. I don't want to be squeezed out by cloture or by time \ndeadlines.\n  If we take 4 weeks on this bill and it becomes a better bill that all \nof us can support, those who wish to have comprehensive reform, 4 \nweeks, with the effect this is going to have in the next 25 years for \nour country, that is nothing. So I hope I will be able to offer my \nthree amendments and get votes on them at some point.\n  I want to be able to protect my rights, and I want to ask if I could \nhave a time certain to vote on the first Social Security amendment, No. \n1302, if that would be possible.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one of the things I think the managers \nshould do is see if they can get a list of amendments, germane \namendments, the minority wants. We have a few on our side. It is at \nleast worth a try to see if we can come up with a list of germane \namendments. I ask Senator Kennedy and Senator Specter to see if they \ncan come up with a list of germane amendments that Members think they \nwant to vote on. We already have, as I said, 12 or so pending, and we \nwill take a look at that. I am not even sure the 12 pending are \ngermane. We don't know that either.\n  Anyway, they can see if they can come up with a list of germane \namendments, whether that is three, four, five, whatever it is, and we \nwill take a look at that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am delighted to deal with the amendment \nof the Senator from Texas. We have to figure out the order. This is the \nside of the Republicans now. Senator Cornyn has been waiting, and \nwaiting patiently. The Senator from Texas did mention this. We had \ncontacted the Finance Committee, since it is dealing with Social \nSecurity, to see whether they would be able to go, and I hope they will \ndo that and dispose of it very rapidly. The other measures are not in \nthe Finance Committee and we would be glad to deal with those. But \ndealing\n\n[[Page S7045]]\n\nwith Social Security is the Finance Committee's jurisdiction, and they \nhad some views on that.\n  I hope we might be able to do the Cornyn amendment. The leader had \nasked me if we could do the DeMint amendment after the Cornyn \namendment. There may be one on our side dealing with health insurance \nwhich we would be prepared to do. It is fine with me. I am here and I \nam ready to go with these amendments, so I will make every effort to \nget the Finance Committee, and I will stay here with the Senator from \nTexas until we are able to get this disposed of this evening. I will \ngive you that, as far as I am concerned.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Let me say I am happy for the Finance Committee \nlooking at it. I wish this whole bill had gone through committee so we \nwould know exactly where we stand. If they are for it, great. If they \nare against it, let us debate it. But let me ask if I could have at \nleast a unanimous consent to bring up the amendments that are filed, \nNo. 1301 and 1302--those are the two Social Security amendments--and \nthen lay them aside, so that at least they are here and I know they \nwill be disposed of.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Absolutely.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. My third one, the one that requires the return home, \nhas not been offered yet but it will be germane. We are still trying to \nwork with Senator Kennedy, Senator Kyl, and all the Senators who are \ninvolved in this process to try to get a consensus on that return home \namendment. So it has not been filed.\n\n  If I could ask unanimous consent to bring up amendments Nos. 1301 and \n1302, after which I would be happy to set them aside, to make them \npending before cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have given assurance to the Senator \nfrom Texas, but I wish to see if we can have a short time. She will \nretain the right to make that request, but let us see if we can't work \nout the time now with the Finance Committee. Could we try that before \ngetting consent? Because there has been some question about others who \nwanted to add a number of amendments on both sides, and we are trying \nto at least dispose of some of those that are on the list. I will give \nthe assurance that this legislation, at least if I have anything to do \nwith it, is not going to pass or be considered or closed out to the \nSenator from Texas, because, as she has pointed out, she raised these \nand we gave assurance she would get them. We were prepared on that \nThursday evening, as we were running out of time to do the supplemental \nand to get the Finance Committee over.\n  The Senator mentioned, before the majority leader left, that she \nwanted to offer that, and I regret I had not gotten the Finance \nCommittee members over here. They were marking up I think the CHIP \nprogram earlier in the day. That is my only reservation about setting \naside now, because there has been objection on both sides to adding \nmore until we start to dispose of some of the underlying amendments.\n  I will certainly try to get the clearance and work with the Senator \nand do it within the next few hours, if the Senator would withhold that \nand give us an opportunity to try to work through that. The Senator is \nquite correct that we have given her those assurances, and I intend to \nkeep my word to the Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I will attempt to work with the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the request withdrawn?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will withdraw the request, yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have been asked, on behalf of the \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint, to seek unanimous consent to \nmove to have a time for amendment No. 1197.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the DeMint \namendment, No. 1197, to be pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \npoint out, if I may, that amendment No. 1184, which I filed and called \nup 13 days ago, has yet to receive a vote on this immigration bill. \nThis amendment would ban felons on the legalization path set forth in \nthe underlying bill. It astounds me this could be in the least bit \ncontroversial, but I have been denied an opportunity for an up-or-down \nvote on that for the last 13 days.\n  Now that I hear the majority leader intends to file cloture, it is \nclear what the pattern is, and that is to try to move this bill through \nwithout an opportunity for Senators to be given the chance to \nintroduce, call up, debate, and then vote on important amendments. So I \nwill object.\n  I likewise object to the scheduling of any other votes on the bill \nuntil I am given an opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on amendment \nNo. 1184. I add that I have offered to my colleagues the possibility we \ncould enter into some sort of time agreement to debate and to vote on \nthe amendment. I am told there is a side-by-side amendment that is \nbeing considered. I was told it would be made available to me at 4 \no'clock this afternoon. It would have been the second side-by-side \namendment that had been proposed. I have yet to see it.\n  I have tried to be patient, and indeed I have been patient. I have \ntried to work with my colleagues to let the process move forward, but \nit is clear to me now, since the majority leader says he intends to \nfile cloture, there is not going to be an opportunity to fully debate \nand offer amendments to this bill; that the majority leader intends to \ntry to force this bill through, denying Senators an opportunity to have \na chance to offer amendments, to have those amendments debated, and \nhave those amendments voted on.\n  I must employ whatever tools the Senate rules give me to insist upon \nmy rights. I will do that by objecting to this and the schedule of any \nfurther votes until such time as we are able to enter into some sort of \nagreement for the disposition of amendment No. 1184.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I understand the point of the Senator \nfrom Texas, and I agree with him. He has been very patient. Some of the \nrest of us have been patient, too. We are waiting for that side-by-side \nso we can proceed.\n  The purpose in the unanimous consent request was not to have a vote \non DeMint but just to have it pending so that it would be in line for a \nvote postcloture since it is germane, so I renew my request.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right, I just mentioned to \nthe Senator from Texas that there has been an objection. I would like \nto go to the Cornyn amendment--we have the side-by-side--get started, \ndebate it, and vote on it tonight. That is what I would like to do. If \nnecessary, we will do something over here in the meantime, come back, \nand deal with the Senator from Texas. We are ready to go. We have a \nside-by-side. We can get into general descriptions about that, but why \ndon't we get started on the Cornyn amendment.\n  I was asked earlier whether we would agree to debate and dispose of \nthe DeMint amendment, and we said fine. But if we are now going to add \nmore and more amendments on this--I agree with those who say let's get \nto work. Let's do the Cornyn amendment at this time. Respectfully, as I \nsaid, we were ready to deal with the DeMint amendment 10 minutes ago. \nEven now, if we want to debate it and vote on it and dispose of it, we \nare ready to go. But that isn't it, it is now to just be filed. How can \nwe do that if we object to the Senator from Texas filing?\n  Why don't we go to the Cornyn amendment, I ask Senator Specter. We \nwill be helpful and try to get the amendment of Senator DeMint up. We \nare not trying to close him out. We can deal with that later this \nevening. I am glad to do that later this evening. We are set to go. It \ndeals with health insurance. I am familiar with the issue. I am ready \nto go on it. We can deal with Cornyn. In the meantime, we can go to the \nFinance Committee and find out what we want to do with the amendment of \nthe Senator from Texas, and then the leader asked us to try to dispose \nof DeMint. We were prepared to go\n\n[[Page S7046]]\n\nahead with the Sessions amendment that deals with the ITC that the \nSenator from Alabama wanted earlier.\n  It is not our problem with this. We are ready to go. We are ready to \ndebate and vote. I hope we can go ahead with the Cornyn amendment and \nthe Senator will give us a little time to get this worked out about \nwhether we are going to add and stack additional amendments up. I \nhaven't got anything against the DeMint amendment. I saw it. I think it \nis a legitimate amendment.\n  Could we ask consent that we go to the Cornyn amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, although it was a long time ago, I \nbelieve I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does have the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am glad to reassert that. I didn't want to say \n``regular order'' and interrupt the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I understand there may be an objection. I want to protect Senator \nDeMint's rights and ask unanimous consent that his amendment be \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, without \nunnecessarily repeating myself, I have been waiting 13 days for a vote \non my amendment. I am afraid if I consent to this unanimous consent \nrequest, it is going to continue the pattern of avoiding my amendment, \nwhich would ban felons from getting Z visas under this underlying bill. \nI think that is something with which the American people, and hopefully \nthe vast majority of the Senate, would agree. This amendment is well \ntaken. It is a good thing. Let's not allow people--those who have had a \nchance, who defied the law, who thumbed their nose at our courts--to \ngain the advantages we are otherwise going to confer on people under \nthe Z visa.\n  I will object. As I indicated, I am willing to offer an alternative \nunanimous consent request that once I am shown the side-by-side \namendment that I am told the majority has in mind, that they would like \nto offer as an alternative to my amendment No. 1184, I will be willing \nto enter into a time agreement with 2 hours equally divided to debate \nand then to vote on my amendment tomorrow. I will not enter into a \nunanimous consent agreement to debate an amendment side-by-side which I \nhave not seen and which has been 13 days in the making. I think my \nrequest is a reasonable one. I am trying to work with my colleagues \nhere but, frankly, I do not feel as if it has been a two-way street. \nThat is my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection was heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could the Chair restate? Is it the request of the \nSenator that we consider the Cornyn amendment? We are making available \nnow the side-by-side. It is basically similar to the other one but in \ngreater detail. Is it the request of the Senator that we go to his \namendment now, we have a 2-hour debate on it, and that we vote on the \nside-by-side? Is that the Senator's request?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the Senator is correct with the exception \nthat I agree we can have the vote tomorrow. If there is no objection to \nmy unanimous consent, I am glad to accommodate Senator DeMint or other \nSenators to allow them in the interim to call up other amendments. I \nwould like to have a time locked in for a vote on my amendment--which \nwould then have been pending for a full 2 weeks without a vote--\ntomorrow morning. I would like to see what the amendment looks like \nbefore we leave today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I understand the request of the \nSenator, he wants to be able to have 2 hours on the Cornyn amendment to \nbe voted on tomorrow morning. Hopefully we can debate this this \nevening. I am more than glad to make the side-by-side available. I \ncertainly support the request.\n  If we can have it more precise, is it just sometime in the morning? \nAre we going to debate this this evening? I would like to try to get it \nso at least the leadership and Members know. This is a very important \namendment. We want to make sure they are aware--what is the desire of \nthe Senator? That we debate it this evening and we let the leaders set \nthe time for the vote tomorrow but we spend at least 2 hours on the \nCornyn amendment and the side-by-side and at some time designated by \nthe leadership we vote on it tomorrow morning at an appropriate time?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I think, in response to the inquiry, I \nwould like to see the amendment before I begin the debate. What I \npropose is to see the amendment tonight and be prepared when we come \ninto session tomorrow morning to begin that debate. The chances are we \nwill be able to yield some time back, but I am proposing 2 hours, \nevenly divided, and then to schedule the vote sometime before noon \ntomorrow morning at a time agreed upon by the bill managers and the \nleadership.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are making that available. I strongly \nsupport it and urge it, as I understand the Senator isn't proposing \nthat exactly at this moment but intends to do so, pending the \nexamination of the amendment. I certainly support that process. We will \nwait. It is not being propounded at this particular time, as I \nunderstand it, until he has a chance to look at it, but that would be \nthe intention about the way to proceed. We will make available to him \nthe side-by-side and then hopefully have an opportunity to propose the \nconsent agreement sometime in the very near future. We then would maybe \nproceed to consider the DeMint amendment, and we will in the meantime \nget ahold of the Finance Committee to deal with the Senator from Texas, \nto check with our side to see whether we have an intervening amendment. \nThat is what I would hope. But I hope very much we are going to \ncontinue to do the business of the Senate this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I think we are making some progress. I \naccept the invitation of the Senator from Massachusetts. Let's talk and \nwrite this up. Then we can make sure we are all on the same page. The \nfundamental agreement would be a 2-hour time agreement to debate this \ntomorrow morning, with a vote no later than noon tomorrow at a time \nmutually agreed upon by the leadership and the bill managers. I think \nwe can come to some agreement on that basis.\n  With that, based on that understanding, then, I will be glad to \nremove my objection. I withdraw my objection to proceeding with the \nDeMint amendment, and I withdraw my consent request for the time being.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn. The Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see the Senator on the floor. I was going to try to \nsee if we could not get Senator DeMint over to do that in a timely way. \nIt is on health insurance. We will do it in a timely way. In the \nmeantime, we are working with the Finance Committee to try to be able \nto deal with the Senator from Texas. I would like to try to do that. I \nwas going to suggest the absence of a quorum. I will not do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1174\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I also have a germane amendment that I have \nbeen trying for some time to get called up and get pending. I ask \nunanimous consent that amendment No. 1174 be made pending. I am happy \nto set that aside or discuss it now. I would like at least to get it in \nthe queue so at some point it could be voted upon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have the Hutchison amendment. I have \nno intention to try to exclude the Senator. We are making a note at \nthis particular time--we have been trying to cooperate. We have been \ntrying to get an amendment up for the last hour or so. But there were \nothers on our side who wanted to offer theirs, and at least our leaders \nwanted us to try to dispose of the underlying ones before we add one. I \nwill reluctantly object to it, but I give personal assurances we will \ndo everything we can to get it up in a timely way, but at this time I \nhave to object to that consideration.\n\n[[Page S7047]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the amendment I just tried to call up, \namendment No. 1174, was objected to, and I hope at some point we can \nget agreement to allow it to be put into the pending status that will \nallow it to be voted on at some point. But since we are on the bill, I \nwould like to speak to the amendment.\n  Amendment No. 1174 is a very straightforward and simple amendment. \nWhat it does is it removes a loophole in the underlying bill that \nallows noncriminal illegal immigrants to obtain immediate legal status \nbefore any of the border security measures set out in this bill are \ndeployed and inserts language that prohibits probationary benefits from \nbeing issued to an illegal immigrant before the effective date triggers \nare implemented.\n  Despite what the proponents of the bill are saying, the immigration \nproposal before the Senate would give illegal immigrants immediate \nlegal status upon enactment by providing legal immigrants with the \nopportunity to apply for a probationary Z visa or, as it is labeled in \nthe bill, a ``Probationary Authorization Document.'' Illegal immigrants \ncan obtain immediate legal status because of a huge exception set out \nin the very first sentence of this very large bill. This exception \nmakes the trigger requirements of beefed-up border security and \ninternal security irrelevant, in my view. It is an exception that I \nbelieve swallows up the rule.\n  This exception completely undermines what is supposed to be a key \nprinciple of the bill, and that is that no legalization of the illegal \nimmigrant population in this country can occur until the border \nsecurity and workplace enforcement provisions in the bill are certified \nas funded, in place, and in operation.\n  My amendment simply does away with this section by striking it from \nthe underlying bill and inserting language that prevents any \nprobationary benefit from being issued before the ``effective date \ntriggers'' are implemented.\n  Not only does this bill provide for immediate legal status for \nillegal immigrants before any of the border security measures in the \nbill are deployed, it also provides that illegal immigrants will be \nable to maintain legal status in this country even if the border \nsecurity measures in this bill are never deployed.\n  The very first sentence of the bill says the probationary benefits \nconferred by section 601(h) are exempt from the trigger requirements of \n20,000 Border Patrol officers and 670 miles of vehicle barriers and \nfencing and other enforcement measures.\n  Section 601(h) says an illegal immigrant who files an application for \na Z visa shall be granted probationary benefits in the form of \nemployment authorization. The provision also says the illegal immigrant \nmay not be detained, nor an unauthorized immigrant.\n  Once an illegal immigrant applies for the Z visa; provides evidence \nthat they were in the country and employed before January 1, 2007; pays \nup to $1,500 in processing fees and a $500 State impact assistance fee, \nas well as a $1,000 penalty, that individual will receive a \nprobationary authorization document if he or she passes all appropriate \nbackground checks or the end of the next business day, whichever is \nsooner. That means the illegal immigrant will legally be in this \ncountry before any certification that 20,000 Border Patrol officers \nhave been hired and 670 miles of vehicle barriers and fence have been \nconstructed.\n  Interestingly, illegal immigrants would not even have to pay the \nentire initial $1,000 penalty set out under this bill. They would have \nto immediately pay the $1,500 for a processing fee and a $500 State \nimpact assistance fee, but these are merely fees, not penalties.\n  Another principle of this legislation is supposed to be that illegal \nimmigrants are justly punished for breaking the law before obtaining \nlegal status. The bill, in section 608, allows illegal immigrants to \nput 80 percent of the penalty on an installment plan, meaning that an \nillegal immigrant would only have to pay $200 initially in penalties \nwhen they apply for a probationary Z visa.\n  So an illegal immigrant could pay a paltry $200 penalty when they \napply for a probationary Z visa and have immediate legal status \nconferred upon them by the next business day if nothing turns up in a \nbackground check. This does not amount to an adequate consequence for \nbreaking our laws, nor does it put illegal immigrants at the back of \nthe line. To make matters worse, no additional fence or other border \nsecurity measures have to be deployed before this happens.\n  Mr. President, what makes matters even worse is that even if the \ntriggers are never met, the probationary legal status never expires. As \nthe bill states clearly on page 291, line 17, all of these things: The \nimmediate legalization, the trigger mechanism being made pointless, and \nthe never-ending probationary legal status occur because of this \nloophole in the very first sentence of the bill.\n  I would simply argue that loophole needs to be closed, and that is \nwhat my amendment would do. Those who have broken our laws to come here \nwill be given immediate legal status, even before additional security \nfences are constructed or desperately needed Border Patrol officers are \nhired. This does not sit well with most of the people I represent in \nSouth Dakota from whom I am hearing every day on this issue. They are \nnot happy with this bill as written.\n  My amendment represents an effort to ensure that the trigger \nrequirements in the bill are met before any legalization occurs by \neliminating the exception for ``probationary benefits'' and ensuring \nthat no probationary benefit for illegal immigrants can be issued until \nthe trigger mechanisms in this bill are implemented.\n  Mr. President, we are a nation of immigrants. We are a nation of \nlaws. We should be rewarding those people who have followed our laws, \nwho have played by the rules, and not putting those who have entered \nthe country illegally in front of them. Before any effort is made to \ndeal with the 12 million illegal immigrants in the country, we first \nmust secure the border.\n  Despite claims to the contrary, the bill in its current form would \ngive illegal immigrants immediate legal status before any further \nborder security measure is deployed. My amendment would fix this flaw \nin the bill. I would hope, Mr. President--I would also add that Senator \nGrassley from Iowa is a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  I hope we will have an opportunity at some point to debate this, to \nvote on it, because I think this is a fundamental flaw in the bill that \nneeds to be corrected. It is a loophole which I think completely \nundermines the whole intention of this bill; that is, to make sure that \ncertain conditions are met before the legalization process is allowed \nto move forward. This, as I said, is a very straightforward, simple \namendment, one that I think is very understandable to people across \nthis country. Certainly I think it makes sense to people I represent in \nthe State of South Dakota.\n  I hope at some point those who are managing this bill will allow this \namendment to be called up, to be made pending, and ultimately to be \nvoted on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1197 to Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1197.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1197 to amendment No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S7048]]\n\n(Purpose: To require health care coverage for holders of Z nonimmigrant \n                                 visas)\n\n       At the end of subsection (e) of section 601, add the \n     following:\n       (9) Health coverage.--The alien shall establish that the \n     alien will maintain a minimum level of health coverage \n     through a qualified health care plan (within the meaning of \n     section 223(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986).\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight one of the most \nimportant domestic issues this country is facing, and that is rising \nhealth care costs. I think it is also important to point out that \nnearly 10 million noncitizens are uninsured according to the September \n2006 U.S. Census report on the uninsured.\n  Since no hospital can legally deny a person health care because of \ntheir immigration status or inability to pay, my amendment would help \nprevent that cost from being shifted to the American taxpayers in the \nform of uncompensated care. Since about three-fourths of all \nuncompensated care costs are paid by taxpayers in the form of national \nand State programs, it is imperative the Senate pass my amendment that \nwould require Z visa holders to maintain a minimum level of private \nhealth coverage.\n  Under this amendment, minimum health coverage would be defined as a \nhigh-deductible health care plan. It is my firm belief these visa \nholders should take some responsibility for their own health care and \navoid burdening American taxpayers when they have medical problems.\n  By requiring Z visa holders to have a minimum level of private health \ninsurance, it will help keep individuals off public assistance and out \nof the emergency rooms. According to the Economic Research Initiative \nof the Uninsured, immigrants as a group are nearly three times more \nlikely to be uninsured than native-born U.S. citizens.\n  I am almost certain some of my colleagues will say it is not possible \nfor these visa holders to afford a private health insurance plan. In \nfact, there are plenty of high-deductible policies available on the \nindividual market that are affordable, with an average cost of about \n$116 a month. Furthermore, these plans have seen only a 2.8-percent \nincrease on an annual basis compared to 8 percent for all other types \nof health plans. This low rate of increase is another reason high-\ndeductible health plans are affordable to those with lower incomes.\n  It is also important to point out that by having their own high-\ndeductible health plans, visa holders will be able to keep their policy \nregardless of their employer. Many employers who want less expensive \nlabor will likely help their employees pay for these high-deductible \npolicies.\n  Mr. President, it is also important to point out that there is a \nprecedent for this type of action. In 1993, the Department of State \nissued regulations requiring students entering the United States under \nexchange visas to have health coverage. This amendment would only \nextend this policy to Z visa holders.\n  What is most troubling to me is that this legislation before us does \nalmost nothing to stem the rising costs of uncompensated care. If we do \nnot pass my amendment, the growing cost of uncompensated care currently \nat $41 billion per year will only be exacerbated.\n  Supporters of this bill will point to the State Impact Assistant \nGrant Program that is established in the legislation. This grant \nprogram would be funded through fees paid by the immigrant, and it \nwould be administered by the Federal Government to repay States for \nhealth and education expenses.\n  However, even the bill language suggests, through a sense of the \nCongress, that this will not be enough to solve the problem of illegal \nimmigrants using our health care services at a cost to the American \ntaxpayer.\n  Our country is spending $2 trillion per year on health care. While my \namendment does not address the entire problem, it does address the \nproblem of noncitizens using our resources at a cost to the American \ntaxpayer. In my opinion, there are many problems with this legislation. \nBut I believe this amendment will at least improve upon this extremely \nflawed bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I can have the attention of the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  His amendment will maintain a minimum level of health coverage \nthrough a qualified health plan in the meaning of 223(C) of the \nInternal Revenue Code. Is that right?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is the health savings accounts?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Generally, high-deductible plans are accompanied by the \nhealth savings account.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So if they had other kinds of health coverage at all, \nthey still would not be--unless they have this particular coverage, the \nhigh deductible, they would not be able to make--adjust their status.\n  Mr. DeMINT. This is the minimum level as established by the high-\ndeductible policies. Certainly, more comprehensive plans would fit in \nthe context of the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is the Senator aware now that the undocumented or aliens \nare not eligible for any of the Medicaid proposals at the present time?\n  Mr. DeMINT. For the first 5 years, that is correct. But that does not \nmean they cannot access any of our health clinics, emergency room \nservices, and a lot of uncompensated care can be directed at the \ncurrent group of illegal immigrants in our country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Why did the Senator select just this particular health \ncoverage rather than being able to participate in HMOs or other kinds \nof programs?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Well, we are establishing a minimum level, which the \nminimum would be the high-deductible policies, often accompanied by \nhealth savings accounts. This does not prevent an immigrant from having \na more comprehensive plan, an HMO. But the point of the amendment is \nnot to mandate a comprehensive plan but to establish a minimum level of \ncoverage, which is more affordable particularly to low-waged workers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What is the estimate that the Senator has for this \ncoverage? What is the estimate that they would have to pay out for this \ncoverage?\n  Mr. DeMINT. The average of high-deductible plans is $116 a month. I \nwill just say as an aside, I just bought a high-deductible plan for my \n22-year-old daughter at $65 a month. This, obviously, leaves some to be \npaid by the workers themselves. But it avoids the high-risk cost of a \nworker who may have complicated, very expensive problems, for that \nwhole bill to land on a hospital, which often happens.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If there are preexisting conditions--how does this \namendment affect preexisting conditions?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Well, we do not specify. It may be something we want to \ncover in an additional amendment. But many States, as you know, now \nhave high-risk pools which are available to all workers in the State \nregardless of immigration status.\n  This certainly may not cover every possible problem. But if we are \ngoing to issue Z visas, I think the point is that they become an asset \nto our economic environment in this country, and certainly if they are \nuninsurable that may suggest that they are not a viable worker as well.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, we have 47 million Americans who don't have \ncoverage at the present time. But you want to insist that anyone, these \nundocumented are going to be mandated individual coverage in order to \nbe able to adjust their status?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Obviously, the uninsured are a problem, and many of us \nare working on ways to solve that. It is one thing to ask American \ntaxpayers to help take care of their fellow citizens. It is another \nthing to ask Americans to help assist those from all over the world. \nCertainly, our hearts go out to anyone with health problems, but we \ncannot ask the American taxpayer to subsidize low-wage workers for \nemployers who are using them in this country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Of course, CBO studies which have been released in the \nlast few days show that immigrant workers contribute much more in terms \nof taxes than they use in terms of services by about $24 billion over \nthe estimate of the length of this plan.\n  Mr. DeMINT. There is obviously a lot of research that refutes that. \nThe Heritage Foundation has come out with quite an extensive study that \nsuggests the low-wage workers, undereducated\n\n[[Page S7049]]\n\nimmigrants in this country today, cost an average of $19,000 a year \nmore in taxes than they pay. This group, as a whole, over the next \nthree decades will cost $2.4 trillion to the American taxpayer. So \nthere is a lot of research that suggests that undereducated, low-\nskilled workers are going to be a net loss to the American taxpayer.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have heard studies quoted. Generally, around here we \nuse Congressional Budget Office figures for actions in the State. They \nreach a rather dramatically different conclusion than the studies the \nSenator has mentioned.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Certainly, the Senator will agree it should not be the \nobligation of the American taxpayer to subsidize low-wage workers for \nemployers. Frankly, I believe if we ask these immigrants to pay their \nfair share, employers are more likely to hire American workers in the \nfirst place rather than lower wage workers who are actually being \nsubsidized by the taxpayer. This health plan is one idea to ask these \nimmigrants and their employers to carry the fair load and not to dump \nthe cost of health care on other workers in this country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Of course, the workers themselves have to contribute \n$550 as part of their cost anyway, their contribution to the State. In \nterms of consideration of covering any of the costs, that was sort of \nput into the legislation itself, in terms of the additional fees and \nadditional fines as well, that addition to help offset any of the \nexpenses that would be carried in the State itself.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I think the Senator obviously knows--and the bill \nlanguage suggests--this is a small token of what the real costs are, \nnot only for health care but education, daycare, and other services \nthat are often used by these immigrants. Again, to ask these immigrants \nor their employers if they would like to assist in paying $100 or a \nlittle more a month to keep them from becoming a burden to the \ntaxpayers is a small thing to ask for someone who is taking advantage \nof the opportunities in this country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is important to get health care and health care \ncoverage for all who do not have it. The real issue is the best way to \npursue that. That is something we have to take a look at.\n  I see the Senator from West Virginia is here and wishes to address \nthe Senate on an important matter about our friend and colleague from \nWyoming.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 1267, As Modified, To Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1267 and note \nthat I have a modification of that amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment, as \nmodified.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and \n     Mr. Obama, proposes an amendment numbered 1267, as modified, \n     to amendment No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Section 218A(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as \n     added by section 402, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(i) Period of Authorized Admission.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Aliens admitted to the United States as \n     Y nonimmigrants shall be granted the following periods of \n     admission:\n       ``(A) Y-1 nonimmigrants.--An alien granted admission as a \n     Y-1 nonimmigrant shall be granted an authorized period of \n     admission of 2 years. Such 2-year period of admission may be \n     extended for 2 additional 2-year periods.\n       ``(B) Y-2 nonimmigrants.--Aliens granted admission as Y-2 \n     nonimmigrants shall be granted an authorized period of \n     admission of 10 months.\n       ``(2) Y-1 nonimmigrants with y-3 dependents.--A Y-1 \n     nonimmigrant who has accompanying or following-to-join \n     derivative family members in Y-3 nonimmigrant status shall be \n     limited to two 2-year periods of admission. If the family \n     members accompany the Y-1 nonimmigrant during the alien's \n     first period of admission the family members may not \n     accompany or join the Y-1 nonimmigrant during the alien's \n     second period of admission. If the Y-1 nonimmigrant's family \n     members accompany or follow to join the Y-1 nonimmigrant \n     during the alien's second period of admission, but not his \n     first period of admission, then the Y-1 nonimmigrant shall \n     not be granted any additional periods of admission in Y \n     nonimmigrant status.

The limitations \n     described in paragraph (3) shall not apply to commuters \n     described in this paragraph.''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to briefly describe what this \namendment does. I understand there is not a plan to have a vote on this \namendment this evening, but I wish to explain briefly what this \namendment does.\n  There are three programs in the underlying bill that are related to \nso-called temporary workers. One of them is the new guest worker \nprogram. That is the program we amended the provision of 2 weeks ago \nwhen we reduced the number of people eligible to come into the country \nunder that program each year from a number of 400,000 to 600,000 down \nto 200,000.\n  This current amendment, amendment No. 1267, I have called up again \ndeals with that same guest worker program. It tries to make the program \nmore workable. The underlying bill says if a person comes into this \ncountry under that program, that person is eligible to get a visa for 2 \nyears to work here, then is required to leave for 1 year, then is \neligible to come back again for another 2 years, then is required to \nleave for another year, then is eligible to come back again for another \n2 years, and then is required to leave permanently. So it is what I \nhave come to refer to as the 2-1-2-1-2 structure of this guest worker \nprogram.\n  Frankly, it does not make a lot of sense. It does not make a lot of \nsense from the point of view of employers or employees--guest worker \nemployees--or American workers who might also want to apply for those \njobs or similar jobs.\n  Let me explain what I have in mind.\n  As regards an employer, if someone came into my office in the Senate \nand said: I have a great proposal for you. I would like to work for you \nfor 2 years and then I am going to take off for a year, and then I will \ncome back again\n\n[[Page S7050]]\n\nand want my job back for another 2 years, and then I am going to take \noff for another year, and then I am going to come back and want my job \nback for another 2 years, I would not hire such a person. It would not \nmake any sense. You need continuity in your workforce. You do not want \npeople coming and leaving for substantial periods of time. So from an \nemployer's perspective, this makes absolutely no sense.\n  From the employee's perspective, if you are one of the guest workers, \nwhat are you supposed to do during the year you are not permitted to \nstay in this country? You are supposed to go back to your home country. \nWhy would we believe that person would be able to support themself and \ntheir family during that year when they are not working here? They have \nto find a job there. When they leave there, obviously, that employer's \nemployment situation is disrupted. So that does not make sense from the \npoint of view of those guest workers.\n  It does not make sense from the point of view of American workers who \nmight want these jobs. These are generally thought of as construction \njobs. These are not agricultural jobs we are talking about, and they \nare not seasonable jobs. They are permanent jobs. It is just that by \nthe provisions of this bill, we are suggesting let's take a permanent \njob and try to make it temporary by kicking people out of the country \nevery 2 years. So that is the only thing temporary about these jobs.\n  This does not make sense from the point of view of American workers \neither. American workers who want to work in these construction \npositions will find there is a constant flow of entry-level workers \ncoming back into this country every year saying: OK, I know I was here \nbefore. Now I am back again. I am starting at the bottom of the ladder \nagain. Pay me the entry-level wage, and I will take any job you have.\n  So the upward pressure on wages in that construction industry is \neliminated. There is no upward pressure. You have this very large group \nof entry-level workers coming back every year. This does not make good \nsense.\n  My amendment simply says, let's do what we did last year. We passed a \nbill last year. We had good bipartisan support for it. Basically, the \nbill, last year, said: Let's do one 3-year visa, and let it be renewed \nfor a year. What I am proposing in my amendment is, let's do a 2-year \nvisa. Let it be renewed twice. Then the 6 years is up.\n  So we are not changing a lot of other aspects of the bill. I know \nthere are some in this Senate who think we should change other aspects. \nIn fact, I think we should as well. But I am not trying to do that in \nthis amendment. I am saying let's at least eliminate this 1-year hiatus \nthat is built in between each of these 2-year visas we are providing \nfor in this guest worker program.\n  To me, this is eminently sensible. It is something we ought to do. \nGovernor Napolitano wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times on June \n1 of this year, and she said the following:\n\n       The proposed notion that temporary workers stay here for \n     two years, return home for a year, then repeat that strange \n     cycle two more times makes no sense. No employer can afford \n     this schedule--hiring and training, only to have a worker who \n     soon will leave. It will only encourage employers and workers \n     to find new ways to break the rules.\n\n  What we are doing is setting up a system that will encourage workers \nto overstay their visas. Much of the illegal immigration problem we \nhave in this country today is not because people have sneaked across \nthe border--although there are many of those--it is because people have \ncome here legally and overstayed their visas, and they are now \nillegally living in this country.\n  If you ever wanted to have a system that would generate more people \ncoming here and illegally overstaying their visas, we have designed it \nin this bill. So my amendment tries to correct that to some extent. It \nsays once they come here and go to work, they are given a 2-year visa. \nThey can renew that two times and work the full 6 years. So it \nmaintains the 6-year limit that the sponsors, the architects of this \nlegislation, have intended, but it makes a lot more sense in the way it \nworks.\n  Let me mention one other aspect which I think is crucial; that is, we \nneed a system that is workable. We do not have the capacity today--we, \nthe Federal Government--to keep track of people who leave the country. \nWe can keep track of the ones who come in, but if you ask the \nImmigration Service how many of those who come in are still here, they \ndo not know. We do not have the capacity today to track the people who \nleave.\n  So we are setting up a system where we have 200,000 a year coming in. \nTwo years later that 200,000 is supposed to leave. The next year \n200,000 more people come. Two years later that group is supposed to \nleave. We have no way of implementing this system and ensuring it is \nbeing complied with. So the whole thing is assuming a capacity and a \ncapability that the Federal Government does not have today.\n  It would be much simplified if we were to adopt the amendment I have \noffered. I hope my colleagues will support the amendment. It would \nimprove this bill significantly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, to give some information to the Members, \nas I understand, Senator Hutchison and the members of the Finance \nCommittee are meeting. As a point of information, the Senator from \nTexas, Mrs. Hutchison, and staff are meeting with the Finance Committee \nstaff to consider those particular proposals. We have given the \nassurance to her that the Senate will address those issues at some \ntime, but since it was just dealing with Social Security, although \nthere are provisions in here that deal with Social Security, it is \nentirely appropriate that we ought to have the Finance Committee work \non that.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has offered an alternative on the \ntemporary worker program that is a serious amendment, and we could, if \nwe are--we will have to find out what the pathway is between voting on \none side and voting on the other, to be able to consider that, but that \nis an important alternative to what is the underlying legislation. I \nknow there is going to be some response to that from Members very \nshortly.\n  On the amendment of Senator DeMint, he had indicated he was going to \ncome to the floor to offer it. We were hopeful we might be able to \nconsider that and have a vote on that later on as well.\n  At the present time, we are trying to work to see if we cannot find a \nsituation where we can get two votes, one from the Democratic side and \none from the Republican side, on measures that have been included on \nthat list that have been talked about earlier, and the Members of the \nstaffs on the Republican and Democratic side are working to see if we \ncan't refine the list of different amendments to see what might be \nacceptable and then what might be germane and see if we can't refine \nthis list. So that, I know for people outside the Senate, doesn't sound \nlike much of an explanation about what is going on, but it is important \nand often produces additional motions here in the Senate. So we will \nhave more information on this.\n  A very brief word on the DeMint amendment. His amendment requires a \nhigh deductible health insurance for each undocumented; otherwise, they \nwould not be able to proceed with their earned legalization program \nwhich includes payments of the fines, demonstration of the work \nproduct, the investigations that show they have not had challenges in \nterms of the law, and the series of requirements that are out there. He \nwould add to this the additional expenditures which would be necessary \nfor coverage with a high deductible health insurance.\n  There are several points to mention here. First of all, in the \nunderlying legislation, we have included a payment, some $500, that \nwill be paid by each of the 12.5 million immigrants who are out there, \nmany of whom will adjust their status. If they pay that $500, that is \nin excess of $1 billion--$1 billion that will be paid to those high-\nimpact States, which is not insignificant, to help offset any of the \nkinds of utilization of these individuals in terms of the services \nwithin these various States. That is not insignificant.\n\n[[Page S7051]]\n\n  Secondly, all of us are hopeful of trying to get universal coverage \nfor people in this country, but we know we have 47 million who don't, \nand the ones who don't, it isn't that they don't want to have health \ninsurance, it is because they cannot afford it. When you look at these \nindividuals whom we are talking about, the undocumented and their \nincome, we are talking about individuals who are earning $8,000, \n$9,000, $10,000 a year. If they have the adjustment of the status, they \nare going to be part of the whole kind of American system, hopefully, \nand meeting the other kinds of requirements, and therefore their \nenhanced opportunities are going to be there so they will be able to \nafford health care in the future. But making the requirement now will \nonly state to those individuals to keep them in the shadows. It is one \nmore barrier that is going to prohibit them from being involved.\n  A final point--and I ask unanimous consent to have this material \nprinted in the record--the utilization of these health care facilities \nas we have seen in the most recent study, particularly in the State of \nTexas, which shows that, by and large, these are individuals who are \nyounger, have used these health emergency centers very rarely. We have \nthe studies that have been done, particularly the most recent one in \nTexas.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Special Report, December 2006\n\n\nundocumented immigrants in texas: a financial analysis of the impact to \n                      the state budget and economy\n\n       * * * to develop an estimate of the fiscal impacts to 14 \n     Texas border counties. In addition to sheriff's offices, they \n     calculated costs to the following offices for each county:\n\n     District Attorney\n     District Court\n     District Clerk\n     County Attorney\n     Court at Law\n     Justice of the Peace\n     Indigent Defense\n     Adult Probation\n     Juvenile Services\n\n       They also included an estimated emergency medical care \n     cost, but their estimate included costs for both offenders \n     and non-offenders who are undocumented immigrants. The \n     Comptroller's report includes a separate calculation \n     estimating Texas health care costs for undocumented \n     immigrants, so these costs were subtracted from the U.S./MBCC \n     estimate.\n       The U.S./MBCC estimated that the cost to these 14 border \n     counties was approximately $21.5 million. Of that amount, \n     sheriff's offices accounted for approximately 60 percent of \n     expenditures for undocumented immigrants. Applying this ratio \n     to the figure calculated for sheriff's office costs produces \n     an estimate of $81.7 million for costs related for processing \n     and incarcerating undocumented immigrant offenders for the 15 \n     highest SCAAP grant recipients. These 15 counties received 88 \n     percent of the 2005 SCAAP money awarded to Texas counties; \n     $81.7 million divided by 0.88 produces an estimated total \n     cost of $92.9 million.\n       This figure represents a conservative estimate, as the \n     SCAAP grantees represent 95 of Texas' 254 counties and 87 \n     percent of the state's population. Some of the remaining \n     counties also may incur criminal justice costs related to the \n     processing and incarceration of undocumented offenders. For \n     example, five of the 14 border counties included in the U.S./\n     MBCC study did not submit SCAAP applications in 2005.\n       Total estimated costs for education, health care and \n     incarceration are detailed in Exhibit 13.\n\n\n                         VI. Economic Benefits\n\n       This section analyzes two issues: the economic impact of \n     undocumented immigrants in Texas, including their \n     contributions to state employment, wages and revenues over a \n     20-year period (2005 through 2025); and the contributions of \n     undocumented immigrants on Texas government revenues.\n\n\n                            Economic Impact\n\n       The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that between 1.4 million \n     and 1.6 million undocumented immigrants resided in Texas in \n     March 2005. To achieve a conservative estimate, this analysis \n     relies on the lower boundary of this range.\n       Using 2000 Census data for the number of foreign-born \n     residents in Texas counties, it is possible to estimate how \n     many undocumented immigrants reside in each of Texas' 24 \n     Council of Government regions, based on the assumption that \n     immigrants are distributed in the same proportion as the \n     foreign-born. Based on an age profile of foreign-born \n     immigrants into the U.S. from Mexico, it is possible to \n     further disaggregate the estimates into age and gender \n     groups.\n       These data then can be put into the Comptroller's Regional \n     Economic Model, Inc. (REMI) model to investigate the impact \n     of undocumented immigrants on the Texas economy. This is \n     accomplished by instructing REMI to act as if these \n     immigrants were to suddenly vanish from Texas and then to \n     examine the degree to which the underlying economic forecast \n     for the state and for each region would be affected. The \n     implicit assumption is 1.4 million undocumented immigrants \n     have employment and spending patterns consistent with \n     Hispanics in Texas with similar age and gender profiles.\n       To gauge the economic impact of undocumented immigrants, \n     one additional change must be made in the REMI model. Because \n     REMI is a general equilibrium model, it tries to compensate \n     for changes in a variety of ways. In the case of workers \n     eliminated from a region, the model assumes new workers will \n     be recruited to make up for their loss.\n       While this is an expected ``real-world'' result, a true \n     test of the effects of unauthorized immigrants would be seen \n     only if the REMI model were prevented from importing \n     additional workers into the state in compensation.\n       The model eliminates the impact of all undocumented \n     immigrants on the Texas economy. Some in-migration was \n     allowed, but drawing in new Hispanic in-migrants in numbers \n     disproportionate to their share of the indigenous population \n     in the U.S. was prohibited. Effectively, this shut off return \n     in-migration from Mexico and other Latin-American countries.\n     Model Results\n       Probably the easiest way to summarize the contribution of \n     undocumented immigrants to the Texas economy is to consider \n     the percentage changes that might occur in various economic \n     indicators as a result of their removal. (As a yardstick, it \n     should be noted that 1.4 million people account for slightly \n     more than 6 percent of the total Texas population.)\n       Exhibit 14 and 15 summarize the changes in key economic \n     indicators, and summarize the economic impact. Without the \n     undocumented immigrant population, Texas' work force would \n     decrease by 6.3 percent. This decline is actually somewhat \n     lower than the percentage of the work force actually \n     accounted for by undocumented immigrants, since REMI assumes \n     some additional immigration would occur to replace the \n     workers lost. The most significant economic impact of losing \n     undocumented workers would be a noticeable tightening in \n     labor markets.\n       This tightening would induce increases in wages, as \n     indicated by a rise in average annual compensation rate. Wage \n     rates would rise by 0.6 percent in the first year and stay \n     above the forecast rate throughout the entire 20-year period.\n       While pay increases can be viewed as a positive social and \n     economic development, when they rise due to labor shortages \n     they affect economic competitiveness. In this case, it would \n     be expressed as a modest decline in the value of Texas' \n     exports.\n       The remaining broad economic measures all point to an \n     initial impact of undocumented immigrants of about 2.5 \n     percent in terms of the value of production and wages in the \n     Texas economy. Eliminating 1.4 million immigrants would have \n     resulted in a 2.3 percent decline in employment, a 2.6 \n     percent decline in personal income and a 2.8 percent decline \n     in disposable personal income in 2005. This change also would \n     generate a 2.1 percent decline in the gross state product \n     (GSP), the broadest measure of the value of all goods and \n     services produced in Texas.\n       While none of these changes are surprising, the one finding \n     that may appear unusual is the persistence of the decline. If \n     no in-migration were possible other than from natives or \n     authorized immigrants, employment would remain 2 percent \n     below the baseline forecast 20 years later. The impact \n     lessens over time, but remains sizable throughout the 20-year \n     forecast period.\n       The primary adjustment the model makes to compensate for \n     the loss of these undocumented migrants is initially a rise \n     in the wage rate, which would induce some new in-migration \n     into Texas and some additional participation in the labor \n     force from current residents. Moreover, with wages rising \n     relative to capital, there would be some substitution of \n     capital for employees so the need for additional workers is \n     lessened through productivity increases. But the fact that \n     the Texas economy cannot adjust completely to the loss of \n     this labor through these changes and retain its \n     competitiveness ultimately means that relative to the rest of \n     the world the cost of production in Texas is higher, making \n     our goods less competitive in the international marketplace \n     and decreasing the size of the Texas economy.\n     Regional Distribution\n       Assuming that the current distribution of unauthorized \n     immigrants is similar to the distribution of the foreign-born \n     population in Texas from Central America and Mexico, as \n     detailed in the 2000 Census, the economic impact of \n     unauthorized immigrants varies substantially across Texas. As \n     detailed in Exhibit 16, the loss of 1.4 million undocumented \n     immigrants from the work force would produce work force \n     declines ranging from 22.7 percent in the South Texas COG \n     region (the Brownsville-McAllen area) to 1.7 percent in \n     Southeast Texas (the Beaumont-Port Arthur area).\n       Generally, undocumented immigrants have the highest \n     economic and demographic impact in the Border region, but \n     they are a factor in the state's more urbanized areas as \n     well. In all but one case (the Middle Rio Grande COG), Border \n     COGs would see work force declines in excess of 20 percent \n     (the Rio Grande, Lower Rio Grande and South Texas\n\n[[Page S7052]]\n\n     COGs). Even in the Middle Rio Grande COG (including Laredo), \n     the work force impact of undocumented immigration is more \n     than double that in the Houston-Galveston COG.\n       Other measures of economic impact are distributed \n     similarly. Estimated population, employment and GSP declines \n     would be highest along the border but also high in large \n     metropolitan areas elsewhere in the state. The least affected \n     regions in Texas would be those along the Louisiana and \n     Oklahoma borders.\n       By 2025, a good portion of the work force and population \n     changes would lessen, but in all regions the employment and \n     gross regional product declines would remain sizable, \n     indicating that the economic impact of undocumented \n     immigrants is unlikely to be replaced by other economic \n     changes (Exhibit 16).\n     Revenues\n       Estimating state government revenue attributable to \n     undocumented immigrants is a difficult undertaking because \n     any calculations must be based both on limited data and a \n     number of significant assumptions about spending behavior. A \n     review of the literature found several studies on \n     undocumented immigrant impacts, but none that could be used \n     as a model for Texas. Primarily, these studies focused on the \n     impact of all immigrants, regardless of legal status, and the \n     analyses focused on federal or state income tax revenue. \n     Since Texas has no income tax, any estimate of state tax \n     revenue must be based on its mix of consumption and business \n     taxes.\n       Texas state government receives revenue from a wide variety \n     of sources, but these generally can be grouped as tax \n     collections, federal funding, licenses and fees and all other \n     sources of revenue. In fiscal 2005, $29.8 billion of the \n     state's total revenues of $65.8 billion came from tax \n     collections. Federal revenue contributed $22.8 billion and \n     licenses, fees, fines and penalties accounted for almost $6.2 \n     billion. Other sources, such as interest income and lottery \n     proceeds, generated the rest.\n       For the purposes of this analysis, major tax sources were \n     analyzed to determine if a significant portion of collections \n     could be attributed to consumer spending. Similarly, some \n     major sources of revenue from fees and fines were identified \n     as appropriate to the analysis. Sources of revenue excluded \n     from the analysis include federal revenue and all other \n     sources that could not be attributed directly to consumer \n     behavior. While the state generates revenue from literally \n     hundreds of taxes and fees, this estimate is based solely on \n     revenue sources reflecting spending by undocumented \n     immigrants.\n       State revenues included in the analysis, can be grouped in \n     five categories: consumption taxes and fees, lottery \n     proceeds, utility taxes, court fees and all other revenue. In \n     addition, local school property tax revenue is estimated. \n     Consumption tax revenue totals are composed primarily of \n     revenue from the sales tax, motor vehicle sales and use tax, \n     gasoline tax, alcoholic beverage taxes, cigarette and tobacco \n     taxes and the hotel tax.\n       Estimated revenue for each tax is calculated based on \n     information from two sources. The Pew Hispanic Center \n     produces data on average income and demographic \n     characteristics of undocumented immigrants nationwide (again, \n     no detailed demographic data are available at the state \n     level). The estimate of annual average family income used in \n     this analysis is $27,400. In addition, data from the \n     Comptroller's tax incidence model shows the tax impact for \n     households at the estimated average income level.\n       State utility tax revenue mostly comprises the gas, \n     electric, and water utility tax and this estimate uses the \n     same basic data on average income along with the final \n     incidence impact for this tax. Similarly, local school \n     property tax revenue is based on the same data and the \n     incidence specific to the school property tax.\n       Estimated lottery revenue is based on a Lottery Commission \n     study of the percent of the population that plays lottery \n     games and the average amount spent by each income level. \n     Court costs and fees were calculated on a per capita basis \n     since they are largely unrelated to income.\n       ``All other revenue'' consists of a number of smaller \n     consumer taxes and fees that may well include some amounts \n     paid by undocumented immigrants, but for which no data exist \n     to base an estimate. The largest of these sources is higher \n     education tuition; other sources include state park fees and \n     the fireworks tax. This estimate assumes that undocumented \n     immigrants contribute to the state through these revenues at \n     the same rate as for the major consumption taxes and fees \n     except for higher education tuition and fees. These \n     contributions were calculated in proportion to higher \n     education student enrollment.\n       As shown in Exhibit 17, estimated fiscal 2005 revenue to \n     the state from undocumented immigrants in Texas is about $1.0 \n     billion, or about 3.6 percent of the $28 billion in state \n     revenue considered in this analysis. In addition, an \n     estimated $582.1 million in school property tax revenue can \n     be attributed to undocumented immigrants, or about 2.9 \n     percent of the statewide total. Undocumented immigrants, \n     thus, contributed nearly $1.6 billion in estimated revenue as \n     taxpayers in fiscal 2005.\n\n\n                            vii. conclusion\n\n       The immigration debate has become more heated in 2006. \n     Congressional hearings were held across the U.S. to discuss \n     the impact of undocumented immigrants on the economy and the \n     culture. At the same time, two distinctly different pieces of \n     legislation were voted out of the U.S. House and Senate.\n       The Comptroller's office estimates the absence of the \n     estimated 1.4 million undocumented immigrants in Texas in \n     fiscal 2005 would have been a loss to our Gross State Product \n     of $17.7 billion. Also, the Comptroller's office estimates \n     that state revenues collected from undocumented immigrants \n     exceed what the state spent on services, with the difference \n     being $424.7 million (Exhibit 18).\n       The largest cost factor was education, followed by \n     incarceration and healthcare. Consumption taxes and fees, the \n     largest of which is the sales tax, were the largest revenue \n     generators from undocumented immigrants.\n       While not the focus of this report, some local costs and \n     revenues were estimated. State-paid health care costs are a \n     small percentage of total health care spending for \n     undocumented immigrants. The Comptroller estimates cost to \n     hospitals not reimbursed by state funds totaled $1.3 billion \n     in 2004. Similarly, 2005 local costs for incarceration are \n     estimated to be $141.9 million. The Comptroller estimates \n     that undocumented immigrants paid more than $513 million in \n     fiscal 2005 in local taxes, including city, county and \n     special district sales and property taxes. While state \n     revenues exceed state expenditures for undocumented \n     immigrants, local governments and hospitals experience the \n     opposite, with the estimated difference being $928.9 million \n     for 2005.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So at the appropriate time, I hope the DeMint amendment \nwould not be accepted. We might have more time to consider it, if the \nSenator wants to, when we have more of our colleagues here later, prior \nto the disposal of it. I was sort of hoping we could see a continued \nmovement on several of these amendments, but we are being told now we \nhave to have this clearance from the leadership on some of these \nmeasures, but we are hopeful we will announce to our colleagues very \nshortly what the plan is for the rest of the evening.\n  We are prepared to stay here, remain here and go through to dispose \nof these amendments. We have made important progress in the past. We \nhave some important amendments which are pending. I think Senator \nSpecter and I and the others who are interested in this--I see my good \nfriend from Colorado, Senator Salazar, and others who are more than \nwilling to have a good discussion about these amendments, and we would \nwelcome the opportunity to have the Senate express itself with votes. \nThat is certainly our desire. We wish to see continued progress on this \nextremely important legislation.\n  As one of those with others who has been a part of this process, we \nwant to try. We know it is complicated and difficult. We know there are \nstrong emotions. But I think all of us, after the period of this \nMemorial Day recess, understand full well the American people are \nexpecting us to take action. They know that failure is not an \nalternative. They know it is complex. They know there are great \nemotions. There are a good many who know nothing out there--people who \ndistort, misrepresent, misstate the legislation, and then differ with \nit, and that has certainly been done with regard to this legislation. \nWe have, at least to date, had good debates and discussions on \nsubstantive matters, and the Senate has reached conclusions on a number \nof these matters. It is certainly our desire to continue that process \nto work with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to commend those who have worked on \nthe immigration bill. I know their hearts are in the right place and \nthey have attempted to come together to solve a very critical issue for \nour country and they are to be commended for their efforts.\n  I understand that if we call up an amendment, it will be objected to, \nand I think that is unfortunate. As the country sees, if we are going \nto have an immigration bill, then we need to have a real, full debate \non all aspects of that bill and each Senator should have opportunities \nto offer amendments.\n  I think the bill has a lot of good in it. I think a lot of positive \nthings have come through. However, there are two or three critical \nerrors I believe that are incorporated in the bill. Quite frankly, one \nof them is the bill's plan, in terms of guest workers and managing the \nload of the Z visa holders. There is not the capability out there right \nnow to do that.\n\n[[Page S7053]]\n\n  I have an amendment which creates a real trigger, and that is what \neverybody in this country wants.\n  The reason there is a stir in the country about immigration today \ncomes from the very fact that we have had laws on the books that we \nhaven't enforced. When you have a free society and you have laws on the \nbooks that are not enforced, you get all sorts of untoward expectations \nthat come about out of that. The No. 1 expectation that has come out of \nthat is the American people don't trust us when it comes to \nimmigration. I believe we have to earn back that trust. The way we earn \nback that trust is to secure the border. The way we earn back that \ntrust is to enforce employer verification. The way we earn back that \ntrust is internal enforcement.\n  The goals, as I said, of those who have worked hard in putting this \nbill together are admirable. However, the trigger is anything of a \ntrigger, and it is something that would not accomplish its purpose.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this time that the pending amendment be \nset aside and amendment No. 1311 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I was in \nconsultation. Could the Senator restate his request? I apologize to \nhim.\n  Mr. COBURN. Amendment No. 1311.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator chooses to call up his amendment.\n  Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what we were attempting \nto do is, as we have been moving from one side to the other, Republican \nand Democrat, to have the introduction of amendments on both sides. \nThat is what we would like to do. We have had a flurry right now of \namendments. I hope we get an opportunity--I think, quite frankly, there \nare more amendments on that side than on this side, as a factual \nmatter.\n  What they have tried to do is match amendment for amendment on both \nsides. That has been what they have tried to do through the day today. \nWhether that will be the way it will be in the future, I don't know. As \nI mentioned, there are more amendments on that side. So, obviously, we \nare going to have to deal with more. At the present time, they are \ntrying to match one side with the other side in terms of amendments. So \nI hope that if we have amendments on this side, the Democrats would \nnotify us so we can match them up and propose them together.\n  I necessarily have to object at the present time. I hope we will not \nhave to object when we get our final list. To try to maintain at least \nthat balance, which was at least the way we were attempting to proceed, \nI have to do it at the present time. I will do everything in my power \nto make sure that, having done so, his amendment will certainly be \nconsidered in a timely way so it doesn't work to his disadvantage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I trust the Senator's integrity. But it is unfortunate \nfor the American people, and also for the Senate, that we use a ruse \nthat we have to have offsetting amendments be heard, when the fact is \nwe are going to bring this amendment up, and we are not going to debate \nit tonight. The fact is it is going to be objected to being called up \nand being in the queue.\n  That overshadows the fact that I know the Senator would like to have \na full and fair debate on this bill, but it seems we cannot get \ntogether to allow that. I will come back multiple times tomorrow to \noffer this same amendment and try to get it up. It is unfortunate that \nthe body has to work this way tonight because we don't want to truly, \nin fact, allow all of the amendments on this bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n\n                     National Hunger Awareness Day\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to my colleagues' \nattention and remind them that today, June 5, 2007, is National Hunger \nAwareness Day. As a founder of the Senate hunger caucus and an original \ncosponsor of the legislation, I express my heartfelt belief that this \ncause deserves our full attention.\n  We all move very fast in this world on Capitol Hill. We sometimes \nforget that outside the beltway bubble there are a lot of hard-working \nfamilies, as well as other families that may not be quite so blessed, \nin terms of their everyday needs being met.\n  The resolution that established National Hunger Awareness Day allows \nfor food collection. That is one thing we are doing on Capitol Hill \ntoday. We are doing a food collection for the needy, where Members and \ntheir staffs can bring food to my office, as well as the offices of the \nother hunger caucus cochairs, Senator Smith, Senator Dole, as well as \nSenator Durbin. I appreciate the willingness of my colleagues to \nparticipate in such a very important effort.\n  Our collection drive has been going on for several weeks, and we will \nsoon be providing the food donations to the U.S. Veterans, a charity \nbased in Washington, DC, that assists homeless veterans with food and \nhousing during their recovery. Certainly, as we recognize the diversity \nin the homeless community and those who suffer from food insecurity, as \nwell as poverty, we must not forget, particularly in this time, the \nnumber of veterans in our great Nation, those who served our country so \nbravely and courageously in a time of need, and what a perfect time \nright now is to be able to recognize that on National Hunger Awareness \nDay.\n  I have worked with my Senate colleagues to draw attention to this \nissue because hunger and poverty are not just global issues; they are \nso pervasive that we all have some experience with them in our local \ncommunities, whether it is work we may do with our own houses of \nworship or whether it is something we do with our community-based \norganizations or community support activities. But we all can find a \nway where we recognize how pervasive poverty, and particularly hunger, \nis in this world.\n  Worldwide, 3 billion people--nearly half the world's population--live \non merely $2 per day. In our Nation alone, almost 38 million Americans \nstruggle day in and day out to find adequate nutritional food. More \nthan 13 million are children living in households that are food \ninsecure.\n  That brings it home to me from several different directions: As a \ndaughter raised in a seventh generation Arkansas farm family, watching \nmy dad take an incredible sense of pride in being able to produce crops \nhe knew would feed his fellow man, taking pride in being efficient and \neffective with what he produced, and knowing what he could do would \nhelp sustain his fellow man. To look out on the crops and those \nfarmlands I grew up on, and to think that 13 million children are \nliving in households that are food insecure, with all of the plenty and \nthe bountiful life we have in this great country, breaks my heart. Then \nI think of myself as a mother of twin boys who are about to turn 11 \nyears old, and I look up and think to myself how grateful I am to be \nable to know they will get a nutritious meal; to see them when they \ncome home from soccer practice and look up at me and say, ``Mom, I'm \nstarving,'' and how blessed I am to be able to go to a cupboard and \nprovide a nutritious snack to them; yet to think about other mothers \nacross this globe who are not so fortunate, who have to look into the \neyes of their own children and say there is nothing here for you, \nnothing to eat, nothing to nourish your body or your mind or your soul \nin the form of food.\n\n  We can do better than that. I feel blessed I have never had to \nexperience what it is to suffer from hunger. But I have tried to put \nmyself in the shoes of those mothers who look into the eyes of their \nchildren and have to give them that answer.\n  Now, in conjunction with National Hunger Awareness Day, I have also \nrecently elected to accept the food stamps challenge and live on an \naverage food stamp program payment of $1 per meal. I went to the \ngrocery store the other day, and I went down those aisles looking at \nwhat I could find that was economical and nutritious that I could \nprepare and would have the time to prepare, not just for myself, which \nI am the only one in my household doing the challenge, but nonetheless, \nto think of the time that working parents would have to spend to figure \nout how to put together a nutritious meal for them and for their \nchildren on $1 per person per meal. It is my hope that my\n\n[[Page S7054]]\n\nparticipation in this event will not only create awareness in myself \nbut also for others in highlighting the difficulties that millions of \nAmericans living at or near the poverty line face each and every day. \nIn addition, I hope to increase my understanding of the limitations of \nthe Food Stamp Program and the importance it plays in assisting the \nfood insecure and the hungry by experiencing what it is like to live it \nfirsthand, to be looking for those foods and what you can afford on $1 \nper meal.\n  We had a woman--a very courageous woman--who came and testified \nbefore the Senate Agriculture Committee on the Food Stamp Program. She \nbrought with her her son who is 11 years old, similar to my boys, who \nsat there. She said: You know, I don't make it a habit of discussing \nfinancial issues in front of my young son, but this is so important to \nme, to point out that I work hard at a full-time job, and I still do \nnot make enough money to provide for my family. I still am able to \naccept food stamps. She said: But look at what I have to do to manage \nthat.\n  Then I looked at her testimony and realized that not only was she \ncaring for her own son, she was volunteering with the PTA, the Cub \nScouts, and the local library. She was helping her community also, \nhelping raise all those children. Yet she was still subjected to living \nin food insecurity.\n  We can do better than that. As a Member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, I wish to ensure that we do improve the delivery and \nmaintain the integrity of nutrition programs when we consider the farm \nbill later this year. I wish to also make sure we maintain the \nintegrity of our ability in this great Nation to produce a safe and \nabundant and affordable food supply. We pay less per capita than other \ncountries across the globe. Yet we still see that working families are \nliving in food insecurity. Over 60 percent of the farm bill budget pays \nfor important initiatives that directly provide food and nutrition \nassistance, such as the Food Stamp Program, the fresh fruits and \nvegetables program for schools; and we are finding now that oftentimes \nfor those children that may be the only access they have to fresh \nfruits and vegetables; a farmer's market program for low-income \nseniors, among others, that we are striving so hard to not only \neliminate food insecurity but to make sure we are working hard to \nprovide for all Americans, for the needs that exist.\n  We must continue to fund these important programs, and we must look \nfor new and innovative ways to ensure that Americans do not go hungry. \nI know that when I worked downtown, there was a man regularly at the \nfront door of the office building I would go into. He would sit there, \nusually with a cigarette and a bottle and, you know, I felt so driven, \nboth by my faith and simply my human nature, and I knew that in my life \non this Earth, I should never, ever want to see another human being \ngoing hungry. That is when I decided to start giving out food coupons--\nnot giving out dollars but making sure my fellow man--doing all that I \ncould do, so he and others would not go hungry if I were there.\n  In the coming weeks and months, I encourage my colleagues to become \nmore aware, more educated, and more informed about the effect of hunger \nand poverty and to find out what impact you can have in your State and \nin your community. I encourage all Americans to do that. Think about \nthe difference it makes--those 13 million children living in food \ninsecurity--how much better they could perform in school if they \nweren't hungry; how less likely they would be to get sick if they were \ngetting nutrition; how much more confident they would be in who they \nwere and who they could become if they knew that their country was \nthere to nurture them in the most basic and essential need: food.\n  There is no quick solution to this problem. Government alone cannot \nprovide all the answers. We know that. As we look across these strong \ncommunities in our country and we see food banks sponsored by our \nfaith-based organizations and the outreach of volunteers that provide \nMeals on Wheels and all kinds of other programs, we know that \nGovernment cannot do it all. But we also know that, as Americans and as \nan American family, the values we hold dear are values of being a good \nneighbor. That is a critical part of what this is all about. Together, \nwe must work to reach out to organizations in our communities that are \ncommitted to this cause and develop a public-private partnership that \nprovides resources and the manpower to combat food insecurity in this \ncountry.\n  Yes, we must teach our children. We must teach our children to become \nengaged in recognizing food insecurity, poverty, and hunger where it \nexists and to recognize that they, too, have a responsibility.\n  I noticed my son the other day when he came home, and he said: Mom, I \nam responsible for bringing some lunch meat to school because our \nstudent government is going to provide sack lunches to the homeless \nshelter out here in our community. The student government got together \nand made the lunches and put them together and then delivered them \nwhere they could visit the individuals they were actually helping, \nassisting, and giving notice.\n  In closing, I would like to leave my colleagues with just a few \nthoughts. I know many of you all read the same Scripture I do. First \nand foremost, I believe my faith calls me, and it calls all of us, \nregardless of faith, to care for those who are less fortunate; to feed \nthe poor and the hungry. I can tell you I am proud that our current \nnutrition program works toward that goal, but does it do enough? No. We \ncan all do more. We can all do more in reaching that goal.\n  Today, on National Hunger Awareness Day, we need to begin by asking \nourselves what more can we do to eliminate hunger and poverty in our \ncommunity and in our world. It has been said: To those to whom much is \ngiven, much is required. We live in this great country. Such a blessing \nto each and every one of us. The opportunity to do for our fellow man \nis an incredible responsibility. To us, much has been given, and much \nwill be required in giving back.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' attention to this issue, and I ask each \nand every one to reflect on what it is that we can do collectively as a \ngovernment that reflects the values of who we are as an American family \nand what each of us has to do individually that reflects the values \nthat we hold dear. One of the things we must remember, hunger is \nsomething that has a cure. There are many diseases and many things we \ndebate on the floor of this body for which we don't yet have a cure. We \ndon't know how we are going to solve those problems. Hunger has a \nsolution and it has a cure and it is our responsibility to strive hard \neach and every day to find that cure for our fellow man.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleague \nfrom Arkansas, the senior Senator from Arkansas, for the passion that \nshe has shared with us that she has had for some period of time about \nthe plight of the hungry.\n  Indeed, she is accurate in pointing out that in the ancient \nScriptures there are over 2,000 references to the poor. And, indeed, \nshe quoted very accurately from the Book of Matthew, where one of the \ngreat admonitions is to do it unto the least of these, my brothers and \nsisters, and one of those admonitions: When I was hungry, you fed Me. \nSo I thank her for that.\n  Having just come back from Africa, participating in a number of the \nworld food programs there, I would note a food program is not only \nnecessary there because of the obvious, the starvation and the drought, \nand so forth, but now, with the President's new initiative and \nadditional funding on the HIV/AIDS plague, in the administering of the \nantiviral drugs which have had some very positive effect, we find they \nwon't work because the patients can't tolerate them if they are hungry. \nSo now a program worldwide of joining the two.\n  But the Senator from Arkansas has spoken so eloquently about hunger \nat home, hunger among us, and there is no reason in America, in the \nyear 2007, that we should stand idly by and turn a blind eye to the \nneeds around us among the poor. I thank her for her comments and her \npassion that she brings to this subject.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of National Hunger \nAwareness Day and to give voice to the difficult reality that exists \nfor more than 35 million people in the United States--the experience of \nhunger.\n\n[[Page S7055]]\n\n  In a society as civilized as ours, basic sustenance should be a \nguarantee. If children--or adults--are hungry in America, that is a \nproblem for all of us.\n  Yet hunger continues to affect the lives of millions of families, \nincluding over 14 million children who live below the poverty line.\n  In the past few years, there have been multiple efforts to make \n``hunger'' disappear--not as a troubling reality for millions, but as a \nterm in surveys and press releases.\n  Every year, the USDA issues a report that measures Americans' access \nto food, and it has consistently used the word ``hunger'' to describe \nthose who can least afford to put food on the table.\n  But starting in 2006, hunger facts and figures began to disappear and \nwere replaced by measures of ``food security,'' a more scientifically \npalatable term.\n  Yesterday, the Washington Post reported on the proposed \nadministration budget cuts to the Survey on Income and Program \nParticipation--the only large-scale measure of the impact of Medicaid, \nfood stamps, school lunches, unemployment and other safety net programs \nfor the poor.\n  All these efforts put forth the false notion that nobody's hungry in \nAmerica.\n  But despite the fact that we don't use words and we don't use \nnumbers, the presence of hunger is ever so clear.\n  We can see it in the faces of children at school who have not had a \ndecent meal since yesterday's school lunch. We can see it in the \nfamilies at food pantries showing up a day earlier than normal because \ntheir monthly pay is not stretching as far it once did. We can see it \nin the loving parent giving up their own meal to make sure their child \nhas something to eat at night.\n  In a land that prides itself as the land of plenty, we cannot hide \nthe fact that we need to do a better job at making sure everybody has \nat least enough to eat.\n  Each hungry child that we allow suffer chips away at the moral \nstrength of our country. This land of opportunity--and the American \ndream--should not allow for 37 million of its people to live in \npoverty, to live hungry.\n  Our moral strength, our commitment to our community is a foundation \nof our country. The well-known American journalist, Bill Moyer, just \nlast week put it best when he said:\n\n       It's right there in the Constitution--in the Preamble: \n     ``We, the People''--that radical, magnificent, democratic, \n     inspired and exhilarating idea that we are in this together, \n     one for all and all for one.\n\n  And he was right, this is the ``heart of democracy'' and more \nimportantly, it is the heart of humanity. As Bill says, the prayers we \nsay are prayers for all of us: ``Give us this day our daily bread.'' \nAnd his is the most important message that should inspire us today: \n``We're all in this together; one person's hunger is another's duty''.\n  Hunger is a problem for all of us. I hope that we all work together \nto fulfill our duty to end hunger in our Nation and the world.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on the \noccasion of National Hunger Awareness Day.\n  Hunger and poverty are among the great moral challenges confronting \nour society. Hunger and poverty require us all to respond--because our \nsociety can be judged by how we treat our most vulnerable citizens. If \nthere is a child out there who has done everything she has been asked \nand still has to say no to the college of her dreams, that makes a \ndifference in our lives, even if it is not our child. If there is a \nsenior citizen who has to go bag groceries because some company broke \ntheir promise about his pension, that matters to us, even if it is not \nour grandparent. If there is a veteran who has been wounded in this \nwar, and ends up back here on the streets picking through a dumpster \nfor food, that diminishes the patriotism of every American.\n  This week the Food Research and Action Center, FRAC, has released its \nannual study: ``State of the States: 2007.'' This important research \nhighlights levels of hunger, poverty and the use of federal nutrition \nprograms nationally and in each State.\n  This report and its findings underscore why we must continue the push \nin Congress to strengthen proven anti-hunger measures such as the Food \nStamp Program. We have made progress over the last few decades in \ncombating extreme hunger in our communities. But the work is not over. \nIn Illinois, for example, more than 150,000 households are hungry, and \nmany more families live at the margins and are at risk of becoming \nhungry. We can do better. That is why I have joined my friend Dick \nDurbin in pushing to strengthen antihunger measures in this year's farm \nbill, and I will continue to support vital programs that can reduce \nhunger in our communities. The Food Stamp Program, for example, helped \nan average of 26.7 million Americans each month last year, while on \naverage the USDA has estimated that every Food Stamp dollar generates \napproximately $1.80 in economic activity. And for many families, Food \nStamp support is vital during their transition from TANF to employment. \nThis is the kind of nutrition and antipoverty program Congress should \nbe enhancing and investing in.\n  I am also proud to be a cosponsor of S. 1172, the Hunger Free \nCommunities Act, which was introduced by Senator Durbin and enjoys \nstrong bipartisan support. This measure would improve and strengthen \nHunger-Free community grants that aide our frontline antihunger \norganizations, as well as establishing much needed, hunger-focused \nresearch efforts within USDA and setting national goals for reducing \nhunger.\n  Other Federal nutrition programs, such as the National School Lunch \nProgram, Women, Infants and Children, WIC, and the Commodity \nSupplemental Food Program, CSFP, offer critical support to some of our \nNation's neediest citizens. After all, how can we expect our children \nto be productive and attentive at school when they haven't had \nbreakfast or lunch?\n  I have learned from my time in Washington that hunger is one of those \nissues that every politician likes to talk about. What is harder, it \nseems, is to follow through and take substantive steps to eradicate \nhunger in our communities. That is why I am grateful for the close \nsupport and collaboration of our many friends and outside groups that \nare at the frontline of combating hunger and raising the profile of \nthis issue every day. They hold us accountable for ensuring our deeds \nmatch our words.\n  I hope that my colleagues will continue to join in this important \nmoral endeavor of addressing the most basic needs of our brothers and \nsisters--and strengthening our Federal nutrition programs.\n\n\n                      William Clifton France, Jr.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have been mourning the loss \nof our colleague today, and I have had the opportunity earlier this \nmorning of sharing with the Senate my comments concerning the life of \nSenator Thomas. Indeed, America is mourning another one of her great \nsons, and that is the past president of NASCAR, the one who built \nNASCAR into what it is today, the No. 1 motor sport--one of the \ngreatest of all sports now, with 75 million followers--and that is Bill \nFrance, Jr., who died just a few days ago.\n  Bill France is one of those great American success stories. He \nlearned from his father, way back in the old days when he was tending \nto a gasoline station in Daytona Beach, FL, where he got the idea of \nstarting to race stock cars. The first races were rather rudimentary \nbecause they went on that beautiful hard-packed sand of Daytona Beach. \nThey would go down the beach for quite a distance, turn, come up on a \nroad that is today called Highway A1A--and back then it was a dirt \nroad--go down that a distance, turn back on to the beach, and continue \nthe circular drive using the beautiful Daytona Beach. Of course, that \ngraduated into the building of the Daytona Speedway, until we now have \nthis NASCAR being America's No. 1 form of motor sports for 75 million \nfans.\n  Bill France, in building this sport, not only started to improve the \nDaytona International Speedway, but his International Speedway \nCorporation oversaw other raceways, such as Darlington, Talladega, and \nothers. Bill France followed in the footsteps of his dad, Bill Sr. He \nwas a big man, 6 feet 5 inches. Bill Sr. was the founder and the first \npresident of NASCAR. The France family lost Bill Sr. some number of \nyears ago. I had the privilege of knowing Mr. France, Sr., and then see \nhis son bring this sport into the prominent\n\n[[Page S7056]]\n\nposition that it is among all sports in the entire world.\n  William Clifton France. The France family mourns his loss. The \nSenate's condolences go out to Betty Jane and his daughter, Lisa France \nKennedy; to his son, Brian France; and to the entire France family. \nAmerica has lost one of her great citizens, but America is the better \nfor the great things that Bill France has built.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, a number of things continue to be \nrevealed as we analyze this monumental piece of legislation which \npurports to comprehensively reform immigration law in America and, \nindeed, any comprehensive reform bill would be extensive because it is \nan incredibly complex subject with many moving parts, many legal \nniceties and complexities, all of which, if we are going to have a \nsystem that works, need to come into place.\n  It has been stated repeatedly by those who have proposed and promoted \nthe legislation which is before us today that this legislation will \nsecure the border and we will have a lawful system of immigration in \nthe future. Those claims have been made repeatedly. The proponents have \nsaid they are going to have additional Border Patrol agents, and so \nforth. Indeed, the PowerPoint that the White House used to make their \npresentations early on promised to ``secure U.S. borders'' and ``not to \nrepeat the 1986 failure.''\n  Others are saying the same thing. One of the Senators who is involved \nin the process said, ``I am delighted we are going to secure the \nborder.'' Another Senator said, ``This legislation will finally \naccomplish the extraordinary goal of securing our borders.'' Another \nsaid, ``The agreement we just reached is the best possible chance we \nhave to secure our borders. In this legislation we are doubling the \nborder patrol; we are increasing detention space.'' Another Senator \nsaid, ``This will restore the rule of law. Without the legislation, we \nwill have anarchy.'' Another one said, ``We started out with 18,000 \nadditional border patrol officers. We will increase the detention \ncapacity.'' And so on and so forth. Even our former Governor Jeb Bush \nand Ken Mehlman wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal and said, \n``It will make sure our borders become secure.''\n  ``We have had broke borders in this country for 20 years.'' That is \nthe truth. ``It is time we get them fixed.'' That is the truth.\n  Then they add, ``And this bill will do just that.''\n  Okay. There are many more I could quote along that line. But I hope, \ntherefore, that every member of our body who understands the \nCongressional Budget Office and the work that organization does, how it \nis designed to analyze statutory language in our legislation to give us \na budget score and other analysis of what that legislation is all \nabout, they made a tremendously significant announcement yesterday, one \nthat is quite frightening and all of us should pay attention to.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the new Senate bill \nwill only reduce net annual illegal immigration by 25 percent. It will \nadd 550,000 visa overstays to the illegal population by 2017, and up to \n1 million visa overstays by 2027.\n  In the section titled ``Effects on the United States Population,'' \nthe CBO states, and I quote their article, their report:\n\n       CBO estimates that implementing those requirements \n     [enforcement and verification requirements] would reduce the \n     net annual flow of illegal immigrants by one-quarter.\n\n  Twenty-five percent. Then they go on to note the problem with visa \noverstays, in addition, saying this:\n\n       Other aspects of the legislation are likely to increase the \n     number of illegal immigrants, in particular, through people \n     overstaying their visas from the guest worker and H-1B \n     programs.\n       CBO estimates that another 1.1 million people would be \n     added by 2017 as a result of the guest worker program, about \n     half of them authorized workers and dependents, the remainder \n     the result of unauthorized overstays. That figure would grow \n     to 2 million by 2027.\n\n  What I want to say to my colleagues is--and those people who have \nworked hard on the bill to try to create a piece of legislation that \npolitically they think can be passed, and they worked together with \nspecial interest groups and everybody but the U.S. Border Patrol, and \neverybody but the American people who had an interest in immigration, \nthey all plotted on how to write this thing up so they can eliminate \npolitical problems and split babies in half--all of that is supposed to \ncreate a system that first and foremost would create a lawful system of \nimmigration, would eliminate the illegality and create border security.\n  Now we have the Congressional Budget Office telling us that at best \nit is only going reduce illegal immigration 25 percent. As a price for \nthat, we are supposed to grant amnesty to 12 million people who are \nhere, provide options for chain migration to continue for 8 years, \ndenying during that time highly competitive people from all over the \nworld who want to come here an opportunity to come here, and delay some \nof the things in the bill that I think are positive and ought to become \nlaw.\n  I want to tell my colleagues once more, think about this as you \nconsider whether you can justify supporting the legislation. Because if \nit is going to reduce the illegal flow into this country by 25 percent, \nand actually through the guest worker program is going to allow more \npeople to overstay, then we have got a problem. You see, visa overstays \nare already nearly 40 percent of the illegal population. Those are \npeople who come into the country legally, they stay here through their \nallotted time; they just do not leave when the time is up. They stay, \nthey overstay.\n\n  Under the plan we have here that has a temporary guest worker \nprogram, that would have after the first year some 400,000 temporary \nworkers here at a given time, their parents could come to visit them, \ntheir spouses could come to visit them. Even spouses could come to \nvisit if the spouse does not certify they intend to return and stay in \ntheir home country; a real tipoff that they intend to stay illegally in \nthe United States if they are not entitled to stay; they want to stay \nillegally. So I think those are matters that are important to us.\n  I also note there is a glaring omission in the trigger language of \nthe legislation, and that omission is the U.S. exit visa, the U.S. visa \nexit portion. In other words, when you come into the country with a \nbiometric card, you are approved to work as a temporary worker at some \nplace, and you do your duty, you are supposed to stay 1 year, a season, \nyou are supposed to stay 2 years, and then return. What happens when \nyou return or do not return?\n  Ten years ago we required that by 2005, we have a recording system \nthat records your exit from the country, like you may have when you go \nto work and you record your time clock out when you leave work. \nTherefore, we know if the person who came left when they were supposed \nto leave, and you know if they did not.\n  That is not in the bill. That is not required as a part of the \nrequirement before the amnesty takes place. I wanted to share that with \nmy colleagues. I think it should cause a great deal of uneasiness for \nall of us. It makes you wonder how committed the drafters of this \nlegislation--and frankly, a lot of lawyers and people with experience \nin immigration and some of them not even Senators, were deeply involved \nin all of this in writing the legislation. I am not sure everybody \ncaught all of these things. We are just now hearing what is in the \nbill, frankly.\n  So however they drafted it, whoever wrote this in, time and again you \nsee provisions in the bill--and I have listed 20; we will soon have 25 \nloopholes of this kind and nature that I think indicate the drafters \nwere not as committed to enforcement as they have suggested. \nOftentimes, as I noted, drafters are not the Senators who did not do \nall of the fine-printing themselves.\n  I want to note one thing in the CBO report. It has been stated more \nthan once.\n  Mr. President, I see the majority leader here. I can delay other \nactivity.\n\n[[Page S7057]]\n\nI wanted to raise this issue. I would be glad to yield to him. I will \nwrap up and say one more thing.\n  It was repeatedly noted that the score by the Congressional Budget \nOffice indicated the bill had minimal cost to the taxpayer over the \nfirst 10 years. Now we knew without dispute that in the second 10 and \neven in the decades that go beyond that, the cost surges. But even in \nthe first 10, they said there would be little, if any, cost. But if you \nread their latest report in detail, you will note that is only true if \nyou consider Social Security taxes paid by those people who are \nlegalized under this bill.\n  But, you see, that should not be counted and will not be counted in a \nbudget situation, because the money paid to Social Security is set \naside for that person's retirement. If they pay into Social Security \nnow, they are going to draw it in retirement later. That is an off-\nbudget matter. That is a Social Security matter. That income should not \nbe counted. When you eliminate that money for Social Security, you come \nout with a $33 billion cost in the first 10 years of this legislation, \naccording to our own Congressional Budget Office. Those numbers will \nsurge in the decades to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez.) The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the benefit of all Members, we are very \nclose, we hope, to having two votes. It should be momentarily, in the \nnext 10 minutes. It might be better.\n  We are trying to work out something on the McConnell amendment and \nthe Feingold amendment. We have been very close to that for some time \nnow. I am told we are very close to it now. We also have staff, both \nmajority and minority staff, working on setting up about a dozen votes \nfor tomorrow on amendments that are pending.\n  As everyone knows, I offered earlier today to have the staffs work to \nfind out what votes the minority has that they feel would be germane \npostcloture, so maybe we can come up with a finite list of those. We \nare willing to be reasonable, but we do have to move this along.\n  I have had a number of Members say to me: Well, let us take another \nweek or two on this bill; it is worth it. I know how people feel about \nthis bill. We are not spending another week or two on this bill. It is \nTuesday. We still have Wednesday, Thursday, Friday to finish this bill, \ncould work into the weekend if necessary. This is an important bill, \nbut we need to finish it. We need to finish this. That is why cloture \nwill be filed tonight. I have offered a unanimous consent request so we \nwould not even have to vote on it Thursday morning; we could vote on it \nThursday night. I have also suggested if people are serious about \nmoving this bill, we only need the one cloture vote on a substitute. \nThat is the way it normally works, anyway; you don't have to turn \naround and vote on the bill itself. Rarely does that happen. That would \nonly be if someone is trying to stall this matter.\n  I hope we can dispose of a lot of amendments. I hope tomorrow or the \nnext day we could vitiate the request for cloture and have final \npassage on the bill. We want to be reasonable. That is why the staffs \nhave been instructed to try to work on a way to get from here to there.\n  But this stage has been very difficult, because a lot of people who \nwant to offer most of the amendments are people who have no intention \nof ever voting for this bill, no matter what happens. We are still \ngoing to process their amendments. They have a right to their \namendments as does anyone else, even though their definition of \nimproving the bill is, I guess, relative.\n  Mr. President, we still do not have anything here yet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as I understand the procedure the leader \nhas been exercising, it is only one or two amendments are allowed to be \nplaced in the pending category, and if one attempts to bring up an \namendment, leadership objects.\n  I tried to bring up an amendment Friday, and there was an objection \nto make it pending. I tried to bring up an amendment Monday. There was \nan objection on a very--we are sort of being slow walked. I would ask \nthe leader, would he allow us to bring up a substantial number of \namendments and get them pending, so if he files for cloture and got it, \nyou would have a chance to get those amendments voted on? If they are \nnot pending, we will not get to vote on them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama, he has two amendments that are pending now.\n  We have found in weeks past, months past, it is important to dispose \nof amendments that are pending; otherwise, you wind up that the person \nwho offered the last amendment controls what goes on here on the floor. \nThere have been a number of additional amendments that have been filed \ntoday. As I indicated, staff is now working on a procedure to dispose \nof all of the pending amendments, have votes on those tomorrow.\n  As I have said earlier today, in fact a few minutes ago again, often \nhere in the Senate, when we come to situations such as this, we say: \nOkay, let's get a list of finite amendments. How many amendments do you \nwant to offer? Then we try to work that out. It is a little difficult \nto do, because any one Senator can stop that. But we are trying to come \nup with a finite list of amendments. The two managers, Senators Kennedy \nand Specter, have worked on this, and their staffs are working on this, \nalong with mine. Right now there is an effort to move this forward. I \nhope we can do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1170\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is an amendment that has been filed \nand may be considered this evening, which I think is extremely \nimportant. I wish to speak to it. It is the McConnell amendment, \noffered by the Republican leader, amendment 1170, to the immigration \nbill.\n  This amendment has very little to do with this immigration bill, but \nit is one of the most important issues any Congress could ever \nconsider. It is about Americans' right to vote.\n  The right to vote is the most fundamental right in a free and \nDemocratic society. In fact, in Reynolds v. Sims, the Supreme Court \ncalled it ``preservative of other basic civil and political rights.''\n  I think that is fair warning to all of us that when we consider the \nMcConnell amendment, we should understand this is not just another \namendment. This amendment goes to the heart of our franchise as \nAmericans. It goes to the heart of our democracy. We have come a long \nway in our country on the issue of voting rights. Last year, we \nreauthorized the historic Voting Rights Act, the landmark act passed in \n1965 safeguarding the right to vote for millions of Americans who had \nbeen denied that fundamental right for generations. The amendment \noffered by Senator McConnell to this immigration bill will undermine \nthe Voting Rights Act. It will restrict voting rights in America. It \nwill diminish the voting rights of our American citizens, particularly \nminorities, the poor, the elderly, and the disabled. That is a historic \ndecision. This is not another commonplace amendment; it is an amendment \nof great moment.\n  I might add, the McConnell amendment is opposed by nearly every major \ncivil rights group in America today. The McConnell amendment, simply \nstated, would require that all Americans bring a government-issued, \ncurrent, valid photo ID with them when they vote. The idea may sound \nreasonable on its face until you look closely.\n  The fact is, many Americans don't have a photo ID. Twelve percent of \nAmericans don't have a driver's license. Who are those 12 percent? By \nand large, they are minorities, the poor, the elderly, and the \ndisabled. A 2005 University of Wisconsin study showed that over 50 \npercent of African-American and Hispanic adults in Milwaukee don't have \na valid driver's license. The McConnell amendment will have a \ndisproportionately negative impact on these groups. It will diminish \ntheir right to vote.\n  Second, the McConnell amendment may be on its face unconstitutional. \nThe State of Georgia passed a photo ID law in 2005, and it was struck \ndown by the courts. A Federal district court judge said it constituted \na modern-day\n\n[[Page S7058]]\n\n``poll tax'' and was presumptively unconstitutional. An appellate panel \nof three judges, including two Republican appointees, agreed. What gave \nrise to the Georgia photo ID law? Was there a history of election fraud \nin that State? No. The Georgia secretary of state said she was unaware \nof a single documented case in recent years of fraud through \nimpersonation of a voter at the polls.\n  Cries of voter fraud are heard over and over again. It is one of Karl \nRove's inspired strategies to keep raising this issue. But these are \nphantom cries. Look at the numbers. Since 2002, 196 million votes have \nbeen cast in Federal elections. Do you know how many voter fraud \nconvictions there have been from those 196 million votes? Fifty-two out \nof 196 million. Most of these were for vote-buying and voter \nregistration fraud, neither of which would be stopped by a photo ID.\n  Sadly, and cynically, photo ID laws are being pushed by some for \npartisan reasons.\n  Seventh Circuit Judge Terrence Evans wrote, while dissenting in a \nrecent Federal case that upheld a photo ID law in Indiana:\n\n       Let's not beat around the bush. The Indiana voter photo ID \n     is a not-too-thinly-veiled attempt to discourage election-day \n     turnout by certain folks believed to skew Democratic. We \n     should subject this law to strict scrutiny . . . and strike \n     it down as an undue burden on the fundamental right to vote.\n\n  We have recently learned about the troubling role played by partisan \npolitical appointees at Alberto Gonzales's Justice Department in \nclearing the Georgia photo ID law. According to press reports, the \ncareer staff at the Justice Department made a recommendation to object \nto the Georgia photo ID law because they believed it would have a \ndiscriminatory impact on minority voters. But the career employees at \nthe Department of Justice were overruled by the political appointees of \nthe President and Alberto Gonzales.\n  One of these political appointees, Bradley Schlozman, was rewarded by \nreceiving a U.S. attorney appointment in Kansas City, MO--job well done \nfor Mr. Schlozman. He went to Kansas City and decided he would continue \nto pursue the Karl Rove strategy of voter fraud. By any objective \nmeasure, Mr. Schlozman was unqualified to be a U.S. attorney. As he \ntestified earlier today at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Mr. \nSchlozman had never worked as a prosecutor and never even tried a case. \nBut by embracing this phantom voter strategy of Karl Rove in Georgia, \nMr. Schlozman earned his stripes and was promoted. In the eyes of Karl \nRove, Kyle Sampson, and Monica Goodling, he was a ``loyal Bushie.''\n  I was proud to cosponsor a resolution in 2005 by my colleague, \nSenator Obama. The resolution condemned the Justice Department's \napproval of the Georgia photo ID law and expressed the sense of \nCongress that requiring a photo ID in order to vote places a \ndiscriminatory burden on voting rights. The McConnell amendment is an \nattempt to impose the Georgia photo ID law on America. This measure was \ndebated and defeated in 2002 when we enacted the Help America Vote Act. \nIt should be defeated again now.\n  I realize the photo ID requirement was proposed a few years ago by a \nbipartisan commission. But since that commission report was issued, new \nresearch conducted for the bipartisan Election Assistance Commission \nhas shown that photo ID requirements reduced turnout in the 2004 \nelection by 3 percent. It showed that with voter ID requirements, \nHispanics were 10 percent less likely to vote and African Americans 6 \npercent less likely. Is that what we should do in Congress--create \nbarriers for minorities to vote?\n  The McConnell amendment is unfair and unconstitutional. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n7:20 this evening be for debate to run concurrently with respect to the \nMcConnell amendment No. 1170 and the Feingold amendment No. 1176, with \nthe time equally divided and controlled between Senators McConnell, \nFeingold, or their designees; that no amendment be in order to either \namendment prior to the vote; that each amendment must receive 60 \naffirmative votes to be agreed to; that if they do not receive 60 \naffirmative votes, then the amendment be withdrawn; that the amendments \nbe voted in the order listed in this agreement; and that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to the second vote and that the second \nvote be 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of S. 1348 tomorrow, June 6, there be 2 hours of debate \nequally divided and controlled between Senators Kennedy and Cornyn or \ntheir designees, with the time to run concurrently on the Cornyn \namendment No. 1184, as modified, and a Kennedy amendment relating to \nthe same subject, with no amendments in order to either amendment prior \nto the vote; that upon the use or yielding back of the time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the Kennedy amendment, to be followed by \na vote in relation to the Cornyn amendment, with 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to the second vote, and with the above occurring \nwithout further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I would hope this would set the process in order that we \ncan work through all these amendments. The staffs have been working, \nlining up other amendments, for votes on those. This is the third time \nnow I have asked for a list of finite amendments. We hope they will be \ngermane amendments but finite amendments. We will see if we can have a \nperiod of time that we ask for those. When that time arrives, those \nwould be all the amendments that would be available on this bill. We \nhave done that on many previous occasions. I hope it works.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, a group of Senators who constructed this \nbill have been meeting and are trying to follow the plan that the \nmajority leader has just articulated. We would ask the cooperation of \nall those who have amendments to be in a position to move promptly \ntomorrow with time agreements to see if we can't show sufficient \nprogress tomorrow to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1176\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support \namendment No. 1176. This amendment contains the language of S. 621, the \nWartime Treatment Study Act, a bipartisan bill I have introduced with \nmy friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley.\n  This amendment would create two fact-finding commissions: one \ncommission to review the U.S. Government's treatment of German \nAmericans, Italian Americans, and European Latin Americans during World \nWar II, and another commission to review the U.S. Government's \ntreatment of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution during World War \nII. This amendment would help us to learn more about how recent \nimmigrants and refugees were treated during World War II.\n  The United States fought a courageous battle against the spread of \nNazism and fascism. But we should not let justifiable pride in our \nNation's triumph in World War II blind us to the treatment of some \nAmericans by their own government.\n  Many Americans are aware that during World War II, under the \nauthority of Executive Order 9066 and the Alien Enemies Act, the U.S. \nGovernment forced more than 100,000 ethnic Japanese from their homes \nand into relocation and internment camps. Through the work of the \nCommission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians created by \nCongress in 1980, this unfortunate episode in our history finally \nreceived the official acknowledgment and condemnation it deserved.\n  But that same respect has not been shown to the many German \nAmericans, Italian Americans, and European Latin Americans who were \ntaken from their homes, subjected to curfews, limited in their travel, \ndeprived of their personal property, and, in the worst cases, placed in \ninternment camps. This amendment would simply create a commission to \nreview the facts and circumstances of the U.S. Government's\n\n[[Page S7059]]\n\ntreatment of German Americans, Italian Americans, and other European \nAmericans during World War II. It is time for a full accounting of that \nsad chapter in our history.\n  A second commission created by this amendment would review the \ntreatment by the U.S. government of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \nNazi persecution and genocide and tried to come to the United States. \nGerman and Austrian Jews applied for visas, but the United States \nseverely limited their entry due to strict immigration policies, \npolicies that many believe were motivated by fear that our enemies \nwould send spies under the guise of refugees and by the unfortunate \nantiforeigner and anti-Semitic attitudes that were, sadly, all too \ncommon at that time.\n  It is time for the country to review the facts and determine how our \nimmigration policies failed to provide adequate safe harbor to Jewish \nrefugees fleeing the persecution of Nazi Germany.\n  It is urgent that we pass this legislation. We cannot wait any \nlonger. The injustices to European Americans and Jewish refugees \noccurred more than 50 years ago. Many of those who were harmed are no \nlonger with us, the rest are very elderly.\n  Americans must learn from these tragedies now, before there is no one \nleft. These people have suffered long enough without the comfort of an \nofficial, independent study of what happened to them, and without \nknowing that this Nation recognizes their sacrifice and resolves to \nlearn from the mistakes of the past.\n  This amendment does not call for reparations. All it does is ensure \nthat the public has a full accounting of what happened. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the bipartisan Wartime Treatment \nStudy Act as an amendment to this immigration legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1170\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as we move forward on this immigration \nbill, we need to make sure we protect voters and the 15th amendment by \nprotecting against illegal voting. The Constitution maintains that \nvoting is a privilege reserved for U.S. citizens. Noncitizens do not \nhave this right. Those who don't abide by our laws are not free to \ninfluence our political process or our policies with a vote.\n  The bipartisan Carter-Baker Commission on Federal Election Reform \nproposed requiring photo ID cards to ensure those who are voting are \nthe same people as those on the rolls and that they are legally \nentitled to vote.\n  Photo IDs are needed in this country to board a plane, to enter a \nFederal building, to cash a check, even to join a wholesale shopping \nclub. If they are required for buying bulk toothpaste, they should be \nrequired to prove that somebody actually has a right to vote.\n  Some have said this legislation penalizes those who are unable to \nafford a photo ID. In fact, it establishes a grant program to provide \nno-cost photo IDs to those who cannot afford them.\n  ID cards would reduce irregularities dramatically. In doing so, they \nwould increase confidence in the system. An overwhelming majority of \nAmericans support this attempt to ensure the integrity of our \nelections.\n  An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll, last year, showed that 62 \npercent of respondents strongly--that is strongly--favor requiring a \nuniversal, tamperproof ID at the polls. Nineteen percent said they \nmildly favor IDs. Twelve percent were neutral.\n  Add that up, and you have over 80 percent who think this is a good \nidea. America is very accustomed to showing a photo ID to do virtually \nanything.\n  Ninety-three percent of those who were asked for their opinion were \neither undecided or in favor of implementing the control, as I \nindicated.\n  Two dozen States already require some form of ID at the polls. That \nis 24 of our States. Almost half of them already have this requirement.\n  My amendment simply establishes a Federal minimum standard that is \nconsistent and allows States wide flexibility in determining the kind \nof ID required.\n  We need to harden antifraud protections at the polls to protect the \nrights of all voters. Voting is the cornerstone of our democracy, and \nwe must preserve its integrity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, this week, the Senate is debating \nhow to reform our Nation's immigration policies, and while this is a \ncontentious debate, there is one point I think all sides agree upon--\nU.S. citizenship is a prized possession. The most fundamental right \nafforded to us as U.S. citizens is the right to vote. I am disturbed \nthat there is an amendment being offered on this bill that seeks to \nlimit citizens' access to that right.\n  Senator McConnell has offered an amendment that requires U.S. \ncitizens to show identification before they can exercise the most \nimportant right afforded them by the U.S. Constitution. Proponents of \nthis bill argue that this identification is necessary to combat voter \nfraud. In fact, before the last elections in 2006 we heard a great deal \nabout the threat of voter fraud.\n  This administration staked a lot on that so-called threat. We have \nlearned in recent months that such a threat just did not exist. The St. \nLouis Post-Dispatch said it best, when, in an April 17, 2007 editorial, \nthe paper called this whole ``voter fraud'' issue a ``snipe hunt'': \n``In a snipe hunt, gullible kids are taken out to the woods, handed \nsticks and gunny sacks and told track down the elusive snipe. \nMeanwhile, their pals, who know a snipe is a bird of marsh and shore \nand generally found nowhere near the woods, yuck it up.''\n  Well, in this snipe hunt, the Senate is supposed to fall prey to the \nruse that there are folks out there just lining up on election day to \nfraudulently cast their vote and we in the Senate and in Congress need \nto get our sticks and gunny sacks ready, so we can snare some of these \nfraudulent voters. Well, let me tell you, I am not going to fall for \nit.\n  Because the facts say something different. A 5-year study by the \nElection Assistance Commission shows that voter fraud is almost non-\nexistent. A report from the Missouri Secretary of State shows that no \none in the State tried to vote with a fake ID in 2006. The Carter-Baker \ncommission said that in 2002-2004 fraudulent votes made up .000003 \npercent of the votes cast. That is a lot of zeros. Let me say it a \ndifferent way. Out of almost 200 million votes that were cast during \nthese elections, 52 were fraudulent. To put that into some context, you \nare statistically more likely to get killed by lightning than to find a \nfraudulent vote in a Federal election.\n  The Department of Justice, which in 2002 created a voter fraud task \nforce, has admitted that only 86 people were convicted of voter fraud-\nrelated crimes in the last 5 years and only 24 convictions during the \nlast 3 years--a rate of 8 per year.\n  So, because 24 people nationwide in the last years may have voted \ndespite their ineligibility to do so, we here in the Senate are \nsupposed to pass a bill requiring all citizens to show ID when they \nvote.\n  That would be a mistake, and you only have to look to the State of \nGeorgia to see why.\n  Georgia's photo ID requirement was a poll tax for the 21st century. \nIt was a law that required some of the poorest in our country--those \nwho probably don't have access to transportation--to possibly travel \ngreat distances and pay up to $35 just for the privilege of making \ntheir voice heard.\n  We have to remember this is a group that is disproportionately poor \nand without easy access to all the documents necessary for a \ngovernment-issued ID. So even if this ID card were completely free, how \neasy would it be for an 85-year-old grandmother to find her birth \ncertificate? Who would drive the destitute all the way to the nearest \nFederal building to get one of these cards? While the McConnell \namendment authorizes ``such sums as may be necessary'' to pay for these \nID cards, it is a frightening proposal to condition the right to vote \non the appropriations process.\n  After Hurricane Katrina ravaged the gulf coast, our country awakened \nto the plight of the most vulnerable Americans--the ones who, when the \nstorm hit, couldn't just hop in their SUVs, fill up with $100 worth of \ngas, put some bottled water in the trunk, drive off with their credit \ncard in hand,\n\n[[Page S7060]]\n\nand check into the nearest hotel until the calamity passed. We learned \nthat, when we pass laws and make policy in this country, our government \ntoo often forgets these Americans--that we too often ignore their \nneeds.\n  Now, here is an amendment doing that again. This time, by limiting \naccess to one of our most fundamental and constitutional-protected \nrights: the right to vote.\n  I would ask that all my colleagues reject the amendment so we can \nmove on to the important business at hand.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. The McConnell amendment would limit the ability of many \nAmerican citizens to exercise the fundamental right to vote. It is \nnothing more than a 21st century poll tax.\n  The 24th amendment states that ``The right of citizens of the United \nStates to vote . . . shall not be denied or abridged by the United \nStates or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other \ntax.''\n  This amendment would force all citizens to obtain a government-issued \nphoto ID in order to vote. Many citizens who have voted for years don't \nown the government-issued photo identification needed to meet the \nrequirement. They would have to pay for the ID or at least for the \nunderlying documents needed to get one.\n  Among the persons who will be hardest hit are the elderly, \nminorities, and persons with disabilities. That is who this amendment \nis targeting.\n  Many seniors don't have photo ID because they don't need a driver's \nlicense. But they should still have the right to vote.\n  Many Americans who are blind or have other disabilities also don't \nhave a photo ID because they don't have driver's licenses either. But \nthey should still have the right to vote.\n  Some religious minorities, such as the Amish, want to vote, but their \nfaith does not allow them to have their pictures taken. We should never \nrequire citizens to violate their religious beliefs or to pay to cast a \nvote.\n  Many African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans also lack photo \nID. Under this amendment, these citizens would lose the right to vote \nif they don't get a government-issued photo ID.\n  Some citizens in this country were never issued a birth certificate, \nparticularly African-American seniors born in the South or rural areas \nand Native Americans. If we pass this amendment, we turn our backs on \nthem.\n  Many voters had their lives devastated by Hurricane Katrina. What \nabout them? What about the elderly grandmother displaced by Hurricane \nKatrina who lost all of her possessions in the hurricane and now lives \nhundreds of miles from her birthplace and home? If she doesn't drive, \nhow is she going to get the documents she needs to vote under this \namendment? If she is retired or lost her job because of the storm, she \nmay not be able to afford the documents. Separated from her family and \nneighbors, she may not have anyone to help her fill out the forms and \nget to the right government agencies to obtain the documents she needs.\n  This country failed the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Are we going to \ndisenfranchise them as well?\n  Supporters of the amendment say, ``Don't worry. Under this amendment, \nStates will give out free identification cards to those who can't \nafford them.'' That sounds good in theory, but what about in practice? \nCitizens will still have to deal with State and local bureaucracies to \nprove who they are.\n  Poll taxes have a dark and notorious history in this country. When we \nconsidered a poll tax ban in the 1965 Voting Rights Act, poll taxes \nwere a tried-and-true tactic to prevent African Americans and poor \nwhites from voting. I introduced an amendment to the 1965 act to ban \npoll taxes in all elections--Federal, State, and local. We had days and \ndays of debate on the Senate floor about poll taxes. Not everyone \nagreed on how to fix the problem. The final amendment made clear that \npoll taxes infringe the right to vote and directed the Attorney General \nto challenge them in court.\n  A year later, in Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, the Supreme \nCourt held that poll taxes are unconstitutional. The Court declared \nthat ``the right to vote is too precious, too fundamental to be so \nburdened or conditioned'' on the ability to pay.\n  We thought that poll taxes and other blatant barriers to the right to \nvote were vestiges of a bygone era. But today, Republican-controlled \nState legislatures around the country are attempting to enact photo \nidentification laws.\n  Federal and State courts have already struck down State laws similar \nto the McConnell amendment. In Georgia, a Federal court has stopped two \ndifferent attempts to impose a photo identification requirement. Judge \nMurphy ruled the first an unconstitutional poll tax because of the cost \nthat hundreds of thousands of Georgians without photo identification \nwould have to pay to obtain them.\n  The State's second attempt made the IDs free, just as this amendment \nsupposedly does, but it was still struck down as unconstitutional. The \ncourt held that Georgia's interest in combating nonexistent vote fraud \ndidn't justify the ``severe burden'' on voters without photo \nidentification who would have to get through several layers of \nbureaucracy to obtain the documents required. A State court also ruled \nthat the Georgia law violated the State constitution because it \ndisenfranchised citizens who were otherwise qualified to vote.\n  A similar proposal recently was struck down in Missouri. The judge \nspelled out the problem loud and clear. For some, he said, the burden \nof a photo ID requirement may not seem great. But ``for the elderly, \nthe poor, the undereducated, or otherwise disadvantaged, the burden can \nbe great if not insurmountable, and it is those very people . . . who \nare the least equipped to bear the costs or navigate the many \nbureaucracies necessary to obtain the required documentation.''\n  Supporters of this modern-day poll tax claim it is just common sense. \n``What's the big deal?'' they ask. After all, if you need a photo ID to \nget on a plane or rent a movie or drive a car, it is only reasonable to \nrequire such an ID to vote.\n  But voting is a right in this country and not simply a privilege. We \nneed to restrict who can get on a plane or drive a car, but we should \nnever restrict the precious right to vote. As Judge Callahan put it in \nthe Missouri case, ``While a license to drive may be just that--a \nlicense and not a right, the right to vote is also just that--a right \nand not a license.''\n  When proponents of this amendment stand up to explain why America \nneeds this legislation, listen carefully. During the floor debate on a \nsimilar proposal in the House, the amendment's Republican supporters \nstrained to convince us that we have a major problem because \nnoncitizens and others are posing as eligible voters. But they couldn't \ngive us any evidence.\n  The fact is, voter fraud simply isn't a major problem. It certainly \nisn't a serious enough problem to justify disenfranchising Americans on \na massive scale--which is exactly what this proposal would do.\n  Proponents of this 21st century poll tax have no evidence that it is \nneeded because all the facts show it is not needed. Here is what the \nhard evidence tells us about voter impersonation in this country:\n  A recent article in the New York Times found that voter fraud is \nexceedingly rare. It found that, over a 5-year-period, the Justice \nDepartment, despite focusing its effort on prosecuting individuals for \nvoter fraud, a top priority of Karl Rove, ``turned up virtually no \nevidence of any organized effort to skew federal elections'' through \nfraudulent voting. There have been only 86 convictions nationwide. That \nis less than 90 instances of anyone voting who wasn't supposed to vote \nin the entire country in 5 years. In addition, according to the \narticle, many of these people, voted or registered to vote by mistake, \nwithout knowing they were not eligible.\n  Statewide surveys in Ohio after the 2002 and 2004 elections found \nonly four instances of ineligible persons voting or attempting to \nvote--four out of over 9 million votes cast during those elections. \nThat is a rate of 0.00004 percent.\n  In Georgia, where state legislators cited voting fraud as the need \nfor a photo ID law, secretary of state Cathy Cox could recall only one \ncase of voter fraud involving the impersonation of a\n\n[[Page S7061]]\n\nregistered voter during her 10 years of service.\n  Out of nearly 200 million votes cast since 2002, only 86 individuals \nnationwide have been convicted of election fraud. And many of those \noffenses involved conduct that would not be remedied by a photo \nidentification requirement.\n  The evidence also makes very clear that this proposal would \ndisenfranchise millions of citizens who are eligible to vote.\n  A University of Wisconsin study found that in Milwaukee nearly 50 \npercent of African-American and Latino men did not have government-\nissued photo identification.\n  According to AARP, 36 percent of voters in Georgia over the age of 75 \ndon't have government-issued photo identification.\n  Georgia Secretary of State Cox found that nearly 700,000, or 1 in 7, \nregistered voters in Georgia do not have a driver's license or State-\nissued non-driver's license, which this amendment would require in \norder to vote.\n  According to the Department of Transportation, 6 to 12 percent of \neligible voters do not currently have the identification the amendment \nwould require.\n  The American Association of People with Disabilities estimates that \nnearly 4 million Americans with disabilities would be disenfranchised \nif this proposal takes effect.\n  Native Americans living on tribal lands, often without street \naddresses and with traditions that don't permit the taking of their \npicture, would also be disenfranchised by this law.\n  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that 11 million \nU.S.-born citizens do not have a birth certificate or passport readily \navailable to them and therefore could be disenfranchised under this \namendment. The burden falls unequally on some geographic regions as \nwell as on our most vulnerable populations:\n  It hurts the elderly--some 2.3 million elderly Americans lack the \nrequired documents.\n  It hurts rural residents, since approximately 4.5 million rural \nAmericans lack the documents necessary to establish their citizenship.\n  It hurts citizens living in the South and Midwest--8.4 million \nresidents of Southern and Midwestern States don't have the documents \nthis amendment would require to vote.\n  It hurts the poor--nearly 3 million citizens making less than $25,000 \na year lack a passport and birth certificate.\n  It hurts African Americans--2 million African Americans lack a \npassport and birth certificate. Many elderly African Americans have no \nbirth certificate because they were born at home at a time when \nhospitals were closed to African Americans because of racial \ndiscrimination. One study estimates that a fifth of all African \nAmericans born in 1939 and 1940 were never issued birth certificates.\n  Under the Bush administration we are running historic deficits and \nour debt is mounting. We can't afford the cost of a program designed to \nfight a nonexistent problem.\n  At a time when Americans have serious concerns about the proper \nfunctioning and integrity of voting machines, the Republican Party \nresponds with a solution in search of a problem. They want to pass a \nlaw that threatens to disenfranchise millions of eligible voters. To \nthose who were disenfranchised in the 2000 and 2004 elections by \nwrongful purges, erroneous registration lists, poll worker errors, \nuncounted provisional ballots, of long lines, this is our answer?\n  If the Senator from Kentucky is serious about election reform, we \nstand ready to work together. But it is cynical to take such a serious \nand important issue, so fundamental to democracy, and use it for \npartisan politics.\n  Last July, Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act with broad \nbipartisan support. The reauthorization passed overwhelmingly in the \nHouse and by a unanimous vote in the Senate. Republicans and Democrats \ncame together to tear down barriers to the ballot box.\n  Now some on the other side of the aisle want to erect new barriers to \nvoting by telling Americans they need a passport to vote. If we adopt \nthis amendment, we undermine the Voting Rights Act's important \nprotections. This amendment would disenfranchise many of the same \nvoters we tried to protect with that historic legislation last year.\n  Mr. President, that is unfair, undemocratic, and unconstitutional. I \nurge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin has 1 minute 37 seconds. The Republican \nleader has 2 minutes 7 seconds.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I assume we will not have the time \nbefore the vote, then. This is the remaining time we have, correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, my amendment, again, contains the language of S. 621, \nthe Wartime Treatment Study Act, a bill I have introduced with my \nfriend from Iowa, Senator Grassley. It is not controversial.\n  It would simply create two fact-finding commissions: one commission \nto review the U.S. Government's treatment of German Americans, Italian \nAmericans, and European Latin Americans during World War II and another \ncommission to review the U.S. Government's treatment of Jewish refugees \nfleeing Nazi persecution during World War II.\n  These commissions would complete the work of the Commission on \nWartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, created by Congress in \n1980 to study the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans \nduring World War II. Thanks to that commission, this unfortunate \nepisode in our history finally received the official acknowledgement \nand condemnation it deserved.\n  My amendment would simply allow that work to be completed. It is time \nto pass this legislation, now, before all the individuals affected by \nthese policies are gone. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The time for the Senator from Wisconsin has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is the time up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 41 seconds left of the \nRepublican leader's time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we start the \nvote now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1170\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1170.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

So I will stand right here until we get order. \nMay we have order in the Senate?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Look at the people up there. There are people up there. \nThey ought not be in that well when there are votes going on. Read your \nrule book. Come on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore is correct.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  This bill would simply create two fact-finding commissions: one \ncommission to review the U.S. Government's treatment of German \nAmericans, Italian Americans, and European Latin Americans during World \nWar II, and another commission to review the U.S. Government's \ntreatment of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution during World War \nII.\n  These commissions would complete the work of the Commission on \nWartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians created by Congress in \n1980 to study the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans \nduring World War II. Thanks to that commission, this unfortunate \nepisode in our history finally received the official acknowledgment and \ncondemnation it deserved. My amendment would simply allow that work to \nbe completed. It is time to pass this legislation now before all of the \nindividuals affected by these policies are gone. I urge my colleagues \nto support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there are two problems with the \nlegislation, as detailed in a 5- or 6-page memorandum from the \nDepartment of Justice, Richard Hertling, the principal Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General who opposes this legislation. First, it falsely \nasserts in the findings matters that slander America incorrectly. It \nfinds that thousands of individuals were subjected to devastating \nviolations of civil rights through arrest, internment, property \nconfiscation, deportation, and detrimental effects still being \nexperienced; whereas, the Department of Justice asked the senior \nhistorian at the U.S. Holocaust Museum about this language and he found \nthat language was outrageously exaggerated and was inaccurate.\n  That is in the legislation. When asked would Senator Feingold accept \nan amendment that prohibited reparations--and reparations have been \ndone in some of these cases--that language was not accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from South Dakota \n(Mr. Johnson), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 67, nays 26, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 185 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--67\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--26\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Sessions\n     Stevens\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--6\n\n     Biden\n     Brownback\n     Dodd\n     Johnson\n     McCain\n     Obama\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 67, the nays are \n26. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of \nthis amendment, the amendment is agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are working in good faith to move this \nbill forward. We had seven rollcall votes before the recess and six \nadditional amendments adopted by voice vote. That is 13. Yesterday, we \nadopted four more amendments by voice vote. Today, we had four rollcall \nvotes. Tomorrow morning, we will vote on the Cornyn-Kennedy amendment, \neligibility for legalization program, and then we are prepared to enter \na unanimous consent agreement for the 10 remaining amendments that are \npending. We have done quite well. We will have done 23 rollcall votes \nwhen we finish these 3 tomorrow, and we adopted 10 by voice vote. I \nknow the staff has been working on this for some time now. I hope we \ncan work out an arrangement to get rid of the pending amendments and \nmove on to other amendments people talked about all day they want to \noffer. I think that is appropriate.\n  Tonight, we are going to, because we agreed to lay down a Domenici \namendment and one I am going to offer dealing with earned-income tax \ncredit--those will be the two amendments we are going to lay down \ntonight. Anyway, somebody else is going to do it. There are two \namendments we are going to lay down tonight, so we will have two more \nthat will be pending tomorrow,\n\n[[Page S7063]]\n\nand I hope we can arrange votes on those amendments. Once we finish \nthose amendments, I hope other Senators will offer amendments. I hope \nthey will consider some germane amendments.\n  In addition to the amendments that are pending, we have a number of \namendments that are at the desk, I understand, and we have taken a look \nat those, and maybe we can work something out on those amendments.\n  This is a difficult bill, we understand that. I hope the offers I \nmade today are considered serious. I repeat, I am not going to go \nthrough the litany of amendments, the unanimous consent requests. One \nis we would vote cloture--rather than Thursday morning, do it Thursday \nnight. That is certainly something we could consider. Anyway, there are \nall kinds of alternatives we can do to move this bill forward if people \nwant to do that.\n  As I said, there is no need to run through the unanimous consent \nrequests I did previously. We will call it quits for the night. There \nis no more business on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask, so the managers don't have to stay around--I \nwonder if we can move to a period for morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. That way, the Senator from Alabama can speak, and I would \ncertainly consent to, when we take up the bill tomorrow, his remarks \nappearing as though we are working on the pending legislation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am sorry, I did not hear the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I asked unanimous consent that there be a period for \nmorning business. I know the Senator from Alabama wishes to speak. I \nassume it is on matters dealing with immigration.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, with regard to that, I have amendments I \noffered last Thursday and Friday and Monday that were not accepted. I \nwas going to ask if those amendments could be made pending in addition \nto the nine amendments which were filed this week which I would like to \nmake pending so we can have votes on them.\n  Mr. REID. I withdraw my consent for morning business, Mr. President. \nI think we have a couple of amendments that are part of the 10 we are \ngoing to try to get rid of tomorrow.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, for clarification, two amendments are \nbasically the same amendment. We would only vote on one pending that I \noffered last week. In addition, last week, I filed two more amendments, \nand an objection was made to making them pending. So I renew my offer \nto at least make those two amendments pending. I filed them this \nmorning.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Alabama, I think we have made a \nsuggestion, and it is appropriate to move forward, that with regard to \nthe 10 or 12 amendments now pending, we will set up times to vote on \nthese, either by motions to table or if we can work out side-by-sides, \nwhatever it takes, and then move to other amendments.\n  Certainly, the Senator from Alabama has been patient. We understand \nhe has other amendments he wants to offer. But I object at this time \nuntil we get some plan for tomorrow to dispose of these amendments we \nhave.\n  I have indicated a number of different alternatives, and others may \ncome up with better suggestions. One is, let's get a list of finite \namendments from the minority. We will add ours in with those, and we \nhave done that on a number of occasions here. It will have to be done \nby unanimous consent, but it is worth a try. We can have a list of how \nmany amendments people think are appropriate on this bill. Let's see if \nwe can get that done by tomorrow morning.\n  We know the Senator from Alabama has a number he wishes to make part \nof that list, and other Senators have amendments they want to make part \nof that list. I have seen Senator Thune, Senator DeMint, and Senator \nCoburn here. There are other people who want to offer amendments, I \nunderstand, but let's get a finite list of who wants to offer \namendments and what the amendments are.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I take that as an objection to my \nrequest.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I did object. I am sorry I didn't make it clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would the majority----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader controls the time.\n  Mr. REID. We are on the bill still; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, we are.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the role of the majority \nleader. I have great affection for the majority leader. He is an \neffective leader for his agenda. But with regard to what is happening \nnow, we need to fully understand that by utilizing the ability he has \nas a leader and as other members of his party--they have objected to \ncalling up amendments and making them pending. When you object to \nmaking an amendment pending, all you have is a filed amendment. And \nwhen you file cloture, amendments that are not pending are not entitled \nto be voted on.\n  So, in effect, we are at the mercy of the majority leader. He has not \nallowed a full and vigorous offering of amendments and votes on those \namendments. I know people can sometimes ask for too many votes and \nabuse the process, but we really are dealing with a monstrous bill that \nis very complex and has a loophole here and a loophole there that can \nplace the bill in such a situation that it really is not enforceable \nand will not work, and there are a host of problems, a host of \nloopholes in the bill. This bill has been moving forward to passage \nunder the railroad system we have here.\n  Let me remind everybody how it happened. First, 2 weeks before we had \nour recess, the old bill, last year's bill that the House refused to \neven take up, was brought up without committee hearings this year and \nbrought up by the majority leader under rule XIV for consideration and \ndebate. So about a week goes by, and then come last Tuesday before our \nrecess, Tuesday morning, he plops down on this floor an amendment but \nreally a complete substitute. If put in proper bill language, it would \nprobably be nearly a thousand pages. It is a substitute, a bill never \nseen before, a bill--except maybe a few days by people who got their \nhands on it--a bill that has never gone through committee was put down, \nand the majority leader indicated he wanted to vote on it that week and \nwe were going to have\n\n[[Page S7064]]\n\na vote on Friday, and there is was a lot of push back. He agreed to put \nit off.\n  We only had a few votes last week. We didn't vote last Friday. We \ndidn't have the bill up even on Monday. So for only 3 days the week \nbefore the recess, we were engaged with actual amendments on this \nlegislation. Then we come back, and on Monday of this week, we had a \nfew Senators show up, no votes, and a few of us talked a little bit, \nand that was it. So nothing was done Monday. I recall I did offer to \nbring up amendments and asked to bring up amendments and make pending \namendments last Thursday, last Friday, and Monday of this week.\n  I just want to say that we are not moving in a legitimate way. This \nwas a completely new bill which was offered as a substitute to last \nyear's bill. Senator Specter, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary \nCommittee, who supports this legislation, said in retrospect we should \nhave gone to committee with it. I say that would have helped to have \nhad a little bit of sunshine on it. But as we examine the bill in more \ndepth, as we look at it more closely, what we see is that as sunlight \nfalls on the mackerel, it begins to smell more and more, I have to tell \nyou.\n  As it was promoted to me by the White House talking points and by \nSenators who thought it was a good piece of legislation, I had some \nbelief that it could be progress over last year. Indeed, I thought \nthere was a real potential to make a bill this year that I could \nsupport and with which we could make progress. But as we have examined \nit, it fails to meet the promises that were contained in those \nprinciples set forth as they were writing up the bill. It just does \nnot. It does not have good enforcement. It does not. The trigger \nmechanism that guarantees enforcement before amnesty is weak and \nineffectual. The shift to merit-based, skill-based immigration is \nineffectual, and it puts off for 8 years, and we have people offering \namendments to weaken that even further. So those were good principles \nthat were stated but did not become reality.\n\n  I saw part of the debate on the TV in the cloakroom a few minutes ago \nand people were saying this is going to make the country safe, and we \nneed to pass it because it is going to make us safe. Well, let us talk \nabout some of the loopholes that are in this legislation still. I have \nlisted 20. I think we probably have a lot more than that which we could \nhave listed, but I will share some of the weaknesses.\n  This is as a result of the fact that individuals in the U.S. Border \nPatrol were not consulted in how to write the bill. If they had been \nconsulted, some of these weaknesses wouldn't have been here. It is \ninteresting, however, that some of these weaknesses were pointed out \nand complained of, but the drafters refused to listen. Why not?\n  For example, loophole No. 5: Legal status must be granted to illegal \naliens 24 hours after they file an application--must be granted legal \nstatus--even if the alien has not yet passed all appropriate background \nchecks.\n  Last year, the bill called for 90 days to complete the background \nchecks. Yes, some aspects can be completed within a few minutes or a \nfew hours, but a lot of things cannot. What if the person is named John \nSmith? There are a hundred John Smiths. How are you going to check \nthose? A thousand John Smiths. I think this is a weakness.\n  In fact, the Border Patrol experts who called a press conference \nyesterday raised that particular point in a number of ways. Kent \nLundgren, the national chairman of the Association of Former Border \nPatrol Agents, was contemptuous of the bill and said there are ``no \nmeaningful criminal or terrorist checks'' in the bill. He said, ``There \nis no way records can be done in 24 hours.''\n  Jim Dorcy, an agent with 30 years experience, and who has also moved \nup to inspector general of the Department of Justice, said: ``24-hour \ncheck is a recipe for disaster.''\n  Then he went on to say, ``I call it the al Qaeda Dream Bill.'' That \nwas from a TV program I happened to catch last night on C-SPAN, a \nNational Press Club presentation by a group of former Border Patrol \nofficers, and I am going to quote from them a little more in a minute.\n  Look at loophole No. 7. They say this bill will make us safer, but \nunder the bill that is before us today, illegal aliens with terrorism \nconnections are not barred from getting amnesty. An illegal alien with \nterrorist connections is not barred from getting amnesty. An illegal \nalien seeking most immigration benefits normally would have to show \n``good moral character.''\n  For all its flaws, last year's bill specifically barred aliens with \nterrorism connections from being able to meet the definition of ``good \nmoral character.'' How simple is that? And from being eligible for \namnesty. But this year's bill does neither. This is another example of \na provision in this year's bill that make it weaker than last year's \nbill, and I am finding this more and more.\n  We were told this bill was much better than last year's bill. I even \ntold people that I think this is going to be a better bill than last \nyear's. I am interested in what is contained in it. But repeatedly I am \nfinding provisions like this one that indicate this bill is weaker than \nlast year's.\n  Additionally, the bill's drafters ignored the Bush administration's \nrequest that changes be made in the asylum, cancellation of removal, \nand withholding of removal statutes in order to prevent aliens with \nterrorist connections from receiving relief. Last year's section 204 of \nthe bill added the new terrorism bars to good moral character.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \nan additional 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Last year's bill added new terrorism bars to the good \nmoral character requirement and required that an alien prove they have \ngood moral character. Under the Immigration and Naturalization Act, the \nINA, an illegal alien must have good moral character to receive most of \nthe immigration benefits, such as cancellation of removal from being \nhere illegally.\n  But according to the current law, the law in effect today, an alien \ncannot have good moral character if they are habitual drunkards, get \nthe majority of their income from illegal gambling, have given false \ntestimony for immigration purposes, have been in jail for 180 days, \nhave been convicted of an aggravated felony, or have engaged in \ngenocide, torture, or extrajudicial killings. Those are some of the \nthings that bar you from good moral character. This year's bill, \nhowever, is completely missing these new terrorism bars, and the bill \nno longer requires good moral character as a prerequisite to amnesty.\n\n  I wonder what this tells us about the mindset of the people who are \nactually putting the pencil to paper and drafting this legislation. \nSurely our Senators didn't fully understand it. But I have to say I am \nparticularly troubled, because the Bush administration, as much as they \nhave wanted a bill that would be exceedingly generous to immigrants, \nwanted this language strengthened, and the committee, the group that \nwrote the bill, rejected their request, which is hard for me to \nbelieve.\n  Additionally, during the course of the negotiations, the Bush \nadministration requested that language be added to the bill to make \nsure that terrorism bars kept aliens from being granted asylum, \ncancellation, and the withholding of removal. Those requests should \nhave been included and they were not. So one of the amendments I want \nto see voted on would be to restore the bars--the same or similar \nlanguage we had in last year's bill that they took out over the \nobjection of the administration.\n  Another example of a weakness in our provisions is some aggravated \nfelons who have sexually abused a minor will be eligible for amnesty \nunder this bill. A child molester who committed the crime of \nmolestation before the bill is enacted is not barred from getting \namnesty if their conviction document fails to state the age of the \nvictim. The bill, after someone raised this problem, corrected this \nproblem, but it was only for future child molesters and did not close \nthe loophole for current or past child molesters.\n  In some States, the sexual abuse of a minor can result in a \nmisdemeanor conviction. Those convictions are not\n\n[[Page S7065]]\n\nalways considered an aggravated felony for immigration or deportation \npurposes. This is not an uncommon problem. There have been lawsuits and \nappeals over this very issue. This is not uncommon.\n  One study, according to these Border Patrol experts at their press \nconference yesterday, indicated a report out of Atlanta found that \n250,000 of the 12 million illegal aliens here may have been involved in \nthe sexual abuse of a minor. That is a lot of people. Why should we \ngive amnesty and citizenship to those who may have been involved in \nthose kinds of criminal violations? Citizenship in the United States \nrequires good moral character.\n  We don't have to accept everybody who wants to be a citizen. We don't \nhave to allow anyone who broke into our country to ever become a \ncitizen. If they have broken into our country and are here illegally \nand they ask for amnesty, we have every right to say you don't get it \nif you are a child molester or have terrorist connections.\n  Look at loophole No. 8. This one is a bit amazing, I think, for \nanyone, and I find it difficult to believe. I am not making this up. \nThis is in the bill on page 289. Instead of ensuring that members of \nviolent gangs, such as MS-13, are deported, the bill will allow violent \ngang members to get amnesty as long as they renounce their gang \nmembership on their application. It has a question there: Are you a \nmember of a gang? If you said yes, the next question is: Do you \nrenounce your membership? And if you say yes, I renounce my membership, \nyou get to stay and become a citizen. Under this bill, it will not \nprevent amnesty. On page 289, the bill requires that you list gang \nmemberships.\n  Why do we allow this? If an illegal alien will be a member of a \nviolent international gang, such as the Mara Salvatrucha 13, the famous \nMS-13, a violent international gang involved in murders, drugs, and all \nkinds of crimes, why don't we say that blocks him from being eligible \nfor amnesty under the bill? Now, if they are a citizen, OK, they get to \nstay in the country. They can be a gang member. But if they are not a \ncitizen and they are here illegally and are petitioning to be given \namnesty, I would say they shouldn't be given it. They should be \nprohibited.\n  Obviously, the loyalty to these illegal criminal gangs is such that \nit is contrary to the ideals of American citizenship in which your \nloyalty is to the United States of America. As Kris Kobach, a former \ntop attorney at the Department of Justice, stated in a Heritage \nFoundation Web memo, posted after the new substitute bill was \nintroduced, titled ``Rewarding Illegal Aliens: Senate Bill Undermines \nThe Rule of Law'':\n\n       More than 30,000 illegal alien gang members operate in 33 \n     States--30,000 illegal alien gang members operate in 33 \n     States--trafficking in drugs, arms, and people. Deporting \n     illegal-alien gang members has been a top ICE priority.\n\n  It is one of the top priorities of the Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement organization. That is what they do. The Senate bill would \nend that. I am quoting Mr. Kobach.\n\n       To qualify for amnesty, all a gang member would need to do \n     is note his gang membership and sign a renunciation.\n\n  I ask again, what kind of mindset is at work here? Is our goal to \nplease every illegal alien, to make sure every illegal alien gets to \nstay in the country regardless or is it to serve our legitimate \nnational interests? I suggest any immigration bill we pass should serve \nour national interest. There is nothing wrong with that. Our \nresponsibility is to America, to the people in America. Somehow we have \ngotten that confused.\n  There are good people in this body who are more concerned about how \nnot to exclude anybody, to make sure everybody who is here gets to \nstay. And somehow, some way, through a maneuver or signing a document \nsaying you renounce your gang membership, you will get to stay. It \nraises serious questions in my mind about how this bill was written.\n  Let me mention we may have a vote on this, I think tomorrow. This is \namazing to me. Aliens who have already had their day in court, those \nwho have been given and received a final order of removal, who have \nsigned a voluntary departure order, or had reinstatement of their final \norders of removal--that is they got a delay on their final order of \nremoval and they got a stay--they are eligible for amnesty under the \nbill.\n  The same is true for aliens who have made a false claim to \ncitizenship, for those who have engaged in document fraud. More than \n636,000 alien fugitives could be covered by this one loophole--page 285 \nof the bill waives the following inadmissibility grounds. It waives \nthese grounds that would normally be a basis for inadmissability.\n  No. 1, ``Failure to attend a removal proceeding.'' You have been \nreleased on bail. They said: You are believed to be here illegally. The \ncourt hearing is going to be 3 weeks from today. We will release you on \nyour own recognizance. You just sign a document or post a small bail \nand you show up at the court hearing 3 weeks from today, 2 weeks from \ntoday, 2 months from today.\n  What if they don't show up? What if they didn't show up, they were \napprehended, ordered to show up in court and didn't show up--amnesty--\nOK, that is excluded.\n  Another category, ``Final orders of removal for alien smugglers.'' If \nyou have been apprehended, you have been ordered removed because you \nwere proven to be involved in alien smuggling, smuggling of other \npeople into our country--coyotes: You are OK. That is OK. You get to \nstay, too.\n  ``Aliens unlawfully present after previous immigration violations or \ndeportation orders.'' You have been caught for previous violations. You \nhave been ordered deported. You are back again. You are excluded and \nyou get to stay. And aliens who have previously been removed--we spend \na lot of money. We fly people back to Brazil and Honduras and Indonesia \nand China. What if they come again? Do they get amnesty, too? Yes, they \ndo.\n  This language appears to be in conflict with another statute that \nsuggests otherwise. But when you read it, my legal team and I agree \nthat the court would clearly rule that this specific language would be \nsuch that those individuals would get to stay in the country.\n  The list goes on. Loophole No. 10. The talking points we were \nprovided with that indicated this to be a good bill and that we should \nbe supportive of it emphasize that the new bill we have would promote \ngreater assimilation of those who come here to our country and greater \nEnglish proficiency--both of which I think are good ideas and we need \nto work on and should be a part of any immigration legislation that is \npassed. I believe that. However, the bill doesn't do it. Illegal aliens \nare not required to demonstrate any proficiency in English for more \nthan a decade after they have been granted amnesty.\n  You have heard people say we are requiring English. We are not \nrequiring it for 10 years. Learning English is not required for illegal \naliens to receive the probationary benefits or the first 4-year Z visa \nor the second 4-year Z visa.\n  The first Z visa renewal, beginning on the second 4-year visa, \nrequires only that the alien demonstrate an ``attempt'' to learn \nEnglish by being ``on a waiting list for English classes.'' Passing a \nbasic English test is required only for a second renewal, the third 4-\nyear Z visa, and then the alien only has to pass the test ``prior to \nthe expiration of the second extension of Z status,'' 12 years down the \nroad.\n  The bill's sponsors claim they have to learn English before being \ngranted amnesty. That is not true. Nothing in the bill requires the \nillegal alien to have any English skills before receiving probationary \nstatus, before receiving the first Z visa that lasts for 4 years. Only \nupon filing for renewal of the Z visa up to 6\\1/2\\ years down the road \ndoes the illegal alien have to meet any language requirement. At that \ntime, the requirement is fulfilled with the most minimal effort: \n``Demonstrating enrollment in'' or being on a ``waiting list for \nEnglish classes.''\n  Second, when the alien applies for a second Z visa renewal, which \nwould be 8 to 10 years from now, is there any real English requirement. \nAt that time, the alien must ``pass the naturalization test.'' It is \ncommon knowledge that the test is not a real English proficiency test--\nit is not. So there is not an emphasis on English. Even then, it is not \nclear that passing the test would be required before the second \nextension of Z visa status is granted. As a matter of fact, on page 295 \nthe bill states that:\n\n\n[[Page S7066]]\n\n\n        . . . the alien may make up to three attempts . . . but \n     must satisfy the requirement prior to the expiration of the \n     second extension of Z visa status.\n\n  As the bill is written, there is no real English requirement until 12 \nto 14 years down the road, and it is not as strong.\n  I don't know why we are so concerned about that. Is it a pandering? \nIs it some attempt to please people who are here illegally? Good \npolicy, I submit, the right policy--both for the United States and for \nthose here receiving amnesty--would be to encourage them to learn \nEnglish sooner rather than later. How long does it take? Twelve years \nis too long, and I think that is a mistake in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague, Senator Kyl here. I will be \npleased to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kyl and Mr. Sessions are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to join in correcting the Supreme Court's decision last week in \nLedbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. That decision has \nundermined a core protection of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964, the landmark law against job discrimination based on gender, \nrace, national origin, and religion. Title VII has made America a \nstronger, fairer, and better land. It embodies principles at the heart \nof our society--fairness and justice for all.\n  Americans believe in fair treatment, equal pay, and an honest chance \nat success in the workplace. These values have made our country a \nbeacon of hope and opportunity around the world. The Ledbetter decision \nundermined these bedrock principles by imposing unrealistically short \ntime limits for employees seeking redress for wage discrimination.\n  In the case before the Supreme Court, a jury had found that Goodyear \nTire and Rubber Company had discriminated against Lily Ledbetter by \ndowngrading her evaluations because she was a woman in a traditionally \nmale job. Year after year, the company used these unfair evaluations to \npay her less than her male coworkers who held the same job. The jury \nwas outraged by Goodyear's misconduct and awarded back to Ms. Ledbetter \nto correct this basic injustice and hold the company accountable.\n  The Supreme Court ruled against her, holding that she had waited too \nlong to file her lawsuit. It ruled that she should have filed her \nlawsuit within a short time after Goodyear first decided to pay her \nless than her male colleagues. Never mind that she didn't know at the \noutset that male workers were paid more. Never mind that the company \ndiscriminated against her for decades and that the discrimination \ncontinued with each new paycheck she received.\n  Requiring employees to file pay discrimination claims within a short \ntime after the employer decides to discriminate makes no sense. Pay \ndiscrimination is different from other discriminatory actions because \nworkers generally don't know what their colleagues earn. It is not a \ncase of being told ``you're fired'' or ``you didn't get the job'' when \nworkers at least knows they have been denied a job benefit. With pay \ndiscrimination, the paycheck comes in the mail, and workers usually \nhave no idea if they are being paid fairly. Common sense and basic \nfairness require that they should be able to file a complaint within a \nreasonable time after getting a discriminatory paycheck instead of \nhaving to file the complaint soon after the company first decides to \nshortchange them for discriminatory reasons.\n  The Court's decision in the Ledbetter case is not only unfair, it \nsets up a perverse incentive for workers to file lawsuits before they \nhave investigated whether pay decisions are actually based on \ndiscrimination. Under the decision, workers who wait to get all the \ninformation before filing a complaint of discrimination could be out of \ntime. As a result, the decision will create unnecessary litigation as \nworkers rush to beat the clock on their equal pay claims.\n  The Supreme Court's decision also breaks faith with the Civil Rights \nAct of 1991, which was enacted with overwhelming bipartisan support--a \nvote of 93 to 5 in the Senate and 381 to 38 in the House. The 1991 act \nhad corrected this same problem in the context of seniority, \noverturning the Court's decision in a separate case. At the time, there \nwas no need to clarify title VII for pay discrimination claims since \nthe courts were interpreting title VII correctly. Obviously, Congress \nneeds to act again to ensure that the law adequately protects workers \nagainst pay discrimination.\n  It is unacceptable that victims of discrimination are unable to file \na lawsuit against ongoing discrimination. Yet that is what happened to \nLily Ledbetter. I hope that all of us, on both sides of the aisle, can \njoin in correcting this obvious wrong.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years, the Supreme Court also has undermined \nother bipartisan civil rights laws in ways Congress never intended. It \nhas limited the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, made it harder to \nprotect children who are harassed in our schools, and eliminated \nindividuals' right to challenge practices that have a discriminatory \nimpact on their access to public services. Congress needs to correct \nthese problems as well.\n  Let's not allow what happened to Lily Ledbetter to happen to any \nother victims of discrimination. As Justice Ginsburg wrote in her \npowerful dissent, the Court's decision is ``totally at odds with the \nrobust protection against employment discrimination Congress intended \nTitle VII to secure.'' I urge my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats \nalike, to restore the law as it was before the Ledbetter decision, so \nthat victims of ongoing pay discrimination have a reasonable time to \nfile their claims. The Lily Ledbetters of our Nation deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/05/senate-section/article/S7066-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7066-S7067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Jay Edward Martin\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, on May 16, 2007, I attended SSG Jay Edward \nMartin's funeral. A soldier born and raised in Baltimore, MD, Sergeant \nMartin lost his life in service to our country. He was 29 years old. I \nrise today to pay tribute to his life and his sacrifice.\n  Sergeant Martin and two others were killed Sunday, April 29, when an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near their vehicle during combat \noperations in Baghdad.\n  Sergeant Martin was not new to the military. After joining the Army \nin November 1997, he served for nearly 2 years in Germany and Bosnia. \nHe was then stationed at Fort Irwin in California as an Army recruiter. \nBut as a recruiter, Sergeant Martin grew restless and chose to go to \nBaghdad. A childhood friend remembers Jay's explanation: ``I'm supposed \nto be fighting for my country; I can't sit in an office.'' An \nexperienced soldier, Sergeant Martin knew the risks and challenges he \nwould face, and this knowledge makes his decision to serve all the more \nadmirable.\n  Sergeant Martin had been scheduled for a 2-week break from Iraq in \nApril. But in a selfless move--one that Jay's family describes as \ntypical of his generous spirit--he allowed a fellow soldier whose wife \njust had a baby to take his place.\n  Jay is remembered by those who knew him for his determination, \nbravery, and devotion to service. Jay displayed remarkable leadership, \nfocus, and determination even as he suffered setbacks in his young \nlife. Jay's mother died when he was only 8 years old, but Jay remained \nfocused on his dream of becoming a pilot and joining the military. An \naunt, Lori Martin-Graham, recalls that he would talk about military \nservice for hours with her husband, who had served in the Navy.\n  Sergeant Martin spoke fervently about the importance of college and \nattended Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, FL. He\n\n[[Page S7067]]\n\nleft after a year when he realized his poor vision would prevent him \nfrom becoming a pilot. Jay moved forward and joined the Army. ``Jay was \nalways . . . positive, ambitious,'' remembered a friend. ``He was \nalways your good conscience.''\n  As one of Sergeant Martin's sisters, Lark Adams, put it, ``He was \njust a shining star. He followed the rules. He did what he was supposed \nto. He was an example to everyone.''\n  After his death, Jay's fiance Maria Padilla, explained that he would \nhave wanted to see those close to him ``laughing because he left us \ndoing what he loved. He left us being the soldier he was so proud of \nbeing.''\n  I hope his family and all who loved Jay will find comfort in that \nimage of the proud and selfless soldier who won several awards \nincluding the Army Commendation Medal and the Army Good Conduct Medal. \nBut I also hope they find joy in their memories of the young man who \ndevised hide-and-seek strategy with his friends, who was a swim and \ntrack star at Forest Park High School, who took such great pride in his \nDodge Stratus RT, who played video games in his grandmother's kitchen, \nand who debated the future of the F-14 with his uncle.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to Jay's father Dwight Martin and \nstepmother Penny Martin; his grandfather Harry Martin; his four \nsisters, Lark, Dove, Raven and Shannon; his fiance Maria, and all the \nother relatives and friends who are bereaved. We honor him as a hero \nand together mourn his loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/05/senate-section/article/S7067-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On July 7, 2002 in Tampa, FL, Devin Scott Angus attacked Sonny \nGonzales and Stephen Hair as the two men were leaving a gay pride event \nat the Florida Aquarium. Angus allegedly yelled antigay slurs at the \nmen, dropped his pants, and screamed additional obscenities. He then \nattacked Gonzales and Hair, repeatedly punching and kicking them. \nGonzales suffered a gash in his head, while Hair suffered a skull \nfracture, a cracked sinus, and a broken front tooth. According to \nreports, Angus' sole motivation was the victims' sexual orientation.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/05/senate-section/article/S7067-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING EARNELL LUSTER\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, every day, millions of American make \nsacrifices for their families and friends. Yet the man I honor today \nhas made the ultimate sacrifice for neither kin nor kind. Earnell \nLuster is a former Marine and a great American. As a lifelong resident \nof Minneapolis, MN, he exemplified the role of a Good Samaritan within \nhis community. Mr. Luster sacrificed his own life for the sake of \nanother, and his bravery and courage makes him a hero.\n  On February 15, 2007, Mr. Luster was walking by an apartment building \nin south Minneapolis when he came across two women who were being \nrepeatedly beaten by a male attacker. Being the man he was, Mr. Luster \ncould not walk away from what he was witnessing. He sprang into action \nby demanding the attacker halt his assault upon the women. By doing so, \nhe gave the women enough time to escape their attacker. Tragically, the \nattacker turned his anger on Mr. Luster and delivered several blows to \nhis head that proved to be fatal. That evening, in an act of true \nselflessness, Earnell Luster gave his life for another.\n  His actions that evening exemplify the life he lived. As a well-\nrespected elder in his church and within his community, Mr. Luster \nlived a life full of joy, duty, and great conviction. His service to \nthe Marines in the mid-1970s demonstrates the strength of his \ncharacter. Mr. Luster enjoyed life, especially the opportunities that \nhe had to go fishing with his twin brother Earnest.\n  Earnell Luster's tragic death is evidence that crime can affect each \none of us. Our commitment to fighting crime must not ebb and flow with \nthe statistics.\n  My thoughts and prayers remain with Earnell's twin brother Earnest, \nhis mother Lorraine Scott, and his entire family. Mr. Luster's selfless \nact of bravery earns him a place in the hearts of Minnesotans and \nAmericans everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/05/senate-section/article/S7067-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR TED STEVENS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to join in this body's hearty \ncongratulations to our colleague from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, as the \nlongest serving Republican Senator. The remarkable thing about Ted \nStevens is not the number of years he has served but the amount of \nservice he has put into those years.\n  The Founders did a unique thing when they created the Senate. They \nknew that democracy should both let the majority rule most of the time \nbut also protect minority viewpoints from the tyranny of the majority. \nThey created a House of Representatives based on proportional \nrepresentation. Meanwhile, in the Senate, they gave every State, large \nand small, exactly two votes. They then went a step further, and \ncreated the Senate as a body that operates by consensus. The result is \na place where one person with a good idea can impact the entire body.\n  Ted Stevens is a living embodiment of the wisdom of our Founding \nFathers. He is precisely the kind of Senator they hoped for: forceful, \npersevering, principled and indefatigably devoted to his State's \ninterests.\n  Alaska is a unique State and Senator Stevens reflects its style and \nunlimited potential exceptionally. In every aspect, Alaska is a long, \nlong way from Washington, DC, and its unusual bureaucratic culture. We \nall benefit from the independent, self-reliant spirit of Alaska that \nthe Senator brings, reminding us of the pioneer heritage of the West. I \nam personally appreciative of the Senator's hospitality when visiting \nin his home State. I thought we had ``wide open spaces'' in Minnesota, \nbut Alaska's are certainly both wider and more open.\n  When President Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of State, William Seward, \nfinalized the purchase of Alaska, it was thought to be a folly. How \nblessed we all are as Americans to have its abundant wilderness and \nnatural resources as part of our national experience.\n  I have found that when people want to learn something really \nimportant, they prefer an example to an explanation. As I have tried to \nlearn my way around this institution, Senator Stevens has been a role \nmodel, an example, and a friend. I thank him for his kindness.\n  But even more I thank him for his service which has made this Nation \nsafer, stronger and freer for all. He makes his great State and all his \ncolleagues proud to say they know Ted Stevens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/05/senate-section/article/S7067-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7067-S7068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING NORM GRAYSON\n\n Mr. ISAKSON.

Although I cannot be there in person, it is a privilege to \nstand in this Senate and honor this tremendous milestone.\n  Norm and my father Ed were the best of friends.

I wish to speak briefly about the National \nFederation of Coffee Growers of Colombia.\n  The federation is a nonprofit grassroots organization that organizes \nand monitors the extensive network of coffee growers throughout \nColombia. Since 1927, it has worked to build an economically and \nenvironmentally sustainable coffee culture, strengthen community \nnetworks of coffee growers throughout the country, and promote exports \nof Colombian coffee worldwide. The federation will celebrate its 80th \nanniversary on June 27 and should be commended for its accomplishments.\n  Coffee is grown today in more than half of Colombia's 1,098 \nmunicipalities, employing some 2 million people comprising 566,000 \nfamilies. Many of these people live and work in small towns and rural \nareas, not unlike the farmers of my own State of Vermont. In fact, \nseveral Vermont companies, including Green Mountain Coffee and Coffee \nEnterprises, sell coffee produced by Colombian coffee growers who are \nsupported by the federation.\n  In a country where everyone has been affected by the armed conflict \nand the economic and social disruption it has caused, the Federation of \nCoffee Growers of Colombia has focused increasingly on supporting the \nsocial aspects of coffee growers' lives. The federation has worked to \nbring trained teachers, schools, health clinics, roads, \nelectrification, and other infrastructure to coffee-growing \ncommunities. It has provided technical training and the benefits of \nfederation-sponsored research and development to coffee growers to help \nthem improve yields and quality and to market their product.

A bill to designate the post office located at 309 East Linn \nStreet, Marshalltown, Iowa, as the ``Major Scott Nisely Post Office''; \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill honoring \nand memorializing a fallen Iowa hero. Scott Nisely had served his \ncountry in Iraq just short of a year when, on September 30, 2006, he \nwas killed in combat.\n  Scott Nisely served his country in many capacities during his \nlifetime. He devoted his life to his family, church, and country and \nhas positively affected numerous lives. Scott Nisely's military service \nincludes about 25 years with the U.S. Marine Corps, starting as an ROTC \nstudent, then 12 years on active duty, almost 9 years in the Marine \nCorps Reserve during which he achieved the rank of major. Most \nrecently, he took a significant decrease in rank to serve his country \nonce again in the Iowa Army National Guard for about 4 years until he \nwas killed in combat. His public service also includes 12 years with \nthe U.S. Postal Service. In addition, Scott served his community by his \nparticipation in the First Baptist Church's music ministry as a \ndrummer. He was a devoted father who walked his daughter down the aisle \nfor her wedding right before his deployment to Iraq. The wedding had \nbeen moved up because Sarah, his daughter, wanted him in her wedding \nand was worried he wouldn't return home.\n  In recognition of this devoted family man and public servant, the \nbill I am introducing with the support of my colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, would name the post office located at 309 East Linn \nStreet in Marshalltown, IA, the Major Scott Nisely Post Office. The \nidea came from Scott's coworkers at the Marshalltown Post Office and it \nis indeed a fitting tribute. Representative Latham is introducing \nidentical legislation in the House of Representatives today with the \nsupport of the other members of Iowa's House delegation. I am pleased \nto be able to propose this small token of recognition and gratitude for \nsomeone who has given so much to his country, and I urge its swift \nconsideration.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I join with my senior colleague from \nIowa, Senator Grassley, in introducing a bill to name the Marshalltown \nPost Office in honor of MAJ Scott Nisely, who was killed in action in \nIraq on September 30, 2006.\n  Major Nisely enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1981 and served in \nOperation Desert Storm. In 1994, he moved to Marshalltown, IA, with his \nfamily and worked at the Iowa Veterans Home as well as at the \nMarshalltown and Des Moines Post Offices. Because of his love for his \ncountry and the military, Major Nisely took a demotion to join the Iowa \nNational Guard and was sent to Iraq in 2005.\n  Major Nisely was a dedicated husband and father, beloved for his \nsense of humor and positive attitude. Having served in Operation Desert \nStorm, he was already a respected Marine veteran and a hero to his \nfamily and friends. But with our Armed Forces engaged in Iraq, he once \nagain felt compelled to fight for his country. Major Nisely served in \ntwo wars, set a sterling example of selfless service to country, and \npaid the ultimate price while fighting in Iraq. I am proud to join my \ncolleague in naming the post office in Marshalltown the Major Scott \nNisely Post Office, in honor of this fallen hero.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. DOLE (for herself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Burr, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mr. Vitter, and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 1540. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit for the transportation of food for charitable purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, today is the sixth National Hunger \nAwareness Day--a day to reflect on the fact that in this Nation alone \nmore than 35 million people are experiencing hunger or are at risk for \nhunger. It is also a day to recognize the tremendous efforts of \nindividuals who graciously give their time and resources to help those \nin need.\n  Hunger is far too prevalent, but I think Washington Post columnist \nDavid Broder hit the nail on the head when he wrote: ``America has some \nproblems that defy solution. This one does not. It just needs caring \npeople and a caring government, working together.'' I agree, the battle \nto end hunger in our country is a campaign that cannot be won in months \nor even a few years, but it is a victory within reach. And I am \nmotivated to do what I can to make a positive difference in this fight \nagainst hunger--both in the United States and beyond our borders.\n  In America--the land of prosperity and plenty--some people have the \nmisconception that hunger plagues only far-away, undeveloped nations. \nThe reality is that hunger is a silent enemy lurking within 1 in 10 \nU.S. households. In my home State of North Carolina alone, nearly 1 \nmillion of our 8.8 million residents are struggling with food security \nissues. In recent years, once-thriving North Carolina towns have been \neconomically crippled by the shuttering of textile mills and furniture \nfactories. People have lost their jobs--and sometimes their ability to \nput food on the table. I know this scenario is not unique to North \nCarolina, as many American manufacturing jobs have moved overseas. \nWhile many folks are finding new employment, these days a steady income \ndoesn't necessarily provide for three square meals a day.\n  To help struggling families and individuals, our nation is blessed to \nhave many faith-based and other nonprofit service organizations that \nwork to fight hunger. Over the last year, I have toured a number of \nthese organizations in my home State--such as MANNA FoodBank in \nAsheville, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina in Charlotte, and \nMeals on Wheels of Senior Services in Winston-Salem. I also have \nvisited the DC Central Kitchen here in Washington--just a few blocks \nfrom the Capitol. At each of these organizations, I am inspired by the \ndedicated staff and volunteers who have such a passion for helping \nothers.\n  Another hunger relief organization that I hold in the highest regard \nis the Society of St. Andrew, which gleans produce from farms and then \npackages, processes and transports excess food to feed hungry people \nacross the country. When I think of gleaning, I often think of Ruth in \nthe Old Testament. Her story takes place during a famine in Bethlehem, \nand Ruth gleaned so that her family could eat. In Biblical times, \nfarmers were encouraged to leave crops in their fields for the poor and \nfor travelers. It is a practice we should be utilizing much more \nextensively today--considering that in this country, 27 percent of all \nthe food produced annually is lost at the retail, consumer, and food \nservice levels. This means we are wasting about 3,044 pounds of good \nfood every second.\n  The Society of St. Andrew recently passed a milestone--saving and \ndistributing a total of 500 million pounds of food since 1983. This \ntranslates into\n\n[[Page S7074]]\n\nmore than 1.5 billion servings. Already this year, the organization has \nprovided more than 5.5 million pounds of produce. Amazingly, it only \ncosts about 2 cents a serving to glean and deliver this food to those \nin need. And all of this work is done by the hands of tens of thousands \nof volunteers and a very small staff. I have gleaned in North Carolina \nfields with my friends at the Society of St. Andrew, and they are truly \na remarkable group.\n  Like any humanitarian endeavor, the gleaning system works because of \ncooperative efforts. Private organizations and individuals are doing a \ngreat job--but with very limited resources. One of the single largest \nconcerns for gleaners is transportation--how to actually get food to \nthose in need. To help address this problem, I am proud to reintroduce \ntoday the Hunger Relief Trucking Tax Credit Act, which would change the \nTax Code to give transportation companies tax incentives for \nvolunteering trucks to transfer gleaned food. Specifically, my bill \nwould create a 25-cent tax credit for each mile that food is \ntransported for hunger relief efforts by a donated truck and driver.\n  This bill would provide a little extra encouragement for trucking \ncompanies to donate space in their vehicles to help more food reach \nmore hungry people. I am grateful to my colleagues, Senators Lincoln, \nBurr, Durbin, Vitter and Allard, for joining this effort, and I welcome \nthe support of relief organizations like the Society of St. Andrew, the \nAmerican Trucking Association, and America's Second Harvest.\n  In addition, Senators Lautenberg, Lincoln, and I plan to soon \nreintroduce the Food Employment Empowerment and Development Program \nAct, or the FEED Act. The idea behind this legislation is simple: \ncombine food rescue with job training, thus teaching unemployed and \nhomeless adults the skills needed to work in the food service industry.\n  With support from the FEED Act, community kitchens will receive much-\nneeded resources to help collect rescued food and provide 2 million \nmeals each year to the hungry. Successful FEED Act-type programs \nalready exist. For example, in Charlotte, NC, the Community Culinary \nSchool recruits students from social service agencies, homeless \nshelters, halfway houses and work release programs. And just around the \ncomer from here, 25 students recently began training in the DC Central \nKitchen's 68th culinary job training class. This is a model program, \nwhich began in 1990, and it is always a great privilege to visit the \nkitchen and meet with the individuals who have faced adversity but are \nnow on track for a career in the food service industry.\n  We also must do more to help America's 12 million hungry children get \non the right track. As a result of hunger, these children have higher \nlevels of chronic illness, depression, and behavior problems. This is a \ntravesty that can and must be prevented, and school feeding programs \nprovide a critical means to this end. The National School Lunch Program \nfeeds 30 million children in more than 100,000 schools each day. While \nreduced price meals are available to students whose family income is \nbelow 130 percent of the poverty level, State and local school board \nmembers have informed me that many families struggle to even pay this \nfee. In too many cases, this is creating an insurmountable barrier to \nparticipation.\n  That is why I am a strong supporter of eliminating the reduced price \nfee for these families and harmonizing the free income guideline with \nthe WIC income guideline, which is 185 percent of poverty. In 2004, we \nsucceeded in having a five-State pilot program authorized, and since \nthen, a number of colleagues have joined me in urging funding for the \nprogram. I am very proud that the fiscal year 2008 Senate budget \nresolution finally includes the funds, and I will continue to push this \nduring the appropriations process--because expanding the free lunch \nprogram has great potential to alleviate hunger for millions of \nchildren and help them succeed in school.\n  School feeding programs also offer tremendous opportunity to reach \nsome of the 400 million chronically hungry children across the globe. \nEarlier this year, Senator Dick Durbin and I introduced a bill to \nreauthorize the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and \nChild Nutrition Program. This program was named for my husband Senator \nBob Dole and his good friend Senator George McGovern--both of whom \nremain tremendous advocates for this and other child nutrition \ninitiatives.\n  As with the U.S. school lunch program, the McGovern-Dole program \nhelps attract children to schools. The nutritious meals provided help \nkeep them alert and focused so they can learn and nourished so they can \ngrow and mature. First authorized in 2002, the program provides for \ndonations of U.S. agricultural products and financial and technical \nassistance for school food programs and maternal and child nutrition \nprojects in low-income countries that are committed to universal \neducation. In 2005 alone, the McGovern-Dole program distributed 120,000 \nmetric tons of U.S. food commodities, including wheat, wheat flour, \ncorn, rice, dry beans, and vegetable oils, to schools that run feeding \nprograms in the world's poorest countries. In addition to Federal \nfunding, outside donors have provided approximately $1 billion to \ncomplement the McGovern-Dole program, making this initiative a \nsuccessful public-private partnership.\n  McGovern-Dole has a proven track record of reducing hunger among \nschool-age children and improving literacy and primary education \nenrollment in areas where conflict, hunger, poverty and HIV/AIDS are \nprevalent. School meals, teacher training, and related support have \nhelped boost school enrollment and academic performance. These positive \nresults are especially true among girls, including those who live where \ngirls are commonly mistreated and marginalized.\n  Throughout my career in public service, I have seen the faces of \nhunger so many times. During my time at the American Red Cross, I \nwitnessed hunger and starvation in war-torn Rwanda and famine-stricken \nSomalia. In Baidoa, I came upon a little boy lying under a sack. I \nthought he was dead, but as his brother sat him up, I could see that he \nwas severely malnourished. I asked for camel's milk to feed him, and as \nI raised the cup to his mouth, I put my arm around his back. The \nfeeling of the little bones almost piercing through his flesh is \nsomething I will never forget. That is when the horror of starvation \nbecomes real--when you can touch it.\n  In Deuteronomy 15:7, the Bible tells us, ``If there is among you a \npoor man, one of your brethren, in any of your towns within your land \nwhich the Lord your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart or \nshut your hand against your poor brother.''\n  I implore friends on both sides of the aisle--and the people of this \ngreat country--to join in this mission, this grassroots network of \ncompassion that transcends political ideology and provides hope and \nsecurity not only for those in need today but for future generations. \nLet us stand and fight as one in this mission to end hunger.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 1542. A bill to establish State infrastructure banks for \neducation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Investing \nfor Tomorrow's Schools Act of 2007, an act that is critical in bringing \nour Nation's schools into the 21st century. If passed, this legislation \nwould provide States with an economical way to fund school \nconstruction. Please allow me to express my thanks to my friend, \nSenator Harkin, for joining my efforts in the Senate, as well as to \nRepresentative Tauscher for his leadership in the House and his \nintroduction of the companion bill.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers gave our Nation's school \nbuildings a D in their last report card, with 75 percent of facilities \ndeemed inadequate for education. Yet our children attend these schools \nevery day.\n  When students attend rundown schools, their well-being and ability to \nlearn is threatened. In 2004, in Washingtonville, NY, the roof over a \nclassroom, in the 44-year-old Taft Elementary, collapsed. Had the \ncollapse occurred just 32 days later, 15 children and 2 teachers could \nhave been seriously injured or even killed.\n  This past January, New York's Manhasset School District issued a \nreport describing the condition of its\n\n[[Page S7075]]\n\nonly high school. The 72-year-old building has exceeded its life \nexpectancy, with a roof ``beyond the stages of patching and repairing'' \nand in need of replacement. Last school year, part of the ceiling \ncollapsed in one of the stairwells.\n  Buildings like this one, in use beyond their life expectancy, are \ndangerous and don't meet the demands of the 21st century. The lack of \nadequate school buildings hampers today's most promising and innovative \nefforts to boost student achievement. Many older school buildings are \nin a dangerous state of disrepair and have seriously outdated \nfacilities. Many do not even have the proper wiring for computer \nnetworks. While we work to give students the academic tools they need \nto compete in the 21st century, we must also upgrade school facilities \nto give students a learning environment conducive to success. This is \nwhy we included a new provision in this legislation creating healthy \nhigh-performance schools guidelines to direct schools during renovation \nand construction in order to create schools that will foster the \ndevelopment of children.\n  According to the National Education Association, repairs and \nmodernization nationwide will cost $322 billion. Last year, over $20 \nbillion was spent nationwide on school construction. At that rate, it \nwill take more than 16 years to modernize school buildings, when \ntoday's kindergartners could be graduating from college. Clearly, \nschool construction is costly, but a price cannot be put on the value \nof our children's education and well-being. We must use innovative \nmethods in providing funding for schools to make these essential \nrenovations.\n  That is why I am introducing this bill. At the center of this bill is \nthe creation of State infrastructure banks, which would improve \nfinancing for school construction. This financing mechanism was \npioneered by the Reagan administration, which used it to help local \ncommunities fund water treatment and clean water facilities. The \nClinton administration also used State infrastructure banks to help \nStates finance transportation projects.\n  State infrastructure banks have been successful in financing public \nprojects at a low cost to taxpayers. They would offer school districts \nflexible options of loan and credit enhancement assistance, such as \nlow-interest loans, bond-financing security, loan guarantees, and \ncredit support for financing projects, which result in lower interest \nrates. State infrastructure banks would not strain the Federal Treasury \nor the American taxpayer. After initial funding, they would require no \nongoing Federal appropriations. As loans are repaid, funds would be \nreplenished, and banks could make new loans available.\n  Passage of this bill would help provide immediate aid to the neediest \nschools and help local communities fund affordable construction far \ninto the future. This modest proposal is one step in the school \nconstruction solution. We must continue to move forward in this \nCongress by creating an academic setting that will prepare our students \nfor the 21st century workplace. I ask my colleagues to join me and \nSenator Harkin in supporting this critical piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1543. A bill to establish a national geothermal initiative to \nencourage increased production of energy from geothermal resources, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to introduce the \nNational Geothermal Initiative Act of 2007, along with my cosponsors, \nSenators Reid, Murkowski, Stevens, Salazar, Tester, and Snowe. This \nbipartisan bill establishes a national goal where at least 20 percent \nof the total electrical energy production in the United States should \nbe from geothermal resources by 2030. Under the National Geothermal \nInitiative, the national goal will be accomplished by establishing and \ncarrying out new programs for geothermal research, development, \ndemonstration, and commercial application. This act also extends an \nongoing study being conducted by the United States Geological Survey to \ncharacterize the complete geothermal resource base for use in future \ngeothermal energy development. Finally, the act will provide \ninternational market support for geothermal energy development. It is \ncritical with ever increasing energy demands that new energy solutions \nare continually developed and explored. With continued research, \ndevelopment, demonstration, and deployment of new technologies, \ngeothermal energy holds great promise as a growing renewable energy \nsource.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1543\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Geothermal \n     Initiative Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) domestic geothermal resources have the potential to \n     provide vast amounts of clean, renewable, and reliable energy \n     to the United States;\n       (2) Federal policies and programs are critical to achieving \n     the potential of those resources;\n       (3) Federal tax policies should be modified to \n     appropriately support the longer lead-times of geothermal \n     facilities and address the high risks of geothermal \n     exploration and development;\n       (4) sustained and expanded research programs are needed--\n       (A) to support the goal of increased energy production from \n     geothermal resources; and\n       (B) to develop the technologies that will enable commercial \n     production of energy from more geothermal resources;\n       (5) a comprehensive national resource assessment is needed \n     to support policymakers and industry needs;\n       (6) a national exploration and development technology and \n     information center should be established to support the \n     achievement of increased geothermal energy production; and\n       (7) implementation and completion of geothermal and other \n     renewable initiatives on public land in the United States is \n     critical, consistent with the principles and requirements of \n     the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. \n     1701 et seq.) and other applicable law.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the quality and efficiency of health care, to provide the \npublic with information on provider and supplier performance, and to \nenhance the education and awareness of consumers for evaluating health \ncare services through the development and release of reports based on \nMedicare enrollment, claims, survey, and assessment data; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the United States spends more on health \ncare as a percentage of GDP than any other industrialized country and \ncosts continue to rise. However, there is significant variation in the \nquality of health care consumers receive. Are we getting a good deal? \nThe Medicare Quality Enhancement Act, which I have introduced today \nwith Senator Clinton, seeks to improve U.S. health care by providing \nqualified private-sector organizations access to Medicare data for the \ndevelopment and release of reports on the quality, cost, efficiency and \neffectiveness of our health care system.\n  Consumer groups, employers, insurance companies, labor unions and \nothers have repeatedly requested access to Medicare data to improve the \nquality of the health care provided to their members, employees and \nbeneficiaries and to help control the ever-rising costs of health care. \nWhile there remains legal debate over whether this data can be \nreleased, the Medicare Quality Enhancement Act ensures that the data \ncollected by Medicare and paid for by the taxpayer can be utilized by \nqualified organizations to measure quality and control costs while \nprotecting beneficiary privacy.\n  The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act of 2007: requires CMS to provide \nMedicare enrollment, claims, survey and assessment data to private \nsector Medicare Quality Reporting Organizations, MQROs, to develop \nreports to measure health care quality for the public; mandates the \nprotection of beneficiary privacy; empowers consumer groups, providers, \nemployers, insurance plans, labor unions and others to request reports \nfrom MQROs; and provides for the public release of all reports.\n  Attempts are already being made by employers and insurance companies \nto measure quality. However, with limited amounts of privately held \ndata, their analysis is not broad enough to provide the most accurate \nresults. However, MQROs will have access to Medicare data and be \nauthorized to aggregate both private and public data, providing a \nsignificantly more robust assessment of both quality and efficiency \nwhile requiring the complete protection of beneficiary health \ninformation.\n  In order for America's health care system to improve, we need to know \nmore and understand the quality of the care we are purchasing. The time \nhas come for the health care community to compete on quality, value and \ncost, and not be rewarded simply for volume of care provided.\n  The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act ensures that the public will \nfinally have the tools necessary to make informed health care decisions \nfor themselves and their families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1552. A bill to authorize the Administrator of General Services to \nconvey a parcel of real property to the Alaska Railroad Corporation; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \nauthorize the Administrator of General Services to convey a parcel of \nreal property to the Alaska Railroad Corporation. This parcel of land \nis used by GSA for a fleet management center at 2nd and Christensen \navenue in downtown Anchorage. The site is approximately 78,000 sq. feet \nand is surrounded on two sides by Alaska Railroad property. This \nproperty was owned by the Alaska Railroad during the period of Federal \nownership and was leased to the General Services administration. At the \ntime the railroad was transferred from Federal to State ownership, the \nparcel of land where the fleet center is located was successfully \nobtained by GSA for its motor pool function due to its close proximity \nto downtown Anchorage and other Federal agencies.\n  This parcel of land is a key transportation component for the \nredevelopment of Ship Creek. Allowing the Alaska Railroad to get the \nproperty back, either through a land exchange or fair market purchase, \nwill allow the Railroad to make additional improvements in the area. \nGSA has indicated a desire\n\n[[Page S7077]]\n\nto move from its present location to a location closer to the military \nbases in Anchorage as most of their business has become the management \nof a motor pool for the bases.\n  As consideration for the property, the administrator shall require \nthe AKRR Corporation to either convey a replacement facility to GSA or \npay the fair market value of the property based on the highest and best \nuse as determined by an independent appraisal commissioned by the \nadministrator and paid for by the Alaska Railroad Corporation. All \nproceeds derived from any payment for the property shall be deposited \nin the Federal buildings fund.\n  The GSA supports this legislation to expedite their move from the \npresent location to one that will allow them to better serve the \nmilitary bases.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1552\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONVEYANCE OF GSA FLEET MANAGEMENT CENTER TO \n                   ALASKA RAILROAD CORPORATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to the requirements of this \n     section, the Administrator of General Services shall convey, \n     not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, by quitclaim deed, to the Alaska Railroad Corporation, \n     an entity of the State of Alaska (in this section referred to \n     as the ``Corporation''), all right, title, and interest of \n     the United States in and to the parcel of real property \n     described in subsection (b), known as the GSA Fleet \n     Management Center.\n       (b) GSA Fleet Management Center.--The parcel to be conveyed \n     under subsection (a) is the parcel located at the \n     intersection of 2nd Avenue and Christensen Avenue in \n     Anchorage, Alaska, consisting of approximately 78,000 square \n     feet of land and the improvements thereon.\n       (c) Consideration.--\n       (1) In general.--As consideration for the parcel to be \n     conveyed under subsection (a), the Administrator shall \n     require the Corporation to--\n       (A) convey replacement property in accordance with \n     paragraph (2); or\n       (B) pay the purchase price for the parcel in accordance \n     with paragraph (3).\n       (2) Replacement property.--If the Administrator requires \n     the Corporation to provide consideration under paragraph \n     (1)(A), the Corporation shall--\n       (A) convey, and pay the cost of conveying, to the United \n     States, acting by and through the Administrator, fee simple \n     title to real property, including a building, that the \n     Administrator determines to be suitable as a replacement \n     facility for the parcel to be conveyed under subsection (a); \n     and\n       (B) provide such other consideration as the Administrator \n     and the Corporation may agree, including payment of the costs \n     of relocating the occupants vacating the parcel to be \n     conveyed under subsection (a).\n       (3) Purchase price.--If the Administrator requires the \n     Corporation to provide consideration under paragraph (1)(B), \n     the Corporation shall pay to the Administrator the fair \n     market value of the parcel to be conveyed under subsection \n     (a) based on its highest and best use as determined by an \n     independent appraisal commissioned by the Administrator and \n     paid for by the Corporation.\n       (d) Appraisal.--In the case of an appraisal under \n     subsection (c)(3)--\n       (1) the appraisal shall be performed by an appraiser \n     mutually acceptable to the Administrator and the Corporation; \n     and\n       (2) the assumptions, scope of work, and other terms and \n     conditions related to the appraisal assignment shall be \n     mutually acceptable to the Administrator and the Corporation.\n       (e) Proceeds.--\n       (1) Deposit.--Any proceeds received under subsection (c) \n     shall be paid into the Federal Buildings Fund established \n     under section 592 of title 40, United States Code.\n       (2) Expenditure.--Amounts paid into the Federal Buildings \n     Fund under paragraph (1) shall be available to the \n     Administrator upon deposit for expenditure for any lawful \n     purpose consistent with existing authorities granted to the \n     Administrator; except that the Administrator shall provide to \n     the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the \n     House of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works of the Senate 30 days advance written notice of \n     any expenditure of the proceeds.\n       (f) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Administrator may \n     require such additional terms and conditions to the \n     conveyance under subsection (a) as the Administrator \n     considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n       (g) Description of Property and Survey.--The exact acreage \n     and legal description of the parcels to be conveyed under \n     subsections (a) and (c)(2) shall be determined by surveys \n     satisfactory to the Administrator and the Corporation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/05/senate-section/article/S7077-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 220--HONORING THE LIFE OF SENATOR CRAIG THOMAS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \nAlexander, Mr. Allard, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, \nMr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nBunning, Mr. Burr, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. \nCasey, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nColeman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Craig, \nMr. Crapo, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, \nMr. Durbin, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Graham, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Hutchison, \nMr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nKerry, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, \nMr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lugar, \nMr. Martinez, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Mikulski, \nMs. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nelson of \nNebraska, Mr. Obama, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, \nMr. Salazar, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \nSmith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Sununu, \nMr. Tester, Mr. Thune, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, Mr. Webb, \nMr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following resolution;
