Mr. President, I think we would all agree, especially in \na time of war, that nothing is more important than the safety of our \nmen and women in uniform. And nothing should be more important to our \nmilitary commanders at the Pentagon.\n  But I come to the floor this morning because safety was not the \npriority when the military awarded the contract to build the next \ngeneration of refueling tankers. If that decision stands, if the \ncontract goes to the European company Airbus, instead of Boeing, our \nservicemembers will be flying in planes that they and the military know \nare less safe. That has me very concerned.\n  During the tanker competition, the Pentagon considered numerous \nfactors, including survivability; that is, the ability to protect war \nfighters when they are in harm's way. But even though they found the \nBoeing tanker was much safer, the Pentagon chose the Airbus tanker \nanyway.\n  Awarding a contract for a plane that is less safe makes zero sense to \nme. Why on Earth would our military choose a tanker that rated lower in \nsafety and in survivability. That is the question I have come to the \nfloor this morning to ask. It is one of the concerns I have raised in a \nletter I am sending today to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  I know as well as anyone how important it is that we get these \ntankers up in the sky. I represent Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane, \nWA. The air men and women at Fairchild fly those tankers. Refueling \ntankers are the backbone of our military. Everywhere we have troops in \nthe world we have tankers. And right now our tanker fleets are in some \nof the most dangerous regions in the world. We know the war on \nterrorism will be long and it will be hard and that our servicemembers \nwill continue to be in dangerous regions for some time to come.\n\n  We owe it to them to provide planes that will enable them to do their \njobs safely and that will keep our aircraft safe as they refuel them.\n  But with this contract, the Pentagon did not make safety the top \npriority. Let me take a minute this morning to explain what I am \ntalking about when I say that Boeing's plane was more survivable. \nSurvivability refers to the ability to keep the war fighter safe.\n  According to Ronald Fogleman, who is a former Air Force Chief of \nStaff and a retired general: The more survivable tanker would have the \nsystems to identify and defeat threats, avoid threats, and protect the \ncrew in the event of an attack.\n  General Fogleman said he was surprised the Air Force selected the \nAirbus tanker, even though it ranked lower in all those areas. I wish \nto read you his quote:\n\n       When I saw the Air Force's assessment of both candidate \n     aircraft in the survivability area, I was struck by the fact \n     that they clearly saw the KC-767 as the more survivable \n     tanker.\n\n  He added he believes the KC-767 is better for the war fighter and for \nthe military. That is how he put it. He said:\n\n       The KC-767 has a superior survivability rating and will \n     have greater operational utility to the joint commander and \n     provide better protection to air crews that must face real-\n     world threats.\n\n  By any measure, Boeing's tanker would be easier to operate under \nhostile conditions, and it would provide the crew with better \nprotection. The KC-767 has the newest defense equipment available. \nAccording to the Air Force's own rating, it had better missile defense \nsystems, better cockpit displays that allow our crews to recognize a \npossible threat, better armor for the flight crew and critical systems \non the plane, and better protection against fuel tank explosion, \namongst many other advantages.\n  But survivability is not only about the equipment on that plane, a \ntanker has to be able to take off and land faster. It has to be able to \nhandle itself in a hostile environment. The best tanker is the one that \nis harder to shoot down. Our tankers are most vulnerable in situations \nin which the enemy can use shoulder-fired missiles and smaller gunfire, \nsuch as when the tankers are taking off or landing.\n  Compared to the Boeing 767, Airbus's tanker is massive. It is much \nbigger than the Air Force originally requested, and its size is \nproblematic for many reasons. Not only are there fewer places for \nAirbus's tanker to take off and land, but as a larger airplane, it is a \nbigger target and it is easier to hit. The KC-767 is a much more agile \nplane, and it is safer for the crew and the aircraft that they are \nrefueling.\n  Americans want our war fighters flying the best, safest possible \nplane. So I am asking today: Why would not the Pentagon?\n  Boeing has appealed the Pentagon's decision to award the tanker \ncontract to Airbus. The GAO is now looking into that process. I look \nforward to seeing their decision. I think Congress has a responsibility \nas well. It is our job to check on the administration. We have to look \nout for the war fighter.\n  Some of my colleagues have said we need to move the process along \nquickly so we can get these planes in the hands of our airmen and \nairwomen. I agree. Refueling tankers are vital to the Air Force. But \nthat is also why it is as important that they get the right planes, the \nplanes that will allow them to do their jobs and keep them safe.\n  We have a responsibility to ensure we are making the right decision \nfor years to come about the safety of our servicemembers and our \nNation. That is why I am raising these concerns today.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last month, Democratic leaders in the \nHouse made a truly terrible decision. They opted to kill a free-trade \nagreement that had already been reached between the United States and \nColombia, one of our closest, if not our closest, ally in Latin \nAmerica, and a nation that has made great strides at democratic reform.\n  At the heart of the deal was an agreement that U.S. manufacturers and \nfarmers would no longer have to pay tariffs on U.S. goods that are sold \nin Colombia. This would have leveled the playing field since most \nColombian goods are sold in the United States duty free.\n  At a time of economic uncertainty at home, the Colombia Free Trade \nAgreement should have been an obvious bipartisan effort to bolster U.S. \nmanufacturing and agriculture and to expand overseas markets for U.S. \ngoods.\n  Unfortunately, the House leaders decided that the support of union \nleaders was, in this case, more important than our relations with a \nclose ally or the state of the U.S. economy. That decision has already \nhad serious and far-reaching consequences, and that is not just the \nview on this side of the aisle.\n  Virtually every major paper in the country was swift in condemning \nthe House Democrats for changing the rules and blocking a vote on this \ntrade agreement. They recognized that the decision was bad for our \nrelations with Colombia, bad as a matter of national security, and bad \nfor the U.S. economy.\n  Here are just a few of the headlines from newspapers across our \ncountry:\n  ``Drop Dead, Colombia,'' said the Washington Post.\n  ``Free Trade Deal is A Winner,'' said the Charleston Post and \nCourier.\n  ``Approve Pact with Colombia,'' said the Los Angeles Times.\n  ``A Trade Deal that All of the Americas Need,'' said the Rocky \nMountain News.\n  ``Our View On Free Trade: Pass the Colombia Pact,'' USA Today.\n\n[[Page S3841]]\n\n  ``Pelosi's Bad Faith,'' the Wall Street Journal.\n  ``Time for the Colombian Trade Pact,'' the New York Times.\n  ``Historical Failure on Colombia Trade Pact,'' the Denver Post.\n  ``Lose-Lose; House Rejection of Trade Agreement is Bad for U.S. \nWorkers and Colombia,'' the Houston Chronicle.\n  ``Caving on Colombia,'' the Chicago Tribune.\n  And in my own hometown paper, the Louisville Courier Journal, an \neditorial titled: ``Free Trade's Benefits.''\n  Here is how the Courier Journal put it:\n\n       Far from the Washington Beltway, out here in Kentucky, the \n     U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement would have real \n     consequences in real people's lives--most of them good, in \n     our view.\n\n  I could go on. In the days after the House scuttled the Colombia Free \nTrade Agreement, the Office of U.S. Trade Representative counted more \nthan 75 editorials opposing that decision. It is still waiting for a \nsingle editorial somewhere in America supporting the Speaker's decision \nto scuttle the free-trade agreement.\n  A congressional resolution in support of Independence Day would \nprobably draw more criticism than the Colombia Free Trade Agreement has \nfrom U.S. newspapers. And the reason is abundantly clear. The decision \nto block a vote has already had serious and far-reaching consequences. \nAs the San Diego Union Tribune put it in yet another editorial critical \nof the move: ``Bashing Has a Price.''\n  With respect to tariffs, that price is quantifiable. According to an \nestimate by the Department of Commerce, U.S. goods entering Colombia \nhave been weighted down with more than $1 billion--$1 billion--in \ntariffs since the Colombia Free Trade Agreement was signed--$1 billion. \nThis is a heavy burden to place on U.S. workers and the businesses they \nwork for.\n  We hear a lot from the other side about the need for fair trade. Is \nit fair that U.S. goods have been saddled with more than $1 billion in \ntariffs just in the last year and a half alone, while more than 90 \npercent of Colombian-made goods are sold here without any tariffs at \nall? What is fair about that? This, apparently, is what House Democrats \nin Congress regard as fair trade.\n  The trade imbalance between the United States and Colombia is a \nmatter of enormous significance for the many States that rely on \nexports--States such as Kentucky, which exported about $67 million \nworth of goods to Colombia last year. Had the FTA been brought up and \npassed, that figure would have been all but certain to increase this \nyear.\n  The beef industry is a good example of how the trade imbalance hurts \nthe U.S. Kentucky is the largest beef-cattle-producing State east of \nthe Mississippi River. But at the moment, prime and choice cuts of \nKentucky beef face 80 percent duties once they reach Colombian ports. \nObviously, an 80-percent markup on beef makes it hard for cattle \nfarmers in my State to compete.\n  The House failure to take up the Colombia Free Trade Agreement puts \nStates such as Kentucky at a serious competitive disadvantage with \nColombia--despite the fact that Colombia itself wants to level the \nplaying field. It is Democrats in the House, not Colombia, who insist \non keeping high tariffs on U.S. goods in place.\n  At a time when the U.S. economy is struggling, we should be doing all \nwe can to help U.S. exporters sell their goods abroad. Instead, House \nDemocrats are burdening our exporters with high tariffs. In these \neconomic times, we should be expanding access to overseas markets for \nAmerican-made products and American-grown goods, not standing in the \nway.\n  This is a consensus view--a consensus view--not just a Republican \nview. The Senate is ready to vote in favor of the Colombia Free Trade \nAgreement on a very broad bipartisan basis. For the good of the \neconomy, we should be allowed to take that vote. The House should take \nup the Colombia Free Trade Agreement and pass it, and they should do it \nwithout any further delay.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am delighted to be able to join today with \nour leader, Senator McConnell, in urging prompt action on the Colombia \nFree Trade Agreement because, as he has said, this represents one of \nthe most important foreign policy and economic opportunities before \nthis Congress.\n  It is both an economic opportunity to increase our exports, \nparticularly at a time when our economy has slowed down--the dollar is \nweak--and we should be supporting policies that will create jobs and \nboost exports.\n  The U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement also represents a key \nopportunity to strengthen an alliance with a friend and ally in a part \nof the world full of anti-American socialists led by, of course, Hugo \nChavez of Venezuela.\n  I have long believed that trade and commercial ties are one of the \nmost effective arrows in America's quiver of smart power, to build \nstrong alliances for peace and friendship throughout the world.\n  But, also, as vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and a \nlongtime believer in free trade, I believe this agreement is in our \nnational security interests as well as our economic best interests.\n  First, let me discuss some of the geopolitical and strategic benefits \nand why Colombia, as a partner with the United States, has demonstrated \nthat it is worthy of such an agreement.\n  President Alvaro Uribe's administration finds itself surrounded by \nstates determined to undermine Colombia's growing democracy. These \nother states provide safe havens to insurgent groups, allow freedom of \nmaneuvering in border areas, and provide monetary support for their \ndrug and terror activities that threaten those countries and our own \ncountry.\n\n  I am sure Hugo Chavez would love nothing more than to see this deal \nfail. This would be a huge victory for Hugo Chavez. Such an event would \nembolden his support for rebels in Colombia and undercut American \ninterests throughout the region. Our credibility would be sadly \ndestroyed among people who should be our friends--our neighbors in the \nWestern Hemisphere.\n  The question we ought to be asking ourselves is, Do we support Hugo \nChavez or do we support President Alvaro Uribe? It is critical for \npeace and prosperity, not just in Colombia but for all of Latin \nAmerica, and it is very important for our security that we take the \nopportunity to show we stand with President Uribe, who has done so much \nto move his country forward in a positive manner.\n  President Uribe has implemented far-reaching policies to protect \nlabor union members--policies that have led to a general decline in \nviolence, and an even greater decline in violence against union \nmembers.\n  Murders in Colombia overall have decreased by nearly 40 percent \nbetween 2001 and 2007, and murders of union members were reduced by \nover 80 percent. Legal reforms have been implemented under President \nUribe to transform the judicial system and increase the number of \nprosecutions. These prosecutions and law enforcement are necessary \nbecause of the violent terrorists who are still operating in Colombia, \nthough President Uribe deserves great credit for cracking down on them.\n  In October 2006, a special subunit within the Unit of Human Rights \nwas set up in Colombia to investigate and prosecute over 1,200 criminal \ncases of violence against trade union members.\n  President Uribe has pushed back Marxist guerrillas of the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC--that we will be \nreferring to later--and the National Liberation Army, or ELN.\n  Earlier this year, the interdiction of two high-value targets, senior \nterror planners and former operators, was a testament to President \nUribe's commitment to ending terror operations in his country and \nstopping the threat to his democratic government posed by the socialist \nMarxist neighbors trying to bring him down.\n  It is important to remember that the FARC insurgent group holds more \nthan 700 political and military prisoners, including three Americans.\n  This regime has been behind some of the most disturbing human rights \natrocities over the past three decades, and it finances its operations \nby facilitating the drug trade. Now, that, if nothing else, ought to \nget our attention.\n  If the leadership in the House in Congress is concerned about \nimproving\n\n[[Page S3842]]\n\nAmerica's image abroad, fighting to keep illicit drugs off our streets, \nand improving America's strategic interests in its own backyard, then \nwhy don't they start by giving a helping hand to the one good friend we \nhave surrounded by challenges?\n  What would the rejection of this agreement say about America's \ncommitment to our friends around the world? It would say: Don't count \non the United States. Big talk; no action. Big hat; no cattle. We talk \na good game, but we can't come through. And that is a serious \nindictment of the United States.\n  Friends such as Colombia, and I might even add Korea, who are helping \nus fight terrorism, fighting for freedom in their parts of the world, \nwant to open their markets to U.S. goods and embrace America's values.\n  Under President Uribe's leadership, tremendous strides have been made \nin the last 5 years. Colombia is a functioning democracy in an area \nsurrounded by socialist anti-American vitriol.\n  The fact that Colombia still faces challenges and needs continued \nreforms should not lead us to withdraw support for this agreement. \nRather, we should increase our support to help Colombia strengthen its \ndemocratic institutions, implement continued social reforms, and \nstrengthen its legal proceedings.\n  Approving the Colombia FTA will embolden President Uribe to continue \nto make these positive reforms and keep Colombia on the right path.\n  As for the economic benefits, as I have said, if the strategic and \ngeopolitical benefits were not enough, I believe the economic interests \nin supporting free trade are just as compelling.\n  As anxiety increases about what most analysts agree is the beginning \nof a recession, a sure way to help head it off is through increasing \nfree trade and opening markets abroad to sell U.S. goods. Yet the \nColombia Free Trade agreement, as have other negotiated FTAs, has been \nheld hostage by short-sighted politicians and Presidential election \nyear politics. These politics are denying American producers and \nexporters expanded markets.\n  Now, my colleague and good friend, our leader, Senator McConnell, has \nalready talked about an 80-percent tariff on beef going into Colombia. \nIt is not just Kentucky beef producers, it is Missouri beef producers, \nit is America's beef producers who want to have access to that market \nbecause that is going to be an important market to them.\n  But look at the others. Here is what the U.S. workers have to pay for \nthe goods they produce to export, and that is a tariff--a tax--on what \nthey are exporting.\n  Automobiles: American workers pay 35 percent in tariffs put on by \nColombia. They pay 2.5 percent. Furniture: a 20-percent tax on goods \ngoing into Colombia. Mineral fuels: 5 to 15 percent. There is no tax on \nfuels coming into the United States. Cotton: Our cotton farmers have to \npay a 10-percent tariff going into Colombia. They pay less than 4 \npercent. Metal products: Our workers in the metal products industry are \nhampered by 5 to 15 percent. They pay zero. Computer products: We are \ntaxed 10 percent on computer products we send to them. They pay no tax. \nThey come in free.\n  Why is this not a good deal? It makes no sense. These are efforts \nthat could increase by $1 billion our trade with Colombia.\n  I remember in 1999 going to the battle in Seattle. There were people \ndemonstrating against world trade. There were longshoremen up there. \nThey were out demonstrating against free trade. Without international \ntrade, they have no job. There were workers at Boeing in Washington who \nwere demonstrating against free trade. Over half their business is in \nworld markets. There were teamsters up there demonstrating against free \ntrade. The largest teamster employer in the United States, I \nunderstand--at least at the time--was United Parcel Service, UPS, but \nfor every 40 packages UPS sends abroad, they hire another teamster.\n  We need to get real about economics. Free trade is in our interests.\n  Some people have been throwing around the term ``Hooverism.'' They \nare worried about Hoover economic policies, and I think they are right, \nbecause President Hoover made some disastrous decisions that kept us \nnot only in recession but deepened it into a long-serving depression we \nonly came out of with World War II. In 1930 he signed the Smoot-Hawley \nTariff Act, setting off a wave of protectionist retaliation and damage \nto the world economy. He damaged it more than the initial stock market \ncrash did in 1929. Two years later, he undid the Coolidge-Mellon tax \ncuts, raising the top marginal income tax rate from 25 percent to 63 \npercent. Now, that is Hooverism: When you are in a recession, impose \nprotectionist barriers and raise taxes. That got us the longest \ndepression we have had in the last century and a half.\n  Unfortunately, we are hearing some people in the campaign talk about \nraising taxes and withdrawing from NAFTA, withdrawing and stopping free \ntrade. That is a recipe for disaster. We need to look beyond the \npolitics and look at the economics. Free trade expands not only \neconomic and commercial ties, but it strengthens critical cultural ties \nand strategic alliances.\n  Yet many in Congress seem to care more about improving our image by \ntalking with rogue regimes such as those in Syria, Venezuela, and Iran \nthan working with and completing trade agreements with friends in \nplaces such as Colombia and Korea. Their denial of the Colombia Free \nTrade Agreement, if we continue on that path, would irreparably damage \nour ability to maintain and forge new strategic alliances with \ncountries of the world.\n  To close, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recently said:\n\n       Continued progress in Colombia is essential to stability in \n     the region . . . the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement \n     will help a neighbor and a long-time ally continue putting \n     its house in order under very difficult circumstances. It \n     offers a pivotal opportunity to help a valued strategic \n     partner consolidate security gains, strengthen its economy, \n     and reduce the regional threat of narco-terrorism. This is an \n     opportunity we cannot--and must not--ignore.\n\n  I could not agree more. We cannot continue to delay the U.S.-Colombia \nFree Trade Agreement. It will disadvantage America's economy and most \ncertainly damage our reputation in Colombia, Latin America, and damage \nour national security interests. I join my colleagues in urging the \nHouse to pass the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire how long remains for morning \nbusiness on this side of the aisle?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Seventeen minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that I be given half of that \ntime, and the Senator from Florida, Senator Martinez, be given the \nother half of that time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague from \nMissouri in talking about the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.\n  Last week marked the inauspicious benchmark for American companies \nthat do business in Latin America, and there are a lot of them. Since \nthe Colombian Free Trade Agreement was first signed in 2006--533 days \nago--more than $1 billion in tariffs has been exacted against American \ncompanies that have sold their goods, their produce, to Colombia. Put \nanother way, that is $1 billion in a missed opportunity.\n  The reason why that is a problem is because Columbia pays no tariffs \nor duty on their goods coming into the United States, of which my State \nis the single largest trading partner. They pay no tariffs or duty on \ntheir goods. So we have a decidedly unlevel playing field when it comes \nto goods and services that are exported from the United States to \nColombia. It is something they are willing to level the playing field \non if we will simply act, if the Speaker would call up the Colombia \nFree Trade Agreement for a vote in the United States House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I would think at a time when we are all concerned about the softening \nof the American economy and jobs here at home, we would want to create \nmore jobs, producing goods for our farmers and greater markets for \ntheir produce in places such as Latin America. But\n\n[[Page S3843]]\n\ninstead, we find this has become more or less a chip in a high stakes \npoker game. It is totally inappropriate to the responsibility we ought \nto demonstrate with regard to one of our best allies in Latin America \nand America's national security and economic interests.\n  As I mentioned, last year Colombia bought about $2.3 billion in goods \nand services from the State of Texas. This has been good for our \neconomy, good for job creation and, as I said, Colombia has been an \nimportant ally in fighting the narcoterrorists, the FARC in particular, \nwho have had it their way unimpeded far too long in Latin America, and \nparticularly in Colombia.\n\n  After more than a year of being stalled by Speaker Pelosi, the \nPresident was finally left with no option but to send this Free Trade \nAgreement for fast track approval. But rather than Congress doing its \njob--acting on this Free Trade Agreement on an expedited timetable--\nSpeaker Pelosi went to the most extreme lengths to avoid a vote on this \ncritical agreement. The Speaker of the House, instead of following the \nrules, decided to rewrite the rules to avoid the possibility of this \ncoming up for a vote in the House of Representatives.\n  Unfortunately, this isn't the first time politics has taken \nprecedence over our national security and economic interests. I remind \nmy colleagues we are still waiting for the House of Representatives' \ncooperation to finally enact essential reforms our intelligence \ncommunity needs to timely receive accurate information through \nsomething known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. I want to \ncome back to that in a moment, but I think it is instructive to look at \nthis chart to see exactly what I was referring to when it comes to the \nimportance of this free trade agreement for the United States from an \neconomic standpoint.\n  As I indicated, without the passage of this free trade agreement, \nAmerican goods and services continue to bear a tariff as they are \nexported to Colombia and imported into Colombia. For automobiles, it is \n35 percent; furniture, 20 percent; mineral fuels and coal, 5 to 15 \npercent; cotton, 10 percent; metal products, 5 to 15 percent; computer \nproducts, another 10 percent. If Speaker Pelosi would simply allow the \nColombian Free Trade Agreement to be voted on in the House of \nRepresentatives, I am confident it would pass, and this 35-percent \ndisadvantage for our domestic auto manufacturers, which are \nparticularly suffering in these slower economic times, would go from a \n35-percent tariff down to zero. Likewise for all of the other goods I \nmentioned a moment ago. This is most decidedly in America's best \ninterests. This is most decidedly in the best interests of a strong \neconomy. Also, as I said, it is in the best interests of our national \nsecurity as well.\n  With the current state of the economy, we have passed one or perhaps \nnow two stimulus packages with discussion of passing yet another. But I \ncontinue to believe the most effective way to jump-start our economy is \nto put more money into family budgets. One thing that is clear to me is \nthat giving American businesses a fair path to compete in foreign \nmarkets will bring money back to the United States and back to the \npeople, particularly small businesses and farmers who work so hard here \nin America to keep our country prosperous and provide for their \nfamilies. Growing businesses mean growing wages, growing jobs, and a \ngrowing economy. There is no better way in these uncertain economic \ntimes to help our economy grow than to create new markets in places \nsuch as Latin America, and particularly with one of our greatest allies \nin Latin America, the nation of Colombia.\n  But in addition to helping our own businesses in America, we need to \nconsider the additional benefits of granting a meaningful agreement to \nour strongest Latin American ally. This agreement would be a strong \nshowing of our support for the reforms that are continuing in Colombia \nand the leadership, at great risk to President Uribe in particular, \nwhen it comes to improving its democracy, respecting the rights of all \nof its citizens, and fighting against the drug cartels and terrorist \norganizations and the like.\n  Unfortunately, I think we too often neglect our Latin American \nneighbors, both when looking for partnerships and when identifying \nthreats. We are well familiar with the rhetoric of President Hugo \nChavez of Venezuela and, frankly, I think there is nothing that Hugo \nChavez would like better than for Speaker Pelosi to prevail in her \nattempt to block a vote on the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. After \nall, Venezuela is a next-door neighbor, and President Chavez, who has \nbeen host to President Ahmadinejad of Iran and who has made himself an \nenemy of the United States, has to be enjoying the blocking of this \nfree trade agreement, because he can say to President Uribe and like-\nminded democracies in Latin America: This is what you get when you \ncooperate with the United States.\n  That is exactly the opposite message we need. We need a message which \nportrays that when you cooperate with the United States in terms of \ndeveloping your democracy, opening your markets to our goods and \nproduce and services, when you cooperate with the United States to \nfight narcotraffickers and to bring peace and stability to your \ncountry, we will be your strongest ally and we will be your best \nfriend. Unfortunately, the message we see being sent by Speaker Pelosi \nis that rather than treating the nation of Colombia as one of our best \nfriends in Latin America, they are being demeaned into being treated as \nnothing but a poker chip in a high stakes game of cards. It is not \nright.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. How much time remains in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wish to follow the comments of my \ncolleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, who so aptly framed this issue of \nthe Colombia Free Trade Agreement. I wish to focus on a couple of \npoints.\n  Senator Cornyn pointed out that the differential in tariffs is \ntremendous. Now, what does it mean to the American worker? It means if \nan American worker is manufacturing something that is sold overseas, \nwhen that product is being sold in the Colombian market--suppose it \nwere a heavy piece of equipment made by Caterpillar and is going to be \nsold now in Colombia to build roads or other things that are happening \nthere because the country is prospering as a result of President \nUribe's leadership--that particular piece of equipment is now competing \nin the Colombian marketplace with one made in Japan and one made in \nGermany. The American piece of equipment today has to pay that tariff.\n  As we speak, Colombia is negotiating a free trade agreement with the \nEuropean Union. As soon as that is done, they will have the opportunity \nto then bring their product in at a tremendous advantage over an \nAmerican product. Canada is in the process of negotiating a similar \ntype agreement with Colombia. Mexico already has negotiated one. So \nwhen it comes to American manufacturers, the advantage to the others is \ngoing to be that over time, these trading patterns will be set with \nother countries. Contracts will be made with the others because of the \ntremendous advantage. While they may prefer an American-made good, they \nare now going to pay an extra 35 percent for it, and as the American \ngood goes in there with a tariff, the advantage will be to our foreign \ncompetitors.\n  This is a global marketplace. Colombia has other trading \nopportunities. As they work and create free trade agreements with other \nmarketplaces, they will put American products at a tremendous \ndisadvantage going into the Colombia market. That may not just be for \nthe one particular sale. That is going to be for time on into the \nfuture because, as I say, trading patterns will be set and contracts \nwill be made, many of which could have a long-term impact. So it is not \ngood in that respect. It is not good because American jobs would not be \ncreated. I was in Tampa with the Ambassador from Colombia on Monday. We \nhave an opportunity in that very important trade city, the port of \nTampa, and for the American economy. The fourth largest trading partner \nusing that port is Colombia. For that very reason, the longshoremen's \nunion in Tampa is in favor of this agreement because they know it will \nmean more jobs.\n\n[[Page S3844]]\n\n  In the first year this agreement is in place, our trade with Colombia \nwill increase by $1 billion. That increase will translate to not only \njobs but good-paying jobs in the cargo area of the airports, as well as \nin our ports and harbors. These are good-paying jobs, which pay well \nabove the minimum wage. These are the kinds of jobs we need to create \nin Florida and across the United States so the American worker can \nbenefit from this enhanced trade relationship.\n  There is another dimension to this problem, which I know has been \ntouched upon, and I wish to put my two cents in. We are in an \nideological battle in Latin America. The fact is the Cold War ended, \nand we pretty well let our guard down in terms of this ideological \ncompetition. Well, it is back in a big kind of way. We have the country \nof Venezuela, under the rule of a tyrant, who is less democratic every \nday and who has maniacal ambitions of conquering the entire region. He \ntalks of a Bolivian revolution. That ideology is rooted in the Castro \nbrothers in Cuba, who have given him the playbook, if you will. On the \nother side of Colombia is Ecuador. We know Colombia, for 40 years, has \nbeen in a fight with terrorists, with those who would subvert the \ndemocratic process. Colombia has had a long and established tradition \nof democracy. This tradition is now threatened by the FARC, the \nnarcoterrorists who have been kidnapping, killing, and maiming in \nColombia for a number of years.\n  We know, because of recent incidents that have occurred, that the \nVenezuelan Government, with assistance from the Cubans, has been \nfunding and giving all sorts of resources to the FARC. The fact is the \nFARC is in existence today in large part because of the support they \nare getting from Venezuela. Venezuela now is engaging in new \nnegotiations with Russia, and Hugo Chavez will be traveling to Russia \nin the near future to sign another large arms agreement. With the price \nof oil at $120 a barrel, Venezuela is awash with cash that it is \nutilizing to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries in \nthe region, with Colombia, with the FARC, and it is also interfering in \nthe political process in other countries, where large sums of money are \nbeing passed to the political candidates of their favor.\n  The United States is AWOL in the region. We need to engage there. The \nworst message we can send to those who look to the United States for \nleadership and partnership and friendship is we are an uncertain ally, \nthat we will not even go into a free-trade agreement which, in fact, is \nto the great benefit of the United States, simply for politics as usual \nin Washington. That is unacceptable.\n  I submit it is in the long-term best interest of the United States, \nnot only from an economic standpoint but also from a geopolitical \nstandpoint, from the regional implications of the trade agreement, and \nwhat it would mean to all those in the region who look to the United \nStates for a signal: Are you with us or will you ignore us? Are you \ngoing to support democracies or not stand behind democracies?\n  The time is now. I know the Hispanic community of America looks upon \nthis agreement as a signal. I know there is a great movement afoot by \nthose who deeply care about the region and about the need for this \nagreement to help create jobs in America, and it is going to be felt \nand heard throughout this Nation.\n  So I am pleased to join my colleagues in talking today about the \nvirtues of the free-trade agreement with Colombia. It is important from \nan economic standpoint, and it is important to create jobs. I know it \nwill create jobs in Florida. I know it will create jobs in other parts \nof the United States. I know it is good for Colombia. It will tighten \nand close ranks with a country that is our ally and long-time friend.\n  I believe the time has come for this agreement to get an up-or-down \nvote on the floor of the Senate and in the House. It is time for \nSpeaker Pelosi to not play politics with something of this importance, \nthis magnitude. I ask that the free-trade agreement with Colombia be \nbrought to a vote and that we have an opportunity to engage with this \nclose ally and friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nTexas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side for \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nFlorida for his leadership on this issue. This is not one of those \nissues that grabs a headline, but it is certainly one that is very \nimportant to the economy of the United States, and it is important to \nour national security.\n  There is one other point I wish to make in that regard. For those \nconcerned about the exodus of individuals from Latin America and other \nparts of the world who are looking for jobs and opportunities because \nthey have none at home, this is an important part of our overall \nstrategy to try to see that people have jobs and they have hope where \nthey live, so they don't feel compelled to have to come to the United \nStates in order to get a job and provide for their family. This is an \nimportant part of our strategy across Latin America.\n  There is another initiative that I think we will be hearing more \nabout soon, called the Meridia Initiative, to help our ally in Mexico, \nPresident Calderon, as he fights the drug cartels down there, for the \nfuture of that country, which of course is on our southern border, \n1,600 miles of which is common border with my State of Texas.\n  Whether we like it or not--and I know some people don't--our fate, in \nmany ways, and our economy and our security are inextricably tied to \ncountries in Latin America, in the Western Hemisphere. It is not \nsmart--it is perhaps even naive--to think we can ignore what is \nhappening in Colombia, in Mexico, and we can fail to come to the aid of \nour allies and people who are like-minded in wanting to establish \ndemocracy, security, and prosperity in those countries. It is naive to \nthink we can simply turn a blind eye to things such as the Columbia \nFree Trade Agreement and the Meridia Initiative to help President \nCalderon in Mexico fight the drug cartels, in what is a fight for the \nfuture of that great country on our southern border.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the rest of our time. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 2284, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S. 2284, a bill to amend the National \n     Flood Insurance Act of 1968, to restore the financial \n     solvency of the flood insurance fund, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my colleague from Louisiana would like to \nenter into a discussion. Before we make any additional motions, I yield \nthe floor to my colleague.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor their cooperation and help on this bill. As they know, this issue \nand this bill is an enormous concern for all of us in coastal regions. \nIn particular, my colleague from Louisiana and myself and the two \ndistinguished Senators from Mississippi have been very focused on this \nbill and on several amendments, also, that we believe are absolutely \ncritical to improve it as we reauthorize this necessary program.\n  As we have told the chairman and the ranking member in discussions \nover many weeks, we have no intention to obstruct and filibuster and \nstand in the way of reauthorizing this important program. But we do \nhave to have\n\n[[Page S3845]]\n\nthe ability to have a fair debate and a set of votes on crucial issues, \namendments that are important to us.\n  In that spirit, in that vein, we took all of our amendment ideas and \nnarrowed them down dramatically to a universe of about six or seven \namendments between the four Senators from Louisiana and Mississippi. We \nhave had productive discussions in that regard with the chairman and \nthe ranking member. I wanted to engage in this discussion to receive \nassurances that the chairman and ranking member will do everything \npossible to ensure that our narrowed-down universe of crucial \namendments gets quick, efficient but fair consideration on the Senate \nfloor and a vote.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague from \nLouisiana and the Senators from Mississippi for their willingness to \nsit down and try to consolidate this so we will have a finite number of \namendments that we can work through that are their particular concern. \nI pledge to him, as I have to his colleagues from the gulf States area \nas well as other coastal State Senators representing coastal areas of \nthe country, I am determined, as I know Senator Shelby is, to move \nthrough this bill, to give each of these amendments fair consideration, \nto make sure there is a full opportunity to debate them. There will be \na full hearing on them. I cannot pick outcomes, but certainly the right \nto offer amendments, to be heard and debate them and vote on them, I am \ndetermined to make sure that happens. From my conversations with \nSenator Reid, the majority leader, I can tell my colleague that he is \ndetermined as well to make sure there is that opportunity, that there \nis going to be a full discussion and debate. My only advice is the \nsooner we get going, the greater likelihood we get through that \nprocess. He has my assurance that I will do everything to make sure \nthat opportunity will be there.\n  Mr. VITTER. On behalf of my colleague from Louisiana, my two \ncolleagues from Mississippi, and myself, I thank the Senator and the \nranking member again for their cooperation. We look forward to that \nvery efficient but full and fair debate and vote on those amendments \nthat are important to us. I will very quickly confer with the rest of \nthem and make sure they do not have any outstanding issues, so we can \nmove forward and get going.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. Before I \nmake a motion, I will wait for the Senator to let me know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it has been a half an hour since we had the \ncolloquy about moving forward on the flood insurance bill. My \ncommitment to the Senators from Louisiana and Mississippi was that we \nwould move these amendments along. In fairness, I have to say, if it \ntakes a half an hour to obtain approval on a unanimous consent to \nvitiate or at least to deem the 30 hours that remain on the motion to \nproceed to expire so we can move to the body of the bill and \namendments--I know the majority leader wants to consider this bill. He \nwould like to do it in the normal, routine way. Amendments are offered, \ndebated, voted on, and move on to the next amendment. But here it is, a \nhalf an hour since we entered into that colloquy. We are here on \nWednesday to complete the bill. There are about 20 amendments I am \naware of--6 or 7 on the Republican side and easily that number on the \nDemocratic side--that Members want to be considered.\n  If this bill is not done, the program expires. I can't, obviously, \npredict the schedule. The majority leader has that responsibility. But \nknowing what work we have to do in the remaining weeks, it may be \ndifficult to get time. The majority leader has been extremely generous \nin providing this time so we could reconstitute the flood insurance \nprogram. In the absence of doing so, the flood insurance program will \nexpire, as we move into hurricane season. This is the opportunity to \ndeal with it. I have made a good-faith commitment that I will allow for \nthese amendments to come up, be debated, and voted on up or down. But \nit will be hard to fulfill that obligation if I can't even move to have \nthe time on the motion to proceed considered expired.\n  For those listening, I appreciate if we could get an answer quickly \nand then bring up the amendments. Then let's move on them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, again, we would like to have Members come \nover and offer amendments so we can move along. The leader has \nindicated he wants to complete this bill over the next day or so. We \nwould like to do it and do it under the normal procedures where \namendments are offered and debate and votes occur thereafter.

The sooner Senators come over and \noffer their amendments, the quicker we will be able to dispose of them.\n  Again, I thank Senator Shelby and the members of the committee. This \nis a matter that deserves our attention. We are only a few weeks away \nfrom hurricane season. We are literally having to pay on a debt of $17 \nbillion. That is causing the rise in the cost of insurance to a point \nwhere people have a hard time paying, if the program exists at all. \nThis bill forgives that debt, which we have to do, and then \nreestablishes a program that people will pay into so they can have that \nkind of coverage.\n  In the alternative, if we don't do that and we end up with the kind \nof devastation we see happen all too often--you only had to look at the \nmorning newspaper and what happened in Myanmar, where literally \nthousands lost their lives, but certainly we saw it here in 2005 with \nthe sweeping hurricanes that poured across coastal States and the \ndamage we are still wrestling with in many areas--if we end up not \nadopting this legislation and getting this work done, those costs could \nfall on the backs of every taxpayer in the country.\n  That is why this insurance program exists. That is why it was created \nsome 45 years ago. It has worked tremendously well. We need to once \nagain put it in place. That is our goal and our purpose. The sooner we \ndeal with the amendments, the greater the opportunity to reestablish \nthis critical program for the country.\n\n[[Page S3846]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am happy we are here. Let me ask a \nquestion, if I may, of the floor manager, Senator Dodd.\n  I just walked onto the floor from a hearing we are having in Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs. Do I understand we have agreement \nnow to proceed to the bill? I don't have an amendment to offer, but I \nunderstand we are ready to accept amendments.\n  Mr. DODD. We are ready to proceed.\n  Mr. CARPER. That is good news. What did we have for the vote \nyesterday?\n  Mr. DODD. The vote was 90 to 1, a rare occasion.\n  Mr. CARPER. We are wasting way too much time on the floor. I am \ndelighted that we finally have agreement to go to the bill. I thank you \nand Senator Shelby for leading us here today.\n  Hurricane season in the Atlantic opens officially on June 1. Today is \nMay 7. That is about 25 days from now--less than a month. Thousands of \nhomes, actually tens of thousands of homes along our coast, from \nFlorida up to New York, probably, and down around the gulf coast, are \ngoing to be at risk from flooding from what are likely to be more \ndevastating storms. You don't have to live along one of our coasts to \nbe at risk. Many will recall, earlier this year, parts of Missouri, \nparts of Illinois faced the worst flood they have seen in decades.\n\n  In Government, we are often asked to respond to terrible natural \ndisasters, and we do, providing, among other things, emergency shelter \nand financial aid for people who lost a lot, maybe in some cases have \nlost everything. Today, we are being asked to step up before the next \ndisaster strikes by overhauling our Nation's flood insurance program.\n  I was talking with a member of my staff walking over here about how \nlong ago this National Flood Insurance Program was created. It has been \n40 years. As I recall from my Bible study as a youngster, that is about \nhow long Moses led the children of Israel through the wilderness trying \nto look for the Promised Land.\n  We have been looking for the ``Promised Land'' with respect to the \nright balance of premiums, risk abatement, flood mapping--you name it--\nwe have been looking for the ``Promised Land'' for the National Flood \nInsurance Program for about 40 years.\n  For the first 25, maybe 35 years, 37 years of the program, we kind of \nmuddled along. The program pretty much paid for itself but not \nentirely. There were some efforts back some 20 years ago to actually \nchange the program to try to bring it into the 21st century, and we \nultimately were not successful.\n  About almost 3 years ago--remember the story of the Red Sea, the \nchildren of Israel going through the Red Sea in hot pursuit by the \nEgyptians? The Israelis made it through and the Egyptians did not, as I \nrecall. About 3 years ago, as to the National Flood Insurance Program, \nwe did not make it through the ``Red Sea.'' In fact, we did not make it \nthrough Katrina. In fact, the program was engulfed by water, by \nfloodwaters, and to the tune of about $20 billion. That is the amount \nof money FEMA had to borrow from the Treasury in order to try to write \nthis program. Now we are spending more money. The program is marginally \nself-supporting. We have a huge interest payment to make on it, the $20 \nbillion loaned by the Federal Government.\n  So, in any event, enough of my Biblical analogies today. But actually \nit is not a bad one. We need to find the ``Promised Land.''\n  I am encouraged today by the debate on this bill. It is a good bill. \nIt was worked on a year ago in the Banking Committee. It was reported \nout. It got through the House, got through the Senate, and died. We \ncannot let that happen again.\n  But when the flood insurance program was established some 40 years \nago, it was established as a three-pronged program involving three \nthings: One, insurance; two, mapping, flood maps; and, three, smart \nland use.\n  Today, that same flood insurance program provides insurance to more \nthan 5 million property owners across America.\n  Before Hurricane Katrina, as I said earlier, the flood insurance \nprogram was marginally self-supporting. But the now famous 2005 \nhurricane season, which included Katrina--not only Katrina but other \nbig storms as well--caused the folks at FEMA to go out and borrow $20 \nbillion from the Treasury. When the Treasury lends $20 billion to FEMA, \nthey do not say: Here, take $20 billion tax free or interest free.\n  You have to pay the interest. The interest on that debt eats up a big \npart of the premiums paid by those 5 million property owners.\n  For 20 years prior to Katrina, the flood insurance program needed to \nbe reformed. It needed to be overhauled. This week, finally, at long \nlast, we can do that, and I hope we will.\n  Some 20 years ago, I was in the House of Representatives, a \nCongressman and a member of the House Banking Committee. At that time, \nHurricane Hugo was bearing down on the east coast. I was part--along \nwith some of my other Banking Committee colleagues in the House--of an \neffort to overhaul the National Flood Insurance Program two decades \nago.\n  At the time, we were concerned about a couple matters. We were \nconcerned about the low participation in the flood insurance program. \nWe were concerned that too few people were participating. That meant \ntoo big a risk, in my book, for the homeowners as well as the Federal \nGovernment, which often bore the cost.\n  At the time, I proposed to increase participation by requiring \nmortgage lenders to escrow flood insurance payments, just like they \nescrow payments for homeowners insurance.\n  In addition to the low participation rate, we were also concerned \nthat a small percentage of properties had been responsible for more \nthan one-third of all claims, costing roughly $200 million each year to \nrebuild or repair properties.\n  To help correct this, our proposal back then included a call for \nfloodproofing or removing from the program high-risk properties, while \nreserving a small amount of funds collected from the flood insurance \npremiums to pay for this.\n  In addition, in 1988, 1989, we sought to limit new construction in \ncoastal areas that were quickly eroding. Our proposal also sought \nhigher risk-based premiums for those who lived in the most vulnerable \nlocations.\n  In 1989, a bill to reform the flood insurance program passed both the \nHouse and the Senate. It was not as far-reaching as the original \nproposal I and others worked on. I called it at the time ``flood \ninsurance reform lite,'' but it was, nonetheless, a step in the right \ndirection. But, unfortunately, that modest bill never made it to the \nPresident's desk, and for almost another 20 years the flood insurance \nprogram has continued pretty much as it was--broken and in need of \nrepair.\n  Last year, the Senate Banking Committee, under the leadership of \nSenator Dodd and Senator Shelby, approved a truly comprehensive flood \ninsurance reform bill. This is not ``flood insurance reform lite.'' \nThis is the real deal. There is nothing ``lite'' about it.\n  Unfortunately, the bill we approved was reported out, came to the \nSenate floor and stalled and was withdrawn. I think I said earlier our \nlegislation a year ago passed the House and Senate. I was thinking \nabout 20 years ago. That legislation passed the House and Senate, only \nto die, as I recall, in conference. This flood insurance reform \ninitiative started last year made it to the Senate floor and stalled \nout.\n  Today, the Senate has the opportunity to breathe new life into this \nbadly needed legislation. It is imperative we seize the day or, as we \nsay in Delaware, carpe diem: seize the day.\n  Where are we today? Today, almost 3 years after Hurricane Katrina, \nand almost 20 years since our attempts in the late 1980s, we have \nanother chance to put the National Flood Insurance Program on solid \nfooting.\n  So what are our main concerns in 2008? Well, the low subscription \nrate, for one. The relatively small number of properties that continue \nto flood year after year is another. And the subsidized premiums that \ndo not reflect the vulnerability of many properties insured under the \nprogram remain a big concern.\n  We need legislation that will require us to better consider where we \nbuild\n\n[[Page S3847]]\n\nand rebuild in this country, how we build, and how we allocate risk.\n  The bill that is before us today, the Flood Insurance Reform and \nModernization Act of 2008, is a bipartisan bill, reported unanimously \nout of the Senate Banking Committee about a year ago.\n  I wish to take a moment, if I can, to highlight some components of \nthis bill, some of the major aspects of this bill.\n  The devastating 2005 hurricanes resulted in FEMA, as I said earlier, \nborrowing almost $20 billion from the Treasury to pay flood claims. \nThat is more than the flood insurance program has paid out in its \nentire history. In order to pay their claims, Congress increased FEMA's \nstatutory borrowing authority from about $1.5 billion to some $20 \nbillion. Annual interest on this debt owed by FEMA to the Treasury is \nabout $1 billion a year.\n  In order to pay the interest on the current debt, flood insurance \npremiums would have to increase significantly. To prevent that, this \nbill takes the step of forgiving $20 billion of debt owed by FEMA to \nthe Treasury. This bill also requires that FEMA set aside in a reserve \nfund an amount equal to 1 percent of all insurance in force to serve as \na financial buffer for future disasters. This bill mandates that more \nproperty owners be required to purchase flood insurance, including \nthose who live behind levees and dams and property owners in the 100-\nyear flood plain.\n\n  Homes in flood plains are in greater danger of flooding, even if \nthere is a levee. Families need to be protected whether the levee works \nor not. This bill requires that property owners pay the actuarial rate.\n  No longer will vacation homes and businesses be allowed to pay a \nsubsidized rate, as they have been under the program for years. This is \na fair and needed change. Why should vacation homes and businesses pay \nless than the residents who sit adjacent to them?\n  Perhaps, most importantly, this bill will compel FEMA to modernize \nits flood maps. Technology now allows the creation for exact detailed \nflood maps. Because many of these maps are now decades old, we do not \neven know who is in danger of flooding and who needs flood insurance in \nmany cases. This has to change. Under this bill, it will.\n  Again, this bill is a bipartisan product. It seeks to move the flood \ninsurance program to the 21st century before the next ``Katrina'' \nstrikes.\n  We have been joined on the floor by Senator Shelby. I know it is \nsomething that is near and dear to his heart. He and I actually served \non the House Banking Committee a few years ago. I think he may have \nactually come to the Senate by the time we were working on this \nlegislation in the House at the time. I know this is something he cares \na lot about, and he has been heavily involved in shaping this \nlegislation that is before us today. I especially commend him for the \ngood work he has done.\n  But for almost 20 years I have worked, along with a bunch of my \ncolleagues, to make some meaningful reforms--badly needed meaningful \nreforms--to the flood insurance program.\n  Katrina exposed the problems with this program. Actually, we were \naware of them before that time, but it showed the problems for what \nthey are. Now it is time for us to roll up our sleeves and finally fix \nthis program.\n  Abraham Lincoln used to say: The job for Government is to do for \npeople what they cannot do for themselves. This program is a good \nexample of that. People cannot go to the private sector--homeowners, \nbusinesses cannot go to the private sector--and get the kind of flood \ninsurance this legislation provides. This is taking Lincoln's \nadmonition to do for the people what they cannot do for themselves and \nactually put it into law. It has been part of the law for 40 years. We \ncan do better, and we need to do better with respect to this program. \nThat was driven home very clearly in the summer of 2005.\n  Going back to my Old Testament example, it has been 40 years since \nthis legislation was passed. For 40 years, those children of Israel \nwere following Moses, trying to find the Promised Land. We have been \nlooking for it too in terms of actually the right kind of language, the \nright kind of legislation, the right kind of law to meet the insurance \nneeds for folks--businesses, homes, and residents--who face the danger \nof floods. It has taken us 40 years to get it right. This is an effort \nI have been involved in for 20 of those years.\n  Looking out across from the ``mountaintop'' today, I see the \n``Promised Land,'' and I see the ``Promised Land'' written on a piece \nof paper that we are going to be voting on today and tomorrow. My hope \nis a couple days from now--if we do not finish this legislation today--\nwe are going to pass it and we are going to send it over to our friends \nin the House of Representatives and they will take it up and move it \nexpeditiously.\n  We can do good for the taxpayers of this country who are literally \nhaving to underwrite the cost of this program, and they should not be \ndoing that. We are going to better protect the folks whose businesses \nand homes are at risk, and we will do it in a way that harnesses common \nsense, harnesses economic forces and market forces. That will be a very \ngood result.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to make note before the Senator steps \naside that last year Senator Carper of Delaware held a very good \nhearing on the subject matter, and as chair of the full committee I am \nvery grateful to him, one, for doing that but also for bringing his \nsense of knowledge and understanding to this issue. It is reflected \nonce again in his comments this morning. So I did not want the Record \nto not include his contribution to this effort. I am very grateful to \nhim for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing my remarks, the distinguished Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown, \nbe granted the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Staar Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of S. \n2313, the Strategies to Address Antimicrobial Resistance, or STAAR Act. \nI am proud to have introduced this legislation with my colleague from \nOhio, Senator Sherrod Brown. Similar legislation is being championed in \nthe House of Representatives by Representatives Mike Ferguson and my \ndear colleague and fellow Utahn, Representative Jim Matheson.\n  For more than 60 years since their discovery, antibiotics have saved \nmillions of lives and helped patients of all populations cope with \nsuffering related to infection. But as we have seen, our country \nincreasingly faces a number of troubling questions about whether we are \nprepared to address the growing problem of drug-resistant, bacterial \ninfections.\n  Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate \nresistant strains of infections have spread rapidly. While antibiotic \nresistance is an elevated problem for those with compromised immune \nsystems--individuals with HIV and patients in intensive or critical \ncare units, for instance--these infections can strike anyone. Further, \nthis alarming trend continues to worsen and treatment options are \nsorely lacking.\n  Antibiotic resistance is not a new development. The news is this: \nInfections that were once easily cured with antibiotics are now \nbecoming difficult--in some cases, impossible--to treat. National \nsurveillance data and studies show antibiotic-resistant bacteria have \nmultiplied and spread at disquieting rates in recent years.\n  For example, consider a common bacterial cause of hospital \ninfections--Staphylococcus aureus, also called staph--which can spread \nto the bloodstream, heart, lungs and bones with potentially fatal \nresults. In the early 1940s, penicillin effectively combated staph \ninfections. However, penicillin-resistant staph bacteria were \nidentified as early as 1942. Subsequently, methicillin was introduced \nin the 1960s to fight staph-resistant infections, and shortly \nthereafter methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus--or MRSA--was \ndiscovered. In 1974, 2 percent of staph bacteria found in our country's \nhospitals were methicillin-resistant. By 2002 the number had jumped to \n57.1 percent, according to CDC data.\n\n[[Page S3848]]\n\n  And it is not just happening in hospitals. Public health experts are \nincreasingly finding infections developed in the home or community as \nwell. Thus, infections in both settings are increasing and the \nresultant drug resistance shows no sign of lessening.\n  The recent problems with MRSA are but one striking example; we are \nalso seeing increases, in extensively-drug resistant--XDR--\ntuberculosis. There are also numerous reports of soldiers returning \nhome from Iraq with Acinetobacter--a resistant infection that is \nespecially difficult to treat, and the only option is a very toxic \nantibiotic.\n  While recent media reports have raised the visibility of this issue, \ninfectious disease doctors have been sounding the alarm for years.\n  In its 2004 report, ``Bad Bugs, No Drugs,'' the Infectious Diseases \nSociety of America, or IDSA, said: Drug-resistant bacterial infections \nkill tens of thousands of Americans every year and a growing number of \nindividuals are succumbing to community-acquired infections. An \nepidemic may harm millions. Unless Congress and the administration move \nwith urgency to address these infections now, there is a very good \nchance that U.S. patients will suffer greatly in the future.\n  Resistant infections lead to higher health care costs because they \nrequire more expensive treatment and care. According to estimates from \nthe Institutes of Medicine--IOM--and the former Congressional Office of \nTechnology Assessment, the economic burden placed on our national \nhealth care system as a result of resistant bacteria totals billions of \ndollars annually.\n  IDSA, which represents more than 7,500 physicians, scientists, and \nother health professionals who specialize in infectious diseases, has \nissued a stern warning and recommendations. The I0M, CDC, NIH and the \nFDA have also warned that drug-resistant bacteria are a serious public \nhealth threat.\n\n  It is time to act.\n  That is why my good friend Senator Brown and I introduced S. 2313, \nthe STAAR Act. Our bill is not the sole answer to the complex problem \nof antibiotic resistance. There are several avenues to address the \nproblem. But our bill focuses on just one: providing adequate \ninfrastructure within the government to collect the data, coordinate \nthe research and conduct the surveillance necessary to stop \ndrugresistant infections in their tracks.\n  We believe that jump-starting a greater, stronger organizational \nfocus at the Department of Health and Human Services will help our \ngovernment and scientists develop an infrastructure that can grow as \nscience develops. The STAAR Act lays out the framework by which we can \nbegin to take action against this serious public health threat. At a \nminimum, we need better testing, hospital controls, medications and \nfunding to support these efforts, particularly the work of the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention.\n  In an effort to create this organizational focus, the STAAR Act \nestablishes a new Office of Antimicrobial Resistance at HHS in the \nSecretary's office. This will give the issue the prominence and the \nfocus it deserves.\n  Our bill also renews the interagency Antimicrobial Resistance Task \nForce which expired in 2006. It creates an advisory board of experts to \nadvise the new office and the task force, which was created in 1999, to \ncoordinate Federal efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance and was \ncomprised of representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes \nof Health and also includes the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality, the Health Care Financing Administration, the Health Resources \nand Services Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n\n  That task force developed a public health action plan to combat \nantimicrobial resistance; however, implementation of the plan fell by \nthe wayside. There were no personnel specifically dedicated for \nexecuting the plan because all task force members already had full-time \nresponsibilities at their respective Federal agencies. In short, this \nvery important job was assigned to people who already had very \nimportant jobs. So our bill recharges that effort. These new bodies \nwill work together to develop a plan to combat antimicrobial \nresistance, to keep that plan updated and to advise the Secretary on \nresearch that should be conducted.\n  The distinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator Brown, and I have found \nthat it is difficult to understand the magnitude of the problem because \ndata are sorely lacking. Spotty data exists from many States--for \nexample, from a hospital or a hospital chain--but not data statewide or \nnationwide. We need to change that. Our bill addresses that problem. \nThe STAAR Act directs drug sponsors and appropriate government agencies \nto collect data and share them with the Office of Antimicrobial \nResistance as the main depot for such data to facilitate interagency \nplanning on antimicrobial resistance. That will provide us with the \ninformation we need to begin addressing the real problem of drug-\nresistant infections.\n  Finally, we authorize grants for at least 10 Antimicrobial Resistance \nClinical Research and Public Health Network sites to strengthen our \nnational capacity to develop the information necessary to assess the \nextent of the problem and look at effective ways to address it. \nCurrently, there is very little capacity to quickly monitor, assess and \naddress the spread of new or particularly resistant microbes. These \nnetwork sites will work with the CDC to establish a surveillance system \nto allow tracking and confirmation of resistant microbes in almost real \ntime. Also, with support from the CDC and the NIH, these sites will \nconduct research to study the development of antimicrobial resistance. \nWith data from this research, we can better prevent and control and, \nultimately, treat the threat of antimicrobial resistance.\n\n  I wish to take a moment to stress the real importance of this issue. \nI mentioned earlier that drug-resistant infections can affect anyone at \nany age--the young, the old, the healthy or ill, I have read stories \nabout newborns, high school and college athletes and NFL football \nplayers who have battled with these resistant infections, and many of \nthem lost the fight.\n  I would like to read a short excerpt from one of these stories, which \nI think really stresses the need for attention to this issue. This was \nwritten by a woman from New Jersey named Linda Lohsen, who lost her \ndaughter Rebecca to MRSA in August 2006. Ms. Lohsen writes:\n\n       Why do I want to share all of this with you? Because for 15 \n     years I was a public health nurse--I heard all about the \n     diseases that might happen. And, perhaps like some of you, I \n     became jaded. I felt that public health was all about \n     sounding the alarm for things that never come to pass. I'm \n     here to tell you this is real, this does happen and it \n     destroys lives.\n       Rebecca's death has changed me, and has changed all of us. \n     Once I believed that the dangers that were out there would \n     stay out there. That modern medicine can avert these dangers. \n     I no longer have the confidence in medicine that I did. I \n     believe we have made great advances, that there are cures to \n     be had, but I've watched the dismay in the faces of doctors \n     who are supposed to be the best in their field as they told \n     me they didn't have any more `cures in their bag.' And I know \n     that it truly is a practice of medicine, not a finished \n     product.\n\n  Mr. President, Federal agencies, physicians and scientists who \nspecialize in infectious diseases, and public health nurses like Linda \nLohsen, are telling us there is a pressing need to address the problem \nof antimicrobial resistance. We do not have time to wait, and we cannot \nquickly fix something that we do not yet understand. As Mrs. Lohsen \nwrote, the dangers that are out there will not simply stay out there. \nWe need to be aggressive in creating a strategy to prevent loss of life \nor a serious public health epidemic, and lift the economic burden on \nour health care system caused by antimicrobial resistance.\n  The STAAR Act is not the whole answer, but it is a good bill and an \nimportant step in the right direction. In addition to IDSA, the STAAR \nAct has been endorsed by more than a dozen highly regarded professional \nhealthcare associations.\n  I am very pleased to sponsor this bill with Senator Brown, and I \ncommend him for his work on this bill, for his interest in national \nhealth care, and for the hard work he performs in the Senate. It is a \nprivilege to work with him on this matter.\n\n[[Page S3849]]\n\n  Of course, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. It is long \noverdue, and we should do everything in our power to make sure we solve \nthese particular problems.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Hatch, for \nhis leadership on this issue and on so many other health issues. He has \nhad a terrific career in public service, especially on public health \nissues such as MRSA, and we are all appreciative of that all over the \ncountry.\n  In the last year, as we know, we have seen news reports about \noutbreaks around the country of a dangerous infection commonly referred \nto, as Senator Hatch said, by the acronym MRSA. MRSA is a strain of \nstaph infection that is resistant to penicillin and related \nantibiotics. While MRSA was previously thought to occur only in \nhospital settings--bad enough--Americans have begun to contract it in \nschools and communities.\n  Last year, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported \nthat MRSA infections occur in approximately 94,000 people each year and \nare associated with approximately 19,000 deaths. Think about that. On \nSeptember 11, 3,000-plus people were killed in New York, Washington, \nDC, and in Pennsylvania. Tens of thousands of people die in car \naccidents. We are talking about 19,000 deaths from MRSA infections, not \nto mention other kinds of related deaths from similar infections.\n  That article in the Journal of the American Medical Association is a \nwake-up call that we must not ignore.\n  In my State of Ohio, there were 12 outbreaks of MRSA last year alone. \nOhioans contracted MRSA in health care settings, in the workplace, on \nsports teams, and in corrections facilities. The head of the Centers \nfor Disease Control told me on the phone several months ago that high \nschool students sharing towels or getting burns from artificial turf at \nfootball practice or coming into the gym and sharing a towel that might \nhave been used the day before that wasn't washed--some students \ncontracted MRSA from that. It is fairly rare that way, but it happens. \nMost students recover fine from it, but occasionally some do not.\n  MRSA outbreaks took place in counties across the State of Ohio, \nincluding Franklin, Gallia, Madison, Cuyahoga, Allen, Portage, Vinton, \nFairfield, and Miami. If you look at a map of Ohio, outbreaks happened \nin all sections of our State.\n  Robert Totsch died in his hometown of Coshocton, a community in \nsoutheast Ohio, after contracting a hospital-acquired MRSA infection. \nHere is what happened to him. He was a kind and loving husband, father \nof two and proud grandfather of five. He was a retired guidance \ncounselor, a Korean war Navy veteran who had served his country during \nthat war. In September of 2006, Robert Totsch suffered a heart attack \nand needed triple bypass surgery. Once the procedure was over, his \ndoctors told him the surgery couldn't have gone better. They said \nRobert would be home by the following Saturday in time to watch his \nalma mater Ohio State playing football on his own TV in his own house.\n  But Robert had contracted a surgical site MRSA infection that spread \nto his blood stream. The surgeon told him ``5 or 6 others in the \nintensive care unit had MRSA.'' Robert was given numerous antibiotics, \nincluding an antibiotic of last resort. While he was in the ICU on life \nsupport, Robert and his wife celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.\n  Robert should have gone home. While he went into the hospital for a \nheart condition, it was not his heart problems that took his life. \nRobert's wife and children miss him every day and are still recovering \nfrom watching him suffer during those last days of life.\n  This story is painful, especially because we know this infection, and \nthe deaths that have resulted from it, don't have to happen. MRSA \noutbreaks are part of the larger problem of what we lay people call \n``superbugs'' that are resistant to antibiotics, which are the \ncornerstone of modern medicine, but they are under siege.\n  Over time, fueled by antibiotic misuse and overuse in farm animals \nand human beings, bacteria mutate to develop resistance to those \nantibiotics.\n  In response to this health care crisis, Senator Hatch and I \nintroduced the Strategies to Address Antimicrobial Resistance Act, also \nknown as the STAAR Act. That bill is meant to reinvigorate efforts to \ncombat the so-called superbugs--efforts that accelerated in the late \n1990s, and then stalled.\n  We need to respond more quickly to this problem because it will only \ngrow with time, reversing years of progress in the fight against \ndebilitating and deadly illness.\n  We know what antibiotics have done to save lives since the discovery \nof penicillin. Our bill will launch a coordinated effort to prevent \noutbreaks of MRSA and other dangerous drug-resistant infections. It \nwould jumpstart research on the superbugs and explore strategies to \nensure a robust pipeline for new antibiotic drugs.\n  Drug-resistant bacteria sets back the clock on medical progress. It \ncosts more and, more importantly, it costs lives. No one should go into \na hospital for one problem with their health and leave with another--or \nnot leave at all.\n  We need to take antibiotic resistance seriously and fight it with as \nmuch passion as we fight any potential killer.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for his leadership on this issue and for \nintroducing this bill with me. I look forward to working with him to \nhelp get it passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, in a few moments, I will call up amendment \nNo. 4719. I have been asked to withhold on that until the distinguished \nchairman arrives. At this point, I will simply describe to the Members \nof the Senate what my amendment does. May I proceed on that, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for that purpose.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, my amendment No. 4719 would add an \namendment to the National Flood Insurance Reauthorization Program to \nprovide for multiple peril insurance. It would create a new option \nunder the National Flood Insurance Program to offer coverage of both \nwind and flood risk in one policy. It is an idea that certainly makes \nsense to most Americans, particularly those along the gulf coast who \nhave suffered the ravages of Hurricane Katrina and are still doing so \n2\\1/2\\ years later.\n  The proposal requires that premiums for this new coverage be risk \nbased and actuarially sound so that the program would be required to \npay for itself.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has issued a statement about similar \nlanguage that was included in the House legislation. I will come back \nto that in a moment or two.\n  CBO estimated that the multiple peril program would increase premium \nreceipts and additional claims payments by about the same amount, \nresulting in no significant net budgetary impact. By covering wind and \nflood risk in one policy, the multiple peril option will allow coastal \nhomeowners to buy insurance and know that hurricane damage would be \ncovered.\n  I am pleased to announce to my colleagues that the Wicker multiple \nperil insurance program amendment, which I will call up in a few \nmoments, has the backing of the National Association of Realtors. They \nhave endorsed my amendment to add multiple peril insurance to the flood \nauthorization bill.\n  Now, when we are embarking on a major change to a program, there are \nconcerns that are voiced and need to be discussed. A number of people \nhave expressed fears that multiple peril insurance would cause the \ndisplacement of jobs from the property insurance marketplace. In fact, \nI would contest that allegation and state to my colleagues this: The \nprogram will not create a sales force for Federal insurance agents. \nIndeed, in coastal communities, local insurance does not write wind \ninsurance today. Of course, the local agents do write the traditional \nfire, theft, and liability insurance, and they earn commissions for the \nFederal policy, as they do now with the National Flood Insurance \nProgram coverage. They will be able to continue to do so under the \nWicker amendment.\n  Others have expressed concern that wind storm coverage is widely \navailable and Federal involvement is not necessary. I would say this to \nthat assertion: There is a difference between being able to purchase \nwind insurance\n\n[[Page S3850]]\n\nunder a very expensive, limited State wind pool, which people are able \nto do, theoretically, and being able to purchase wind insurance and \nstill be able to pay your mortgage because it is so expensive that the \ntypical American family is not able to do so.\n  Indeed, wind premiums are increasing exponentially because the risk \nis contained in geographical boundaries of a given State. My amendment \nwould correct that problem. Also, I think another myth with regard to \nmultiple peril insurance is that it would dramatically increase the \nexposure of the National Flood Insurance Program and the Federal \nGovernment to catastrophic loss.\n  That is where I want to get back to fully quote the Congressional \nBudget Office in this regard. The explicit language of the Taylor \namendment, adopted in the House of Representatives and adopted \noverwhelmingly in that body, on a bipartisan basis, provides that the \npremiums coming to the program will be actuarially sound and risk \nbased. I don't think we can be any more explicit than that. If a Member \nof the Senate would like to come forward and make that a little \nclearer, I would be happy to have an amendment in that regard.\n  The House of Representatives said the premiums are based on risk, and \nthey must be actuarially sound. Here is what the CBO had to say about \nthe proposal as it was offered and adopted in the House of \nRepresentatives, which is virtually identical to the amendment I am \noffering today:\n\n       H.R. 3121 would direct FEMA to offer such multiple peril \n     coverage at an actuarial, i.e., unsubsidized rate. Because of \n     the uncertain nature of actuarial pricing, FEMA might collect \n     more receipts than necessary to pay future claims, resulting \n     in a net reduction in direct spending. It is also possible \n     that FEMA might collect less premium income than would be \n     necessary to cover future liabilities from multiple peril \n     policies, which would likely result in the need for \n     additional borrowing authority from the Treasury. In the \n     latter case, the legislation would prohibit FEMA from \n     entering into or renewing any multiple peril policy until \n     such borrowing is repaid.\n\n  That is the one difference in my amendment and the House-passed \namendment. But, specifically CBO goes on to say:\n\n       CBO expects that the new coverage offering under H.R. 3121 \n     would increase premium receipts and additional claims \n     payments by about the same amount, resulting in no \n     significant net budgetary impact.\n\n  Mr. President, so we enter into a debate today on a commonsense \nproposal to allow the insurance consumer to know when he or she \npurchases hurricane insurance, there will not be a debate between wind \nand water in the courtroom, and the insurance customer, homeowner, \nproperty owner can purchase insurance with the knowledge that he or she \nis covered regardless of the nature of the peril and pay a premium that \nis adequate to purchase such coverage.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4719 to Amendment No. 4707\n\n  Mr. President, at this point, I think it is appropriate--and I am \ntold the chairman has no objection--to call up my amendment No. 4719, \nwhich is at the desk. I do so now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Wicker] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4719 to Amendment No. 4707.\n\n  Mr. WICKER.

Hatch, Jon Kyl, John \n           Cornyn, Lamar Alexander.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I support the flood insurance bill that \nhas been reported out of committee. I think it is a good bill.\n  However, as important as it is that we strengthen the flood insurance \nprogram and get it back on sound financial footing, we cannot continue \nto ignore the No. 1 issue on the minds of the American people, and that \nis high gas prices.\n  Two years ago, Democratic leaders told us they had a ``commonsense'' \nplan to lower gas prices. But since they took control of the Congress, \ngas prices have risen by $1.29 a gallon, according to AAA.\n  At home in Kentucky, the average price of a gallon of gasoline is now \n$3.58. Diesel fuel--which runs our trucks and farm machinery--is now \n$4.11. This creates incredible hardships for families, small \nbusinesses, and farmers.\n  Apparently, the Democrats' commonsense plan is not working so \nwell. In fact, the general thrust of their plan is to increase taxes on \nenergy companies which would raise, not lower, gas prices. But \nRepublicans do have a plan to reduce gas prices over the long term by \nincreasing our supply of energy, American energy and American jobs, \nright here in our own country.\n\n  In last year's Energy bill, we passed a number of provisions that \nmost of us supported to reduce the demand for oil, increasing fuel \neconomy standards for both cars and trucks and increasing the use of \nalternative fuels. All of that was important and needed to be done. \nThose were important provisions. I certainly supported them and most of \nthe Senate did as well, but we cannot seriously address the root cause \nof today's high gas prices without also addressing the issue of supply.\n  The senior Senator from New York, for example, said last week that \n500,000 more barrels of oil per day on the world market would bring \nrelief at the pump--500,000 barrels of oil per day would bring relief \nat the pump. I agree with him. The difference is, I believe we should \nproduce those additional barrels of oil right here in America, with \nAmerican jobs, to bring prices down. The fact is, if President Clinton \nhad not vetoed a bill to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 13 \nyears ago, 1 million barrels of oil would be flowing from ANWR to \nAmerican consumers every day--twice what the senior Senator from New \nYork said would bring relief at the pump.\n  We will have a good debate on the flood insurance bill, and \nultimately we will pass it. I certainly support that. But first we are \ngoing to discuss the only real plan that would address the root cause \nof today's high gas prices by increasing America's supply of oil and \nsupporting American jobs here at home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4721 to Amendment No. 4720\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4721 to amendment number 4720.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I compliment the minority leader for \nstepping forward on the issue of meeting the energy needs of our \ncountry and the provision he has just proposed as an amendment to this \nparticular bill.\n  I think it is very important that we move forward with creating more \nsources for energy. We have done a lot in this Congress to encourage \nand promote the development of renewable energy resources. In fact, as \nchairman and founder of the Energy Renewable Caucus, I have pushed that \npersonally. I think it is extremely important. We have done a lot to \npromote this new technology, but the reality is, if we want to see pain \nat the pump immediately relieved, we have to do more.\n  What we do in the particular amendment that was introduced by the \nminority leader, we begin to open the more traditional sources of \nenergy that we have here in this country--sources that are supported by \nan infrastructure that is already in place. Although we do need more of \nit, there is some degree of it already there. Also, it is supported by \ntechnology we have already pretty well developed, to one extent or \nanother, although more technological advances need to be done. Those \nare the\n\n[[Page S3852]]\n\ntraditional sources we find in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, \nwhere we have more than 1.2 trillion barrels of oil, and the Outer \nContinental Shelf, the extent of whose value and resources is huge. I \ndon't know as anybody has ever been able to really anticipate how great \nare the resources we have, because we have a huge amount.\n  The provision also provides for opening the oil shale reserves we \nhave in the State of Colorado--it is not only the State of Colorado, it \nis in the State of Utah and Wyoming. I am told we have well over a \ntrillion barrels of petroleum that could be extracted from this \nresource. There is a total of somewhere around 1.7 trillion in that \nbasin. Totally in the United States, we have well over 2 trillion \nbarrels of shale.\n  The technology has been developed now where, in my State, the \ncompanies that have been working on it--primarily Shell--have indicated \nthey have come up with a pretty high-quality jet fuel. It needs some \nadditional refining, with sulfur and nitrogen. This particular \namendment begins to address that.\n  In addition, we suspend the filling of the Petroleum Reserve. Right \nnow, I am told there are about 70,000 barrels of oil being put in that \nReserve on a daily basis. That will reduce the consumption of the \npetroleum products we have.\n  Also, it repeals permitting and drilling fees that have acted as a \ndisincentive for oil companies and gas producers when this particular \nprovision was passed in the 2008 Omnibus appropriations bill. Also, it \nencourages coal-to-liquid fuels and also talks about increasing our \nrefinery capacity.\n  Right now, with all the various blends of fuel--some States have \nmandated 15 percent, in some cases as high as 20 percent--each time you \nhave a different blend requirement mandated by a State, you have one \nrefinery that gets dedicated to that particular blend. So we have a \nnumber of different States that are driving different blends of fuel. \nThen you have a different requirement for diesel fuel. What you do is \nyou create a shortage of refiners. It kind of funnels down, and then, \neven if you increase production, you don't have the refineries \navailable to kick out the particular blends we need to meet demands.\n  We need to do a lot in advancing our battery technology. Where you \nhave intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, the \nSun doesn't shine all the time, the wind doesn't blow all the time. We \nneed to have a good battery technology that will carry and supply \nenergy at the times we don't have the adequate supply of wind and solar \nto carry on the demands on that particular system.\n  We need to work more on biofuels. I am very excited. We put in \nincentives in this particular amendment to address that. I am excited; \nin Colorado, we have a biodiesel plant that takes the oil and grease \nand fats from restaurants, puts it together, and comes out with a \nbiodiesel. It is a self-sustaining plant; they use the diesel they \ngenerate back into the plant to run their own electricity. It could be \nindependent of the power lines, could be a stand-alone facility. It \nalso helps us get rid of a byproduct out there that is a problem for \nour county dumps and whatnot. The exciting thing about this particular \ntechnology is it is to the point where they do not have to have \ngovernment subsidies, which I think is a huge jump.\n  I mentioned the oil shale moratorium, removing that, which was in the \nfiscal year 2008 omnibus bill.\n  It also provides some reasonable approaches to the regulatory process \nso we can increase production on an emergency basis because we are \nfacing an emergency situation in this country with the high prices we \nare facing here in America--and all over the world, as a matter of \nfact.\n  We all know the Senate has limited time left this year to debate \nimportant legislation. It is becoming more apparent and more clear to \nme that the Democratic leadership is staunchly opposed to doing \nanything that would alleviate the seemingly endless upward pressure on \nenergy prices. That is why I am so excited about the fact that the \nminority leader has introduced this amendment.\n  Given their unyielding desire to increase taxes on much of the energy \nindustry, I can only assume that the Democrats in Congress believe that \nsteadily increasing energy prices provides political fodder upon which \nthey can capitalize. Democrats in both Chambers appear beholden to the \nenvironmentalist agenda, a radical agenda that wholly disregards \nAmerica's economy. Oblivious to prices at the pump and indifferent to \nfrom whom we import our oil, far-left environmentalists and their \ncohorts in Congress are failing their duty to the American public. The \nCongress has stymied efforts to produce trillions of cubic feet of \nnatural gas, trillions of barrels of oil, and prevented the \nconstruction of new refineries, new powerplants, and hydroelectric \nfacilities. This is bad policy.\n  America's economy may be struggling, but despite hard times, American \nbusinesses and consumers still demand energy. In oil alone, we consume \nover 20 million barrels a day. Since we only produce over 8 million \nbarrels a day, the gap must be made up by purchasing oil from hostile \nand undemocratic nations such as Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and Nigeria \nto meet our energy needs. We spend over half a trillion dollars each \nyear importing foreign oil and it is far past time to rectify this \nunhealthy dependency.\n\n  The global price for petroleum reaches new highs every day and \npetroleum-related import have caused our trade deficit to increase by \nbillions of dollar, According to a study by the Congressional Research \nService in 2005 and 2006 alone, our trade deficit rose by $120 billion. \nAs oil prices continue to rise and domestic energy production is \nfurther obstructed, America's trade balance will only fall deeper into \nthe red.\n  As a senator from energy rich Colorado, I am on the front lines of \nthe battle to increase our domestic energy production.\n  The Democrats continue to delay efforts to tap into a natural gas \nreserve below the Naval Oil Shale Reserve--often referred to as the \nRoan Plateau--that contains approximately 8.9 trillion cubic feet. We \nneed this clean source of energy now.\n  Moreover, below the vast lands of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming lies \nroughly 1.5 trillion barrels of potentially recoverable oil. This \namount dwarfs the reserves of Arabia and other petro-rich nations and \nnew technologies that are continually emerging would allow us to \nresponsibly extract this oil to help meet our demands. The benefits to \nColorado and the American economy would be tremendous.\n  Something else that I don't believe we're talking enough about is the \neconomics of this. Colorado, just like every other state is trying to \nfind a way to pay for the many responsibilities and priorities set by \nthe state legislature. Taxpayers are tapped out and there are still \nshortfalls. I would think that an infusion from a steady income source \nwould be welcome. The BLM estimate that Federal royalties from \nproduction of natural gas within the Naval Oil Shale Reserve would be \n$857 million to $1.13 billion over the next 20 years.\n  Because these royalties are split with the state we are talking \nabout--probably conservatively--$400 to $500 million going to Colorado. \nI think our school districts benefits from that kind of money.\n  I think that local police forces, fire departments, hospitals, roads \nand other state and community services benefit from that kind of money. \nI think the taxpayer benefits from that kind of money.\n  All of us here also know that national environmentalist groups have \nsucceeded in pressuring members of Congress to mandate a lock down of \nwhat could be an immense treasure chest of oil in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. Not only have these groups subverted the widespread \nlocal support of Alaskans by prohibiting the potential extraction of \noil, environmentalists stubbornly resist even moving forward with \ncomprehensive testing that could result in the environmentally \nresponsible development of parts of the ANWR.\n  There could be 5 to 15 billion barrels of recoverable oil there. \nThere could also be much more, or much less. The point is we do not \nknow because extremist environmentalists have convinced their friends \nin the House and the Senate to prevent us from finding that out. It \nmakes one wonder what they are afraid we might find.\n\n[[Page S3853]]\n\n  Moving to another part of the country, in April, the U.S. Geological \nSurvey announced that 3 to 4 billion barrels of technically recoverable \noil exists below North Dakota and Montana's Bakken Formation. This is \n25 times more than what was estimated to exist in 1995.\n  These numbers are staggering and there are other examples where our \naversion to responsible development defies common sense. Of course, we \nmust continue our dedicated efforts to explore alternative sources of \nenergy to meet our demand.\n  We have long advocated for a more diversified energy portfolio. But I \ndo believe it is possible to develop sections of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, extract natural gas from the Rocky Mountains west and \nharvest resources in economically feasible ways that also protect our \nnatural wonders.\n  We should not take increased production of any domestic energy source \noff the table. The longer we completely deny access to domestic supply, \nthe more we exacerbate our current energy shortages. Possibly most \nconcerning to me is the fact that the less we are able to produce our \nown energy sources, the more we will rely on foreign and possibly \nhostile sources for it.\n  We cannot solve the problem of soaring gas prices facing Americans \ntoday with any one solution, but we certainly should not allow the \nrelentless push or environmentalists' narrow agenda to make this crisis \neven worse.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes to \nwrap up my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Yesterday the national average for a gallon of gasoline \nwas $3.62. What will the average gallon of gasoline in America have to \ncost for the leadership in Congress to step up to the plate with a \ncomprehensive solution for consumers?\n  It is time for Congressional leaders to be a part of the solution and \nnot the problem. It is time to put every idea on the table and \nresponsibly develop some of the vast energy resources we have right \nhere at home. It is time for common sense to prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we are about to go into recess here for the \nweekly lunches. I say to my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Wicker, \nand those who are interested in the addition of wind coverage in this \nflood insurance bill, I am not sure of the fate of this bill now in \nlight of some of the motions that have been filed on a bill where I \nhoped we could deal straightforwardly with flood insurance issues. So \nit may all have come to naught, anyway, in all of this, which I regret \ndeeply. But putting aside that possibility, I want to respond briefly \non the wind request. I am very sympathetic to this request. It is a \nvery legitimate issue to be raised about the damage that wind does. \nThere was some $17 billion in claims on flood, of course; in fact, more \nthan that. We are in arrears in that amount. We have no idea what the \ncost of this program would be with wind, if we add wind.\n  That is my problem with agreeing to the amendment of Senator Wicker \nand others. All of us who live in coastal States are fully aware of the \nkind of damage wind can produce. But in candor to my colleagues, if \nthey turn to me and say to me: ``How much does this cost?'' I cannot \nanswer. I am stymied in a sense to respond to the question. The \nestimates run high and low. What I am committed to doing--and I want my \ncolleague from Mississippi and others to know this--we have a \ncommission we have adopted in this legislation specifically for the \npurpose to getting at the bottom of this so we can develop a program \nthat clearly would cover those kinds of circumstances.\n  There will be more debate and discussion. But I say to him, in \ncandor, I am sympathetic. He makes a point I have made and others have \nmade over the years, to those of us who live within 100 miles, as so \nmuch of the country does, of our coastal regions.\n  I have listened to Gene Taylor, a Congressman from Mississippi. He \nhas come to my office and laid this out for me in detail. Senator \nSchumer of New York has talked about it, as well as Senator Martinez \nhas talked about it, the damage done in their respective constituencies \nas a result of wind damage.\n  The simple problem I have, if one of my colleagues turns to me and \nsays: Can you tell me what this will cost under the program? I cannot \nanswer the question. We are right now trying to, of course, excuse the \n$17 billion worth of debt that FEMA owes. That is part of the premium \ncosts people are paying in. We need to get a program in place, because \non June 1 hurricane season starts. In the absence of any program at \nall, this entire expense can fall in the taxpayers' laps.\n  We are all painfully aware of how damaging Mother Nature can be. The \nheadlines of every newspaper in the country today are of course about \nthe devastation in Myanmar where thousands have lost their lives. I \npresume with 120-mile-an-hour winds that ripped through these \ncommunities, it was not only flood damage that caused the tremendous \ndestruction.\n  This can happen. It is happening all over the globe these days. So we \nneed to address this. But in terms of this bill and trying get this \npiece done, it poses a significant burden for me as the chairman of \nthis committee. This bill passed out of our committee unanimously and \nnot without expressions being made by Senators Schumer and Martinez \nabout the wind issue.\n  Again, I am sensitive to their concerns. The flood program covers 5.5 \nmillion homes and businesses, and the wind program would substantially \nincrease the number of policies provided by the Federal Government, \ntaxing the administration of the program and putting taxpayers on the \nhook for greater losses, without any question.\n  In 2005, the hurricanes resulted in $17 billion in flood claims, an \namount that completely overwhelmed the flood program. We collect $2.5 \nbillion in premiums each year. About $1 billion of that is \nadministrative costs. So when you are down to a fraction, you get $17 \nbillion in claims on flood, how much would you have to raise those \npremiums to include the potential wind, where wind damage was five \ntimes that of flood in 2005, in those hurricanes that ripped through?\n  Again, I do not know the answer to those questions in terms of cost \nand what it would be. But it could literally price the program out of \nthe possibility of people affording it. And what makes the program work \nis that people pay into it here that allows us to deal with these kinds \nof catastrophes without going to the Federal Treasury to pay for them. \nSo an expansion of this size could literally overwhelm this program, \nthe flood insurance that is at a significant risk of sinking under the \nweight of wind. Flood insurance is already in a precarious position. I \nwant to make sure anything we do here will work to stabilize that \nprogram.\n  I am committed to finding a solution. In fact, had it not been for \nthe housing crisis I have been literally spending 98 percent of my time \non--and the Presiding Officer is a member of our committee--we are \nconsumed with this issue of how we deal with foreclosures, which is \nalso a problem, I might add, in some of the very States we are talking \nabout that are facing these problems coming to hurricane season.\n  We would have spent a substantial amount of our time on these related \nissues, the catastrophic issues our colleagues from Florida talk about, \nmy good friend, Bill Nelson, raises all the time that the people of \nFlorida care deeply about. We will get to that. The problem is that the \nwindow is closing on our time to do things. This program expires in \nSeptember, the flood insurance program--there is no program. So we have \na limited window to get this right.\n  I deeply regret that people have come over offering cloture motions. \nThe energy issue is huge. But when you end up messing up a piece of \nlegislation such as this, despite my offers to everyone to have up-or-\ndown votes on related amendments, to wind and flood and these problems \nhere, it does not help.\n  An awful lot of people are going to get hurt. An awful lot of costs \nare going to go up. A lot of damage is going to be done because we \ncannot spend 24 hours around here doing one thing, and that is deal \nwith flood insurance.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3854-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3854]]\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Wicker \namendment, the multiple peril insurance provision. I want to share some \nthoughts with the Senate on this provision.\n  As a Senator from the State of Florida, little is of more importance \nto the average homeowner than their home insurance and the cost of that \ninsurance.\n  The multiple peril insurance provision will create a new option in \nthe National Flood Insurance Program to offer coverage of both wind and \nflood risk in one policy.\n  The program requires premiums for the new coverage to be risk-based \nand actuarially sound.\n  CBO estimates the multiple peril program ``would increase premium \nreceipts and additional claims payments by about the same amount--\nresulting in no significant net budgetary impact.''\n  By covering wind and flood risk in one policy, the multiple peril \noption will allow coastal homeowners to buy insurance and know that \nhurricane damage would be covered.\n  The reason we have to consider this is because in Florida, the gulf \ncoast and throughout the region we have experienced constricting \neffects in the market.\n  Insurance companies are pulling out. They are dropping coverage. \nState Farm, for instance, stopped writing residential, rental, and \ncommercial policies just 2 months ago.\n  People in my State are finding it increasingly difficult to secure \ninsurance, especially policies that cover both wind and flood damage. \nPeople who have paid every premium and never filed a claim are simply \nlocked out of the market.\n  But insurance is only part of the solution. We also have to encourage \nmitigation.\n  The multiple peril program would strengthen coastal mitigation \nefforts by making the new coverage available only where local \ngovernments have adopted building codes consistent with International \nCode Council standards.\n  Most of the State-sponsored plans are not able to spread risk \nefficiently and not able to build up sufficient reserves to cover a \nmajor hurricane.\n  They are forced to charge higher and higher premiums to buy more \noverpriced reinsurance to keep up with their increasing liability.\n  The Federal multiple peril program will spread coastal risk \ngeographically, in a much more efficient manner than the state pools.\n  I strongly support the Wicker amendment, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I remind my colleagues that CBO expects that the new coverage offered \nunder H.R. 3121, the Wicker amendment, would increase premium receipts \nand additional claim payments by about the same amount, and the CBO \nclaims that the result would be no significant net budgetary impact.\n  For those reasons, I strongly support the Wicker amendment and urge \nmy colleagues to vote in favor of it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support, with so \nmany of my colleagues, of the Wicker amendment. As Senator Martinez has \ntalked about Florida, Senator Wicker has talked so eloquently about \nMississippi, so, too, in Louisiana it is an absolute imperative that we \naddress the wind liability coverage issue in this larger debate.\n  The single greatest obstacle to recovery in both of our States hit by \nKatrina and Rita is insurance. For so many of my constituents, \ninsurance on the wind liability side is unavailable or, if it is \navailable, completely, absolutely unaffordable. This Wicker amendment \nwill give folks a new option. It won't mandate it, it won't push them \ninto that program, but it will give them an option. Most importantly, \nit will give them an option without increasing any burden or risk to \nthe taxpayer.\n  I want to repeat something that has been said, but it is vitally \nimportant for everyone to understand before we vote; that is, the CBO \nhas made perfectly clear this amendment does not make the bill more \nexpensive. It does not make the program more expensive. It does not \ncost the taxpayer for a very simple reason: There is a mandate in the \nlanguage that premiums be set in an actuarially sound way to cover the \nrisk.\n  I strongly support the Wicker amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4722 to Amendment No. 4707\n\n  Having said that, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up Vitter amendment No. 4722.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4722 to amendment No. 4707.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n             (Purpose: To increase maximum coverage limits)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 33. MAXIMUM COVERAGE LIMITS.\n\n       Subsection (b) of section 1306 of the National Flood \n     Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4013(b)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``$250,000'' and \n     inserting ``$335,000'';\n       (2) in paragraph (3), by striking ``$100,000'' and \n     inserting ``$135,000''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (4)--\n       (A) by striking ``$500,000'' each place such term appears \n     and inserting ``$670,000''; and\n       (B) by inserting before ``; and'' the following: ``; except \n     that, in the case of any nonresidential property that is a \n     structure containing more than one dwelling unit that is made \n     available for occupancy by rental (notwithstanding the \n     provisions applicable to the determination of the risk \n     premium rate for such property), additional flood insurance \n     in excess of such limits shall be made available to every \n     insured upon renewal and every applicant for insurance so as \n     to enable any such insured or applicant to receive coverage \n     up to a total amount that is equal to the product of the \n     total number of such rental dwelling units in such property \n     and the maximum coverage limit per dwelling unit specified in \n     paragraph (2); except that in the case of any such multi-\n     unit, nonresidential rental property that is a pre-FIRM \n     structure (as such term is defined in section 578(b) of the \n     National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 4014 \n     note)), the risk premium rate for the first $500,000 of \n     coverage shall be determined in accordance with section \n     1307(a)(2) and the risk premium rate for any coverage in \n     excess of such amount shall be determined in accordance with \n     section 1307(a)(1)''.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment is basic and \nstraightforward. This amendment would increase the coverage limits for \nflood policies under the National Flood Insurance Program. Why do we \nneed to do that? For a very basic reason. Those dollar limits have not \nbeen changed in 14 years. They haven't been changed at all, adjusted \nfor inflation or anything else, since 1994. So it is way past overdue \nto update these coverage limits in a reasonable way. This Vitter \namendment 4722 would do just that. But, in fact, it wouldn't even fully \ntake into account inflation since 1994. It would fall a little short of \nthat. We chose the increases because my increases in amendment 4722 are \nexactly what the House of Representatives has already passed, merely \nupdating those limits to take into account most but not even all of \ninflation since they were last set in 1994.\n  I share with the chairman and ranking member the goal of making this \nprogram more fiscally sound, more actuarially sound. But we will \ncompletely frustrate that goal if we have a program with extremely low \ncoverage limits and people can't buy the coverage they need. What will \nhappen if we allow that? More and more storms\n\n[[Page S3855]]\n\nwill hit, and people who have flood insurance coverage will not have \nnearly enough coverage, so there will be pressure--every event, every \nstorm--to come to Congress for emergency measures above and beyond the \nflood insurance program. That isn't a path to fiscal soundness. A path \nto fiscal soundness must include some reasonable updating of coverage \nlimits. This amendment would do that.\n  Finally, this was included in the House version of the bill. It did \npass the House overwhelmingly. In the context of the House bill, the \nCongressional Budget Office said it did not add to the cost of the bill \nin any way because increased premiums go along, of course, with \nincreased coverage limits. The CBO said, in light of those increased \npremium payments, which go along with increasing coverage limits, there \nisn't an addition to the cost of the bill. It is a net wash in terms of \nthe cost to the taxpayer and to the bill.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to look \nhard at this amendment. It is a sound, modest amendment to update the \nprogram. It is perfectly consistent with fiscal soundness. I would hope \nwe can get a strong resounding vote in favor of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Vitter amendment and \noppose it very strongly. The goal of flood insurance legislation is to \nmove the program to more actuarially sound prices. This amendment would \nundermine that goal. The Vitter amendment would add significant new \nliabilities to the program without ensuring the necessary premium \nincreases to cover such liabilities.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that we are forgiving in this bill \nnearly $20 billion of debt incurred as a result of failures of the \nflood insurance program to date. The changes we are making are an \nattempt to ensure that taxpayers never have to pay off such a debt ever \nagain. This amendment runs contrary to that goal, making it much more \nlikely that we will be back bailing out the program in the near future.\n  Furthermore, there are currently numerous private insurance carriers \nproviding flood coverage for losses that exceed the maximum amounts \nprovided by the Federal program. In other words, unlike basic coverage, \nwhere no private insurance exists, there is a private insurance market \navailable for additional coverage. While I recognize this insurance is \nexpensive, that is because it is actuarially priced. The premium is \ncommensurate with the risk.\n  This program was designed to address the fact that the market stopped \nproviding primary flood insurance coverage. It was not intended to \nsocialize risks that were otherwise being handled by private markets. \nThe only reason to increase the coverage limits of the program is to \ncrowd out risk-priced private insurance to provide socialized \nsubsidized insurance. I believe it is largely due to the existing \nsubsidies that this program has such problems. We do not need to add \nmore subsidies at this time.\n  For all these reasons, I oppose the Vitter amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in response, I respect very much the views \nof the ranking member. But, No. 1, at least with regard to the House \nbill on which I have seen the CBO analysis, the CBO said it did not add \nto the cost of the bill because higher premiums obviously come with a \nhigher coverage limit, if folks choose to buy that.\n  Secondly, if we have coverage limits which are way too low and a big \nevent hits, that is going to shove us in a direction away from fiscal \nsoundness because it will make extraordinary emergency measures \nnecessary in response to that event by this Congress, rather than \nhaving an insurance system capable of covering the loss.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4723 to Amendment No. 4707\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment so I may \ncall up amendment No. 4723.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment No. 4723 to amendment No. 4707.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To allow for a reasonable 5-year phase-in period for adjusted \n                               premiums)\n\n       On page 11, line 6, strike ``Any increase'' and all that \n     follows through the second period on page 11, line 11, and \n     insert the following: ``Any increase in the risk premium rate \n     charged for flood insurance on any property that is covered \n     by a flood insurance policy on the date of completion of the \n     updating or remapping described in paragraph (1) that is a \n     result of such updating or remapping shall be phased in over \n     a 5-year period at the rate of 20 percent per year.''.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in the interest of moving this bill along \nand moving through as many issues as possible efficiently, I will \nexplain the amendment briefly.\n  This amendment deals with those properties which have an increased \nrisk because of the issuance of new flood maps. Every time there is an \nevent, of course, whether it is a small event or a huge one, such as \nKatrina and Rita, there are new flood maps developed over time by FEMA. \nIf a property is a greater risk under those new flood maps, under this \nunderlying bill premiums would go up. I have no objection to that. They \nshould go up. But I do think we need to temper that with a reasonable \ntime period over which to spread out that increase. This underlying \nbill says that increase would happen all in 2 years. My amendment would \nchange that to mirror the provision in the House bill and would spread \nthat increase over 5 years instead of 2.\n  This is a reasonable, modest measure to make this movement toward \nfiscal responsibility and actuarial soundness reasonable and manageable \nby the premium payer. Some of these changes, particularly after an \nevent such as Katrina or Rita, can be quite dramatic. To say that all \nof that change, all of that premium increase happens over 2 years is \ngoing to be a huge, whopping bill that is going to stop a lot of folks \nfrom being able to be insured over time.\n  I think this change to have that phased in over 5 years is \nreasonable. It does not lose sight of the goal of fiscal soundness and \nactuarial soundness, but it is a reasonable accommodation to folks who \nare in a very different circumstance because of a brandnew flood map.\n  With that, Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to support the measure, and I yield back the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank my colleague from \nLouisiana for offering these amendments and handling them as \nefficiently as he said he would. I appreciate that very much. We are \ntrying to move legislation here, so I am grateful to him.\n  As to this idea, this last point that was made--like the first \namendment he offered--there is value and merit in what he is \nsuggesting. But, as Senator Shelby has pointed out, we are trying to \nstrike balances. We have an obligation, one, to get this program up and \nrunning again. There is $17 billion on which we owe a debt, which is \ngoing to raise the cost of premiums if we do not forgive that debt, \nwhich is the major thrust of this legislation, as well as trying to \ndeal with some other related issues--but to try to keep this within \nprudent fiscal conditions.\n  What we do in this bill--and the point the Senator from Louisiana \nraises is a valid one. Certainly, we do not want this to occur in 1 \nyear. So what Senator Shelby and I did with our committee members is to \ndo a 2-year phase-in of this program. It is not 5 but it is 2 years, to \ntry to exactly accommodate the legitimate concerns raised by the \nSenator from Louisiana. Obviously, it all occurring at once would \nprobably be more than some people could tolerate. If the property is \nnewly mapped in a flood plain, the rates are phased in over a 2-year \nperiod to ensure that a home or business can plan for flood insurance \ncosts, obviously. It is not as long as 5 but we think 2 helps.\n  The bill and this provision are part of our overall effort to balance \nthe need to reform and strengthen the flood program with the need to \nensure people can afford to purchase needed flood insurance. Striking \nthat balance is what we are trying to achieve. It is hard not\n\n[[Page S3856]]\n\nto make a case--we could make it 6 years, 7 years. That would be \neasier. But the problem is, at the same time we would not be getting \nthe revenue coming in to accommodate covering the additional properties \nwe want to cover with the new mapping. So how do we do that? We thought \n2 years would be an adequate amount of time to give people a chance to \nphase that in and simultaneously meet our obligation of seeing to it \nthat this program would be there to cover the 5.5 million homes we are \ntalking about. I think we struck that right balance.\n  As to the other members of the Banking Committee, again, we \nunanimously adopted these provisions, and not without debate and \nconsideration of the very point being raised by the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues, again, this bill results in \nsignificant savings in the flood program. The bill forgives $17 billion \nin debt. We are paying interest payments on that $17 billion. That is \npart of that premium cost. That is a huge cost. Without this debt \nforgiveness, which is a part of this legislation, policyholders would \nsee rates increase many times over. In fact, rates would have to almost \ndouble just to pay the interest on the debt FEMA owes. So that is a \nmajor thrust of what we are trying to achieve. So we are saving all \npolicyholders and all homeowners at risk from being priced out of this \nprogram with the debt-relief provision.\n  In exchange, however, the bill contains provisions to move the \nprogram to actuarially sound rates to ensure the long-term viability of \nthe flood program, which is also our responsibility with this \nlegislation--to make sure that actuarially this program will have the \nrevenues coming in to support and sustain the risks it tries to cover \nagainst.\n  These reforms stabilize the flood program to make sure that when the \nnext flood hits, homeowners will have flood insurance to be able to \nrebuild their homes and their lives.\n  I am concerned that further subsidies in the program undermine our \nefforts to put this program on sound financial footing. Those are the \nreasons I would oppose the second Vitter amendment as well. I say that \nwith respect. Again, these are a lot of ideas that neither Senator \nShelby nor I would say lack merit. It is a question of what we can \nafford to do, where the balance is, where the actuarial soundness is. \nThat is more the thrust of our argument than whether we agree or \ndisagree with the goals stated by the proponents of these amendments.\n  I make the same point I made earlier as to the amendment offered by \nSenator Wicker from Mississippi. I would be hard pressed to make a case \nthat we should not try to do something about wind damage. It is a \nlegitimate issue. I will point out in this morning's papers, if you \nread about that incredible devastation created in Myanmar: 25,000 \npeople lost, 120-mile-an-hour winds ripping through that country, \nclearly flood damage, clearly water damage, clearly wind damage.\n  The problem Senator Shelby and I have is, I could not answer the \nquestion. My friend from New Mexico asked me: How much is that going to \ncost, Senator? I cannot answer you. You have a right to know the answer \nto that question, so we are trying to find that out. We have asked for \na study to look at the wind issue. The Acting President pro tempore \ncomes from a coastal State as well. He knows what can happen with these \nissues. I think wind is a legitimate issue for us to sort out. But I \ncannot honestly answer the question actuarially. We are told it is five \ntimes the cost. If you take in the four hurricanes in 2005, the $17 \nbillion in flood damage, wind damage would have been five times that \ncost. Of course, we have a flood insurance program here that puts $2.5 \nbillion into that account on an annual basis.\n  So we are talking about something we are really not capable of \nmanaging under the present circumstances--a legitimate issue. The \nSenator from Mississippi is absolutely correct in raising it. I pointed \nout earlier that Senator Schumer of New York talked about this \npassionately. Senator Martinez from Florida talked about this as well. \nAnybody from a coastal State will tell you what this can mean. But I \nhave to be able to answer--as Senator Shelby and I do--the question of \nwhether you can actuarially account for this, whether we can have a \nprogram that is sustainable, and we cannot answer those questions. In \nthe absence of doing that, we reluctantly oppose these amendments, and \nbecause of the importance of getting this program accomplished, in \nplace.\n  In 3 weeks, or less than 3 weeks, the hurricane season starts. Any of \nus who live in these eastern coastal areas, the Gulf State areas, \nFlorida, coming up that coast all the way up to New England, know that \nat any given point over that period of time, we could be hit. We need \nto have this program in place to begin to take care of these costs. \nThat is why we are here today to try to get this done.\n  I am going to respectfully say and urge colleagues to come over with \ntheir amendments so we can get this work done--to listen to what they \nhave to offer and say, to consider where we can, but we need to \ncomplete this bill, and we are going to be most reluctant to be \nsupportive of ideas that violate the actuarial soundness of what \nSenator Shelby and I and the other 18 members of our committee endorsed \nlast year when we adopted this bill.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Alabama on the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4719\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments. I rise \nin opposition to the Wicker amendment that the Senator from Mississippi \noffered earlier and has spoken to. I recognize that property casualty \ninsurance availability and affordability is a serious concern in some \nparts of this country, perhaps all parts. The addition of wind \ncoverage, however, to the financially insolvent flood insurance program \nis not the solution to this problem.\n  I think we should put this amendment into context. According to the \nInsurance Information Institute, this amendment would add an additional \n$10 trillion to $12 trillion in exposure to the bankrupt Federal flood \nprogram, as well as annual Federal program deficits that could reach \n$100 billion or more. Just think about it.\n  On this, in the Banking Committee, we have had no hearings. We have \nestablished no record. We have no understanding in any way, shape, or \nform as to what the true consequences of the Wicker amendment could \nbe--nothing at all.\n  Perhaps we should consider this amendment in the context of flood \ninsurance. The National Flood Insurance Program does not charge \nactuarial rates for anyone within the program. There are direct \nsubsidies to many homeowners and indirect subsidies to all others \nbecause the underwriting criteria do not accurately depict the risk. \nThe program is currently bankrupt and has no ability to pay back its \n$17 billion debt obligation at this point. With a model such as this, I \nam not convinced that another Government-managed insurance program will \nwell serve the American taxpayer.\n  There are other considerable flaws to the approach contemplated by \nthe Wicker amendment. Private insurers minimize exposure to \ncatastrophic risk through diversification. The Wicker amendment would \nconcentrate the risk. It provides no ability for reinsurance, \nretrocessional insurance, or any other means to diversify and lay off \nrisk.\n  In addition, the Federal wind coverage would face operational \nchallenges that have not been addressed through the Wicker amendment. \nThe flood program currently takes advantage of efficiencies created by \nthe use of public and private resources. No private insurance company \nwould ever sell or solicit a policy that would directly compete with \nitself. Therefore, the wind portion of this insurance will be marketed, \nunderwritten, and serviced directly by the Federal Government, if you \nwill. This will add significant administrative costs and bureaucracy to \nthe process of claims handling.\n  The capital markets have begun to show strong willingness to \nunderwrite the risks associated with natural disasters. New \ninnovations, such as catastrophe bonds and sidecar agreements, have \nbeen created recently. By allowing more Federal Government involvement, \nmany of the innovative techniques for transferring risk will be crowded \nout in the marketplace.\n\n[[Page S3857]]\n\n  While there are some parts of the country where insurance coverage \nproblems have occurred, most of the property casualty insurance market \nis functioning well in this country. In order to fully understand the \nproblems associated with coverage lapses, I believe we must work to \nunderstand the root causes of the problem so we can debate solutions \nand address the problem without hindering the rest of the market \nitself.\n  Our legislation creates a commission intended to provide us much of \nthe necessary information we need to understand the problem of \ncatastrophic risk. For instance, the commission would study ``the \ncurrent condition of, as well as the outlook for, the availability and \naffordability of insurance in all regions of the country.'' It would \nalso consider ``catastrophic insurance and reinsurance markets and the \nrelevant practices in providing insurance protection to different \nsectors of the American population,'' as well as many other issues \ndirectly relating to the cost and availability of insurance for wind \ndamage.\n  Given the potential exposure to the taxpayer, I believe we owe them a \nbetter process. At a minimum, Mr. President, I think we need to further \nstudy this problem prior to committing the resources of the American \ntaxpayer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: What is the \nbusiness before the Senate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Vitter amendment is the pending \nbusiness.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, that is because we had unanimous consent \nto set aside the Domenici amendment, or the Allard amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There was a unanimous consent to \nset aside the pending amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to speak on the underlying \nDomenici amendment for about 15 minutes, and then time will be arranged \nfor that between the leaders for later in the day, so we will not have \nto have any further interruptions, as I understand it. I do not seek to \ninterrupt your bill. I say to Senator Dodd, there will not be any \nfurther interruptions until some agreement is reached, perhaps between \nthe leadership.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, I am trying to \narrange--we now have three amendments. There may be some people who \nwant to be heard on them, the Wicker amendment and the two Vitter \namendments. My hope was to have a vote at around 3:15 on those three \namendments.\n  I am trying to move a bill--Senator Shelby and I. We are running out \nof time here. There are about maybe as many as 17 amendments we are \ngoing to have to consider. We could be in here late tonight. If that is \nthe case, I would like to do that in order to get this done. I am going \nto let staff know here--and I am not going to make the motion at this \ntime--just to let them know I would like to make a unanimous consent \nrequest that, say, at 3:15 we vote on the Wicker and the two Vitter \namendments and to notify the leadership of that so they can consider \nwhether they want to agree to that. But that way, we could move along, \nif Members want to be heard on these amendments.\n  The concern, I say to my good friend from New Mexico--and he is one \nof my best friends here--I am trying to get this done.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. DODD. If you have 15 or 20 minutes, it will blow me back from \n3:15.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, 3:30 would be early enough. You would be \nmaking good time at 3:30 and let me have a little time. This is a big \namendment and we have to have some understanding of it before you get \nyour bill finished. You are going to have a vote on it--I won't use \nmore than 15 minutes at this point--on a very big proposition on behalf \nof almost all of the Republicans. I don't know about your bill in \ndetail, but I think you are doing a terrific job.\n  Mr. DODD. Here is my problem. If I don't have a vote at 3:15, it will \nbe a lot later than that, and I will be notified by staff and the \nleader. That is my problem. I know my colleague wants to be heard on \nthe bill and he has every right to be heard. I would like to vote at \n3:15, stacking three votes at 3:15.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If you get that agreed to, can I have consent to be \nrecognized after those votes for 15 minutes?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if votes \nare called for on the three amendments alluded to by Senator Dodd, the \nSenator from New Mexico would be recognized after those votes for 15 \nminutes to speak on the energy amendment which is attached to this \nbill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. We have a request to see whether we can have the three \nstacked votes at 3:15.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what are \nthe three votes?\n  Mr. DODD. Senator Wicker and two amendments offered by Senator \nVitter. I don't have the numbers in front of me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The unanimous consent does not deal \nwith stacking those three votes at this point. The unanimous consent \nonly dealt with the Senator from New Mexico having floor time if there \nwere three votes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. OK. That is the only unanimous consent agreement. That \nis fine.\n  Mr. DODD. Pending the agreement on that, at the conclusion of those \nthree votes, the Senator from New Mexico be recognized for 15 minutes \nto talk about his amendment--assuming we can get an agreement to have a \nvote at 3:15.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If we don't get agreement on that, then I ask that I be \nrecognized at 3:30 for my 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me try to get an agreement here. One step at a time.\n  The Senator from Louisiana wants to be heard.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a moment, if I \ncould, about the wind amendment that is pending that Senator Wicker, \nmyself, Senator Vitter, and Senator Cochran have cosponsored. Several \nof us have been working on this for months now, and our colleagues in \nthe House, particularly from Mississippi and Louisiana, have been very \nengaged, but there are other delegations that are engaged in this issue \nas well. The reason is because flood insurance, while it has been \nhelpful--very helpful to some degree--throughout the southern part and \ncoastal areas of the country, is not sufficient. We have to provide \nsome opportunity for our homeowners and businesses to have access to \naffordable wind insurance, and the operative word here is \n``affordable.''\n  That is why we have offered this amendment to modify and expand the \ninsurance bill regarding flooding. That is why we have held this bill \nup--one of the reasons this bill has been held up by several of us for \nseveral months now--until we could try to get an opportunity to fix \nthis bill which is still, in my view, greatly flawed in a number of \nareas, and this is one. This bill is not providing what people need--\nnot just in Louisiana and in Mississippi but in Texas, in Alabama, in \nSouth Carolina, in North Carolina, in Florida--in many places around \nthis country that may be subject to storms, particularly along the \nlines of Katrina and Rita and other storms that have hit recently and \nare projected, obviously, to continue.\n  We are making some significant changes. People are building stronger. \nThere are new building codes being adopted county by county, parish by \nparish, and State by State. There are new ideas about designs and \nbuilding more safely. Even some communities are moving to higher \nground. Neighborhoods are making tough decisions about where we should \nbuild and where we shouldn't. All of that is going on throughout many \nparts of the country.\n  I wish to read a couple of letters--because I think my colleagues \nhave explained this issue very well--that we are receiving from \nconstituents who have been struggling to get themselves back in their \nhomes and to pay not just their mortgage but their insurance costs as \nwell as the rising cost of fuel and the rising cost of groceries. This \nis exacerbating a very tough economic situation that we are \nexperiencing in the gulf.\n\n[[Page S3858]]\n\n  This is an e-mail I received from Chet in Metairie:\n\n       Hello. I live in Old Metairre. My home did receive wind \n     damage from Katrina, with a total insurance claim of just \n     under $30,000. I share my mortgage costs with my mother who \n     is a 79-year-old retired Jefferson Parish school teacher. \n     This year, our homeowners insurance tripled. Thanks to this, \n     the total amount we pay to our mortgage company has almost \n     doubled in 2008. Our monthly payment of loan, property tax, \n     and insurance has gone from about $1,200 before Katrina to \n     $2,093 post-Katrina. My income has not increased. My mother's \n     pension has not increased at all. My brother in Mandeville \n     has experienced similar increases. We know that insurance \n     companies reported record profits in the year following \n     Katrina.\n\n  It is very interesting to me that so many people on this floor are \nscreaming and yelling about record oil profits. I didn't hear anyone \ncome to the floor to talk about the strange and unusual situation of \nafter one of the greatest catastrophes in the history of this country, \nor at least recent catastrophes, the insurance profits hit a record \nhigh, but no one from the committee came down to talk about taxing or \ncurbing insurance profits. Yet we can't even get any kind of expansion \nor affordable rates for wind coverage.\n  I am not blaming all insurance companies, but there is something to \nbe said for in the same year that there is the largest catastrophe in \nthe country, the companies that are covering the catastrophe had record \nprofits. I don't understand it and most of my constituents don't \nunderstand that. So there is a plea from constituents everywhere to try \nto do something about affordable insurance coverage.\n  Here is another e-mail from Kim in New Orleans:\n\n       Dear Mary, I'm not really sure what category this falls \n     under. I have owned a home in New Orleans for the past three \n     years. My insurance has gone from $995 a year to $5,133. I am \n     a single mother with one child. I cannot afford an insurance \n     premium of $995 to $5,135. What are we going to do?\n\n  Another from Mandeville:\n\n       My homeowners insurance has just increased $1,000. Since my \n     insurance company decided not to cover hail and wind anymore, \n     I will have to buy insurance from the ``Fair'' plan--\n\n  Which is our State's pool--\n\n     at a higher premium.\n       In addition to keeping the premium low enough to afford my \n     mortgage, I cannot cover everything inside of my home.\n\n  Now, again--I know the Presiding Officer has been down to Louisiana--\nI am not talking about second homes on beaches. I am not talking about \nhomeowners who live on the water. I am talking about people who live in \nthe city, a port city, similar to Baltimore. We have New Orleans, a \ngreat port city, that services not just the millions of people who live \nin and around the metropolitan area and all up and down the lower \nMississippi River, but a port city that benefits the whole entire \nNation. So basically, with the bill that the committee has brought to \nthe floor, which I have objected to, their basic philosophy is \neverybody who lives in and around a port that generates profit can pay \nhigh rates, so everybody else can pay extra low rates, and the people \nin the port cities can basically absorb the difference.\n\n  I understand about risk. If you are living in Florida on a beach in a \ncondo as a second home or maybe even your first home or you are living \non a beach in Alabama or in Mississippi, maybe you should pay a little \nbit extra. But the people whom I am representing--we only have two \nbeaches. There are only two, 3 miles long, and you can't even get to \nthem basically without a boat. I have people in Mandeville, in St. \nTammany Parish, in Tangipahoa Parish and in the city of New Orleans 5 \nminutes from the Superdome who are seeing their rates quadruple. These \npeople are not living in a vacation area.\n  This committee is having a hard time understanding this issue. That \nis why the Members, both Republicans and Democrats, have brought this \nbill, to try to say what are we going to do to give affordable wind \ncoverage to people who live in and around these port communities.\n  This is from Robert in Slidell:\n\n       This will be an increase from $500 to $3,887 or an increase \n     of 775 percent. My dwelling coverage increased by more than \n     21 percent in June of 2007 and another 21 percent in June of \n     2008. This is in addition to my deductible increasing 775 \n     percent.\n\n  He says:\n\n       I am confused.\n\n  Well, let me tell Robert that I am confused too, because this is \nsupposed to be a reform bill coming through to give people better \ninsurance and better coverage and it leaves wind out of it completely. \nThat is why we put on a wind amendment. I ask my colleagues to please \nsupport the amendment that will allow us to include wind.\n  This is a final e-mail from Theresa in LaPlace, LA, again, 75 miles \nfrom a beach:\n\n       I just received notice from my mortgage company that due to \n     the skyrocketing insurance premiums for my landlord policy, \n     the house note is increasing from $312 per month to $725 per \n     month. The monthly insurance premium is more than the monthly \n     house note. If something is not done, I am going to be forced \n     to sell my house.\n\n  Now, I have been to this floor many times before. I am very sensitive \nto the foreclosure problems going on around this country. I know the \ncounties that are experiencing very high foreclosure rates. Some of \nthem are because lenders speculated. Some of it is because a few home \nbuilders got greedy--not all, because most home builders are doing the \nright thing, but they maybe speculated in a market.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Can I interrupt you for a minute?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator from Louisiana \nyield at this time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU: Yes, for 1 minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:15 p.m., \nthe Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the following amendments: \nWicker amendment No. 4719, the Vitter amendment No. 4722, and the \nVitter amendment No. 4723.\n  Further, I ask that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided \nbetween the two votes and that there be no second-degree amendments in \norder prior to the vote. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfirst vote be a 15-minute rollcall vote and the remaining votes be 10-\nminute votes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  As I was saying, the letter goes on to say:\n\n       I have paid enough in insurance premiums to rebuild my \n     house out-of-pocket had it been completely destroyed.\n\n  But again, when we try to get decent, affordable coverage for people, \nboth for flood and wind, we are having a difficult time on this floor \nand in this Congress.\n  So I hope as we continue to discuss through the afternoon the \nimportance of this that people will understand and recognize that this \namendment--there are several but this amendment regarding wind is very \nimportant so we can continue our recovery in the gulf coast.\n  As I was saying before I was asked to pause for a minute, I recognize \nthe foreclosure difficulties throughout the country, and I have said I \nam sensitive to the concerns of those communities. But I want to please \nremind everyone again: The people of the gulf coast do not have a \nforeclosure problem brought on by themselves. In fact, our foreclosure \nrate is lower, much lower than any--much lower than the national \naverages. But our people are getting their homes foreclosed and taken \naway from them because Federal levees that should have held failed and \nan insurance system we should have regulated has gone in large measure \nunregulated, and programs such as this that are supposed to be helping \npeople afford insurance are not doing so. It is not right.\n  Our people have nowhere else to go other than to Congress to help \nthem get a better system in place. That is why I and many of my \ncolleagues have held this bill up for 2 years in committee. We may or \nmay not get to vote on it this afternoon, depending upon how many e-\nmails I decide to read into the Record.\n  I wish to talk about an amendment I am going to offer and send up, \namendment No. 4706, as modified.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is the Senator requesting to set \naside the pending amendment?\n\n[[Page S3859]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, and I will offer another one.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The clerk will \ncontinue with the call of the roll.\n  The bill clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4719\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I want to speak to the Wicker \namendment. This amendment, which will add wind coverage to the flood \ninsurance policies, is a major policy change with regard to the Federal \nGovernment. Wind coverage has always been handled by the private \ninsurance sector and/or the quasi-government sector, covering wind \nthrough a catastrophic insurance fund as we have in Florida, or a \nquasi-insurance company such as we have in Florida.\n  This is a major policy shift. The bottom line is, I support this \namendment because it is an important symbolic amendment. Our people are \nhurting and they need some help with regard to the potential \ncatastrophic wiping out of not only their lives but their property as \nwell.\n  What has happened in this day and age of the huge natural catastrophe \nfirst came to the fore in the example in 1992 by the monster hurricane, \nHurricane Andrew. Andrew--now they think it was a category 5, which is \nwinds upwards of 150, 155 miles an hour--had insurance losses in 1992 \nof $16 billion. That was by far the largest insurance loss through a \nnatural catastrophe in the history of the United States. In today's \ndollars that would be somewhere around a $22 or $23 billion insurance \nloss.\n  What really shook up the insurance marketplace at that time was, had \nAndrew turned 1 degree to the north and drawn a bead on the city of \nMiami or Fort Lauderdale instead of the city of Homestead--which is way \nto the south in a relatively undeveloped part of Miami, Dade County--\nhad it turned 1 degree to the north and hit that other area, it would \nhave been a $50-billion-loss storm, and that would have taken down \nevery major insurance company in the country that was doing business in \nthe path of that storm. That is what shook up the markets.\n  Then we had a few others--not anything upwards of category 4 or 5--in \nthe latter part of the decade in the 1990s. Then along comes 2004 and \nwe get four hurricanes in Florida within a 6-week period. There was \nvirtually no county in the State of Florida that did not have hurricane \ndamage. The only good news coming out of that year was none of them \nwere above category 3--in the range of 120 to 125 miles per hour. Of \ncourse, the damage goes up exponentially as winds increase in miles per \nhour above 110, 115. When you get on up into the range 130, 140, 150, \nthe damage goes up exponentially.\n  The insurance marketplace was just roiled, and insurance companies \ncould not find what is known as catastrophic coverage, or in this case \ninsuring against catastrophe to insure the insurance company against \nthat catastrophic loss.\n  Of course, right on the heels of 2004, then we had the awful mess \nwith Hurricane Katrina. That is an interesting storm because it was a \ntypical category 3 storm that can cause the amount of damage that you \nwould expect a storm to do hitting the Mississippi coast with category \n3 winds. What people did not expect was, on the back side of that \nhurricane--remember the hurricane is counterclockwise in the northern \nhemisphere--the back side of those winds coming across Lake \nPontchartrain, as the eye of the hurricane moved over the coast to the \neast in Mississippi, those winds brought the rain, and that started \nfilling up the canals in New Orleans. The pumps did not work or were \ninadequate to pump out the canals. The water rose, the water pressure \nrose, it breached the dikes, and it filled up the bowl of New Orleans \nso you get so much more water damage, flood damage, with a lot of the \npeople in New Orleans not having flood insurance when, in fact, they \nwere below sea level in the location of their homes.\n  What the amendment of Senator Wicker, and a companion side-by-side of \nSenator Schumer, is doing is adding wind to the flood insurance \npolicies. Symbolically it is important because our people are hurting. \nThey cannot find available hurricane wind insurance, and they can't \nfind it affordable. That is why I am going to support it.\n  Now, let me tell you what is wrong with it. Should this legislation \npass, it would have to be fixed down the line. It has two major flaws. \nThe first is that it sets up a standard that says the rates for this \nwind insurance have to be actuarially sound.\n  That sounds real good. Rates ought to be actuarially sound. But the \nproblem is, there is no check and balance on the person or persons who \nare going to be doing that as there is in the regulation of insurance \nby the insurance commissioners of the 50 States. Therefore, what I fear \nwith legislation like this is that some secretive group or Star Chamber \noutside the normal government in the sunshine, making mathematical \ncalculations that are actuarially sound, would suddenly enact rates \nthat would go through the roof, and the very purpose of what we are \ntrying to do--to have available and affordable insurance for people in \nthe face of hurricanes--would be for naught. It would have exactly the \nopposite result with no accountability and no insurance regulator that \nwould crack the whip on them.\n  The other flaw in the requirement of actuarially sound rates is, if a \nloss occurs and you are covering both wind and flood, the wind losses \nmay well absorb all of the available reserves in the Federal flood \ninsurance program and there is no money left in order to pay the flood \ninsurance claims.\n  What it does is it translates into higher premiums and a potential \nloss of flood subsidies. The requirement in the bill that the \nmultiperil rate be actuarial could cause the current flood \npolicyholders, who are eligible to receive subsidized rates through the \nstandard National Flood Insurance Program, through their flood policy, \nto lose the subsidy that is already there in the National Flood \nInsurance Program. If this policy in this amendment were to be enacted, \nit could certainly lead some States with existing wind coverage \noptions--such as my State of Florida--to discontinue that coverage, \nwhich would further provoke policyholders to have to purchase the \nexpensive but actuarially sound National Flood Insurance Program \nmultiperil coverage.\n  This would essentially shift the liability from the State to the \nFederal Government while at the same time actually limiting consumers' \naccess to affordable wind coverage--exactly the opposite of what is \nintended by the offeror of the amendment. Nevertheless, it is a logical \nconclusion unless you clean up this language.\n  Now, the next concern I have with it is both the Wicker and the \nSchumer amendments could destroy the financial integrity of the \nNational Flood Insurance Fund. In both these amendments being offered, \nthe multiperil policy would be offered as an optional coverage under \nthe National Flood Insurance Program.\n  Because the proposals do not expressly separate the premium from the \nstandard flood program, there is a potential for the entire flood fund \nto be drained without paying the claims for the wind damage. This would \nput the flood insurance program right back in the situation it finds \nitself now: relying on borrowing from the U.S. Treasury to pay the \nclaims to flood policyholders.\n  So this is a complex problem. But as we try to solve it, we must \nensure that we do not inadvertently undermine the viability of the \nNational Flood Insurance Program and fail to fulfill the promise we \nmade to 5.5 million current policyholders, and, oh, by the way, 40 \npercent of all those flood insurance policyholders are in my State of \nFlorida--40 percent of them.\n\n[[Page S3860]]\n\n  All of us along the gulf have struggled with availability and \naffordability of homeowners insurance. But, Members of the Senate, this \nis not only a Florida problem and it is not only a gulf coast problem; \ninsurers are cancelling coverages from Texas to Massachusetts, and \nthose who say the Federal Government does not belong in the catastrophe \ninsurance market are mistaken.\n  Because when the big one comes, and mark my word, the big one is \ncoming, the big one is a category 5 storm that hits at a high-density \nurban concentration population on the coast, be that anyplace on the \ngulf or Atlantic seaboard, when that big one comes, the availability of \nprivate markets to handle that natural disaster is not going to be able \nto be there. And the Federal Government keeps denying the fact that we \nought to face this problem.\n  The Senators in the Midwest say: Well, Hurricanes are Florida's \nproblem or earthquakes are California's problem. What they do not \nrecognize is, no, it is everyone's problem. Because what typically \nhappens when a natural disaster of this magnitude hits, it is the very \nsame Federal Government that picks up the tab.\n  I remember my first year as a young Congressman back in 1979. I had \nto vote for what were Federal disaster funds and the cleanup of a \nnatural catastrophe that was the blowing of Mount St. Helens, which \nspewed ash all over several cities.\n  I thought to myself at the time, when others were trying to kill that \ndisaster assistance saying: Well, that is not our problem; that is the \nproblem of the State of Washington. No, it is all of our problem. The \nFederal Government does have the disaster funds to come to that aid.\n  If you take a State such as Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina, that full hurricane now is something like a $200 billion \neconomic loss. The Federal Government has picked up at least half of \nthat, $100 billion. And we say we do not think there is a Federal \nresponsibility to try to plan ahead for that catastrophe by providing \nsome kind of catastrophe insurance if the States cannot provide it?\n  This whole instability has repeatedly forced the Federal Government \nto absorb billions of dollars of uninsured losses, including the most \nrecent ones of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, just those \nhurricanes alone.\n  So as we go on down the line, we have a must-pass bill. We have to \nreauthorize this Federal Flood Insurance Program. I wish to thank the \nchairman and the ranking member in that what they have done, if we do \nnot pass anything else--and I have a couple amendments on trying to \narrange for a loan program from the Federal Government. It has already \npassed the House--a loan program at fair market rates; in case the \nState catastrophe fund, which is a reinsurance fund against \ncatastrophes, in case that goes belly up, that there will be a loan \nprogram from the Federal Government at market interest rates.\n  But if we fail on all these, at least in the bill, thanks to the \nchairman and to the ranking member, is the setting up of a commission \nthat would have to report back, a commission composed--and the ranking \nmember is coming on the floor. I have been singing his praises, along \nwith the chairman's, of putting in the bill a commission made up of \nexperts, broadly representative of the communities that are affected, \nto recognize we have a problem on covering catastrophes in the \ninsurance business.\n  That commission would have a certain day on which to report. What \nthat will signal, if that is the only thing we can get in here, I hope \nwe can get this loan program that I talked about for a State insurance \ncatastrophe fund. If it goes drain dry, that Federal Government would \nlend money to it at market rates so that at the State level, they can \ntry to take care of that catastrophe.\n  But if we cannot get that, there is a question of germaneness; \ntherefore, I would have to get a 60-vote threshold to have the \namendment considered. But if we cannot do that, at least we have in the \nbill, in a must-pass bill, the Federal flood insurance bill, for the \nfirst time, the Federal Government will have on the table the \nrecognition that we have to understand and do something about the \nresponse from the Federal Government when the big one comes. And it is \ncoming.\n  Madam President, I made a commitment to the Senator from Louisiana \nthat when I yield the floor I will ask for the quorum call. So I would \nmerely take my instructions from the Senator from Louisiana if she \nwanted me to entertain a question from any Senators standing, without \nlosing my rights to the floor.\n  The Senator from Louisiana has so indicated. So I would certainly \nyield for the purpose of a question without losing my right to the \nfloor to the distinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I do not have a question for my colleague. \nI wish to thank him. For those who want to understand this, I think he \nis rather eloquent and knowledgeable. As a former insurance \ncommissioner of the State of Florida, he has more than a passing \nfamiliarity with these issues. He has described it, made the case more \neloquently than I did about the difficulty we have with the wind \namendment; not on the substance of whether we ought to do something \nabout it but whether we can and what the effects of this amendment \ncould be.\n  I commend him as someone who understands that, for laying it out and \nthe problems inherent with it. As he and my colleagues know, the \nability to then alter that kind of amendment then becomes almost \nimpossible in this process.\n  As I said earlier in the presence of my friend from Mississippi, we, \nSenator Shelby and I, are deeply involved in the foreclosure issues, as \nwe have been over the last number of months. As our colleagues are \naware, this subject matter of catastrophic insurance would have been \nthe major subject matter of the Banking Committee. I regret we were \ncaught up in the foreclosure situation, for obvious reasons.\n  But that does not minimize at all the situation my colleague from \nFlorida faces--or that other States do. It is not only a Florida issue, \nthis is an issue that affects all of us in this country, and we need to \nhave a far better plan in place on how we deal with it.\n  I mentioned earlier: Pick up this morning's newspaper. You read the \nheadline in the local newspaper and every newspaper, I presume, across \nnot only this country but around the world on what happened in Myanmar; \n120 mile-an-hour winds, devastation, loss of life. These problems are \noccurring around the globe. We would be naive at best to think it \ncannot happen here. In fact, it has happened and could happen even \nworse in this country. So we need to get to those points. I thank him \nvery much for his eloquence and his understanding of these issues.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I would yield for the \npurposes of a question, without losing my rights to the floor, to the \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank my friend, the Senator from Florida, for \nyielding.\n  I, too, wish to commend him for his statement about the complexity of \nthis issue. I appreciate the reservations he has expressed, while at \nthe same time expressing support for the Wicker amendment today. I \nwould hope the Senator would agree that support for this amendment \ntoday, though it might not be a perfect amendment, would send the \nsignal he suggested--that there needs to be a Federal response to this \nissue.\n\n  We know this bill will go to conference. There will be additional \nwork on it. But I would like to send a signal to the executive branch, \nto the insurance industry, to the homebuilders, to the realtors, we \nneed to get busy on this issue.\n  Because, as the Senator said, the insurance for wind coverage is not \nthere anymore in the private market at an affordable rate. And the wind \npools are not affordable, because the pool is so small that we cannot \nspread the risk, whether it is Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, \nMaryland, North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, \nLouisiana, Alabama, or my home State of Mississippi.\n  This is a problem for people when the next big one comes, as my \nfriend has said. We do not know where or when it will come, but what we \ndo know for a certainty is it will indeed come.\n  So I appreciate the thoughtfulness of the Senator's remarks. I \nappreciate his\n\n[[Page S3861]]\n\nbottom indication that he supports the amendment as a vehicle to move \nthis issue forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I indicated in my opening \nremarks that not only do I support the Wicker amendment but the similar \nSchumer amendment. It is important, symbolically, to get something \ndone.\n  Now, the Senator from Mississippi has suggested another idea, that at \nthe end of the day, when it is very difficult to enact a national \ncatastrophic fund, what the Federal Government can do is encourage, by \ngiving incentives to the States, enactment of a regional catastrophic \nfund.\n  Florida, of course, had to take the lead because we were the ones who \ngot devastated in 1992 by Hurricane Andrew. Florida set up this fund \ncalled the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. It is a reinsurance fund \nto insure against catastrophes.\n  But that cost is spread over 18 million Floridians. Does it not make \na lot more sense to spread that hurricane catastrophic risk over 50 \nmillion Americans, by getting all the Gulf States and the Atlantic \ncoast States to combine in a regional catastrophic fund, since at the \nend of the day, it is going to be very hard to get a national \ncatastrophic fund?\n  So as we get on down the line, with the commission, if that is the \nonly thing that survives this legislative process, then certainly that \nshould be an item on the table that the commission would consider when \nthey would report back to the Congress.\n  I am hopeful for the first time now, we have something on the floor \nthat is going to address this, and I am grateful I can speak out on \nbehalf of 18 million Floridians who are hurting because what they want \nis available and affordable homeowners insurance.\n  Right now many times it is not available, and they have to go to a \ngovernment insurance company such as Citizens or it is unaffordable. \nRemember, if you can't have homeowners insurance, you can't build \nhomes, make loans on homes, or sell homes. The necessary component for \nall three of those industries--real estate, construction, and banking--\nis an available and affordable homeowners insurance policy. We have \nreached the point that it is either not available or it is not \naffordable. Finally, we are beginning to address it, right here. I am \ngrateful for that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3861-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3861-S3883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Cap and Trade Revenue\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise on a separate subject that is \ncoming at us that is of even greater significance in many ways because \nit is going to impact the entire structure of the economy and the lives \nof everyone in the United States, and that is how we get a handle on \nthe issue of global warming and the issue specifically of the emission \nof toxic materials from plants which generate energy. The term ``cap \nand trade'' is applied to a bill that is going to be brought forward \nsupposedly in early June. Cap and trade is a concept of basically \ncreating areas where energy companies are required to start reducing \ntheir emissions but the manner in which they do so is tied to the \ntrading of rights of basically emissions and what sort of chemicals can \nbe emitted through a trading process between different regions and \nwithin different communities of emitters.\n  This cap-and-trade proposal, which is known as the Warner-Lieberman \nbill, is a huge readjustment of our economy. It represents a massive \ncost to our economy as well as, hopefully, a massive improvement, if it \nwould work right, in the amount of toxic emissions which we incur and \nwhich occur as a result of our production of electricity specifically. \nThe cost of the cap-and-trade program, through the purchasing and \nselling of allocations of what can be emitted, is estimated to be about \n$1.2 trillion over the first 10 years of the proposal. This cost, \nobviously, is going to have a major impact on our economy. It is going \nto have a major impact on the people who consume the electricity, \nbecause the cost is going to be passed on to the people who use \nelectricity in their homes, primarily, and businesses. There are a lot \nof issues raised by this bill on the substance of whether cap and trade \ncan work--for example, issues of foreign competition, whether the \ntechnology necessary to meet the conditions for reduction will be \navailable in time, issues as to whether certain segments of our \nindustrial society are going to be unnecessarily handicapped and create \na rush to move jobs offshore. These are big policy issues. I didn't \nwant to address those. I don't want to address the substance of how the \nactual cap and trade will work. What I want to address instead is the \nancillary, sidecar issue of the generation of this huge cost of $1.2 \ntrillion, and it will go on 40 years. So we are talking about literally \ntrillions of dollars passed on to consumers through higher energy \ncosts. It is estimated those energy costs will increase anywhere from \n$30 to $500 a month.\n  In any event, the costs are dramatic, and that has two effects. One, \nthe Federal Government is going to make a massive amount of income as a \nresult of these costs. Two, the consumers, the homeowners are going to \nsee their electrical rates go up which is essentially a tax as a result \nof these costs. So the way I conceive of this is that the Federal \nGovernment is going to get a lot of new revenue, and what do we do with \nthat revenue is the first question. Secondly, what about the consumers \nwho are going to have to pay this new consumption cost through the \nincrease in the price of electricity which is essentially a consumption \ntax.\n  The bill itself that is being discussed in committee and is \nsupposedly going to be reported on the floor will take the $1.2 \ntrillion over that 10-year period and essentially spend it all, spend \nit all in a variety of ways. But a large amount of that spending would \ninvolve the expansion of Government. It would be a huge infusion of \nfunds into the Federal Treasury at the expense of the consumer who pays \nthose funds.\n  Barack Obama, who is running for President, who appears to be close \nto successful in winning his quest for the nomination, has suggested he \nwould pay for an additional $300 billion in new spending annually. He \nhas proposed over $300 billion in new spending annually. He would pay \nfor a large amount of that through generating $30 to $50 billion \nannually in taxes as a result of cap and trade. It is estimated by some \nthat that revenue to the Federal Treasury might exceed that number and \nbe actually up to $100 billion a year annually of income to the Federal \nTreasury. But Barack Obama has already suggested that we spend it on \nthe expansion of the Federal Government.\n  The bill itself proposes that it be spent on the expansion of \nGovernment as well as on various other initiatives which the bill \nsuggests we should pursue.\n  I suggest a different approach. I suggest that if we go down the path \nof cap and trade and if we end up raising well over $1 trillion over a \n10-year period from consumers, we should return those dollars to \nconsumers in some way. I believe since we are basically creating a \nconsumption tax and we are essentially shifting the burden of the \nGovernment significantly onto the user of electricity, especially the \nhomeowner, they should receive a commensurate reduction in taxes that \nthey pay in other places. It makes sense to me that if you are going to \nshift what amounts to a $1.2 trillion increase in consumption taxes, \nyou ought to take those revenues and use them to reduce income taxes to \nworking Americans by pretty much an equal amount. I believe if we did \nthat, if we took the revenue from the consumption tax and moved it over \nand reduced the income taxes so working Americans could benefit from \nthat reduction in their income taxes, you could end up dramatically \nreducing income tax rates on working Americans.\n  That should be our goal with these dollars. We should not use these \ndollars to significantly expand the size of the Federal Government. If \nwe are going to create this brandnew consumption tax in order to try to \nenergize the effort of the marketplace to control emissions which may \nbe causing global warming,\n\n[[Page S3862]]\n\nthen we ought to use the revenues which are the result of a new tax \nburden, a consumption tax burden on people using electricity, to reduce \nthe tax burden on working Americans in other places. We should not use \nit as a windfall to the Federal Government which would expand the size \nof the Federal Government and expand the size of Government. It is not \nright to do that.\n  The overall tax burden on the American people is already significant. \nIt is going to grow, regrettably, over the next few years. If we listen \nto some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, it is going \nto grow a lot. In fact, the budget that passed this Congress suggests \nit will grow by almost a trillion dollars over the next 5 years. We \ndon't need to throw on top of that increased burden of taxation, which \nAmericans are already paying, a brandnew consumption tax, the revenues \nfrom which are then taken to expand the size of the Federal Government. \nRather, let's take those revenues and put them toward a reduction in \nincome taxes. In fact, there are many people who look at tax policy and \nwould argue that this is an intelligent way to structure this, to \nbasically begin the shift from an income tax system to a consumption \ntax system is a much more efficient way for us to collect revenues and, \nsecondly, a better way to collect revenues from the standpoint of \nenergizing a strong and vibrant economy. But independent of that \nargument, which has been raging for years, whether a consumption tax \nmakes more sense than an income tax, what doesn't make sense is to \nraise consumption taxes through cap and trade by $1.2 trillion over 10 \nyears and then spend it to increase the size of Government. Let's use \nthat money to reduce the tax rate on working Americans, to reduce the \nincome tax. That should be our goal as we move forward and debate the \nissue of cap and trade and how we are going to use the revenues which \nthat bill will generate.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Louisiana and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, Senator Wicker, Senator Vitter, \nmyself, and Senator Cochran to some degree have been working for months \nliterally on this bill. It is a very important bill--as has Senator \nNelson of Florida--a very important bill to Mississippi and Louisiana \nthat felt the brunt of these last storms that we will be marking the \nthird anniversary of this August, not too far from today, and in \nSeptember for Hurricane Rita. As I was saying earlier this morning, \nthousands and thousands and thousands of homeowners are having a \ndifficult time, the causes of which are very different. In some parts \nof the country people extended debt beyond what was wise and reasonable \nand find themselves losing their homes and in some instances it is \npartly their fault.\n  In some places, some consumers had bad deals thrust at them, and \nmaybe through fraud or some other abuse they find themselves losing \ntheir homes. The people I represent didn't do either of those two \nthings. The people I represent in Louisiana and along the gulf coast \ndid nothing but basically play by the rules, have insurance if they \nwere required to, didn't have insurance when they were not required, \nfor the most part. There were some families who should have had \ninsurance who did not, but that is another subject for another day. But \nthe bulk of the people did exactly what they were supposed to do, and \nthey are still going to lose their homes because of two reasons: The \nFederal levees that should have held didn't and the insurance paradigm \nwe have established is not sufficient. That is what this bill is about.\n  To describe this in very clear graphics, I wish to put up this poster \nthat shows why we are on the floor today: $17.53 billion; that is a lot \nof money. That is why this bill is on the floor today, because we have \nto ``reform the system'' because it is obviously not working. We set up \na flood insurance program and for years it would basically break even \nbecause of the way it was structured. Then in 2004, it went into debt a \nlittle bit, $225 million. Then we went into debt a little bit more, \n$300 million, but still manageable. Then Katrina and Rita hit and the \ndebt goes up to almost $20 billion. So make no mistake about it, that \nis why this bill is on the floor. This is a taxpayer bailout of $20 \nbillion. At the same time the taxpayers are bailing out the insurance \nindustry, I wanted to show you what the insurance industry profits are. \nEverybody--some Republicans and a lot of Democrats--has been on this \nfloor talking about oil companies. I guess I can understand why oil \ncompanies are making profits, because prices are high. That is a whole \nother subject for another day. But I wonder how insurance companies can \nmake profits when you are supposed to have a record loss. I understand \nprofits when prices are high; I don't understand profits when losses \nare great. There is something wrong with this system.\n\n  So, in 2005, the insurance profits went up to $48 billion. Katrina \nand Rita hit; they don't go down. The profits go up. Because it is \nbasically a system where insurance companies just cannot lose money. \nPeople can lose money. People can lose their houses. Businesses lose \ntheir businesses. Businesses lose their contents and their markets. But \nfor some reason, in this insurance bill we are operating under, \ninsurance companies make money in the middle of a disaster. Some of my \nconstituents, including myself, would like to know how this happens.\n  As to the National Flood Insurance Program, the GAO did a report that \nsays: ``Greater Transparency and Oversight of Wind and Flood Damage \nDeterminations Are Needed.'' They just issued this report. I would say \nso, since the taxpayers are going to pick up the $20 billion bill.\n  You heard the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson. They were so \ndesperate in\n\n[[Page S3865]]\n\nFlorida, the State had to sort of insure itself, which, thank goodness, \nFlorida is big enough and maybe wealthy enough to do. It is very risky \nfor the State of Florida to do that. If they have four our five \nhurricanes in one season, like they did a couple seasons ago, it could \nbankrupt the State. I am sure this debate went on in the Florida \nLegislature. But they were so desperate, they actually had no recourse \nbecause the Federal Government will not come up with a plan that will \nwork for everyone.\n  So Florida had a choice: They could either shut down every commercial \nbusiness, shut down every homebuilder, completely stop the housing \nmarket in Florida, or they could self-insure themselves. It was a \npretty desperate situation, so Florida went ahead and did that.\n  But let me explain, Louisiana is not a rich State, and we are not a \nbig State. We cannot insure ourselves that way. If we had another \nKatrina, the whole State would go bankrupt and our kids could not go to \nuniversities, our hospitals would shut down. I know people think I am \nmaking this up, but it is the truth. We cannot assume that risk onto \nourselves, and neither can Mississippi, and I would suggest neither \ncould Alabama. Maybe California could do it, maybe New York could do \nit, maybe Texas could do it, and maybe Florida could do it because they \nare big States, but our little States would go bankrupt.\n  So our GAO says the insurance business needs some more transparency \nand oversight. I will tell you why. As shown on this chart, this is \nwhat is in the report. As you know, maybe by word of explanation, under \nthe current system--as unbelievable as this might sound--you have the \nreal estate agents who are in the private sector writing wind insurance \nfor their companies, which they can make a profit on. It is private. \nThey are writing the flood insurance policies. So it is ``write your \nown'' policy. So the same people who write the Federal, taxpayer-\nguaranteed flood program write the private program.\n  So right now--and this bill does not fix this; this bill does not do \nanything to fix this--right now, according to our own GAO, Government \nAccountability Office, which is completely neutral, not political:\n\n       In certain damage scenarios, the WYO [write your own] \n     insurer that covers a policyholder for wind losses can have a \n     vested economic interest in the outcome of the damage \n     determination that it performs when the property is subjected \n     to a combination of high winds and flooding.\n\n  Which, hello, most often happens in a hurricane. You have winds and \nwater. So it always happens that way.\n\n       In such cases, a conflict of interest exists--\n\n  Let me underline ``a conflict of interest exists''--\n\n     with the WYO insurer as it determines which damages were \n     caused by wind, to be paid by itself. . . .\n\n  So if a house is destroyed and the person comes in and says: This \nhouse was destroyed by wind 85 percent--if that is the case--then I \nhave to pay it out of my pocket. If it is actually 85 percent flood, \nthen the Government can pay it. The poor taxpayers can pick up this \ntab, so the insurance companies move their liability to the taxpayer.\n  I know, Madam President, as a former auditor, you can most certainly \nappreciate and understand this situation.\n  So it says:\n\n       In such cases, a conflict of interest exists with the WYO \n     insurer as it determines which damages were caused by wind, \n     to be paid by itself, and which damages were caused by \n     flooding, to be paid by NFIP [the National Flood Insurance \n     Program].\n\n  Which is basically the taxpayers.\n\n       Moreover, the amount WYO insurers are compensated . . .\n\n  In addition to that obvious conflict of interest, which is not \ncorrected in this bill, the insurers are compensated for servicing a \nflood claim, and it increases as the amount of the flood damage \nincreases. So their compensation, their percentage is increased. So if \nthe flood insurance is more, they get a little bit of a premium.\n  So this bill has been in committee being worked out through the House \nand Senate, it is finally on the floor, and this problem has not been \ncorrected. So that is why I offer my amendment to try to correct some \nportion of it.\n  Let me show you one of the actual transactions we have uncovered. \nThis is an actual blowup of a claim, the paperwork that was done. It \ntalks about the flood that occurred on August 29. Damage appears to be \nthe result of the general condition of flooding. The first inspection \nrevealed an exterior waterline of 15 to 20 feet, an interior waterline \nof 8 to 12 feet. Damage was extensive. It lists this.\n  That sounds wonderful and great. That is kind of what one of these \ndocuments would look like. The problem is, the adjuster who turned in \nthat document said--this is under oath in one of the court proceedings \nthat is slowly moving through the courts--``I did not put those numbers \nin there.'' ``There was no house to measure a waterline.'' ``I did not \nprepare that letter.'' ``They didn't call me about that letter.'' \n``That is the document that is sent to the Federal Government.'' This \nis an adjuster. We have blocked his name out because he would probably \nget in trouble if they knew he was sharing this information with us.\n  So, in other words, again, this is not complicated, because I know \ninsurance can be complicated. I do not really like the subject very \nmuch, but I have had to learn more about it than I care to know because \nof what we are going through.\n  But we have a system which we are getting ready to vote on right now \nthat allows the same insurance companies to write their own personal \npolicies or their own business policies, and they do the Government a \n``big favor'' by writing the flood insurance policies. They decide when \ntheir houses are destroyed, how much they have to pay out of pocket, if \nit was done by wind, or how much we have to pay if it was done by \nflood. These documents are barely ever audited, or this system is \nbarely ever audited.\n\n  When we went and checked, as shown on this chart, this was the house \nthat supposedly had a water line. Of course, you can see this address. \nThere was no house. There could not possibly have been any measurement \nbecause there are no walls to measure. So this is just an example of \nhundreds that are coming out as these court cases move forward all \nalong the gulf about the very serious problems related to the way the \nU.S. flood insurance program works.\n  Now, I know we need a flood insurance program. My State benefits \ntremendously from having one that is fair and equitable to the people \nwho are paying the premiums, to the homeowners and businesses who rely \non it. I also have an obligation to taxpayers generally in this country \nto support a program that is honest and fair. What I am suggesting is \nthat the bill we are about to vote on--which is probably why I am going \nto vote no--does not do anything to change this.\n  So I am going to put up my ``$20 billion'' sign again. This $20 \nbillion debt exists in large measure because of this system I have just \ndescribed. Now, this bill is going to pass, and magically the Federal \nGovernment is going to just absorb the $20 billion so we kind of get \nback to even. The bill, then, generally said, to make up for that, we \nare going to raise rates. But do you know on whom they raise rates? Not \non the insurance companies that have already made record profits. Do \nyou know on whom they raise rates? People who cannot afford the rates \ntoday. In the underlying bill, they can raise rates 15 percent a year \nor 25 percent a year.\n  When we ask the committee to please consider that the people of \nMississippi and Louisiana and Alabama cannot afford higher insurance \nrates, couldn't we possibly consider some kind of catastrophic plan--\nbecause we might have hurricanes, but Memphis is going to have an \nearthquake someday, and Seattle is going to have a tsunami; in 1938, a \nhurricane 5 slammed into Long Island--we are told no. We cannot even \nconsider such a thing.\n  So there are many things wrong, and I really cannot correct them. I \ntried to hold this bill up as long as I could, and everybody decided we \nneeded to have a flood insurance bill, so I said: Fine. Let the bill \ncome to the floor, but I am going to talk against it. That is what I \nplan to do.\n  So the purpose of this bill is for the taxpayers to eat $20 billion, \nto let insurance companies have record profits, and the end result is \nthe people of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana get rates raised \nevery year from now until who knows. And I am supposed to just\n\n[[Page S3866]]\n\nsit here and say this is a great bill the committee came up with?\n  So the amendment I am offering--which is not going to fix this bill, \nbut it might fix one problem with this bill--is to establish an \nombudsman.\n  Oh, and this is really ironic, what is in the underlying bill. In the \nunderlying bill, there is a provision that establishes an office to \nregister complaints. It is a flood insurance advocate section of this \nbill. If I had the section, I would read it. But in the underlying \nbill, there is a section that talks about that if anybody has a \ncomplaint, they could call a 1-800 number and complain.\n  Now, I have e-mails up to my ceiling in my office from people--not \ncomplaining, crying--not complaining, crying because they are getting \nready to lose their business or lose their house. But they could, in \nthe underlying bill, call a 1-800 number and make a complaint. But the \nlanguage is so weak and flimsy, there is really not anything they can \ndo other than complain.\n  So I have taken that section and strengthened it. That is what my \namendment does. It does not just establish a complaint counter. It \nestablishes an office that has some teeth. It establishes an \nombudsman's office. We kind of took the language from some of our IG \nlegislation which will allow the establishment of an office with some \nsignificant funding attached to it that can review and audit more \ncarefully this National Flood Insurance Program.\n  I would hope the leaders of this committee would look carefully at \nthis amendment and know that I offer it in very good faith. Again, I do \nnot believe the underlying bill, in this provision just establishing an \noffice to complain, is enough considering the gravity of the situation \nwe are dealing with.\n  I offer this amendment in good faith. I offer it with Senator Nelson \nfrom Florida as a cosponsor. It establishes an office that would \nconduct audits to ensure that only flood losses are being allocated to \nthe flood insurance program. It ensures that write-your-own insurers \nare preserving the necessary documentation to justify their payments, \nto conduct any other examinations to protect the financial integrity of \nthe program, and to prevent fraud and abuse and conflicts of interest.\n\n  Now, again, our Government Accounting Office has already established \nthere is an inherent conflict of interest in the current program. So we \nare not guessing that there might be a conflict of interest; there is a \nconflict of interest. It says so according to the GAO:\n\n       In certain damage scenarios, the insurer that covers a \n     policyholder for wind losses can have a vested economic \n     interest in the outcome of the damage determination that it \n     performs when the property is subjected to a combination of \n     high winds and flooding. A conflict of interest exists, as it \n     determines whether it says your house was damaged by wind.\n\n  So let me go ahead and pay your claim on it, or the insurer says: No, \nI think it was damaged by flood, which then the taxpayers can pay for, \nand my insurance company gets off Scot-free. And maybe, just maybe, \nthat might explain why in the worst disaster in the history of the \nUnited States, at least recently, taxpayers have to pick up $20 billion \nand insurance companies file record profits.\n  Is there anything in this underlying bill that might suggest that we \ncould watch the taxpayers' money a little more carefully? No. They put \nin an office, a 1-800 number where people might complain.\n  So instead of the 1-800 number where people might complain, I would \nlike to put in an office where, if something is wrong, people can be \ncriminally prosecuted. If there is fraud, people can be penalized with \ncivil penalties and criminal penalties.\n  I know this is very tough language, but I am not suggesting this \nparticular document suggests that there is any stealing or any crime. \nBut there is something wrong in our system of justice where somebody \ngoes into a grocery store and steals $100 and gets 3 years in jail, and \nwe have companies that--``fudge'' is the word. They didn't really use \nthe word ``steal,'' but they will fudge a little and take $20 billion \nout of the Treasury and they get nothing--not a slap on the wrist, not \na fine. The only thing that happens is the poor homeowners and \nbusinesses get increased premiums. So that is one of the things this \namendment does.\n  I hope my colleagues, whether they vote for the bill--I probably will \nnot vote for the bill unless it is amended substantially, which it may \nbe between now and the time we vote on final passage--but I hope my \ncolleagues will look very carefully at this amendment that I offer with \nSenator Nelson. It establishes basically an IG ombudsman within this \nprogram to make sure the taxpayers don't pick up another $20 billion in \ncosts.\n  I know people will say: Well, Senator Landrieu, if we don't have this \nbill, your people won't have flood insurance. Well, I understand that, \nbut our people have--we are between a rock and a hard place. We need \nflood insurance, but we need flood insurance that we can afford. We \nwould like to believe we have a flood insurance program that operates \nhonestly. I am not sure that we do. So that is what this amendment \ndoes, amendment No. 4706.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 4705, as Modified, to Amendment No. 4707\n\n  I have one final amendment to offer. If I can, I would like to send \nthe amendment, as modified, No. 4705, to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for herself, Mr. \n     Pryor, and Mrs. Lincoln, proposes an amendment numbered 4705 \n     to amendment No. 4707.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 10, strike line 3 and all that follows through page \n     10, line 16, and insert the following:\n       (c) Study on Mandatory Purchase Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall conduct \n     and submit to Congress a study assessing the impact, \n     effectiveness, and feasibility of amending the provisions of \n     the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 regarding the \n     properties that are subject to the mandatory flood insurance \n     coverage purchase requirements under such Act to extend such \n     requirements to properties located in any area that would be \n     designated as an area having special flood hazards but for \n     the existence of a structural flood protection system.\n       (2) Content of report.--In carrying out the study required \n     under paragraph (1), the Comptroller General shall \n     determine--\n       (A) the regulatory, financial and economic impacts of \n     extending the mandatory purchase requirements described under \n     paragraph (1) on the costs of homeownership, the actuarial \n     soundness of the National Flood Insurance Program, the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency, local communities, \n     insurance companies, and local land use;\n       (B) the effectiveness of extending such mandatory purchase \n     requirements in protecting homeowners from financial loss and \n     in protecting the financial soundness of the National Flood \n     Insurance Program; and\n       (C) any impact on lenders of complying with or enforcing \n     such extended mandatory requirements.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I send this amendment to the desk, \nwhich is actually on behalf of myself, Senator Lincoln, and Senator \nPryor, that addresses the mandatory coverage requirements in the \nunderlying bill. I hope my colleagues will not think again that this \nbill only affects the gulf coast because there are some provisions in \nthis bill that are going to affect the entire country.\n  One of the provisions is, it is going to be mandatory as FEMA maps \nhome and businesses located beyond levees and dams and floodwalls and \nother manmade structures into residual risk areas. Once these homes and \nbusinesses are mapped into such areas, the legislation would require \nthem to purchase flood insurance.\n  Now, levees and dams don't just exist in New Orleans, although we \nhave quite a few of them because we are a low-lying area. But we have \n14,000 miles of Federal levees throughout the country along many \nrivers. In fact, I see the Senator from North Dakota, and he himself \nhas had very significant experience with one of his towns being \ndemolished, devastated, almost completely destroyed, I think it was \nmaybe 15 years ago, when their levees broke. So he is well aware.\n  Whether you are in Michigan or Illinois or Missouri or in many places \nwhere there are levees and dams, there are 14,000 miles of Federal \nlevees, 79,000 dams, and 22 percent of all counties\n\n[[Page S3867]]\n\nand parishes have a levee. So it is one out of every four that will be \naffected by the underlying bill; that is, once FEMA finishes mapping \nthe whole United States, which they are doing and which we need to do. \nWe need to have better maps using new technology to try to determine \nwho is near sea level and who is above sea level and who is at risk. I \nhave no problem with that. But this bill will mandate that everybody \nbehind those levees pays insurance.\n  So my amendment will basically establish before that requirement goes \ninto place--and, again, it may be necessary--that there be adequate \nstudy about the issue. The amendment strikes the mandatory purchase \nrequirement. In its place, it requires the GAO to study the cost, the \nregulatory, financial, and economic impacts of extending the mandatory \npurchase on the cost of home ownership, the actuarial soundness to this \nprogram, to the local communities, insurance companies, and local land \nuse; the effectiveness of sending such a purchase requirement in \nprotecting homeowners from financial loss and protecting the financial \nsoundness of the program.\n  Now, I know this was debated in committee. I am not sure that it has \ngotten a lot of coverage, but my phone has been ringing off the hook \nfrom other Senators who are just waking up and saying: Well, Senator, I \nthought this flood insurance program only affected those places along \nthe coast, and now I am realizing this flood insurance ``reform'' bill \nis going to raise fees--not necessarily taxes but premiums--on \nthousands and thousands and thousands of homeowners and businesses \nthroughout the country.\n  We may have to do that. We may have to do that. But let's do it after \nGAO has studied and laid out what the impact and ramifications are, and \nlet's do it in a system that is fair so it is not just the homeowners \nwho have to pay premiums, the taxpayers who bail them out when there is \na problem, and insurance companies that can't lose money under the \ncurrent system. That is basically the system that we have.\n  So, again, 43 million people are affected by the underlying bill with \nthis new provision. Twenty-two percent of all counties in the country, \nand in our case parishes, have levees; 79,000 dams and 14,000 miles of \nFederal levees.\n  So these are the two amendments that I offer. This has been done in a \npackage with Senator Wicker and Senator Vitter. We have offered a \npackage of amendments trying to fix and expand wind coverage to this \nbill, to lift the coverage limits.\n  Again, a big problem with this bill is it has not kept pace with \ninflation and only covers homes valued up to $225,000. That might sound \nlike a lot, but it is not keeping pace with inflation. Our amendment \nwould lift the coverage to homes over $325,000.\n  Then my ombudsman amendment and this mandatory coverage reprieve \nwould be the other amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator would yield for \na question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The last amendment that the Senator sent to the desk, my \nunderstanding is that it is an amendment very similar to something I \nwas intending to offer, but I am not certain I understand your \namendment, so if I could just work through it with you.\n  My concern about the underlying bill with respect to the mandatory \ncoverage areas is that it requires the expansion of areas of special \nflood hazards to include areas of residual risks, including areas that \nare behind levees, dams, and other manmade structures.\n  Is your amendment designed to strike that provision?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. It doesn't strike the mapping requirement. It doesn't \nstrike the mapping requirement, but it strikes the mandatory coverage \nprovision until there is a study done about what the economic impact \nwill be to people living behind those levees and dams.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But, if I might inquire further, is it the intention of \nthe amendment to provide that there shall not be mandatory requirements \non all of these levees, dams, and other manmade structures, which the \nunderlying bill would require?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, it does. That is the intent of the amendment.\n  Madam President, there are many Senators who feel as though this is a \nvery abrupt requirement. They are not sure of what the outcome of these \npremiums might be to people who are already struggling with higher \ncosts. And because there is no estimate to my knowledge, we thought it \nwould be better to offer an amendment that would basically require a \nstudy so more discussion can be had, and then perhaps later we could \ninsist on mandatory coverage or phase it in as is appropriate. But is \nthat the Senator's concern?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I believe I looked at the amendment, and \nit does not strike what is in the underlying bill--all of section 7--\nwhich I was intending to do with my amendment. I didn't quite \nunderstand the consequences of striking just a portion of it. But if \nthe Senator from Connecticut who is on the Senate floor--when the \nSenator from Louisiana concludes, I would like to make a couple of \ncomments about the reason for my concern about this matter, and perhaps \nwe can visit. If our amendments have exactly the same impact, there is \nno reason for me to offer mine.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would be happy to. I appreciate the Senator raising \nit. I will review the way this amendment is structured. But, again, I \nwould be happy to work with the Senator so we could offer something \ntogether because there are many Senators who are concerned, and rightly \nconcerned, about this particular section.\n  If the Senator would allow me to finish, I will be happy to yield the \nfloor for further discussion because I am about ready to finish my \nremarks. There are no votes scheduled. There are other amendments that \nare going to be offered. But, again, a package has been put together by \nseveral Senators, both Republicans and Democrats.\n  I have to say again, in conclusion, I don't like the underlying bill. \nI did a great deal to keep this bill bottled up in committee for over 2 \nyears. But I have been convinced the better way to proceed is to have \nthis bill come to the floor, which is what I allowed with Senator \nVitter and Senator Wicker, as long as we can offer amendments and have \nsome time to air our grievances. The chairman of the committee and the \nranking member of the committee have been men of their word and allowed \nus to do so.\n  So at some point, Madam Chair, I would request that the Senate vote \non these amendments together as a package, but individually the one \nregarding wind, the one regarding the increased coverage, the one \nregarding the ombudsman, and the amendment regarding the mandatory \ncoverage, and then the additional coverage options. So there are five \namendments in this package that we have been working on. At some point, \nwhen that can be agreed to, we can move this bill forward.\n  In the meantime, I will be happy to work with my colleague from North \nDakota to see if the language he has suggested is the same as ours. If \nnot, perhaps we can modify our amendment to accommodate that, or \nperhaps he will offer the amendment with our acquiescence.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my friend from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I was surprised by what is section 7 in \nthe underlying bill. I understand the substitute at the desk has it on \na different page. I am talking about the same provision the Senator \nfrom Louisiana spoke about briefly; that is, an expansion of the \nrequirement to have flood insurance in areas of special flood hazards, \nto include areas of residual risk, areas that are located behind \nlevees, dams, and other manmade structures.\n  I am not surprised we want people to buy flood insurance if they are \nat risk of being flooded. That is not my point. But let me give you a \ncase study, if I might, and talk about Grand Forks, ND. Eleven years \nago--in fact 11 years ago about this time--the city of Grand Forks, ND, \na city of nearly 50,000 people, was nearly completely evacuated. It was \nthe largest evacuation of a city since the Civil War, and it was \nbecause of a flood on the Red River. It was a very significant flood; \nsome said it was a 500-year flood.\n  All of us who went to that city and spent time there and went to the \nAir Force base--a major Air Force base--15 miles west of the city and \nvisited with the citizens who had been evacuated--\n\n[[Page S3868]]\n\ntens of thousands of people--we will never forget that. So what \nhappened in the last 10 years--by the way, let me speak about the \nmemory of not only a city being flooded and evacuated, but in the \nmiddle of that city there was a raging fire. So there is a flood, and \nthen buildings in the middle of the city that are inundated by water \ncaught fire, and there was a major fire in the middle of the city. To \nwatch firefighters work in a flood to try to see if they can't, in the \nmiddle of a significant city, put out a fire that is consuming a number \nof businesses in the downtown district is quite extraordinary.\n  Fast forward 10 years, and I think we have spent close to $400 \nmillion over a decade to provide unbelievable flood protection for that \ncity. That is not going to happen again. There is a flood protection \nplan in place for that city that is very significant. That flood \nprotection plan protects against a 250-year flood. The provisions in \nthis bill talk about a 100-year flood. We have now flood protection for \na 250-year flood. It is blue ribbon, first rate, brandnew flood \nprotection for this city. So it is a little surprising to me to see a \nbill that says, by the way, we have just finished spending a lot of \nmoney to provide very significant 250-year flood protection and now we \nhave one other decision; we want you to understand you should now buy \nflood insurance. It is only $1 a day, $300 or $400 a year, they say.\n  That is going to be pretty surprising to a lot of people who are \nstill paying debts to fix up their houses from 10 or 11 years ago from \nthat flood. They are going to ask the question: Why are we asked to buy \nflood insurance when you have built a very significant flood protection \nplan, with 250-year flood protection for our city, and now you say to \nus we all should go buy flood insurance. Are you daft? What are you \nthinking of? They would not understand this. I am trying to figure out \nwhat the requirement is.\n  I understand there are some manmade levees and dams and other \ncircumstances that perhaps have risk attached to them, which are old \nstructures. I understand that. There are some circumstances where those \nwho take a look at this believe that more should participate in the \nflood insurance program. I understand all that. But to simply say that \nin every circumstance, including areas located behind levees, dams, and \nother manmade structures, everybody should have flood insurance, that \ndoesn't make any sense to me.\n  I don't know how you explain that to somebody who was told we \ncompleted a terrific flood protection program that gives you a 250-year \nflood protection, but you need to pony up some money to buy new flood \ninsurance. I think this is not a good provision, and I hope we will be \nable to remove it.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I don't know how this will be resolved. I certainly can \nappreciate that, and I agree with the Senator, because one size doesn't \nfit all, which has been part of the problem with this bill--that it is \npushing everyone into a one-size-fits-all requirement. It is not the \nappropriate response to our situation. I hope the Senator will consider \neither modifying the amendment I have laid down, or I would be happy to \nactually support a narrower amendment that any communities that can \nestablish that they have created protection that is over and above the \naverage, which is 100-year flood protection, might not be subject to \nthis requirement.\n  As the Senator knows--because he is chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee that funds levees in the country, so he most certainly is one \nof the leading experts--the standard in America right now is not \nsufficient, and it is 1 storm out of 100. Very few communities can \nboast of being as protected as his community can. I suggest that most \ncertainly I would not object as the main author of the amendment, but \nthere are several cosponsors. I am sure we could work something out.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, in my subcommittee that I chair on \nappropriations, dealing with energy and matter, we spent $2.2 billion \non Corps of Engineers construction alone, to say nothing of \nmaintenance, remediation, and other expenses. Just the construction in \nfiscal year 2008 was $2.244 billion. So we are spending a lot of money \nworking on levees and dikes and other areas of protection. It seems to \nme--my colleague from Connecticut indicated this and he is absolutely \ncorrect--levees do fail, and I understand that. He is absolutely \ncorrect about that. Levees do fail. Manmade structures, from time to \ntime, will fail. But it is also the case that some risks are \nsubstantially lowered, and there are some risks that are substantially \nelevated because of the condition of the levy and so on. My colleague \nfrom Louisiana is correct when she says let's not do something that is \none size fits all.\n  Again, I will use the example I think is clear. If you just finished \na new flood control program that you have worked on for 10 years with a \n250-year flood protection, which is more than double the protection \nnormally required to protect against a 100-year flood, at least \nunderstand the difference between what you have done there with public \nfunding and what might exist somewhere else, where there is higher \nrisk. It is hard to tell somebody, by the way, you have a new flood \ncontrol plan, it works, it is terrific and it is new and it costs a lot \nof money; it will protect you against a 250-year flood, but you must \nbuy some flood insurance, please, because we are worried that you are \ngoing to be hit by a 100-year flood. That is the kind of thing I hope \nwe can avoid.\n\n  Earlier, I used a word I don't ever use. I don't know why I used it. \nI used the word ``daft.'' I wasn't applying it to anybody who wrote \nthis legislation. I should quickly explain that.\n  It appears to me that, if this would pass, we may have to explain to \nsome people something that is not able to be explained. You now have \nterrific flood protection, but we want you to buy flood insurance, even \nthough we protected you with public funding, with a first-class flood \nprotection system. It is not difficult for me to go to someone in a \ncircumstance where there is risk and say I understand why you have to \nhave flood insurance. You have to have a large number of people paying \nin. You have risk and you are going to have to buy flood insurance. I \nunderstand that.\n  The Senator is correct that sometimes levees do fail. We should not, \nit seems to me, with this small section in the bill, on page 9, \nsubsection 2, under (b), we should not say, anyplace in America where \nyou have a levee, a dam, a manmade structure, you are all in the same \nboat. That is not the right thing for us to do.\n  I hope that with the concurrence of the Senator from Connecticut, \nperhaps, we can talk through this as we move along and make some \nchanges to that, which are thoughtful and address the issue of risk.\n  I thank my colleague from Louisiana, and I thank my colleague from \nConnecticut for his patience. As I conclude, I am going to visit with \nthe Senator from Louisiana to see whether my amendment is sufficiently \nsimilar to hers so maybe we can deal with one amendment. If so, I will \nnot add my amendment. I have filed it, but I will not call it up. If it \nis not sufficiently similar, I will call up my amendment later today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, now we have had five amendments that will \nbe pending at some point. At an appropriate time, after my colleague \nfrom Alabama arrives, in consultation with others and with the \nleadership, we will work out a time when we may have consideration of \nthese amendments and have votes. Many Members are curious about votes \nthis evening. We would like to give a clear indication of when the \nvotes are likely to occur. Let me take a few minutes and respond.\n  First of all, all of us in this Chamber, including myself, have \nexpressed ourselves over the years in terms of what has happened when \npeople have been devastated by natural disasters, including those in \nthe gulf area. I have traveled down there reviewing the area and seeing \nwhat happened. We all care deeply about what happened to people in the \nGulf State areas, in terms of the devastation that occurred. Let me \npoint out quickly that is not the debate, in the sense whether we \nunderstand it. It is what we can do about it.\n  The bulk of this legislation, as presently written--it is a given \nthat most of the 5.5 million properties that are going to be covered \nare in the Gulf State areas. FEMA borrowed money\n\n[[Page S3869]]\n\nfrom the Federal Government to pay the $17 billion in claims. The flood \ninsurance program generates about $2.5 billion each year as a result of \npremiums as part of the fund, and about $1 billion of that goes to \nadministrative costs. There might be a legitimate amendment as to why \nthere is so much administration in that program. That is how it breaks \ndown. You are left with $1.5 billion to cover this. As a result of \nnatural disasters and floods, here we are left with a debt of $17 \nbillion, which FEMA owes to the Federal Government. In the process of \npaying that debt, they are increasing the premium costs, unless we take \naction. So you can have a choice. We can drop the bill, basically--\ndefeat it, as some suggested, who may vote against it--in which case \nthe very people we are concerned about are going to end up with a \nlarger cost because somebody has to pay that debt. That is a bailout \notherwise, if we don't do something about it. So the idea is, how do \nyou do that?\n  The major thrust of the bill is to forgive that debt, take it off the \nbooks, so the people who pay these premiums will not have a surcharge \nadded to their costs to meet that obligation. That is the fundamental \npurpose of the bill, to forgive that $17 billion, which otherwise \nbecomes a cost to the very people paying the premiums. So I began the \ndiscussion by saying the thrust of this bill was to do that.\n  The second part--Senator Nelson has it exactly right, the author of \nthe second part. He came to the committee a number of months ago and \nasked to include a commission to deal with catastrophic natural \ndisasters. There is a significant debate as to how to handle this. A \nsignificant percentage of our population lives within 100 miles of the \ncoast of the United States. Obviously, there are natural disasters that \noccur inland as well. But how we deal with catastrophic costs, how we \nset up the mechanism to deal with it is a significant debate, with \nhardly unanimity around it. Rather than trying to pretend that one \ncommittee can solve all that, Senator Nelson suggested a commission \nmade up of people who would bring knowledge about all this and report \nback to us in 9 months their recommendations as to how we might deal \nwith catastrophic disasters that occur in our country.\n  That is the second part of this bill. There are a lot of other ideas. \nI addressed some of them earlier--wind issues and the like. I don't \nargue about the legitimacy of the issue. The question is, we have a \nresponsibility to be actuarially sound. I know that is not something we \nhave a great reputation on, but we try to do that occasionally, to \ninsist upon having a system that will allow us to collect revenue, pay \nfor a program, keep the costs down, and cover the kind of catastrophe \npeople face.\n  Our bill does a number of things that are more than just vague \nterminology in dealing with the insurance industry. I, for one, believe \nwe ought to do more in this area to try to get greater accountability. \nThat is not an issue for debating here.\n  Let me mention some things we have included in the bill before we \naccept the notion that nothing is here at all. No. 1, in the program we \nrequire the insurance companies to participate in State-sponsored \nmediation.\n  We require the insurance industry to submit all data on costs to \noperate this program and require FEMA to conduct rulemaking so the \ninsurance companies are only paid for actual costs.\n  We created a flood advocate to help consumers who have problems with \nthe flood program so they can have direct access to it. That was one of \nthe major problems a few years ago.\n  We also direct FEMA to collect information from the insurance \nindustry on claims where there is both wind and flood damage. I might \nadd, this gets exactly at the problems raised by our colleagues from \nLouisiana and the other gulf State areas. FEMA will now be required to \nlook at how insurance companies are dividing damages to ensure that \ncompanies are not improperly shifting costs to the Federal flood \nprogram.\n  I know others may want to add other things. But to suggest we did \nnothing to require greater accountability is not to be terribly honest \nabout what is in this bill. Obviously, there are those who would like \nto get rid of the industry altogether and maybe just have a Federal \nprogram where FEMA becomes an insurance company. That is an option, if \npeople want to do it. I don't know there is a will here to do it, but \nthat is one option.\n  There is no requirement in law that an industry provide this kind of \ncoverage. You have to be somewhat careful that if you become so onerous \nin your requirements or your indictment of them that getting these very \ncompanies to write the policies becomes harder. If they don't write the \npolicies, who does? Does the Federal Government then become an \ninsurance company? I don't think there is a will to do that. Maybe \nthere are some who would like to.\n  Before you decide to beat this horse into oblivion, be careful about \nhow far you go. If you do it to such a degree there is no one there to \nwrite the programs to begin with, we may find ourselves in deeper \ntrouble. But to say they ought to be able to do exactly as they want to \ndo, and not be mindful of some of the egregious examples my colleague \nfrom Louisiana referred to, would also be wrong.\n  In this bill we tried to identify some specific areas that were the \nsubject of hearings that informed us where there were matters clearly \nthe industry and those responsible for overseeing them could demand \nmore and get more out of them.\n  I believe we have done a good job in this bill on those issues. Could \nyou add some more things? I am not going to argue that. We did try to \ndo our best. Again, we had a unanimous vote in our committee after \nsignificant debate on this bill. But the idea of having an ombudsman \ngoing in and basically drawing a conclusion about things before \nactually determining it--be careful what you wish for. If in fact we \ndon't end up with people coming in to provide the coverage, we could \nfind ourselves in even worse shape than we are in today. I invite my \ncolleagues to look at the legislation and the specific provisions I \njust mentioned that we have included in the legislation to require \ngreater accountability out of the industry.\n  Now let me address the second point, and that is the mandatory \nrequirement that people within certain high-risk areas be required to \npay some premiums. I ask my colleagues to think about the consequences \nof this amendment should we strike the portion of the bill that \nrequires people who live in areas behind levees or downstream of dams \nto purchase flood insurance. Currently, home and business owners in \nthese residual risk areas, as they are called, are at great risk of \nflooding. There are over 122 levees and dams that have already been \ncategorized as weak, failing.\n  With all due respect to my colleague from North Dakota--and I have \nbeen to his community where these problems exist--these manmade \nprojects do not always work. So the fact that taxpayers in Connecticut \nand elsewhere have paid to build them is a good thing. Maybe we ought \nto be talking about how those costs of premiums ought to reflect the \nquality of the levee or the dam that has been built in those areas. But \nto suggest somehow that since we built the levee anybody living in that \nresidual risk area should not assume any responsibility if it breaks \ndown is maybe going to far.\n  Let me tell you what we are talking about. Most cost less than $1 a \nday to cover this. What you get for that is roughly $250,000 to cover \nstructures and $100,000 to cover the contents. That is $350,000 in most \ncases for less than a dollar a day, for living in a residually high-\nrisk area where a levee or dam exists. This idea somehow that we all \ncan get our levees built and dams built and we bear no other \nresponsibility for trying to cover against those risks and the costs, \nwhen they occur, if that levee or dam breaks and it gets flooded out \nand there is no insurance requirement in those areas--who pays for that \ndamage? Again, we are right back here draining the Treasury instead of \nrequiring an insurance program. A dollar a day for roughly 350,000 \ndollars' worth of coverage, I do not think that is overly burdensome.\n  I know people don't like any additional cost. But if you are asking \nme to craft a program that is actuarially sound, that allows us to \nbuild up that fund so we do not have to drain the Treasury or forgive a \ndebt that is now\n\n[[Page S3870]]\n\nowed by FEMA to the National Government, then requiring some \nresponsibility--I have it in my own State of Connecticut. The \nConnecticut River in Hartford, we have a huge levee, a dam there. I \ncertainly think my constituents who live along that have to pay \nsomething. They made the choice to be there. Some don't make the \nchoice. They live there. But asking for less than $1 a day for over \n$350,000 in coverage for structure and contents in order to bear some \nresponsibility--Lord forbid it breaks down--I don't see that as being \noverly burdensome, as some would suggest.\n  What percentage of problems occur in this area? We are told here--\nagain, I am relying on data that has been given to us--we all know that \ndams fail, levees fail. What better evidence than what happened to our \ncolleagues from Louisiana, the failure of the levees and the problems \nthat ensued from it. I will provide the lists and put them in the \nrecord of the 122 levees we know are failing today. One percent of all \nflood policies are outside the 100-year floodplain, many of these in \nresidual risk areas. This 1 percent of policies accounts for 25 percent \nof flood claims. Let me repeat that. One percent of the policies \naccounts for 25 percent of the flood claims. So 1 percent of policies \nnot currently in mandatory purchase areas are responsible for 25 \npercent of all the claims that come in--one-quarter of them.\n  You could just persist in this and say we are not going to have \nanybody pay anything at all. Yet 25 percent of the entire fund is going \noff to provide coverage in areas where, again--it is only 1 percent of \nthe policies that are being written. Clearly, the risks outside the \n100-year floodplain are significant--25 percent of all claims are \ncoming from them, despite the dams and the levees we have here. We \nshould ensure that adequate insurance coverage for all homes and \nbusinesses in these risky areas are covered. That is what we are trying \nto do.\n  Flood insurance should not be viewed as punitive. It is a cost to \ninsure against a known risk. Flood insurance premiums for homeowners in \nthese residual risk areas are not prohibitively expensive. The maximum \namount of coverage--$250,000 for structures and $100,000 for contents--\nwill cost less than $1 a day. That is the maximum insurance. For a \nmajority of people, the cost will be much less, less than $1 a day to \nensure a family can rebuild from a flood.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to look at recent experiences in New Orleans, as \nwell as the recent flooding in Missouri along the Black River, in \nNevada near Reno, and in Lake County, IN. These are just a few \nexamples, but each caused devastation when levees did not provide the \nneeded protection.\n  I also ask my colleagues to look at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nreview of levees last year. That review identified 122 levees at risk \nof failure in the country. Surely, people who believe they are \nprotected should know of their risks and should carry affordable \ninsurance to hedge against those kinds of devastating events that occur \neven when significant efforts have been made to protect people in those \nareas.\n  No one likes to vote for something where you have to have a fee \ncharged. We bear the responsibility of having a program that works, \nthat is actuarially sound, that makes a difference, that doesn't put us \nin a position of having to constantly bail out--in this case FEMA--as a \nresult of these claims coming in. If there were a way of doing this \nwhere I could wave a magic wand and no one would have to pay a nickel \nand somehow this would all be done by someone else, I would love to \nachieve that. But miracles do not exist when it comes to costs. We \ntried to minimize those costs and have a good program that doesn't \ndrain the Treasury and doesn't expose all taxpayers to these costs and \nasks people to contribute in some degree to get the kind of protection \nwe are looking for. That is what we have designed.\n  If this bill fails--and there are those recommending by their vote it \nought to fail--then those premiums are going to go up, and the very \npeople we are talking about bear a tremendous financial burden. In the \nabsence of this bill, they will pay a tremendous amount to pay off that \ndebt to FEMA. It is not a free charge unless we take action to excuse \nthat obligation.\n  Then, second, that commission to examine these other very important \nissues, and then the provisions in this bill itself to achieve greater \naccountability within the insurance industry--that is why this bill \npassed unanimously out of the committee, Democrats and Republicans, \npeople from coastal States and noncoastal States working together to \ncraft the legislation that Senator Shelby and I put together.\n  I realize we are not going to write something that everybody agrees \nwith every dotted i and crossed t. That is beyond my capabilities. What \nyou have asked me to do as chairman of the committee, with Senator \nShelby, is craft a bill that will allow people to have reasonable \ncosts, get some real help and relief, protect against these kinds of \nproblems that are obviously going to occur again, but this time we will \nhave done something about it ahead of time instead of waiting for it to \nhappen and be back here again trying to come up with some supplemental \nappropriation where billions of dollars are being asked for out of the \nFederal Treasury to pay for the damages that might have otherwise been \npaid for under an intelligent insurance program, balanced and sound.\n  I apologize if I can't make everybody happy with this bill, but we \ndid our very best to craft legislation that I think accommodates the \nfundamental points.\n  If you want me to craft legislation that allows money to be spent and \nno one has to pay a nickel for it, you are going to have to find \nsomeone else. I can't do that for you. I have a proposal of less than \n$1 a day for 350,000 dollars' worth of coverage. I do not believe that \nis unreasonable for people living in residual risk areas, particularly \nwhere 25 percent of the claims are coming out of those areas where only \n1 percent of the policies are being provided for.\n  With that, at the appropriate time we would like to have some votes \non these amendments. I will be urging my colleague to reject these \namendments. I appreciate the intentions behind those who offer them, \nbut in good conscience we need to pass a bill that can make some sense, \nbecome the law of the land, and provide some protection we are seeking \nwith this legislation.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the list of levees of \nmaintenance concern be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS LEVEES OF MAINTENANCE CONCERN, FEBRUARY 1, 2007\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           District                  Project Name           Segment Name            State             City\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDetroit.......................

No. 8.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3872]]\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4706\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment offered by Senator Landrieu, my friend from Louisiana, which \nwould allow the mandatory purchase provision for areas behind levees \nand dams to be eliminated.\n  Currently, the flood insurance program suffers from a $17 billion \ndeficit, mostly as a result of payments made to individuals living \nbehind manmade structures such as levees and dams.\n  The fact that people behind manmade flood protections do not have to \npurchase flood insurance clearly sends the wrong message. As we all \nknow now, flood protections sometimes fail. Telling people they need \nnot protect themselves from the risks associated with those failures \nprovides a false sense of security.\n  Keep in mind that all of these individuals will be required to pay a \nrate that reflects the risk associated with living behind flood \nmitigation devices. Currently the rates behind many of these structures \nwould suggest an individual homeowner would pay approximately $316 for \ncoverage up to $350,000. That is less than $1 per day for full flood \nprotection; $1 dollar a day. This bill eliminates the entire debt \nassociated with this program that is owed to the Federal Government, \nbut it also demands that in the future people begin to pay a fair price \nfor the risk associated with living in high-risk areas.\n  This amendment would require that we undertake a study as to the \neffect of requiring insurance behind manmade structures. I believe we \nhave learned all we need to know about the risk associated with living \nbehind manmade flood protection devices.\n  The insurance premium takes into account the real risk properties \nface. Levees fail. They fail all the time. They do not eliminate all \nrisk. Flood insurance protects people against unforeseen risk.\n  These amendments do not recognize that fact. A prudent course is \nrisk-based premiums for everyone at risk. I strongly oppose this \namendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes on the \nbill itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I wish to speak about the flood insurance bill before \nthe Senate and about the program in general.\n  The flood insurance program is one I care about a great deal. It is \nvitally important to States such as Kentucky that are surrounded and \ncrossed by major rivers and exposed to flooding.\n  In 2004, former Senator Sarbanes, Senator Shelby, and I sat down to \nmake some important changes to the program and we did. My bill was a \nstep in the right direction for fixing the program. Our reforms \nestablished a mitigation program to reduce further losses, charge \nhigher premiums if property owners refused to reduce their risk.\n  Unfortunately, we were not able to address all of the problems in the \nbill, but I am glad some of the things we wanted to do back then are \nbeing done in this bill before us today.\n  As we saw from the storms of 2005, the flood insurance program is not \nfinancially sound. This bill builds on the reforms of the 2004 law by \nending the subsidy for the most costly and least deserving properties. \nIt requires more at-risk people to purchase flood insurance, and \nincreases penalties on the lenders for not following the law.\n  It also sets up a reserve fund to keep the program from going into \ndebt in future years with significant flood losses. This bill does not \nfix all of the problems in the program, but it is a strong bill which I \nsupport. While I do not like forgiving the program's debt, it is a \nnecessary step to stop policyholders in Kentucky and across this \ncountry from having to foot the bill for the gulf coast's problems.\n  Every Senator should think about that $18 billion we are forgiving \nwhen they consider the additional cost of amendments being offered. We \nhave 40 years of experience that says the Government is a terrible \ninsurance company. Adding wind insurance will drive out private \ninsurers and put the taxpayers throughout the entire country on the \nhook for the risks taken by those who choose to live in the path of \nhurricanes.\n  The sponsors of the amendment claim premiums will reflect the actual \nrisk, but I would point out to them the 18 billion reasons why I do not \nbelieve that will happen. Several other amendments are worth \nmentioning. One would create a Federal backstop for State disaster \ninsurance funds. I understand why the Gulf Coast States would want a \nFederal backstop for the risk, but I do not understand why my State or \nanyone else's State should be put on the hook for the decisions of \ncoastal State legislators who choose to socialize insurance.\n  Other amendments would increase coverage limits or decrease the \namount policyholders would have to pay. One would even make a certain \nearmark for an area in Illinois for lower premiums. Those amendments \nwould defeat the entire purpose of this bill. Instead of making the \nprogram more financially sound, they would make the current problems \nworse by charging policyholders less than their actual risk.\n  After some version of this bill becomes law, we will have to keep an \neye on how FEMA acts on these reforms. It took FEMA more than 2 years \nto implement some of the 2004 reforms, and they did that only after the \nVice President and the Secretary of Homeland Security intervened. We \nmust make sure the program is run the way Congress intended, not as the \nbureaucrats think it should be run.\n  I congratulate Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby and their staffs for \nwriting a good bill. I also thank former Senator Sarbanes for his help \nin writing the 2004 bill and setting the foundation for this bill \ntoday.\n  Finally, I wish to say I am glad Senator McConnell has brought up the \nimportant issue of energy. The American people are watching gas prices \ngo through the roof, and this summer electric bills are going to do the \nsame. I have heard the other side talk about energy before, but I have \nnot seen them do one thing about the problem. The problem is, we do not \nhave enough supply. The solution is expanding domestic production of \nenergy any way we can. We can drill for oil safely in Alaska, we can \nget more natural gas from the Gulf of Mexico.\n  But beyond the usual ways to increase production, we can use new \ntechnologies to change the game for energy prices. That is why I have \nsupported and will keep pushing coal-to-liquid fuels. We are sitting on \nhundreds of years' worth of coal, and through a proven and \nenvironmentally sound process, we can turn that coal into gasoline for \nour cars, diesel for our trucks, and jet fuel for our planes.\n  I have met with the Air Force many times. This is one of the most \nimportant security issues they face. We cannot rely on Middle Eastern \noil to provide fuel for our jet fighters and our tanks. With secure \ndomestic alternative fuels, we can guarantee the military the fuel they \nneed.\n  The American people deserve a Congress that takes action. Every \nbarrel of fuel made in America is a barrel of fuel we do not have to \nbuy from the Middle East. Increasing production of energy in America \nwill bring down energy costs and protect jobs.\n  For too long we have heard about manufacturers and companies moving \ngood-paying jobs to China or the Middle East because of cheap energy. \nToday, with this package we can do something about it. We can give \nAmerican companies the energy they need to build cars, fly planes, and \nproduce goods with American workers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What are we on \nnow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering amendment No. 4705 \noffered by Senator Landrieu.\n\n\n                     American Energy Production Act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have been setting aside the pending amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I plan to speak for about 15 or 20 minutes here, for \nthose who might be interested.\n  I rise not to talk about the work that has been done by the committee \non\n\n[[Page S3873]]\n\nflood insurance, although it is obvious that is important, and they \nhave done a great job and we ought to be finding our way through that \nthicket before too long. But attached to that bill, for the purpose of \nmaking an issue and seeing to it that we give everybody in this body an \nopportunity to vote for the production of more American energy for the \nAmerican people, for the automobiles that drive on our streets, the \ntrucks that drive on our streets, the airplanes, both domestic and \nmilitary, that fly, and all other sources of energy, we are going to \nhave a chance to vote on whether we want to produce more energy which \nwe now import, either crude oil or crude oil products or substitute \nproducts that can be produced in the United States. Do we want to do \nthat?\n  The Democrats today had a press conference after we have been talking \nabout this bill that we call the American Energy Production Act, and \nthey are talking about what they might want to do. I regret I cannot \ntalk in detail about what they propose, but I will say I will be very \nsurprised if the sum total of their suggestions produces one new barrel \nof oil or one cubic foot of natural gas, one cubic foot of American-\nproduced natural gas, because it seems to me they are too busy trying \nto find out what they can do to the oil companies of the United States \nand windfall profits and those kinds of things.\n  But we are going to give everyone this opportunity, an opportunity to \ntake a look at some very simple propositions that could yield large \nquantities of crude oil, natural gas, derivatives of coal that can be \nused in trucks, diesel fuel in airplanes, for military and the domestic \nairplanes.\n  I want to suggest the following: Last week I introduced a bill which \nwould fundamentally change America's reliance upon foreign oil in a \nshorter time period than I have seen of any proposal thus far.\n  The American Energy Production Act is cosponsored by 19 of my \ncolleagues and would produce a minimum of 24 billion barrels of \nAmerican oil. Americans, in my opinion, are sick and tired of such high \nprices for gasoline, and unless we take action, the situation is going \nto only get worse. One can talk all one wants about why it is, but the \nbiggest reason the price is going up and continues up--and we do not \neven know where it will stop--is because the demand for crude oil in \nthe world is getting bigger than the production of crude oil in the \nworld. So supply and demand is principally the reason for the \nincreasing cost of crude oil.\n  There may be other things we have to do, but essentially the only way \nto alter that rising price and cause it to come down and, thus, give \nthe American people some relief is to produce more crude oil and \nderivatives of coal and otherwise that we can use to take the place of \ncrude oil products. So if the American people are sick and tired of \npaying high prices and want to know what can be done, we are telling \nthem we think it is time we face up to the fact that we can produce \nmuch more in America. But for some reason, we have decided to vote no \non some very imposing and powerful supply sources. It is time we take \nanother look at those, especially with crude oil at $120 a barrel and \nrising.\n  What we have done is looked around at what we have refused to do in \nthe past, new things we could do that would accomplish what I have \nsuggested. Congress has made a great deal of progress already in \npromoting conservation and developing renewable energy technology such \nas wind and solar. I am for doing more of those, if we can and when we \nare ready. I stand ready to work on those. I have been leading the \ncharge on those fronts as either chairman of the Energy Committee or \nranking member. I believe we should develop all our energy sources as \nsoon as we can.\n  The bottom line is that America is not going to stop using oil in the \nnear term, so we need to take action to make sure the oil we do use is \nproduced domestically, all of it we can, rather than coming from \nunstable regions. Congress has not done such a good job in this area. \nIn fact, almost every time we have tried to boost domestic production, \nDemocrats--mostly Democrats--have blocked our efforts. But with oil now \nat $122 a barrel and rising, I implore my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle to rethink their position. Times have changed. Now \nAmerica's response needs to change as well.\n  The American Energy Production Act, which is an amendment on this \nbill, which I indicated we will vote on one way or another before this \nbill is finished, is an excellent place to start. The bill allows for \nStates on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to petition the Federal \nGovernment to opt out of a broad moratorium that for two decades has \nlocked up America's assets and forced us to turn to unstable foreign \nnations to power our lives.\n  Together, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans contain oil reserves of up \nto 14 billion barrels, and that is a minimum. We know it is a minimum, \nand we have not been allowed to spend the money to do an in-depth \nevaluation which I believe would show much more. The reserves of \nnatural gas are thought to be 55 trillion cubic feet. These regions \ncontain substantially more oil and gas than the areas we opened in 2006 \nin the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. The area that is left, that \nwe had this moratorium on for more than 20 years, is much bigger than \nthe area we opened as part of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, \nmuch bigger, much larger space, and much more in reserves.\n  This legislation also opens 2,000 of the 19 million acres of the \nArctic Plain of ANWR for oil and gas leasing.\n  Over the past week, I have heard Members from the other side of the \naisle say that ANWR won't help because it will take 8 to 10 years to \nbring it on line. That is the same thing they have been saying for two \ndecades. Had we acted when we had a chance, we would have 1 million \nbarrels of oil a day available to us, oil that we are now forced to buy \noverseas.\n  I heard a Member of the Senate from the other side of the aisle, the \nSenator from New York--the Senator from New York who is not running for \nPresident--say that if we could get the OPEC cartel to just add 500,000 \nbarrels of production, it would have a big impact on bringing down the \nprice of oil. If that is the case, if we had a million barrels of oil a \nday coming from ANWR, that surely would do as much or more. It would \nbring down the price just as well, if not more than the Senator was \nspeaking of from oil the cartel would produce. That is because it is a \nsupply-demand situation he is talking about. ANWR would yield more than \nthe 500,000 barrels to which he alluded.\n  Additionally, even after revenue sharing, ANWR oil could bring over \n$2 billion to our Federal Treasury annually. It is past time that we \nstarted producing our own oil and generating revenues for our own \nGovernment instead of buying foreign oil and sending billions of \ndollars to unstable, unfriendly regimes.\n  The Republican bill I have talked about also makes it easier to build \nrefineries. We haven't built a new refinery for 30 years, and our \nNation cannot afford to go 30 more years without doing so. We provide \nsome incentives and some very natural ways to cause that to happen.\n  While I have resisted calls to suspend filling the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve in the past, I have indicated to the chairman of the \nsubcommittee on which I serve, the Energy and Water Committee, I have \ntold the Senator who is promoting discontinuing filling of the SPR for \n6 months to a year, providing 70,000 additional barrels of light sweet \ncrude a day to the marketplace, that I would support him on that at \nthis time because the price of oil is so high that it is worth doing. \nThat is in this bill. By its very nature, this 70,000 barrels from SPR \nis just a fraction of the oil that would be gained through the OCS \nproduction and ANWR production, but in today's environment every small \namount helps.\n  In the area of alternative resources, this bill requires studies on \nethanol to help ensure that smart decisions are made as we move toward \ncellulosic and other advanced biofuels. This bill also provides \nincentives for the advancement of breakthrough energy technologies such \nas battery-powered vehicles. That is necessary and something we could \ndo. It is ready and right.\n  It is also important to mention that this bill will promote the use \nof coal-to-liquids technologies, as long as it results in no more \ngreenhouse gases than the fuels we are already using. Bringing 6 \nbillion gallons of this fuel to market, if we started immediately \nworking\n\n[[Page S3874]]\n\non it, could be done quickly. They are already doing it in South \nAfrica. It would reduce our projected imports by 4 percent by the year \n2022. The coal-to-liquids mandate is just one-sixth the size of the \nethanol mandate placed into law last year. To push the coal-to-liquids \ntechnology, we must send a signal to the marketplace that America is \nserious about using some of its abundant, reliable American energy \nresource--coal.\n  In addition, this bill repeals the moratorium on oil shale \nregulations that was put into an omnibus appropriations bill in the \ndark of night, when those of us who had been involved were not around \nand could not object. The shale beneath our Western States amounts to \nthree times the conventional oil reserves in Saudi Arabia. We need to \naccelerate this project's resources and repeal the $4,000 fee for \ndrilling permits which hit America's smallest family-owned oil and gas \ncompanies the hardest. This, too, was done in an appropriations rider. \nIt is time to take it off, while we talk about producing more rather \nthan less. We don't need more taxes and fees on American producers if \nwe want to produce more.\n  It is my sincere hope that we can act soon on this measure. I have \nnot talked about every provision, but they all are directed at \nproducing more energy rather than directed at more attacks against \nenergy companies and those things included in today's proposal by the \nDemocratic leadership.\n  The United States needs to send a message to the marketplace, to \nOPEC, and to consumers that we will no longer continue to let billions \nof barrels of oil sit underground within our own domain while the price \nat the pump goes up and up. We must end the cycle of dependence and the \nflow of money overseas for foreign oil. We must do it as quickly as \npossible. If we can do it now, we should do it now.\n  I thank the Republican leader for bringing up this important issue. I \nurge my colleagues to think about it and ultimately to support it. What \na message it would send.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am about to make a unanimous consent \nrequest dealing with a series of amendments we are going to vote on. \nThen following my unanimous consent request, I know the Senator from \nAlabama would like to be recognized. I ask unanimous consent that he be \nrecognized at the conclusion of my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 6 p.m., the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relation to the following amendments: \nWicker amendment No. 4719; Vitter amendment No. 4722; Vitter amendment \nNo. 4723; Landrieu amendment No. 4705, as modified further; further, I \nask that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to each \nvote and that there be no second-degree amendments in order prior to \nthe votes. Finally, I ask consent that the first vote be a 15-minute \nrollcall vote and the remaining votes be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair and my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). Under the previous order, the \njunior Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see Senator Thune, who wanted to have \n4 minutes to file an amendment. I ask unanimous consent that he be \nrecognized when I finish my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I so much appreciate the remarks of \nSenator Domenici. He has given his career in the Senate to dealing with \nenergy issues. There is no one here who is more deeply steeped in those \nissues and the history of how we got here and how we could be in better \nshape today than Senator Domenici. We don't want to be in a blame game. \nWe don't want to be saying, ``I told you so.'' In fact, I will admit \nthat I have made decisions, when the price of a barrel of oil was $30 \nand $40. It is different when it is now $120, as the Senator from New \nMexico pointed out. We are facing a crisis, and we need to do some \nthings. We don't need to do a piece of legislation that is pending on \nthis floor, that came out of the EPW Committee, that not only won't \nhelp us deal with our crisis in energy but will actually surge the cost \nof energy, which is the only big piece of legislation I know relevant \nto the question that is now pending, other than legislation Senator \nDomenici offered.\n  Gas today is over $3.60 a gallon. That is well over what it was 2 \nyears ago. People are spending $60 to fill up with a tank of gas. The \naverage family who has two cars is spending no doubt $50 to $100 more a \nmonth for the same amount of gasoline they were purchasing the previous \nfew years. It is an enormous cost to that family. It is an impediment \nto economic vitality. It is a very significant, if not the most \nsignificant, factor in the economic slowdown we are dealing with. \nElectricity also will be going up. One expert has said that we could \nbasically be seeing a $100-a-month increase in the average family's \nelectricity bill. If we pass this cap-and-trade bill, it will be a lot \nmore than that. Diesel priced fuel is up--too high, in my view. I can't \nunderstand why it is consistently 60 cents more per gallon than regular \ngasoline. An airline official told me not long ago that jet fuel is \ndouble.\n  So we have a problem. We really do. I know everybody has goals and \nvisions about how we can solve this problem. Senator Domenici and I \nshare a deep belief that nuclear power can be a primary source in the \nyears to come to deal with this crisis. In fact, he has written a book \nabout it. We have advocated this for some time. I think that reality is \nbeginning to dawn more clearly on us today. But it is going to be maybe \n7, 8, 10 years to get a new nuclear plant up and running. But we can \ngenerate large numbers of them if we follow smart procedures and have \nthat come on line. But the point I think we are trying to make is: That \nis 10 years down the road. It may take 10 years to do ANWR. We can \nbring on coal-to-liquid technology. That can happen, but it takes some \ntime. But we need to get started.\n  We are so hopeful we can do more with conservation. I supported the \nbill last year to raise our fuel standards, CAFE standards, automobile \nmileage standards up to 37, 35 miles per gallon, the entire fleet, \nincluding trucks. That is going to be difficult to achieve, but it will \nconserve a tremendous amount of fuel and be good for us. But that is \nnot going to solve our problem either.\n  So what must we do? I think we must have a long-term policy. I \nbelieve that policy should focus on investing in the ideas and concepts \nthat have potential to be breakthrough technologies to confront this \nproblem. There are a number of them out there.\n  Hydrogen. President Bush pushed hydrogen for our automobiles, but \nfrom what I can understand, that is coming along slower than we would \nlike. There are a number of very difficult technical problems with \nhydrogen. It takes some time. We would love to see the hybrid \nautomobiles be able to be converted to plug-in hybrid automobiles, and \nprogress is being made in that regard that is pretty exciting. We may \nbe getting closer there than we think. That would convert from liquid \nfuel that runs our automobiles to electricity. We can utilize \nelectricity generated in nuclear plants that emits no CO2, \nno pollution into the atmosphere, and do that at night when they are \nnot fully engaged and be able to drive, for most people, all they need \nto drive that day on a battery charge at night, utilizing no fuel in \ntheir automobile. What a great thing that would be.\n  We also have, as Senator Domenici has pointed out, though, great \nreserves of oil and gas and energy in our country. The sad fact is, we \nare not going to be able to get away from fossil fuels in the next few \ndecades. We are just not going to be able to get away from that. People \nseem to have no problem that we buy it from foreign countries, some of \nwhich are not friendly to us. We can just buy from them. But if you \ntalk about producing that oil and gas here in the United States, in our \ncountry, they get, for some reason, to objecting. We have seen it time \nand time again.\n  I was so pleased that last year, under Senator Domenici's \nleadership--the year before last, I guess--we passed legislation to \nopen 8.5 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. But we left closed to \ndrilling huge areas in the Gulf of Mexico, some of which have \ntremendous reserves of oil and gas. We have opened\n\n[[Page S3875]]\n\nnone off the Pacific coast, where there are huge resources, and none \noff the Atlantic coast. We have shown in the Gulf of Mexico that even \nwith this powerful hurricane, these billion-dollar rigs can sustain the \nstorm and not provide economic destruction or damage to the gulf. We \ncan do that around the world. So the question is, Are we going to take \nthat step? This legislation helps us go in that direction.\n  We have seen and shown you can convert coal. We have huge reserves of \ncoal-to-liquid that can burn in our automobiles. That is technology \nwhich is ready to go today basically. We just need to prove it out in a \nlarge commercial area, and the Government should help establish that \ntechnology. But the point I would like to make is that would produce \nhuge amounts of energy we can utilize in our vehicles and keep the \nmoney at home.\n  So there are many other things we can do and are doing.\n  I believe the concerns over ethanol raising food prices are \nexaggerated. Even President Bush, who has been somewhat skeptical of \nthis--his own administration said they thought about 2 percent to 3 \npercent of the price of food was as a result of ethanol being produced \nfrom corn and soybeans for biodiesel. It is not the main factor in the \nrise of farm prices. But it certainly helped us not to have to import \nlots and lots of foreign oil into the United States.\n  I will recall for my colleagues that according to the Congressional \nResearch Service, this year we will import into America $400 billion-\nplus worth of oil. Probably, the next year from this day--the next 12 \nmonths--it would be over $500 billion worth of oil. This is the \ngreatest wealth transfer in the history of the world. It is money we \nhave, as American citizens, that is ending up in the pockets of \ncountries--small countries, some of them, building more skyscrapers \nthan they have apartment complexes--unbelievable displays of wealth. We \ncan do better about that. We need to produce more energy here at home, \nenergy that we have. If we do so, we can reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil. And if we can reduce that amount through conservation, \nthrough local American production, the result could be that we could \nknock down the high demand that is out there, and we might even see the \nprice of oil drop more than people think. Historically, it has been \nboom and bust in the oil industry. Some say we will not have a bust \nagain because of the world demand, and they may be right. But I think \nthere are some realistic possibilities we can.\n  So there are biofuels and solar and wind and biomass and new \nbatteries. All of this is good, and I would support research and \ndevelopment on them. But I do not believe we ought to press down on the \nbrow of the American working man some theoretical beliefs about clean \nenergy that will not work or are exceedingly expensive and create only \na burden on working families in America. We have to be careful about \nthat.\n  So I am excited about the proposal that has been put forth. I believe \nwe have great potential to produce more American oil and gas off our \nContinental Shelf. I have seen it right off from the coast where I live \nin Alabama. I have seen that production come in for decades now.\n  We know ANWR has great potential. It could reduce our imports by as \nmuch as 10 percent if it is brought on line.\n  We know coal-to-liquid can be done today for far less than the world \nprice of oil. We know oil can be produced from these huge oil shale \ndeposits in the West for less than the world price of oil today.\n  We know nuclear power has the potential to help us transform our \nvehicular traffic from fossil fuels to electricity. But we have to get \nbusy doing it. We have not built a nuclear plant in 30 years. Since I \nhave been in the Senate, for 12 years I have talked about nuclear \npower, how critical it is to our future. We have done nothing really to \nmake that happen--until Senator Domenici, 2 years ago, as chairman of \nthe Energy Committee, finally pushed through some legislation that took \nus from having zero applications for nuclear plants to over 30 today.\n\n  I think we have the potential to see a renewal of nuclear power. The \nBritish just announced they are going to build five new nuclear plants. \nFrance has 80 percent of their power or more from nuclear power. Japan \ndoes.\n  We also need to figure out how to deal with the question of \nrecycling, which is not at all impossible to do. The British, the \nFrench, the Japanese, the Russians recycle. We want to work on \nlegislation to create recycling of nuclear waste. That will both help \nus create more fuel and reduce the danger of the waste that is left.\n  These are things we can do. But it is time to get busy and do it, not \nhave a policy of creating a massive bureaucracy, some cap-in-trade \nbureaucracy that has not worked in Europe. It just has not worked. A \nmassive tax increase is what it amounts to in sheep's clothing.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, \nwill he answer a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator, do you know what the price of a \nbarrel of oil was when we sent the ANWR bill to the President of the \nUnited States, which was vetoed? Do you know how much it was per \nbarrel?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know it was less, but I do not know.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Nineteen dollars a barrel.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Nineteen.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So for those who do not think it is worth another try--\nthat is, to have a vote and seriously consider ANWR--just think of the \ndifference in economic impact on the United States of tying up that \nresource when we did it compared to now.\n  Also, we were estimating only 1 million barrels of oil as the \nproduction per day. We have not upped that, brought that current for \n$120-a-barrel oil. It might very well be that it is more than a million \nbarrels a day just based upon price because it would justify far more \ninvestment in that little 2,000-acre footprint. Clearly, with such an \nincrease in price, you probably will get more.\n  But I think some of the American people may have favored holding that \n2,000 acres hostage and saying you cannot use it--they might have said, \nwell, that is all right when it is $19 a barrel--but when we are \nsuffering with $120-a-barrel oil, it may be a very close call even for \nthose who have exaggerated in their dilemma and fear about ANWR. To say \nwe can afford $19-a-barrel oil--lock it up--but should we lock it up \nfor $120 a barrel is a very good question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is six times as expensive.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It has increased six times in price since you first \nbegan to discuss it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So a million barrels a day becomes a different thing. A \nmillion barrels a day was $19 million. But now a million barrels is 120 \ntimes that. That is what you are losing to foreign countries.\n  You have alluded to the fact that maybe the American economy is \nsuffering irreparable harm. You said it a different way than I. But I \nhappen to believe--and have spoken to it two or three times on the \nfloor--I think we are experiencing irreparable damage to the American \neconomy because of the enormous price of crude oil and our inability to \nfind a way to get along without it. We are just depleting our vitality, \nand we do not know quite how to figure it out. We do not know why the \neconomy is having trouble. There are just all kinds of things we do not \nknow. But I have an answer for most of them: It is too many dollars \ngoing overseas to get crude oil. That is an enormous drain on this \neconomy, as strong as it is. That, plus the big debt we have accrued is \nhanging out there to be bought by the Chinese and others. You add them \nup, and it is frightening. If we can do something about it, we should. \nIsn't that why we are here?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I could not agree more, I say to Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield floor and thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is very troubling to me. I say to the Senator, I \nknow you also are knowledgeable--I do not know if you have a minute; I \nthink you mentioned it in your remarks. But you have pointed out, as I \nunderstand it, in the West, in the shale oil areas of the West, we can \nactually produce shale oil for far less than $120 a barrel; is that \ncorrect?\n\n[[Page S3876]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Under current technology. I assume it will get better \nin the years to come, but even right now with the technology we have?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is no question. One of the major oil companies \nhas invested a huge amount of money. I think the initial investment \nallowed was $4 billion to experiment with a project that would in situ, \non sight--rather than picking mines, they would boil the oil in the \nground and siphon it out. That price was put around $50, $50 to $60 \nbefore they would consider it feasible to invest money. We are long \npast that, for that kind of an experiment. If it works, then the next \nsteps have to be taken. It will be expensive, but $50 a barrel versus \n$120, there is a lot of room for play.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That keeps the money at home, hiring American workers \nwho pay taxes to the United States of America.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. And this bill we are talking about here tonight \nhas a provision in it about it. Because in the dead of night, in an \nappropriations bill in the Department of the Interior, somebody in the \nHouse--we think we know who--decided to put a moratorium on the final \nregulations for shale development, even though in the Energy bill you \nhelped us write, the comprehensive bill, we provided for oil shale \nleases of the right size to permit activity, permit this research, this \nexperimentation. Well, they put a moratorium on it and that thwarts the \ncompany that is putting the investment in it. This bill says no, that \nhas to come off. So I don't know whether we will have a chance to vote \non it another way, but maybe since it is one year at a time, we may \ntake it off of appropriations. I don't know.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Domenici has some interest. We have had talks \nabout coal to liquids. It is my understanding--is it yours--that we \nhave technology today that can take our massive coal reserves and \nconvert that to a good liquid fuel for our automobiles at less than \n$120 a barrel, the world market price of oil today?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, I choose to take one step back on that and say, \nthere is no question but that South African technology is available to \nconvert clean coal into liquid diesel. Its principal use at that point \nwould be American airplanes, both commercial and military, American \nmilitary equipment, and that would be a huge amount. This bill limits \nit to 9 million, the equivalent of 9 million barrels a day is what we \nwould produce. That would be so we could be sure we weren't having a \nnegative impact on the environment. How do we do that? Well, the energy \nproduced by the conversion would not contribute any more than the crude \noil we would buy would contribute and we would use it anyway, so we \ndon't think we are harming the environment. But we are not going to go \nall out and produce the whole amount that coal can produce but, rather, \nlearn how to do it, do it well, and send a signal that the great \nAmerican ingenuity is ready to do something, and do something big. That \nis what that one would be, a big one that would frighten those who have \nus captive, because they would say they are finally going to do \nsomething and something that is important.\n  The same thing would happen if we had a breakthrough on oil shale. \nThere is no question, that would be an enormous signal. Now I am not \nsaying that is as ready as coal to liquid. One is ready rather quickly, \nthe other one would take a little while. But we only put things in that \nare doable and that are important, and if they are not doable \nimmediately, they are doable in the sense of sending a signal that the \ncountry is doing something.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Landrieu amendment No. 4705 is pending.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to call \nup amendment No. 4731 which I filed earlier today with my colleague \nfrom South Dakota, Senator Tim Johnson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Senator from New \nMexico for his comprehensive energy bill which he introduced. It is a \nsolution we need to take a hard look at, perhaps moving to it sometime \nin the not too distant future here in the Senate. I think his bill \nstarts the debate.\n  Unfortunately, he has tried over and over and over again to start the \ndebate here in the Senate. The legislation he introduced--and I am a \ncosponsor of that bill last week--is comprehensive in that it addresses \nthe supply issue. We can't address America's high energy costs absent \naddressing the issue of supply. We are sending, as was already noted, \n$1.6 billion every single day outside the United States and, in some \ncases, to countries that would do us harm, in order to meet our demand \nfor energy here at home. The Senator from New Mexico has put forward a \nsolution which is broad based and which addresses the supply issue by \nmaking available some of the reserves we have in this country on the \nNorth Slope of Alaska, on the Outer Continental Shelf, and he addresses \nthe need for additional refinery capacity. We haven't built a refinery \nin 30 years, since 1976. He also addresses some of the new technologies \nsuch as coal to liquid, which was talked about earlier.\n  I should say he changes a definition that was modified very late in \nthe Energy bill debate last year that precludes forest waste residues \nfrom being a source of cellulosic ethanol because in many respects, the \nfuture of renewable energy in this country is transitioning from corn-\nbased ethanol to cellulosic ethanol. We have enormous biomass available \nin this country in forests in the form of switchgrass that can be grown \nin abundance on the prairies in this country and other forms of biomass \nthat can be available and can be converted into cellulosic ethanol. So \nhis solution is to create additional supply--the supply of fuels but \nalso the capacity of refineries--in order to be able to process more of \nthose natural resources into refined gasoline. If we don't do that, we \nare going to continue to send billions and billions and billions of \ndollars every single year to countries outside the United States which, \nin many cases, use those very dollars to turn around and fund terrorist \norganizations that attack Americans, that to the tune of about almost \n$500 billion. Half a trillion dollars last year left the United States \nin order to meet the demand we have for energy here at home.\n  I congratulate the Senator from New Mexico and hope we can get a \ndebate going here in the Senate that addresses the supply issue.\n  I am all for conservation measures. There are some conservation \nmeasures as well, and there are lots of steps we can be taking. Last \nyear as part of the Energy bill, we created the first change in a long \ntime--something like 20 years--in fuel efficiency standards. That is \nsomething we need to be pursuing as well. But at the end of the day, \nour appetite for energy in this country and the world's appetite for \nenergy is not going away. In fact, the Department of Energy estimates \nthat even with intensive conservation efforts in place, maintaining our \neconomic growth through the year 2025 will require a 36-percent \nincrease in energy supply, including a 39-percent increase in oil \nconsumption. Sixty percent of our oil is currently imported. So as \ndemand rises and domestic supply is not increased, we are subject to \nprices that are set by foreign countries, including, as I mentioned, \nsome hostile regimes.\n\n  Senator Domenici has put forward several ideas in his plan that are \nnot new. Some of them have been debated previously, some of them \nblocked by bipartisan politics. But I hope that $3.50, $4-a-gallon \ngasoline will change some of that. In my State of South Dakota, the \naverage price of gasoline today is $3.60. Oil, of course, traded at an \nall-time high of $122 per barrel. Diesel is $4.18 a gallon. As the \nfarmers in my State continue another planting season, they are faced \nwith those diesel fuel costs that are substantially higher than \nprevious years. They are faced with higher fertilizer costs because \nnatural gas prices have gone up.\n  This is a crisis that reaches into the pocketbooks of every American. \nI was talking in my State of South Dakota\n\n[[Page S3877]]\n\nthis week with someone in the tourism business who was saying the \nnumbers this year are already down 11 percent from the previous year. I \nthink that is a sign of more to come in terms of the economic hardship \nthat is going to be imposed on the economy all across this country. My \nState of South Dakota, because it is so energy dependent as a result of \ntourism and agriculture and some of the industries that are very energy \nintensive, is particularly hard hit. Since I was first elected to \nCongress over 10 years ago, we voted on opening a small section of ANWR \nat least five times. Most recently, in the 2006 Defense appropriations \nbill, we had that vote.\n  It is important to note at that time the Senate Democrats blocked oil \nand gas exploration in ANWR oil was trading for just over $50 a barrel. \nWell, now it is at $122 a barrel, and at that time it was argued it \nwould take at least 10 years to develop the resources in ANWR. But I \nthink it is high time we began the process of authorizing that \nexploration and production. We have up to 16 billion barrels of oil, we \nare told, up there, or a million barrels of oil each day that could be \ncoming into our pipeline in this country and taking pressure off of gas \nprices. So I hope the fact that today the high price of gasoline is \nimpacting more and more consumers across this country, more and more \nsmall business owners, more and more families, we will see a change in \nthe mindset that will enable us to move forward with legislation such \nas that introduced by my colleague from New Mexico that will get at the \nheart of this problem. The problem is we don't have enough supply to \nkeep up with the demand either at home or around the world, but at a \nminimum, we ought to be coming up with those solutions that are \ndomestic, that are home grown, and by that I mean the oil reserves we \nhave here in the United States or off our shores, the infinite amounts \nof coal we have that can be converted into fuels, the enormous \npotential we have out there for renewable energy such as ethanol made \nnot only from corn but from other sources of biomass, and that we take \nsteps to add refinery capacity.\n  It is absolutely critical, in my mind and in my view, that we start \nmoving in this direction. I heard a report earlier today that some \nprojections are that oil prices could get up to somewhere around $200 a \nbarrel. I can't imagine that happening or what the impact would be on \nour economy, but it is never too late to do the right thing, and we \nneed to move quickly now and decisively on an energy policy that will \nincrease our supply, our domestic supply, take pressure off of oil \nprices and prices at the pump that American consumers are dealing with \nevery single day.\n  I congratulate again the Senator from New Mexico for his bill. I am \nhappy to be a cosponsor of it. I hope we are able to get a vote on it, \nand I hope we can do something once and for all about high gas prices \nand bring some relief to the American consumer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to join in this discussion. I \nknow my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been out here \ntalking about energy issues and the high price of gasoline.\n  I certainly know when the Senate works together on energy policy, we \nget things done. The 2000 Senate Energy bill is an example of that, of \nhow we worked in a bipartisan fashion. That bill, when it is fully \nimplemented over the next 20 years, will save families over $1,000 a \nyear at gas stations. That is because we put a good policy into place.\n  The question is where we are going to go from here. I have listened \nto some of the things my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nsaid, and I hope when we are done with our statements, we can sit down \nand work together on trying to implement more legislation that will \nhelp the American consumer. But I think the notion that where we are \ntoday is a rational market and that supply and demand is driving what \nwe are seeing, a 100-percent increase over last year in oil prices, is \nnot correct.\n  We just had a hearing in the Commerce Committee where airline \nexecutives were testifying, and they said they don't think this is \nsupply and demand, and it has obviously caused a great impact on their \nindustry. They would like us to be more aggressive in policing the \nmarkets, and they offered some suggestions. But many of my colleagues \nhave been out here talking about opening drilling in the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge. Well, we have had this debate. We have had it numerous \ntimes. I always like the administration's own Energy Information Agency \nthat says drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge would result, when it \nis fully implemented 10 or 20 years from now, in 1-penny-per-gallon \nsavings. So that means when you take the average driving of a consumer \nat 400 or 500 gallons of gasoline in a year, you would have saved $5 on \nyour annual gas bill from drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge.\n  God only gave the United States 3 percent of the world's oil \nreserves. We are not going to drill our way out of this situation. But \nI ask my colleagues to look at what is causing this problem because we \nhave oil company executives who are saying oil should be at $50 to $55 \na barrel. This is the oil companies testifying in April. So they are \nsaying the market isn't functioning correctly when it is at $120 a \nbarrel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4719\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, The issue of wind coverage is important \nand is a concern of many families across the country and in my home \nState of Massachusetts and the Cape. Legislation must be developed that \nhelps those families facing the threat of wind damage without harming \nthose who already have flood insurance. I have the assurance from the \nchairman of the Banking Committee, my friend the senior Senator from \nConnecticut, that this is his intention as well and that he intends for \na commission to study the issue and present to Congress a set of \nresponsible recommendations for addressing this need.\n  For this reason, I oppose the Wicker amendment at this time in order \nto allow further study of the matter and that a consensus approach may \nbe put forward in the Senate in the near future.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4719\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote in relation to \namendment No. 4719 offered by the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Wicker.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I understand we now have 1 minute each to \nclose on the amendment; is that the order of the day?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I tell my colleagues that this is a \nmultiple perils amendment to the National Flood Insurance Program. It \nis backed by the National Association of Realtors.\n  The CBO will tell you it is budget neutral because the premiums have \nto be based on risk and actuarially sound. There are changes that could \nbe made to make a good amendment perfect. We might not have those \ntonight. But I can assure my colleagues of this: The passage of the \nWicker amendment tonight will ensure that a solution will come quicker \nto the problem of millions and millions of Americans not being able to \nensure against wind and water damage at the same time. I urge passage \nof the Wicker amendment for that reason, if for no other.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have great respect for our colleague from \nMississippi. The point we wish to make on this amendment is not that we \ndisagree. The simple question, as pointed out by Senator Nelson from \nFlorida, is that this amendment, as presently crafted, could end up \ncosting billions more than we anticipated. There were $17 billion in \nclaims in excess of the $1.5 billion in funds. Some predict this could \nbe as much as $60 billion to $100 billion.\n  We have a commission we are working on as part of the bill. We have \nto grapple with wind. We have to have an actuarially sound program. The \nlast thing we want to do is destroy a flood program, which we could do \nby overwhelming it as a result of claims under\n\n[[Page S3878]]\n\nwind, without standards under which we judge those conditions and \nconcerns. Based on what happened in 2005, the claims under wind might \nhave been five times $17 billion.\n  I am determined as a member of the committee to spend more time on \nthis. In fact, we would have spent more time but for the foreclosure \ncrisis to try to come up with answers. At this juncture, to adopt this \namendment would cause the program to be put in great jeopardy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4719.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), \nthe Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), and the Senator from Illinois \n(Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) is absent \nbecause of illness.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Nebraska (Mr. Hagel), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), and \nthe Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had a number of conversations with \nSenator McConnell today. I have had a number of conversations with the \ntwo managers of the bill. I think we have a plan for finishing this \nlegislation tomorrow. We have had good cooperation on both sides.\n  What we are going to try to do is finish this bill. There are a \nnumber of Senators who want to offer amendments tonight. We can have \nthe votes tonight or in the morning. The way things are looking, we can \nhave them after morning business in the morning because there are not a \nlot of amendments.\n  It is our goal to finish this bill tomorrow. If that is the case, \nthen we wouldn't have to be in Friday. We have a lot of things to do \nlegislatively, hearings, and other such business. What we will do is \ncome in Monday and vote on the amendment that has been filed by the \nRepublican leader dealing with energy. It is the Domenici energy \npackage. We will have a side-by-side. I already explained to the \nRepublican leader and others what that will be. It should be fairly \ndirect and to the point. We will have a 60-vote margin on both of \nthose.\n  Following that, we will move to legislation that is bipartisan in \nnature. We will need to invoke cloture on it. It is the Judd Gregg \nfirefighters legislation. That will get us through Monday.\n  We have 2 weeks left. Hang on to your hats; we have a lot to do. We \ndo not know if we are going to get the supplemental next week. We \nthought we would early next week, but we have learned today there may \nbe some problems developing in the House. We are doing our very best to \ndo that.\n  I congratulate Senators Harkin and Chambliss and Senators Baucus and \nGrassley. We think--we don't think, we know the farm bill has been put \nto rest. We are going to be able to bring a bipartisan conference \nreport to the Senate floor, hopefully, next week. There is no reason we \nshould not be able to do that next week. Those are just a few of the \nmoving parts we have.\n  The supplemental is not going to be easy, as it never is. Once we get \nit from the House, we can do our job over here fairly rapidly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, can the leader explain how he is going \nto handle the two Energy bills? It seemed he was saying we would be \nfinished with this bill before that. That is not the case, is it? These \ntwo amendments will be voted on as part of this bill.\n  Mr. REID. What we would like to do--we certainly will work with the \ndistinguished Republican leader at a later time. I don't think Senators \nShelby and Dodd want energy to be part of this bill. If we can get 60 \nvotes on it, we will be happy to stick it in this bill.\n  What Senator McConnell and I talked about--I think it is fair, and we \ndo a lot of business with 60 votes around here. We are not trying to \nstop anybody from doing anything.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is going to be freestanding.\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As long as there is ample time to discuss it.\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to Senator Domenici, even though he \nand I have disagreed on a few issues over the years--few in number--I \npersonally know how strongly the Senator from New Mexico feels about \nthis energy issue. I hope the Senator doesn't get 60 votes, but we will \ndo everything we can to ensure he gets a vote.\n  Mr. President, able staff, both on the majority and minority side, \nsay I may not have phrased everything right regarding the energy \nlegislation. But I think Senator McConnell and I understand we are \ngoing to have two votes on energy Monday night. The exact terminology \nprocedurally, I may not have outlined it properly, but I think we know \nwhere we are going.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4722\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under previous the order, there is now 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. \n4722 offered by the junior Senator from Louisiana. Who yields time?\n  The junior Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple and modest. \nIt simply updates the coverage limits available for a flood policy \nwhich have not been updated at all since 1994. It does not even take \ninto account all inflation since then, just most inflation. It is what \nthe House did. And under the CBO study of the House bill, the CBO said \nit does not increase the cost of the bill because people will obviously \npay significantly higher premiums for the higher limits.\n  This is a very modest updating of the limits. I ask for the support \nof my colleagues.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I oppose the Vitter amendment. The purpose \nof the Dodd-Shelby bill is to increase the actuarial soundness of the \nflood insurance program. This amendment by Senator Vitter would \nundermine greatly that effort. The amendment would extend flood \ninsurance subsidies, crowd out private markets, and lead to larger \nprogram losses down the road.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Dodd and me in opposing the \nVitter amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reclaiming the remainder of my time, again \nI think it is very important to note the CBO analysis, with regard to \nthis issue in the House bill, said it does not cost any more. It does \nnot get in the way of actuarial soundness at all. This is only updating \nthe limits for less than inflation since 1994.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n[[Page S3879]]\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, periodically new flood maps are issued by \nFEMA. When a new flood map comes out, some properties that used to not \nbe in a flood zone may now be in a flood zone, or move from a lesser to \na more severe part of a flood zone.\n  This amendment would simply say we are going to charge higher \npremiums, absolutely, but we will transition that over 5 years instead \nof the 2 years in the bill. The 5 years is the same provision as in the \nHouse bill. I think it is a reasonable transition, still getting to \nthat new higher premium.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I oppose the Vitter amendment No. 4273. \nMost homes mapped into the mandatory coverage areas will only see \nlimited increases in their premium rates.\n  Homes or properties mapped into the higher risk areas should pay \nhigher rates to match the reality of higher risk. Out-of-date maps that \nhave vastly underclassified risk need to be updated, and delay in \nrequiring property owners to pay their full freight is an extension of \nthe inadvertent subsidies provided by inaccurate maps.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Dodd and me in opposing the \nVitter amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 4705 be modified further with the changes at the desk and that \nSenators Dorgan, Lincoln, and Pryor be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 9, strike line 12 and all that follows through page \n     10, line 16, and insert the following:\n       (c) Study on Mandatory Purchase Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall conduct \n     and submit to Congress a study assessing the impact, \n     effectiveness, and feasibility of amending the provisions of \n     the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 regarding the \n     properties that are subject to the mandatory flood insurance \n     coverage purchase requirements under such Act to extend such \n     requirements to properties located in any area that would be \n     designated as an area having special flood hazards but for \n     the existence of a structural flood protection system.\n       (2) Content of report.--In carrying out the study required \n     under paragraph (1), the Comptroller General shall \n     determine--\n       (A) the regulatory, financial and economic impacts of \n     extending the mandatory purchase requirements described under \n     paragraph (1) on the costs of homeownership, the actuarial \n     soundness of the National Flood Insurance Program, the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency, local communities, \n     insurance companies, and local land use;\n       (B) the effectiveness of extending such mandatory purchase \n     requirements in protecting homeowners from financial loss and \n     in protecting the financial soundness of the National Flood \n     Insurance Program; and\n       (C) any impact on lenders of complying with or enforcing \n     such extended mandatory requirements.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, if this amendment does not pass, \nsignificant portions of many States will be\n\n[[Page S3880]]\n\nrequired to have flood insurance which has never been required before. \nThe underlying bill says everywhere there is a dike, a dam, or a levy, \nregardless of the situation behind the dike, dam, or levy, regardless \nof how strong the dike, dam, or levy is, you will be required to have \nflood insurance. That is a very different jump from where we are today. \nOur amendment strikes that language and instead says there shall be a \nstudy and evaluation to make better determinations.\n  This is a tough issue because we were behind levees that broke. It \nwould have been a good idea, but this is a tax and fees on people \nwithout the appropriate study. That is what our amendment does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me take 30 seconds to say to Members, if \nthey have any amendments on this bill, I will stay around this evening. \nAnyone who has an amendment, we will consider them this evening. There \nwill be no votes until tomorrow, but I will stay around tonight to \nengage in debate on amendments.\n  Let me express my opposition to the Landrieu amendment. This is less \nthan $1 a day; at the most it is $350 a year for 350,000 dollars' worth \nof insurance. Twenty-five percent of all the claims against the flood \ninsurance program come out of residual risk areas. One percent of the \npolicies are coming out of that area. If we are going to have an \nactuarially sound program, you have to ask people to contribute.\n  Here is a list of dikes and dams that are failing right now. There is \nno guarantee these are going to last forever. We learned that painfully \nin Louisiana. When they don't, just like homeowner policies, you want \nto have something in place that will allow people to get back on their \nfeet again other than coming to raid the Treasury to do so. Again, \n$350,000 for the maximum of less than $1 a day is very little to ask \nfor a program that is actuarially sound. That is what we are trying to \ndo with this bill so we don't end up raiding the Treasury in the long \nrun.\n  I urge defeat of the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4709 to Amendment No. 4707\n\n (Purpose: To establish a National Catastrophe Risks Consortium and a \n  National Homeowners' Insurance Stabilization Program, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I send amendment No. 4709 to \nthe desk. It has been filed, and I call it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson], for himself, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. Martinez, and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4709 to amendment No. 4707.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, May 6, 2008, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this is an amendment to \nrecognize what we have been discussing on this floor earlier: that the \nbig one is coming. The big one is either a category 5 hurricane that is \nhitting an urbanized area of the coast, of which there is some loss of \n$50 billion of insurance losses in wind losses, or it is an 8.5 \nearthquake on the Richter scale that hits downtown San Francisco or \ndowntown Memphis--either one of which no one State could withstand that \nkind of economic loss. There is no one insurance company that can \nwithstand that economic loss.\n  It is clear that the package of bills Senator Martinez and I--and he, \nby the way, is a cosponsor of this amendment--the package of bills we \nhave filed to address the plethora of subjects having to do with \ncatastrophic risk--a national catastrophe fund is one of those bills. \nThat is not going to pass. The White House opposes it. But what could \npass is what has already passed the House of Representatives and is \ndown here and is the essence of this amendment; that is, it sets up two \nthings. It sets up, on the one hand, a consortium whereby if a State's \ncatastrophe fund goes dry and they need additional bonding, that State \nthen has set up a consortium where it is easy to go into the private \nbond market for catastrophe bonds and get that bonding back to the \nState catastrophe fund. That is one part of this bill. The other part \nof this bill is also where the State has a State catastrophe fund.\n  What is a catastrophe fund? It is a reinsurance fund. It reinsures \ninsurance companies against the catastrophic risk. In the case of \nFlorida, it is hurricanes. In the case of California, it is \nearthquakes. In the case of Memphis, TN, it is earthquakes. In the case \nof the gulf coast, the Atlantic seaboard, it is hurricanes. That is \nwhat a State catastrophe fund is.\n  Florida has that fund. There are a lot of other States that do not. \nSo this amendment would only apply to those that set up and address the \ncatastrophic risk at the State level first. Therefore, if a State has a \nState catastrophe fund, it would have another opportunity to have the \nFederal Government help it. If the well ran dry in its State \ncatastrophe fund and was out of money, it then could borrow cash from \nthe Federal Government at market rates to replenish the cash until it \ncould get its own cash reserves replenished by its mechanism which, in \nthe case of Florida, is that they assess all of the policyholders--the \nproperty and casualty policyholders--in the State. Now, that is the way \nFlorida does it.\n  This is not a new Federal program. This is a Federal incentive to the \nStates solving this problem but recognizing that the big one is \ncoming--either a hurricane or an earthquake--that when the big one \ndoes, if the State catastrophe fund, the reinsurance fund cannot handle \nit, the Federal Government is going to step in but only to the extent \nof helping the State catastrophe fund facilitate getting bonds in the \nprivate marketplace--catastrophe bonds--or, No. 2, help the State \ncatastrophe fund have ready quick access to cash from the Federal \nGovernment but lent at fair market rates.\n  Now, this is utilizing the private marketplace. This is not a new \nFederal\n\n[[Page S3881]]\n\nprogram. It is a commonsense solution. It has already passed the House \noverwhelmingly. This is the vehicle that we have to offer it all. Even \nthough this is a flood insurance bill, it is an insurance bill. We are \nnot trying to monkey around with the flood insurance program; we are \nmerely trying to have a vehicle by which we can bring this up.\n\n  Now, they are going to say it is not germane because it is not flood \ninsurance. So that means we are going to have to get the 60-vote \nthreshold to waive a point of order that it is not germane, and that is \na high threshold. But nevertheless, we have to try.\n  I notice my colleague from Florida is here, and he is a cosponsor. I \nwish to thank him for that cosponsorship.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a detailed explanation of my amendment \nbe printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Summary of the Homeowners Defense\n\n       The Homeowners Defense amendment establishes a Consortium, \n     a non-Federal entity that States may choose to join. The \n     Consortium is designed to encourage and facilitate the \n     transfer of catastrophe risk from State catastrophe \n     reinsurance facilities/funds into the private markets, \n     notably, the catastrophe bond markets.\n       In addition the bill also creates a Federal loan program to \n     provide financing for qualified reinsurance programs and \n     state residual insurance market entities that choose to \n     participate to help cover the cost of paying out in the event \n     of a disaster.\n       The bill includes general eligibility and underwriting \n     requirement provisions that would:\n       Ensure that the savings realized form Titles I and II are \n     passed through to primary policy holders\n       Encourage compliance with loss mitigation requirements\n       Ensure that actuarial rates are charged\n       Ensure that State reinsurance programs only underwrite \n     truly catastrophic events (i.e. Katrina)\n\n\n           Title I--The National Catastrophe Risk Consortium\n\n       Title I establishes the National Catastrophe Risk \n     Consortium, an organization that States can choose to join \n     for the purposes of transferring catastrophe risk to the \n     private market. To be clear, the Consortium would not assume \n     the States' disaster risk. The risk transfer would be \n     achieved through the issuance of risk-linked securities \n     catastrophe bonds) or through negotiate reinsurance \n     contracts. The consortium is designed to function as a \n     conduit, so that at no time would risk transfer either to or \n     from the Federal government.\n       The Consortium would be governed by a board comprised of \n     Federal and participating State representatives with all \n     members having a single vote. All States are eligible to \n     join. Much of the Consortium's needs for risk modeling, \n     financial consulting, and relations with the capital markets \n     would be arranged for on a contract basis rather than \n     provided by a permanent staff.\n       The Consortium offers States and private market \n     participants a unique opportunity to benefit from combining \n     catastrophic risks diversified by the type of peril and \n     geographic regions. The Consortium staff would work in \n     coordination with participating States to catalogue \n     inventories of catastrophic risk.\n       Catastrophe bond underwriters and other market participants \n     would be able to access this database to structure bonds or \n     reinsurance contracts and treaties.\n       The Consortium would serve as a conduit issuer of \n     catastrophe bonds on behalf of the participating States, but \n     not actually take possession of any bond proceeds, coupon \n     payments, or underlying risk. Through the aggregation and \n     maintenance of market statistics, the Consortium would \n     develop industry standards for the catastrophe bond and risk \n     transference markets. Such standards include, but are not \n     limited to, the terms of bond offerings, the nature of \n     triggers used and the definitions of risks.\n       $20,000,000 per year is authorized to cover the costs of \n     the establishing and administering the consortium.\n\n\n     Title II--National Homeowners Insurance Stabilization Program\n\n       This title creates a National Homeowners Insurance \n     Stabilization Program within the Department of Treasury \n     designed to ensure a stable private insurance market by \n     extending Federal loans to qualified reinsurance programs in \n     States wishing to participate in the program. Specifically, \n     the program would make two types of loans of last resort \n     available: liquidity loans and catastrophic loans.\n       Liquidity loans would be extended to qualified reinsurance \n     programs that have a capital liquidity shortage due to and \n     following an insured catastrophic event.\n       The amount of the loan cannot exceed the ceiling coverage \n     level for the reinsurance program. The liquidity loan would \n     have an interest rate set at 3 percentage points higher than \n     marketable obligations of the Treasury having the same term \n     to maturity of between 5 and 10 years.\n       Catastrophic loans would be extended to a qualified \n     reinsurance program when it has sustained losses above its \n     maximum underwriting capacity. The catastrophic loan will \n     have an annual interest rate set at 0.20 percentage points \n     higher than marketable obligations of the Treasury having the \n     same term to maturity and maturity of no less than 10 years.\n       As a transitional measure, during the first five years of \n     the program, States that do not have a qualified reinsurance \n     plan would be eligible to participate in the Title II program \n     through their residual insurance market entities. Currently \n     36 states have a residual market entity that would meet the \n     requirements of this bill.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank Senator Nelson, my dear \ncolleague from the State of Florida, for bringing this bill forward, of \nwhich I am a cosponsor. I wish to associate myself with his comments \nregarding this very important proposal for the State of Florida. What \nalready passed in the House ought to be given an opportunity to be \nconsidered by the Senate. I believe it could make a big difference to a \nlot of Florida homeowners who today are hurting because of high \ninsurance costs because of unavailability of insurance and this is a \nway of safeguarding and actually it is a way of planning ahead for the \ninevitable storm.\n  Senator Nelson likes to say the big one is coming. The fact is it is \ninevitable that we will have other storms and some of them are going to \nbe substantially large storms. As that occurs, the Federal Government \nwill have a response. Inevitably, FEMA will be there, and there will be \nother responses to help people. Wouldn't it make much more sense to \nhave a Federal backstop to an insurance program that could then \nprovide, in an orderly way, the relief that surely will come to Florida \nor whatever other State is afflicted by the big natural disaster as we \nknow Katrina was and other terrible storms can be.\n  I met today with the Director of the National Hurricane Center. I \npresume Senator Nelson may have met him as well. He was coming around \nto tell us about their programs, the terrific job they do of \nforecasting, but it is also a reminder that the hurricane season is \nupon us. About a month from now will be the official beginning of the \nhurricane season. As that happens, surely I will join with Senator \nNelson in saying the big one is sure to come, and when it does it will \nbe nice to have the kinds of funds the Klein-Mahoney legislation \nenvisions and which I fully support.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, pending some language to be drafted on a UC \nrequest, let me respond to the comments of Senators Nelson and Martinez \nof Florida.\n  First, I commend Bill Nelson and the two House Members who crafted \nthis legislative proposal to deal with the national catastrophe events. \nI commend them because they thought about this in a constructive way as \nto how they can possibly get resources to come into the States to deal \nwith national catastrophes. Every one of us is confronted with this \nproblem, whether you are in Florida with hurricane season, or in the \nMidwest with cyclones and tornadoes and floods, or whatever else may \noccur. We have all been confronted with how to deal with devastating \nnatural disasters. It has been a long-time interest of mine.\n  Some years ago, going back almost 20 years, Senators Stevens, Inouye, \nothers, and I tried to craft exactly something like this. We didn't get \nvery far back in those days. The idea was to try to come up with a \nnational plan that would allow us to be able to deal with these issues.\n  I begin my comments about the Nelson amendment as a complimentary \none. We tried to accommodate it to some degree, because there are a lot \nof different ideas on how to do this. The authors of the original idea \nin the other body have a very creative idea. I welcome that. And there \nare others; it is not the only one. Rather than trying to adopt this in \nthe middle of a flood insurance bill, as you heard Senator Nelson talk \nabout earlier, we adopted a commission study for 9 months to examine \nthese various ideas, and to come back to us with recommendations within \nthat 9-month period. So we will\n\n[[Page S3882]]\n\nlook clearly at this idea, but there are others as well. That is the \nintention.\n  We also included in the legislation several other ideas to try and \ndeal with some of these problems. Two initiatives particularly, I \nadmit, don't address the overall problem. They assist homeowners in \ncommunities faced with these problems. One is to provide a tax credit \nto homeowners who live in coastal areas--and it is not in the bill; it \nis a separate piece of legislation--who have seen property insurance \nrates substantially increase. That is certainly the case in Florida, \nwhere they have seen significant increases in those rates.\n  The bill I have introduced would give homeowners an immediate relief \nto offset part of the rise in premiums as we grapple with the long-term \nsolutions. Again, it is not an answer, but it is some financial relief \nbefore we sort out this issue. I hope it will be on an appropriate \nvehicle, and I hope we will have an opportunity to offer that idea in \nthe next several weeks.\n  I have also introduced a bill to provide grants and loans to home and \nbusiness owners to undertake mitigation efforts. The best we can do for \npeople in harm's way is to help them lessen the risk in the first \nplace, with things such as storm shutters, hurricane clips, elevating \nessential utilities, and even elevating an entire house, in some cases. \nThat will not only reduce insurance costs but save lives.\n  Mitigation costs are not inexpensive. We thought it might be a great \nhelp to assist in this so when problems arise, there is an effort to \nreduce the amount of damage that would occur. First, I admit these are \nnot solutions to the issue raised by our colleague from Florida. I urge \nmy colleagues at this juncture to add a specific idea such as this. But \nthis is going a little beyond where we are prepared to go. That is my \nnote of caution.\n  There is a vote on this tomorrow. I will be voting against the \namendment offered by Senator Nelson, but not because I am opposed to \nthe idea. In fact, I would make a case that I believe there may be \nlegal authority that exists today to do some things already that he is \ntalking about in his amendment. Some may be redundant based on what \nexisting law would allow States to do to assist with funds in these \nareas. Some would clearly require new authority.\n  I urge colleagues, when considering this, not to give up. We will get \nto it. We have to. I think the best way to approach it is in a more \ncomprehensive fashion. I thank them for their ideas, and I commend the \ntwo House Members of the Florida delegation, the principal authors of \nthis idea. I commend Senator Martinez, as well, for addressing these \nissues. I met with both of the House Members in my office several weeks \nago and, ironically, at the time they came to my office, the chief \nexecutive officer of the Travelers Insurance Company, Jay Fishman, a \nvery good friend of mine, a good fellow, was in the office, and he has \nauthored his own idea that has attracted broad-based interest. Despite \nthe fact that somebody would say it has come from the CEO of an \ninsurance company, he is an original thinker; he thinks outside of the \nbox. In fact, both of the members of the Florida delegation were quite \ntaken with his idea and thought it was very creative as a national \nmodel. That is one other idea that is out there that we happened to \ndiscuss that day in the lengthy conversation we had on this issue.\n  There are many ideas, a lot of which have very sound merit, but they \nneed to be thought out. I am a little uneasy about taking an idea and \nadopting it as an amendment as part of a flood insurance bill without \nunderstanding the full implications of what is involved in it. For \nthose reasons, I will be objecting, or at least asking my colleagues to \nturn down this particular approach--not because it is a bad idea or it \nmay not work but because we are not quite ready to accept that at this \njuncture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4711 to Amendment No. 4707\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I wish to call up two amendments and then \nmake some brief comments about them. The first amendment is amendment \nNo. 4711, which I believe is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4711 to amendment No. 4707.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Director to conduct a study on the impact, \neffectiveness, and feasibility of amending section 1361 of the National \n   Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to include widely used and nationally \nrecognized building codes as part of the floodplain management criteria \n                     developed under such section)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. REPORT ON INCLUSION OF BUILDING CODES IN \n                   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT CRITERIA.\n\n       Not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency shall conduct a study and submit a report to the \n     Committee on Financial Services of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs of the Senate regarding the impact, \n     effectiveness, and feasibility of amending section 1361 of \n     the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4102) to \n     include widely used and nationally recognized building codes \n     as part of the floodplain management criteria developed under \n     such section, and shall determine--\n       (1) the regulatory, financial, and economic impacts of such \n     a building code requirement on homeowners, States and local \n     communities, local land use policies, and the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency;\n       (2) the resources required of State and local communities \n     to administer and enforce such a building code requirement;\n       (3) the effectiveness of such a building code requirement \n     in reducing flood-related damage to buildings and contents;\n       (4) the impact of such a building code requirement on the \n     actuarial soundness of the National Flood Insurance Program;\n       (5) the effectiveness of nationally recognized codes in \n     allowing innovative materials and systems for flood-resistant \n     construction; and\n       (6) the feasibility and effectiveness of providing an \n     incentive in lower premium rates for flood insurance coverage \n     under such Act for structures meeting whichever of such \n     widely used and nationally recognized building code or any \n     applicable local building code provides greater protection \n     from flood damage.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 4710, as Modified, to Amendment No. 4707\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, my next amendment is actually a \nmodification which I need to send to the desk. It is amendment No. \n4710.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4710, as modified.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask that the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 8, line 13, strike ``and''.\n       On page 8, line 16, strike ``policy.''.'' and insert the \n     following: ``policy; and\n       ``(3) any property purchased on or after the date of \n     enactment of the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act \n     of 2007.''.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, if I could take a couple of minutes to \nexplain these, my hope is that I can even get the chairman's support of \nthis.\n  Amendment No. 4711 is actually a study that I hope we can all agree \non. It is a study that would try to determine the feasibility of using \nincentives of lower flood insurance rates when consumers or businesses \nhave their homes or business locations comply with nationally \nrecognized building codes. A number of codes are out there. If we could \nencourage better construction of buildings, to make them more resistant \nto storms, it is likely we could save the flood insurance program a lot \nof money. So this amendment would simply study the feasibility of those \nincentives and what it might do to insurance rates, as well as to \nsaving Government money.\n  My second amendment, No. 4710, ends the practice of permanently \nsubsidizing premiums for older homes in flood zones, which can be as \nlarge as 65-percent. The bill does a good job phasing out these \nsubsidies for just about every other property: businesses, vacation \nrentals, and primary residences that have been renovated since the \nflood zone mapping was determined. But there are a number of homes that\n\n[[Page S3883]]\n\nare grandfathered into subsidies up to 65 percent. These are homes that \nwere built before 1975 or when their area's flood mapping was actually \ndone. These primary residences enjoy this subsidy, and will continue to \nunder the current bill.\n  What my amendment does not do is change the insurance rates or the \nsubsidy for those who are grandfathered into the current rate that we \ncall pre-firm, or before flood insurance rate maps were completed; in \nother words, these are folks who could legitimately have said they did \nnot know they were in a flood plain when they bought their home. I \nthink their rates and subsidies should stay the same.\n  What my amendment does is make the premiums for pre-firm properties \nsold after this bill's enactment the same actuarial rates of homes that \nwere built after the new mapping was complete, or post-firm. So it is a \nrelatively simple amendment, and I think it gives more equity to the \ntotal bill by making sure all properties are eventually treated \nequally.\n  So I will provide more detail tomorrow, but I hope the chairman will \nconsider both of those amendments because I would love to have his \nsupport.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3883-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I have an amendment which I understand the \nmanager for the majority will object to me calling up, but I would like \nto make some remarks about it, if I might, at this time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague would yield, I appreciate \nhis recognition of that. Again, our hope is something can be worked \nout. The objection is not based on the substance of the amendment as \nmuch as it is a question of whether the committee of jurisdiction which \nthis matter is being considered under has raised some concerns with our \ncolleague from South Dakota, and my hope is they can be resolved. So I \nwould have to object if he brought up the amendment, but certainly I \nwelcome his opportunity to talk about this amendment, and my hope is \nthat between now and tomorrow sometime, whatever the differences are \ncan be worked out, and we will be able to consider his amendment.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the chairman, the Senator from Connecticut, for \nthose words. Let me, if I might, make a couple of remarks with regard \nto the amendment and again suggest that if at all possible, we could \nfigure out a way to make it a part of this Flood Insurance Reform and \nModernization Act. I think it is very fitting on this bill. There are \nsome jurisdictional issues that have been raised. But what I would like \nto point out is that this is a bill which obviously has a lot of \nimportant content and legislation that needs to be acted upon by the \nCongress, by the Senate. The amendment that Senator Johnson and I have \noffered is directly relevant to the bill because it seeks to reduce the \npotential impact of FEMA's revised flood map for residents of Sioux \nFalls, SD, which is the largest city in my State. Above all, this \namendment allows the City of Sioux Falls to have the ability to advance \nthe funds associated with the Big Sioux Flood Control Project which was \nauthorized by the Congress in 1996.\n  Keep in mind, roughly 20 years ago, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \ndetermined that the original flood control project in Sioux Falls was \nineffective due to two significant flood events that occurred in 1957 \nand in 1969. The city and the Federal Government have been working \nsince 2000 to raise the height of the levees and to construct a dam. \nHowever, without the authority contained in this amendment, the \ncompletion of the Big Sioux Flood Control Project will languish until \nthe Federal Government's remaining share of the project is \nappropriated.\n  Effectively, with roughly $21 million in remaining Federal costs and \nthe fact that the average funding provided by Congress over the past 7 \nyears has been about $2 million per year, the city is at the mercy of \nthe Federal Government to complete this important project. If these \nflood protection improvements are not made, roughly $750 million in \nproperty damage could result in homes and businesses in a major flood \nevent.\n  Adding to the urgency for completing this important flood control \nproject is the fact that following Hurricane Katrina, the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency proposed modifications to the city's 100-\nyear flood plain, just as FEMA has done in other communities across the \ncountry, to ensure that homeowners are aware of potential flood risks. \nAs a result of FEMA's proposed flood plain modifications in Sioux \nFalls, until the Army Corps certifies completion of its project, \nroughly 1,600 homeowners and businesses will be required to purchase \nflood insurance. The quickest way to eliminate or reduce the need for \nflood insurance for the 1,600 homeowners and businesses is to complete \nconstruction of the Big Sioux Flood Control Project as soon as \npossible.\n  While the city has expressed a willingness to advance fund the \nFederal Government's remaining portion of the project, this would \nrequire Congress to act in a couple of ways. One is to allow the Army \nCorps to accept advance funding from the city for the Federal \nGovernment's portion of the project; second, to authorize the Army \nCorps to reimburse the city through future appropriations from the \nFederal Government's portion of the project.\n\n[[Page S3884]]\n\n  This straightforward amendment doesn't add any costs to the Federal \nGovernment. In fact, allowing the city to advance fund the remainder of \nthe project would actually reduce the Federal Government's overall cost \nbecause the project would be completed in a much shorter timeframe.\n  Such authorities have been extended to other Federal flood control \nprojects in the past. Senator Johnson and I are simply seeking \nadditional flexibility that will allow the city to expedite \nconstruction of the Big Sioux Flood Control Project. I believe the \ncity's willingness to advance fund this flood control project \nunderscores their commitment to finishing this much needed project.\n  I look forward to working with the bill managers to try to get this \namendment voted on, to get it included in the underlying bill as we \nwork to reform our Nation's flood insurance program.\n  I hope we can work through this jurisdictional issue because this is \nan issue of timing. There is another WRDA bill that may come down the \nroad, but the last one took 7 years to get on the floor of the Senate. \nI don't believe the next one will take that long. In any case, the city \nof Sioux Falls--the largest community in my State--is looking at 11 \nyears to complete this project.\n  As soon as FEMA designates this flood plain, 1,600 homeowners will be \nfaced with an insurance bill. All the city is trying to do is take the \ninitiative to complete this project in a more timely way by advance \nfunding it and then allowing the Federal Government, through the Corps, \nto reimburse through what would be annual appropriations, which could \ntake perhaps 11 or more years to get. I think this is a commonsense, \npractical solution. The city has stepped forward on this. I hope we can \ninclude it in this bill before we get to final passage.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all amendments \nto S. 2284 must be offered during Thursday's session, May 8; that the \nonly amendments in order on Monday be the pending substitute amendment; \nfurther that a managers' amendment still be in order if cleared by the \nmanagers and leaders, the McConnell amendment No. 4720, with the Allard \namendment No. 4721 withdrawn prior to a vote in relation to the \nMcConnell amendment; a Reid and others amendment relating to the \nsubject of energy; that the McConnell and Reid amendments be subject to \na 60-affirmative-vote threshold; that if either amendment achieves that \nthreshold, then the amendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table; that if neither achieves the 60-affirmative-\nvote threshold, then it be withdrawn; that the vote with respect to the \nMcConnell amendment No. 4720 occur at 5:30 p.m. Monday, May 12, to be \nfollowed by a vote in relation to the Reid, et al., amendment; that \nupon disposition of all amendments, the substitute amendment, as \namended, if amended, be agreed to; the bill read a third time, and the \nSenate then vote on passage of S. 2284, as amended; further that the \nprevious order which referenced H.R. 3121 be changed to reflect passage \nof a flood insurance bill, either S. 2284 or H.R. 3121, and the cloture \nmotion on amendment No. 4720 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank all involved. I thank the majority \nstaff, the minority staff, and the respective Members who helped us put \nthis agreement together. Basically, what it says is we have to offer, \ndebate, and vote on all amendments by the end of business tomorrow, and \nthen leaving off until next week the issue involving the energy issues \nwhich the majority leader talked about earlier this evening. That will \nallow us to hopefully complete consideration of the flood insurance \nbill.\n  I know I speak for Senator Shelby and other members of the committee, \nas I mentioned earlier, we passed this bill unanimously out of the \nBanking Committee some months ago. The fact that we will be able to \ncome to closure on the bill by the end of business tomorrow is good \nnews for literally millions of people who are counting on having a good \nflood insurance program.\n  I would like to make some unanimous consent requests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3884-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, this past weekend a front page article \nin the Washington Post reminded us of the devastating attack on the USS \nCole and the inability--or unwillingness--of the administration to see \nthe investigation to the finish line. Nearly 8 years since the attack \non the Cole, and 6\\1/2\\ since September 11, 2001, an attack directly \nlinked to al-Qaida--and to bin Laden himself--remains stalled, at best, \nwith few answers to key questions.\n  I would like to take a minute to remind my colleagues of the attack I \nam referring to--an attack perhaps not as seared into our memories as \nthose horrific ones of 9/11, but one that is equally as painful for \nthose who lost loved ones and are still waiting to hold someone to \naccount. On October 12, 2000, as the USS Navy destroyer Cole stopped \nbriefly to refuel in the harbor of Aden, Yemen, it was attacked by a \nsmall boat loaded with explosives. The attack killed 17 members of the \nship's crew, including a sailor from my home State of Wisconsin. At \nleast 39 others were wounded. According to the 9/11 Commission Report, \n``The plot . . .was a full-fledged al Qaida operation, supervised \ndirectly by [Osama] bin Laden.'' Although teams from the FBI and other \nU.S. agencies were immediately sent to Yemen to investigate, the Yemeni \ngovernment was hesitant to participate in the investigation.\n  While the Yemenis eventually agreed to a joint investigation, the 9/\n11 Commission Report notes that the CIA described Yemeni support for \nthe investigation as ``slow and inadequate'' and that in the early \nstages of the investigation President Clinton, Secretary Albright, and \nothers had to intervene to help. What followed was a number of arrests \nby the Yemeni government of people connected to the attack--including \nthose found to have close links to al-Qaida--but less than 3 years \nafter their arrest, 10 were able to escape from prison.\n  Shortly after the jail break, the Justice Department unveiled a 51-\ncount indictment against two of the escapees, including cell leader \nJamal al-Badawi. Both were indicted on various terror offenses, \nincluded the murder of U.S. nationals and U.S. military personnel. Yet \nYemen refused to extradite al-Badawi. Despite a trial in 2004 that \ncondemned him to death--a sentence which was later reduced to 15 years \nin prison al-Badawi dug his way to freedom in 2006 with a number of \nother convicts. Although he surrendered 20 months later, al-Badawi was \nable to strike a deal with the government which rendered him a free \nman. No one has been charged in U.S. courts and none of those \nimprisoned remain behind bars. The USS Cole investigation remains \nunfinished as there has been no real accountability for the deaths of \n17 Americans.\n  I am deeply troubled by the message we are sending to our enemies by \nallowing this investigation to languish, while many of those involved \nin the attack walk free. Since 2003, I have repeatedly requested \ninformation from the State and Defense Departments, CIA, and FBI about \nthese attacks, the circumstances surrounding the detention and escape \nof the suspects, and efforts to find and detain those involved. In \n2006, I wrote to Secretary Rice and the Director of National \nIntelligence, DNI, expressing grave concern about al-Badawi's multiple \nescapes and in 2007 I strongly condemned the Yemeni government's \ndecision to release him.\n\n[[Page S3885]]\n\n  There is little to inspire confidence in our efforts to hold these \nterrorists to account for their actions and even less to show for our \nwork to date. Our reliance on the government of Yemen to detain and \nprosecute these known members of al-Qaida--and their inability or \nunwillingness to do so--calls into question the partnerships and \nrelationships we have secured in our efforts to meet the number one \nthreat we face. The State Department's 2007 ``Country Terrorism \nReport'' notes that Yemen has ``experienced several setbacks to its \ncounterterrorism efforts'' and recounts multiple examples of the Yemeni \ngovernment's inability to apprehend escaped convicts--many of whom are \nmembers of al-Qaida and are associated with the USS Cole attack. \nFurthermore, for the past two years Yemen has been listed as a \nterrorist safe haven because of al-Qaida's ability to ``reconstitute \noperational cells there'' and carry out ``several terrorist attacks \nagainst tourist targets.''\n  How reliable is the Yemeni government as a partner in the fight \nagainst al-Qaida and its affiliates if it has been designated as a safe \nhaven for terrorists? What efforts are being taken to ensure the \nYemenis commit to combating terrorists and work with us to hold those \nresponsible for the USS Cole attack accountable? Can we assure the \nAmerican people that the Yemenis will ensure al-Qaida is denied access \nto resources, opportunities and safe spaces from which to operate? We \ncannot simply rely on others to do our work--especially when they are \nclearly not doing the job that needs to be done. We cannot sit back and \nallow others to take the reins while we remain distracted.\n  The war in Iraq has brought about a dramatic and regrettable shift in \nour priorities--a shift away from the top threat to our national \nsecurity. Despite the persistent calls from the majority of Americans, \nwe remain bogged down in Iraq--while it drains our resources, saps our \nattention, and depletes us of our ability to focus on our top national \nsecurity concerns. I am concerned that this same lack of focus may be \nbehind the administration's failures with respect to the attack on the \nCole. The administration has paid relatively little attention to the \nmarginalization of the USS Cole investigation, despite how critically \nimportant it remains to our national interest.\n  The global fight against al-Qaida and its affiliates must be our top \npriority, and the administration must take seriously its responsibility \nto ensure that the al-Qaida operatives behind the attack on the USS \nCole are held to account for their heinous actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3885-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL ARSON AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize \nNational Arson Awareness Week, May 4-10, and its theme for 2008: ``Toy-\nlike Lighters Playing with Fire.''\n  The major goal of National Arson Awareness Week is to promote \nnational recognition, awareness and understanding of the arson problem \nin the United States. By creating a new theme each year, the National \nArson Awareness Week encourages local communities to come together and \npromote a different aspect of arson awareness information. \nIntentionally set fires are a leading cause of fire deaths and a \nfrequent cause of financial losses in the United States. The theme for \nthis year's Arson Awareness Week, ``Toy-like Lighters--Playing with \nFire,'' focuses public attention on the dangers of toy-like or novelty \nlighters in the hands of children.\n  Novelty lighters are frequently mistaken by children for play toys, \nsome complete with visual effects, flashing lights and musical sounds. \nSuch cases of mistaken identity often carry devastating consequences.\n  National Arson Awareness Week greatly benefits communities in \nCalifornia and across the Nation, as it highlights awareness of the \ndangers posed by arson-related issues throughout local communities. I \ncommend the local fire departments and localities that have worked to \npromote awareness of the dangers posed by toy-like and novelty lighters \nthrough the National Arson Awareness Week of 2008.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3885-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3885-S3886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CELEBRATING PEARL HARBOR NAVAL SHIPYARD'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today, Senator Inouye and I celebrate the \n100th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. The Pearl Harbor \nNaval Shipyard has held a significant place in both Hawaii and our \nNation's history. Even before Congress passed an act in 1908 officially \ncreating the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard, Pearl Harbor has been an important \nport for ships and sailors from across the world.\n  Early in the 19th century, Pearl Harbor, or ``Wai-Momi,'' served as a \nprimary port for exploration and trade. By the late 1800s, the United \nStates was looking toward Pearl Harbor to serve as the center of its \nexpanding Pacific Fleet. On May 13, 1908, Congress solidified Pearl \nHarbor's strategic importance by appropriating $3 million to officially \nestablish the Navy Yard at Pearl Harbor. Over the next 33 years, the \nnew naval facility at Pearl Harbor was transformed into a site capable \nof basing the then-newly formed U.S. Pacific Fleet, and changed the \nface of Hawaii in the Pacific forever.\n  Every schoolchild in the United States learns about the events on the \nmorning of December 7, 1941. That was the day the U.S. Naval forces at \nPearl Harbor were devastated by the Imperial Japanese Navy's surprise \nattack. Nine ships of the U.S. Pacific Fleet sank, and more than 2,300 \nAmerican lives were lost. However, our children are taught far less \noften about the courageous resolve and dedication demonstrated by the \nshipyard's employees. After resurrecting much of the fleet from the \nbottom of Pearl Harbor, and repairing 18 of 21 severely damaged \nvessels, the workers earned the motto, ``We Keep Them Fit to Fight.'' \nTheir commitment to duty became a model of the U.S. war effort during \nWorld War II.\n  The effort and hard work by Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard personnel to \nmaintain the ships of the U.S. Navy helped to turn the tide of war at \nsea in the Battle of Midway. Their tireless work ultimately ensured \nthat of the ships damaged on December 7, salvaged, repaired, and \nreturned to service, one, the USS West Virginia, survived the duration \nof the war to sail triumphantly into Tokyo Bay in August 1945. The \nintegrity, ethos, and determination of Pearl Harbor Shipyard workers \ncontinued throughout the Cold War, and provided the United States with \na national treasure and a strategically critical base of operations for \nPacific naval and air power.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the rich history and unflagging service of \nthe men and women at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard highlighted by Senator \nAkaka continues today.\n  Once again our Nation is at war, and our Naval Forces engaged in the \nglobal war on terror can rely on the shipyard to provide top quality \nsupport. The shipyard's work focuses on the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and \nmakes the shipyard the largest repair facility between the west coast \nof the United States and the Far East. The shipyard provides full-\nservice maintenance for both the Pacific Fleet's ships and submarines \nthroughout the Asia-Pacific theater. In addition to this significant \nresponsibility, the shipyard has demonstrated its diverse capabilities \nby supporting our nation's space exploration, Antarctic expeditions, \nmissile defense, and its ability to rapidly respond by deploying \nworldwide to perform emergency repairs.\n  Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard is a national treasure, and it is known \nas ``No Ka Oi,'' or ``The Best'' Shipyard. In the tradition of \nupholding this moniker, it has earned multiple national awards for its \nexcellent safety and environmental stewardship programs. These awards \ninclude the prestigious Occupational Safety and Health Administration \nStar, and the White House Closing the Circle Environmental Quality \nAwards.\n  Beyond the numerous contributions to our U.S. Navy, the shipyard is \nalso an integral part of Hawaii. It is the largest single industrial \nemployer in the State, and its direct annual economic impact is greater \nthan $600 million in Hawaii. Through its apprentice, engineer co-op, \nand other student hire programs, Hawaii residents are provided with \nextraordinary training, employment, and career opportunities. For some \nfamilies this tradition to keep our ships and submarines ``fit to \nfight'' runs throughout a generation\n\n[[Page S3886]]\n\nand is being passed down to the next generation.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Honor, courage, and commitment are the core values of the \nPearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. These words speak volumes about both the \nlocal and national contributions of the proud men and women who have \nserved under its banner. I ask my colleagues to join with me in \nhonoring these outstanding Americans by celebrating the 100th \nanniversary of the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, and to wish it as much \nsuccess over the next century as it attained during the last.\n  Mr. INOUYE. When Congress established the ``Navy Yard Pearl Harbor'' \nin 1908, Hawaii and the U.S. Navy were inextricably linked together. \nJust as it did in 1908, America understands the need for a strong \npresence in the Asia-Pacific region. Both the shipyard and its \nachievements are special. However, it is the shipyard's heart, the \ndedicated men and women who work there, that make those achievements \npossible. I join my colleague Senator Akaka in celebrating the 100th \nanniversary of the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, and I look forward to \ncelebrating its future successes in the next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3886-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING MONSIGNOR JOSEPH G. QUINN\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, it is with the greatest respect and \npersonal gratitude that I stand today to honor our guest Chaplain, \nMonsignor Joseph G. Quinn, and thank him for his humble and moving \nblessing upon us this morning. I am proud to say that Monsignor Quinn \nhails from my hometown of Scranton, PA, and lives and works there today \nas pastor of St. Rose of Lima Parish in Carbondale.\n  Monsignor Quinn is one of the most dedicated and committed servants \nof God whom I have ever had the privilege to know. I am honored to say \nthat he is my good friend and has been an invaluable and steadfast \nfriend to my family for decades. He has provided us comfort and \nstrength in times of sorrow and loss. When my father, Governor Casey, \nwas ill and when he died in May of 2000, Monsignor Quinn grieved with \nus. In times of happiness and celebration like christenings and other \noccasions or celebrations, he has brought his sense of humor and his \nwarmth.\n  Monsignor Quinn is a beloved church servant. He has made \nextraordinary contributions to his family, the city and diocese of \nScranton and all of northeastern Pennsylvania. Interestingly, Monsignor \nQuinn's journey to the priesthood first took a detour through a short, \nbut remarkable, legal career. I would like to highlight just a few of \nhis accomplishments over the last three decades.\n  After graduating from the University of Scranton and Seton Hall \nUniversity School of Law in 1976, he was appointed a Federal \nmagistrate-judge for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of \nPennsylvania. Then 25 years of age, he was the youngest person in the \ncountry to serve in that position. After 6 years of distinguished \nservice in the judiciary, he answered his call to the priesthood and \nwent on to complete his studies at the North American College in Rome \nand was ordained in 1985.\n  Monsignor Quinn's numerous professional contributions include serving \nas: parish priest and pastor; dean of the Scranton Central Deanery of \nthe Diocese of Scranton; member of the Pennsylvania State Ethics \nCommission; diocesan moderator of the Bishop's Annual Appeal for the \n1998, 1999 and 2000 campaigns; member of both the Diocesan College of \nConsultors and the Diocesan Presbyteral Council; chairman of the \nDiocesan Communications Commission; member of the Board of Trustees of \nthe University of Scranton; and personal representative of the Bishop \nof Scranton to the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference, a statewide body \nthat addresses and advances public policy issues on behalf of the \nPennsylvania Bishops.\n  Monsignor Quinn has been a key contributor to the community in a wide \nvariety of capacities, and has been honored with numerous awards. The \nfollowing are just a sampling: the B'nai B'rith Americanism Award; the \nScranton Preparatory School Outstanding Alumnus of the Year as well as \nits most significant honor, The Ignatian Award; a Marywood University \nPresidential Scholarship in his honor; and the Lackawanna Bar \nAssociation's President's Award as well its highest award, the Chief \nJustice Michael J. Eagan Award. The University of Scranton honored \nMonsignor Quinn with its O'Hara Award in recognition of his community \nservice, and in the fall of 2004, the Monsignor's nearly 30 years of \nservice by naming a Presidential scholarship in his honor. In 2005, \nScranton's Central City Ministerium named Monsignor Quinn its Clergyman \nof the Year.\n  These are only a few of Monsignor Quinn's many awards and \naccomplishments. He should be proud of these commendations but I have \nno doubt that his tremendous joy in serving God through service to his \nbrothers and sisters in Christ, each and every day is what continues to \ninspire him.

Mr. President, I wish to give special recognition \nto the music department of Bridger High School for putting together an \naward-winning music education program. By demonstrating outstanding \ncommitment to music education, Bridger High School won this year's \nGRAMMY' Signature School Award. This distinction is a \nnational honor and a cause for celebration for the town of Bridger in \nmy home State of Montana.\n  Music plays an integral part in our daily lives. It helps to define \nwho we are as individuals and as a nation. Through music we celebrate, \nwe laugh, we grieve and we heal. An old song, like an old friend, helps \nto recall feelings and memories lost in time.\n  The power of music is undeniable. Music education, therefore, is a \nsound investment. It teaches discipline and provides an avenue to \nexpress deep and powerful emotions. It enhances a student's performance \nin other subject areas. It makes a fundamental difference in the \nquality of life.\n  It makes an even bigger difference in the lives of students from \neconomically underserved school districts. Bridger is a small town with \na population less than 1,000. Under the watchful guidance of their \nmusic director Michel Sticka and principal John Ballard, the 28 music \nstudents from Bridger High strived to distinguish themselves and their \nschool. They have succeeded. And so, they deserve our respect and \nadmiration.\n  Being selected as a GRAMMY' Signature School is no small \ntask. Bridger High School competed against 20,000 other public schools \nacross the Nation to capture the distinction. In addition, the students \nat Bridger High went on to win the GRAMMY' Signature Schools \nEnterprise Award. The award recognizes three schools across the country \nfor their efforts towards achieving music excellence. This national \nhonor comes with a grant of $5,000 designed to benefit Bridger High's \nmusic program.\n  Because of a strong music education, for the students of Bridger \nHigh, the greatest reward comes from the lifelong benefit of being able \nto lead richer and fuller lives.\n  I couldn't be more proud of the students and faculty members at \nBridger High School. They have gone above and beyond to put Bridger, \nMT, on the map, setting the standard for all Montana schools. I join my \nfellow Montanans in a chorus of praise for these 28 bright students on \ntheir extraordinary achievements: Benton D. Asbury, Katryna N. Asbury, \nSamantha J. Bobby, Jonathan E. Bostwick, Devon B. Caballero, Jenny M. \nCooke, Jessica Denney, Karissa J. DeRudder, Sommer D. Dykstra, Rebekah \nEdelman, Hayden D. Forsythe, Hannah Goetz, Jacey K. Griswold, Elliott \nG.

Mr. President, I am proud to honor a group of 97 \nWorld War II veterans from Louisiana who are traveling to Washington, \nDC, this weekend to visit the various memorials and monuments that \nrecognize the sacrifices of our Nation's invaluable servicemembers.\n  Louisiana HonorAir, a group based in Lafayette, LA, is sponsoring \nthis Saturday's trip to the Nation's Capital. The organization is \nhonoring each surviving World War II Louisiana veteran by giving them \nan opportunity to see the memorials dedicated to their service. On this \ntrip, the veterans will visit the World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Iwo \nJima memorials. They will also travel to Arlington National Cemetery to \nlay a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknowns.\n  This is the ninth flight Louisiana HonorAir will make to Washington, \nDC.\n  World War II was one of America's greatest triumphs, but was also a \nconflict rife with individual sacrifice and tragedy. More than 60 \nmillion people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, \nand more than 400,000 American service members were slain during the \nlong war. The ultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in \nEurope is a testament to the valor of American soldiers, sailors, \nairmen and marines. The years 1941 to 1945 also witnessed an \nunprecedented mobilization of domestic industry, which supplied our \nmilitary on two distant fronts.\n  In Louisiana, there remain today more than 40,000 living WWII \nveterans, and each one has a heroic tale of achieving the noble victory \nof freedom over tyranny. The oldest in this Honor-Air group was born in \n1913. They began their service as early as 1938, before the bombing of \nPearl Harbor, and some members of this group served as late as 1979. \nThey served in various branches of the military--34 members in the \nArmy; 14 in the Army Air Corps; 37 in the Navy; 8 in the Marines; 1 in \nthe USO; and 3 in the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  Our heroes served across the globe, participating in major invasions \nsuch as those at Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Guadalcanal, Leyte, the \nPhillippines, and southern France. One was a prisoner of war in Italy, \nanother served under General Patton, and one flew 35 bombing missions \nover Europe.\n  Many of these veterans earned Purple Hearts, Bronze Star Medals, Air \nMedals and Navy Crosses.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in honoring these 97 veterans, all \nLouisiana heroes, that we welcome to Washington this weekend and \nLouisiana HonorAir for making these trips a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3887-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING TINA FLETCHER\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the work of \nan outstanding young woman who has served Arkansas and our Nation this \nspring as an intern in my office, Tina L. Fletcher of Plumerville, AK.\n  Last month, Tina, a senior at the University of Arkansas, was named \nthe 2008 recipient of the Henry Woods Student Leadership Award, which \nrecognizes one outstanding student leader and his or her contributions \nto the University of Arkansas campus community. She is the ninth \nrecipient of the Woods award and will receive a $750 scholarship.\n  Friends and associates of Henry Woods created this award to honor his \n25 years of service in the Washington, DC, area. While in Washington, \nWoods worked for U.S. Representative Bill Alexander and U.S. Senators \nDavid Pryor and Dale Bumpers. I was also fortunate enough to have Henry \nwork in my Washington office for a short time and lend his years of \nexperience to my staff. Prior to his professional service with in \nCongress, Henry was active in numerous campus organizations and served \nfor 2 years as editor of the Razorback yearbook while attending the \nUniversity of Arkansas.\n  In addition to winning the Henry Woods award, Tina is a Silas H. Hunt \ndistinguished scholar and member of the Political Science Honor \nSociety, Pi Sigma Alpha. She is a graduating senior in the J. William \nFulbright College of Arts and Sciences completing a combined major in \npolitical science and African-American studies.\n  In addition to serving as the former secretary of Pi Sigma Alpha, \nTina also served as the 2007 president of the Kappa Iota Chapter of \nAlpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., the 2007 vice-president of the Black \nStudents Association, and is the founder and first President of \nS.A.S.S.: Students Advocating Stronger Sisterhood. Tina is an active \nmember of the Connections Mentoring Program, Order of Omega, and Tri-\nCouncil.\n  In November 2007, Tina was selected as one of 10 students to serve as \na Congressional Black Caucus/Wal-Mart Emerging Leaders intern. She was \namong the first group of students to receive the Silas H. Hunt \ndistinguished scholarship. Tina has also received many additional \nhonors and awards since arriving at the University of Arkansas as a \nfreshman in 2004 including being named the NAACP's University of \nArkansas Legend.\n  Recently admitted into Harvard University, Tina will pursue her \nmasters of education degree in political philosophy/political science \nand history during the upcoming school year. After receiving her \nmaster's degree, Tina plans to teach high school within the Delta \nregion's urban and impoverished school districts.\n  Mr. President, it goes without saying that the future looks bright \nfor Tina Fletcher. While we will certainly miss her, we wish her the \nbest in all her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3887-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3887-S3888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING LEW WILLIAMS, JR.\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to talk about one \nof Alaska's greatest newspaper publishers and newsmen. Lew Williams, \nJr. was a fixture in Ketchikan, AK, one of the State's largest cities \nas I was growing up in nearby Wrangell. Lew unfortunately passed away \nat age 83 this past Saturday, leaving a hole in the fabric of Alaska \njournalism that may never be fully patched.\n  Mr. Williams was a successful publisher, no simple accomplishment \nwhen publishing newspapers in relatively small Alaska towns is \nexpensive, newsprint had to come by barge from thousands of miles away, \nand advertisers and readers were sometimes far too scarce. But he never \nscrimped on his product and was fearless in writing strong, clear and \nalways factually accurate and well reasoned editorials.\n  Lew was a champion in supporting statehood for Alaska back in the \nmid-1950s. Along with Robert Atwood, the former publisher of the \nAnchorage Times, and C.J. Snedden, the long-time publisher of the \nFairbanks News Miner, Mr. Williams was one of the three pioneer \npublishers and editors in Alaska who did more to establish modern \nAlaska than most community leaders and politicians. Avoiding the trend \nto sell his publication to outside chains, his daughter Tena remains as \npublisher of the newspaper today.\n  He also was a leading light in improving journalism in Alaska, being \nthe founder in 1965, just 6 years after Statehood, of the Alaska \nNewspaper Publishers' Association, the forerunner to today's Alaska \nNewspaper Association. He served as president of each organization and \nlater as director of the regional Allied Daily Newspaper Association.\n  Mr. Williams was born in Spokane, WA, in November 1924, the son of \ntwo reporters, Lew M. Williams, Sr., and Winfred--Dow--Williams, who \nworked for newspapers in Tacoma, WA. The Williams family moved to \nJuneau in 1935, where his father worked for the Juneau Empire. In 1939 \nLew Williams, Sr., purchased the Wrangell Sentinel, starting a history \nof newspaper publishing in Alaska which continues to this day.\n  After serving as a sergeant in the paratroopers in World War II, Lew \nJr. ran the Wrangell Sentinel for the family. He married Dorothy M. \nBaum in July 1954. The couple bought the Petersburg Press and acquired \nthe Wrangell Sentinel from Mr. Williams' parents when they retired. \nThey later sold the two newspapers and bought the Daily Sitka \nSentinel--Sitka being the site of Alaska's first pulp mill started \nafter WW II--and also bought an interest in the Ketchikan Daily News.\n  Ketchikan, a sawmill town in the heart of the Tongass National \nForest, later saw its own pulp mill develop. The Williams sold the \nSitka paper to\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\nconcentrate on the Ketchikan paper. But Lew was quick to help \nreestablish small papers in both Petersburg and Wrangell.\n  Like many newspaper publishers, Lew Jr. was active in his community. \nHe served on the Wrangell School Board, as mayor of Petersburg, and on \nnumerous State boards including the Alaska Judicial Council, on the \nBoard of Regents of the University of Alaska and as a member of the \nBoard of Governors of the Alaska Bar Association. He served on the \nState boards under every State Governor, Democratic or Republican, \nthrough his retirement in 1999. He also served as the first secretary \nof the Petersburg Fish and Game Advisory Board just after statehood, \nhelping to foster the State's strong fisheries ethics that helped \nsalmon to recover from the catch disasters of the 1950s to the all-time \nrecords for salmon harvest currently being produced in Alaska.\n  Besides government positions, Mr. Williams was a lifetime member of \nthe Petersburg Elks Lodge 1615, the American Legion, the Pioneers of \nAlaska, a past president of Rotary, and for 29 years was an adult \nleader in the Boy Scout program. He also was active in the Democratic \nParty and was awarded an honorary doctorate of humanities by the \nUniversity of Alaska Southeast. He also was the founder of the regional \nSoutheast Conference and was named Citizen of the Year by both the \nAlaska State Chamber of Commerce and the Greater Ketchikan Chamber of \nCommerce in the early 1980s. He won statewide recognition as the \nAlaskan of the Year in 1991.\n  But this speech is not meant as an obituary, but as a way for me to \nstate my deepest appreciation for a man who epitomized Alaska during \nthe past 70 years. He was a man who loved the beauty of Alaska, \nenjoying hunting and fishing on the nearby Stikine River. He also \npushed for the development of Alaska from its timber industry in the \nsoutheast to the fishing industry around the State. He was a strong \nvoice in favor of the aquaculture movement in the 1970s that helped the \nState preserve and grow its wild salmon populations. He also was a \ntireless supporter of environmentally sensitive oil and gas \ndevelopment, first in Cook Inlet and later in northern Alaska. Lew, \nhaving lived in the grinding poverty of Alaska long before statehood, \nalways understood that Alaskans needed and still need good jobs and a \nstrong economy so that the State can develop an economy strong enough \nto support good educational institutions, community infrastructure and \nallow the development of good health care and social service programs. \nHe knew that Alaskans could grow the economy and protect our wildlife \nand environment. He never set up an artificial confrontation between \nthe two goals.\n\n  After his retirement, Lew wrote with the late Evangeline Atwood, the \nbook ``Bent Pins to Chains: Alaska and its Newspapers.'' The 2006 book \nis a lively history of Alaska as described through the development of \nits newspaper industry. The book, better than most, tells the tales of \nlife in both the territory and State of Alaska as seen through \nreporters, editors and publishers. Lew, undoubtedly wrote the book as a \nway of honoring the many talented writers and editors that have \npracticed in Alaska over the past 49 years since statehood, many of \nthem reporters he helped recruit out of journalism schools, and helped \nmentor and train once they arrived.\n  As his obituary earlier this week in the Ketchikan Daily News said, \n``He believed the editorial was the heart and strength of any \nnewspaper. He editorialized for Alaska State, for the creation of the \nstate ferry system, for the trans-Alaska pipeline, for power \ndevelopment, in support of the timber and fishing industries, and for \nairports, harbors and roads.''\n  Alaskans have seen countless columns and editorials explaining to \nAmericans--who never wanted to really understand the issue--why it was \nfully proper for some of Alaska's Federal highway funds to go for \nconstruction of a bridge from downtown Ketchikan to the city's airport, \nso that those who needed to fly out of the State's fifth largest city \ncould actually get to their flights when high winds or low tides \nrendered the ferry system to the airport inoperative. For those who \nneeded to catch emergency medivac flights, a bridge was no expensive \ntrinket, but a life-saving link to the outside world. Lew always \nchampioned Alaska.\n  I can only say to his wife Dorothy, to his daughters Christena--Tena \nfor short--and Kathryn, his son Lew III, and his daughter-in-law Vicki, \nand granddaughters Kristie, Jodi, and Melissa Williams, and great-\ngrandson Milan Browne, all of Ketchikan; and his sisters: Susan \nPagenkopf of Juneau and Jane Ferguson of California, how much he will \nbe missed. Those in public life will miss his balanced and fair \neditorials, his prodding and his support. We will miss his ethics and \ndeep-seated sense of fair-play and ethics. And we will miss his wise \ncounsel and thoughtfulness and compassion.\n  Alaska, and the Nation, has lost a great citizen. Goodbye Lew, we \nwill never forget you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3888-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3888-S3889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING READY SEAFOOD\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I celebrate the outstanding \nachievements of two brothers from Portland, ME, who recently won the \nU.S. Small Business Administration's Young Entrepreneurs of the Year \nAward on the local, regional, and national levels. John and Brendan \nReady are the founders and owners of Ready Seafood and Catch a Piece of \nMaine, two highly successful firms that have transformed the Maine \nlobster market. I had the pleasure of meeting with the brothers just 2 \nweeks ago, and they are a true reflection of the dedication and zeal of \nMaine's legendary lobstermen.\n  The Ready brothers grew up in Cape Elizabeth, on Maine's picturesque \ncoast, where they quickly grew fond of the sea. Venturing out with \ntheir uncle to catch lobsters, the pair learned the intricacies of the \ntrade before their teenage years, and they continued to fish throughout \nhigh school. Attentive to their lifelong passion for lobstering, the \nbrothers returned from college during summer breaks and even weekends \nto lobster. Additionally, John spent an extra year at Boston University \nto participate as a lobsterman in a co-op program.\n  When they arrived back in Maine following college--John from Boston \nUniversity and Brendan from Stonehill College--the duo immediately \nsought to enter the Maine seafood market. In 2004, they opened Ready \nSeafood, a thriving wholesaler of fresh lobster and other seafood to \ndomestic clients, as well as customers as far away as Italy, China, and \nJapan. To promote Maine's rich history of lobstering, the firm provides \nboth internships and unique educational opportunities to high school \nand college students in the region, including an inside look at how \nPortland's waterfront works. The brothers have visibly transformed the \ncompany into a $10 million business in just 4 short years.\n  In October 2007, seeking to create a one of its kind company in the \ncrowded seafood industry, the Ready brothers launched Catch a Piece of \nMaine, a remarkable and innovative company that allows individuals and \ncorporate clients alike to purchase lobsters caught especially for \nthem. The buyers pay an annual fee, which entitles them to have their \nown personal lobsterman set their traps and collect their lobsters. The \ncompany began with 400 traps for 2008, all of which were in place by \nlast Thursday, and each is guaranteed to garner a minimum of 40 \nlobsters throughout the remainder of the year. The lobsters are shipped \nat intervals scheduled by the client, and each shipment includes one \npound of mussels and clams, a Maine dessert, and the traditional bibs \nand utensils essential to enjoying Maine's famed crustacean.\n  The program includes some additional distinctive features. Customers \nkeep in touch with their personal lobstermen through the Internet by \nlogging onto an individualized and regularly updated summary, including \nhow many lobsters have been caught and when the traps were checked. \nMoreover, clients can have their lobsters shipped anywhere in the \ncontinental United States, making a great holiday gift, corporate thank \nyou, or special anniversary dinner. Ever mindful of the future of \nMaine's gorgeous coast and those who rely on it, the Ready brothers \nsend 10 percent of their profits to the Gulf of Maine Research \nInstitute for marine ecosystem education programs for schoolchildren \nthroughout the State.\n\n[[Page S3889]]\n\n  The fundamentally forthright business philosophy of the Ready \nbrothers is truly impressive. They represent the next generation of \nMaine lobstermen, and as such they continue and share the heritage of \nthe State's prized tradition. Through both Ready Seafood and Catch a \nPiece of Maine, the brothers have already taken great steps to doing \njust that. I commend both Brendan and John for their originality and \ndedication--and for garnering the U.S. Small Business Administration's \nYoung Entrepreneurs of the Year Award--and wish them well in their \nextremely bright futures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3889-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3889-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3889-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13338 OF MAY 11, 2004, WITH \nRESPECT TO THE BLOCKING OF PROPERTY OF CERTAIN PERSONS AND PROHIBITION \n   OF EXPORTATION AND RE-EXPORTATION OF CERTAIN GOODS TO SYRIA--PM 46\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to enhance \npublic and private research efforts to develop new tools and therapies \nthat prevent, detect, and cure diseases; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a new bill, \nthe Accelerating Cures Act of 2008, to enhance public and private \nresearch efforts to develop new tools and therapies that prevent, \ndetect, and cure diseases more quickly from bench to bedside. I \nintroduced an earlier version of this legislation in December 2005, the \nAmerican Center for Cures Act of 2005, S. 2104. Fundamentally, the \nAccelerating Cures Act of 2008 has the same intent to promote clinical \nand translational research within the National Institutes of Health \nwhile incorporating many of the recommendations made from the 2003 \nNational Academy of Sciences Report, ``Enhancing the Vitality of the \nNational Institutes of Health: Organizational Change to Meet New \nChallenges.''\n  The NIH is a successful, worldwide leader in biomedical research \nwhose mission is to support ``science in pursuit of fundamental \nknowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the \napplication of that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the \nburdens of illness and disability.'' Our national investment in NIH is \nintegral to our Nation's capacity to respond safely and effectively to \npublic and population health threats, chronic disease prevention and \nmanagement, and burdensome orphan diseases. The 2006 NIH \nreauthorization strengthened the agency even further, and also brought \na greater focus on clinical and translational research to its mission.\n  The Accelerating Cures Act of 2008 would build upon the progress of \nNIH reauthorization and further enhance the ability of the agency to \naddress clinical and translational research barriers. For example, it \nis estimated to take up to 17 years for a scientific discovery to be \ntranslated into a clinical application. This gap will not be resolved \nunless we take serious action to implement clinical and translational \nresearch initiatives, critically evaluate the impact of health care \ndelivery, promote multi- and cross-disciplinary collaboration, increase \nthe number of clinicians engaged in clinical and translational \nresearch, and foster efforts that streamline the translational \ndevelopment process to result in product commercialization.\n  The Accelerating Cures Act of 2008 would address these issues by \ncreating new programs that fund high-risk, high-reward research, to \noversee and direct promising avenues of translational research, to \nincrease the translational and clinical research workforce, and to \nprovide new funds and authorities to evaluate the clinical \neffectiveness of various treatments and procedures at the NIH. The bill \nexpands upon existing infrastructure in the Office of Portfolio \nAnalysis and Strategic Initiatives and encourages intra- and inter-\nagency collaboration to build on strengths of NIH's 27 institutes and \ncenters and other Federal agencies such as the Department of Defense, \nFood and Drug Administration, and the Agency for Healthcare Research \nand Quality. Lastly, the Accelerating Cures Act of 2008 uniquely adds \nresources to guide researchers through the `Valley of Death,' a stage \nin biomedical development between research and commercialization where \nthe success of an initiative is dependent on feasibility and \nprofitability that can only be established by a market that, by \ndefinition, has not yet developed. With the bill's strengthening and \nbroadening of the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business \nTechnology Transfer programs and making available resources such as the \nRapid Access to Intervention Development and Translational Development \nprograms, investigators, institutions, small businesses, and other \nentities, will be better suited to navigate the regulatory and \ncommercialization processes.\n  To summarize, the NIH has been and continues to be our Nation's \npremier biomedical research investment in areas of basic science and \nclinical and translational research. My legislation seeks to expand \nupon existing clinical and translational research efforts not only to \nmeet the healthcare needs of this Nation, but to maintain the NIH's \nstatus as the most respected research institution in the World. This \nbill will not only increase our overall Federal investment in the NIH, \nbut enhance our translational and clinical research capacities overall. \nI urge my Senate colleagues, patient advocacy groups, and researchers \nto work together to bring new hope to Americans that we can fight and \nconquer disease.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2988\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Institutes of Health (referred to in this \n     section as the ``NIH'') is the United States premier \n     biomedical research investment with annual appropriations \n     exceeding $29,200,000,000.\n       (2) The goals of the NIH are to--\n       (A) foster fundamental creative discoveries, innovative \n     research strategies, and their applications as a basis to \n     significantly advance the Nation's capacity to protect and \n     improve health;\n       (B) develop, maintain, and renew scientific human and \n     physical resources that will ensure the Nation's capacity to \n     prevent disease;\n       (C) expand the knowledge base in medical and associated \n     sciences in order to enhance the Nation's economic well-being \n     and ensure a continued high return on the public investment \n     in research; and\n       (D) exemplify and promote the highest level of scientific \n     integrity, public accountability, and social responsibility \n     in the conduct of science.\n       (3) Thus, the NIH is tasked with applying basic science \n     discoveries to protect and improve health. This includes, \n     translational research, which is the scientific work \n     necessary to develop a clinical application from a basic \n     science discovery.\n       (4) The United States translational research investment \n     will be key to the Nation responding effectively--\n       (A) to public and population health threats;\n       (B) to the complex nature of chronic diseases, which are \n     responsible for 7 out of 10 deaths in the United States, for \n     75 percent of\n\n[[Page S3895]]\n\n     the $2,300,000,000,000 spent annually on healthcare in the \n     United States, and for 16 percent of gross domestic product;\n       (C) to research and development vacuums in the private for-\n     profit market, such as in the fields of vaccine and \n     antibiotic production, drugs for Third World diseases, orphan \n     drugs, and medical tools for pediatric populations; and\n       (D) to facilitate the process of converting medical \n     innovations into commercial products.\n       (5) Key components of the translational research process \n     include research prioritization, a strengthening and \n     maintenance of an expert workforce, multidisciplinary \n     collaborative work, strategic risk taking, support of small \n     innovative businesses caught along common pathways in the \n     research and development Valley of Death, simplification and \n     promotion of the clinical research endeavor, and early \n     involvement of private entities that are skilled in the \n     manufacturing and marketing process in the translational \n     research endeavor.\n       (6) A National Academy of Sciences/Institute of Medicine \n     report made recommendations for reorganizing NIH to meet new \n     challenges facing the biomedical research endeavor. The \n     committee report contained specific recommendations aimed at \n     strengthening clinical and translational research including: \n     increasing trans-NIH research, promoting innovation and risk \n     taking in intramural research, creating a ``special \n     projects'' program, and increasing funding for research \n     management and support.\n       (7) The Government Accountability Office reported that \n     although the pharmaceutical industry has increased its \n     research and development investment by 147 percent from 1993 \n     to 2004, new drug applications to the Food and Drug \n     Administration have only increased by 39 percent; thus, the \n     productivity of the industry's research and development \n     expenditures is declining. The report cited that a limited \n     scientific understanding of how to translate research \n     discoveries into safe and effective drugs is contributing to \n     the problem and recommended that training researchers who can \n     translate drug discoveries into effective medicines is \n     necessary.\n       (8) It is estimated to take 17 years for a science \n     discovery to be translated from the point of proof of concept \n     to clinical application. The percent of physicians engaged in \n     research has declined steadily from a peak of 4.6 percent in \n     1985 to 1.8 percent in 2003.\n       (9) A report by the Infectious Disease Society of America \n     cited concerns with the lack of new antibiotics to treat \n     infectious diseases. The report commended the NIH Roadmap, \n     but also recommended that NIH aggressively expand the \n     translational research components of the Roadmap, increase \n     grants to small businesses, universities, and nonprofits \n     working in antibiotics research and development, and seek \n     more opportunities to partner with pharmaceutical and biotech \n     companies.\n       (10) Clinical effectiveness results provide patients, \n     payers, and clinicians with tools to evaluate the benefits \n     versus risks of the ever evolving number of prevention, \n     diagnosis, and treatment strategies available.\n       (11) The Common Fund is an annual set aside account created \n     from an agreed upon percentage of the annual budget that \n     supports innovative and trans-NIH initiatives to improve and \n     accelerate research to impact health.\n       (12) The ``Valley of Death'' is a stage in biomedical \n     development between research and commercialization where the \n     success of a product is dependent on its profitability.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create a new \n     pathway to curing disease by enhancing public and private \n     research to translate new discoveries from bench to bedside.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto implement a National Neurotechnology Initiative, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is estimated that 199 million \nAmericans--or one in three--suffer from some kind of brain or nervous \nsystem illness, injury or disorder. Among these illnesses are \ndebilitating diseases and conditions, including: Alzheimer's, multiple \nsclerosis, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury. \nThese diseases are challenging for the patients and for their loved \nones, who often have intense caretaker burdens.\n  In addition, our men and women fighting overseas are suffering from \nthese conditions in record numbers. The signature injuries of the \ncurrent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are brain and spinal cord \ninjuries, such as traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, and paralysis. For example, it is estimated that as many as \n12 percent to 20 percent of servicemembers who have served in Iraq \nsuffer from PTSD alone.\n  The combined economic burden of these illnesses and disorders is \nestimated at $1 trillion annually--and this cost is rising quickly as \nour population ages and our military conflicts continue. Recent \ndiscoveries are revolutionizing our understanding of the human brain, \nand new uses for these discoveries are emerging almost every day. At \nthe same time, researchers still have a limited understanding of the \nhuman brain and how best to diagnose, treat, and cure its diseases. The \ncurrent research system for neurological diseases is disjointed and \noften limits this life altering research from reaching the patients in \nneed. For example, compared to the average drug, it costs nearly $100 \nmillion more--and takes 2 years longer--to bring a drug that treats a \nneurological disease to the market.\n  We need a targeted, coordinated, national effort to support the \ndevelopment of neurotechnology. It is vitally important that public \ninfrastructure be developed to ensure that today's neurotechnology \ndiscoveries quickly become tools to improve the human condition. This \nresearch has the potential to transform highly specialized areas of \nmedicine, computing, and defense. It could dramatically change \nAmericans' everyday lives.\n  The National Neurotechnology Initiative Act addresses each of these \nissues. I am proud to be an original cosponsor with my colleague from \nNew Mexico. Under this proposal, the National Institutes of Health \nwould receive funds to coordinate research and\n\n[[Page S3900]]\n\nmove research into innovative companies developing the next generation \nof treatments.\n  This legislation will also accelerate research and treatment of \nneurological diseases by removing key bottlenecks in the system. It \nwill coordinate neurological research across Federal agencies, create a \ncoordinated blueprint for neuroscience at the NIH, and streamline the \nFDA approval process for life changing neuro drugs--without sacrificing \nsafety. All of this will mean more treatments faster for millions of \nAmericans.\n  This act is an investment in America's neurological health. \nInvestigation into the mechanisms and functions of the brain will lead \nto vastly improved understanding of brain disease and injuries and \nhuman behavior. It will give us an unprecedented ability to treat and \nheal those in need. The act also will dramatically reduce healthcare \ncosts while expanding the American neurotechnology industry and \ncreating good American jobs. Finally, this bill will help us honor our \ndebt to the brave men and women of America's armed forces.\n  Today, I am proud to introduce this legislation with Senator \nDomenici. I thank him for his leadership on this issue, and I look \nforward to working with him and my other colleagues to pass this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator Murray, to introduce the National Neurotechnology Initiative \nAct of 2008. Our bill will coordinate and accelerate federal brain and \nnervous system research, and will help move that research from the \nlaboratory into the hands of patients.\n  It is estimated that approximately 100 million Americans--one in \nthree--suffer from some kind of neurological illness, disorder, or \ninjury. These include some of the most debilitating illnesses, such as \nAlzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, autism, \nschizophrenia, and stroke. They include issues with a neurological \nbasis that often goes unnoticed, such as obesity and hearing loss. They \nalso include issues of particular importance to Senator Murray and me: \ntraumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, and other neurological effects suffered by the brave men and \nwomen of our armed forces as they execute their missions throughout the \nworld.\n  The total economic burden of these neurological illnesses, disorders, \nand injuries is estimated to be more than one trillion dollars every \nyear. These costs include direct medical treatment, long-term care for \nsenior citizens who have been incapacitated by a neurological disease, \naddiction-related costs, secondary medical costs related to obesity, \nand so on.\n  As the baby boom generation ages, the cost associated with these \nillnesses will increase rapidly, straining our healthcare resources \neven further than they already are. Now is the time to act to promote \nthe development of diagnostics, treatments, and cures that will restore \nhealth and reduce costs.\n  Our armed forces too often suffer from a traumatic brain injury, \nwhich is among the primary types of casualty that disables our service \nmembers. Some soldiers also suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder \nas well. We owe it to these heroic warriors to help them heal as \nquickly and as completely as possible.\n  The National Neurotechnology Initiative Act is designed to address \nfour key issues currently slowing the development of neurological \ntreatments, and to rapidly accelerate R for only three percent of the \nannual NIH brain research budget. The first is a lack of coordination \nbetween the many agencies that conduct brain research. The bill creates \na coordinating office that will help ensure that the Department of \nDefense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Institutes of \nHealth, and other agencies know what every other agency is doing, and \nthat they work together toward common goals.\n  The second issue is insufficient coordination within the National \nInstitutes of Health. Sixteen different Institutes, Centers, and \noffices within NIH conduct research on the brain and nervous system, \nand they have begun to work together through a program called the \nBlueprint for Neuroscience Research. This bill authorizes and fully \nfunds that program.\n  The third issue is the need to translate basic research into \ntreatments. Advances in neurotechnology are useless if they merely sit \nin the lab. This bill boosts neuroscience-related technology transfer \nthrough the SBIR and STTR programs.\n  The fourth issue is regulatory approval of new neurotechnology drugs, \ndiagnostics, and devices. Brain-related treatments take much longer and \ncost much more to approve than other treatments. This bill will \nincrease the timeliness and safety of the neurotechnology review \nprocess by allowing the FDA to hire and train neuroscience experts and \nto work with industry to develop neurotechnology standards.\n  The bill also supports the analysis of societal implications of \nneuroscience and neurotechnology, so that we know we are proceeding \nthoughtfully and carefully in our research.\n  Brain and nervous system research is an issue that has been extremely \nimportant to me throughout my time in the Senate. I have long been a \nsupporter of the MIND Research Network, which does amazing work on \nthese issues in New Mexico; and I have worked hard to advance our \nability to treat and cure brain and nervous system diseases and \ndisorders. I hope that this legislation will be part of my legacy in \nthis area.\n  I want to thank my good friend Senator Murray for asking me to join \nher on this very important issue. I appreciate her commitment to \nadvancing this important research and I look forward to working with \nher to pass this legislation this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Alexander, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S 2990. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove access of Medicare beneficiaries to intravenous immune \nglobulines; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have the opportunity this year to help a \ngroup of Medicare beneficiaries who are currently subject to costly, \nbureaucratic red tape which is delaying essential, life-saving \ntreatments to some of our most vulnerable citizens. Addressing this \nproblem will increase the quality of life for many patients and ease \nfinancial burdens for their medical providers.\n  Between 6,000 and 10,000 Medicare beneficiaries have primary \nimmunodeficiency diseases, PIDD, and require intravenous \nimmunoglobulin, IVIG treatment to maintain a healthy immune system.\n  Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases are disorders in which part of the \nbody's immune system is missing or does not function properly. These \ndisorders are caused by intrinsic or genetic defects in the immune \nsystem. Untreated primary immune deficiencies result in frequent life-\nthreatening infections and debilitating illnesses. Even illnesses such \nas the common cold or the flu, while unpleasant for most of us, can be \ndeadly for someone with PIDD.\n  Because of advances in our medical understanding and treatment of \nprimary immune deficiency diseases, individuals who in the past would \nnot have survived childhood are now able to live nearly normal lives. \nWhile there is still no cure for PIDD, there are effective treatments \navailable. Nearly 70 percent of primary immune deficient patients use \nintravenous immunoglobulin to maintain their health.\n  Immunoglobulin is a naturally occurring collection of highly \nspecialized proteins, known as antibodies, which strengthen the body's \nimmune response. It is derived from human plasma donations and is \nadministered through an IV to the patient every three to four weeks.\n  Currently, Medicare beneficiaries needing IVIG treatments are \nexperiencing access problems--an unintended result of the way Medicare \nhas determined the payment for IVIG. The current IVIG access and care \nissue began in January 2005 as a result of the Medicare Modernization \nAct under Part B, which changed the way physicians and hospital \noutpatient departments were paid under Medicare. The law reduced IVIG \nreimbursement rates such that most physicians in outpatient settings \ncould no longer afford to treat Medicare patients requiring IVIG. In \naddition, access to home based infusion\n\n[[Page S3901]]\n\ntherapy is limited since Medicare currently pays only for the cost of \nIVIG, and not nursing services and supplies required for infusion.\n  As a result, patients are experiencing delays in receiving this life \nsaving treatment and are being shifted to more expensive care settings \nsuch as inpatient hospitals. In addition to incurring extra expenses, \nhospital-based care results in patients being in close proximity to \ncountless microorganisms, an unsafe prospect for those who have \nsuppressed immune systems.\n  In April 2007, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \nOffice of the Inspector General, OIG,reported that Medicare \nreimbursement for IVIG was inadequate to cover the cost many providers \nmust pay for the product. In fact, the OIG found that 44 percent of \nhospitals and 41 percent of physicians were unable to purchase IVIG at \nthe Medicare reimbursements rate during the 3rd quarter of 2006. The \nprevious quarter had been even worse--77.2 percent of hospitals and \n96.5 percent of physicians were unable to purchase IVIG at the Medicare \nreimbursement rate.\n  We have a rare opportunity to fix this very real problem with a \ncompassionate and common sense solution. We can improve the quality of \nlife for PIDD patients and cut inpatient expenses by improving \nreimbursement procedures for IVIG treatments for physicians and \noutpatient facilities and allowing for home treatments and coverage for \nrelated services.\n  Today, I am introducing--along with Senators Alexander and Stabenow--\nthe bipartisan Medicare IVIG Access Act, a bill that will grant the \nSecretary of Health & Human Services temporary authority to update the \npayment for IVIG, if necessary based on new or existing data, and to \nprovide coverage for related items and services currently excluded from \nthe existing Medicare home infusion therapy benefit. This bill is \nendorsed by several national organizations from the patient and \nphysician communities, including the Immune Deficiency Foundation, IDF, \nGBS/CIDP Foundation International, the Jeffrey Modell Foundation JMF, \nthe Platelet Disorder Support Association, PDSA, the National Patient \nAdvocate Foundation, NPAF, and the Clinical Immunology Society, CIS.\n  The patients, physicians, caretakers, researchers, and plasma donors \nhave all done their part--now it's time for us to do ours.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2990\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare \n     IVIG Access Act of 2008''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Findings.\nSec. 3. Medicare payment for intravenous immune globulins.\nSec. 4. Coverage and payment of intravenous immune globulin in the \n              home.\nSec. 5. Reports.\nSec. 6. Offset.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is a human blood \n     plasma derived product, which over the past 25 years has \n     become an invaluable therapy for many primary \n     immunodeficiency diseases, as well as a number of \n     neurological, autoimmune, and other chronic conditions and \n     illnesses. For many of these disorders, IVIG is the most \n     effective and viable treatment available, and has \n     dramatically improved the quality of life for persons with \n     these conditions and has become a life-saving therapy for \n     many.\n       (2) The Food and Drug Administration recognizes each IVIG \n     brand as a unique biologic. The differences in basic \n     fractionation and the addition of various modifications for \n     further purification, stabilization, and virus inactivation/\n     removal yield clearly different biological products. As a \n     result, IVIG therapies are not interchangeable, with patient \n     tolerance differing from one IVIG brand to another.\n       (3) The report of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for \n     Planning and Evaluation of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, ``Analysis of Supply, Distribution, Demand, and \n     Access Issues Associated with Immune Globulin Intravenous \n     (IGIV)'', that was issued in May 2007, found that IVIG \n     manufacturing is complex and requires substantial up-front \n     cash outlay and planning and takes between 7 and 12 months \n     from plasma collection at donor centers to lot release by the \n     Food and Drug Administration.\n       (4) The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \n     Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-173; 117 Stat. \n     2066) changed Medicare's reimbursement methodology for IVIG \n     from average wholesale price (AWP) to average sales price \n     plus 6 percent (ASP+6 percent), effective January 1, 2005, \n     for physicians, and January 1, 2006, for hospital outpatient \n     departments, thereby reducing reimbursement rates paid to \n     those providers of IVIG on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries.\n       (5) An April 2007 report of the Office of Inspector General \n     of the Department of Health and Human Services, ``Intravenous \n     Immune Globulin: Medicare Payment and Availability'', found \n     that Medicare reimbursement for IVIG was inadequate to cover \n     the cost many providers must pay for the product. During the \n     third quarter of 2006, 44 percent of IVIG sales to hospitals \n     and 41 percent of sales to physicians by the 3 largest \n     distributors occurred at prices above Medicare payment \n     amounts.\n       (6) The report of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for \n     Planning and Evaluation of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, ``Analysis of Supply, Distribution, Demand, and \n     Access Issues Associated with Immune Globulin Intravenous \n     (IGIV)'' notes that, after the new reimbursement rules for \n     physicians were instituted in 2005, 42 percent of Medicare \n     beneficiaries who had received their IVIG treatment in their \n     physician's office at the end of 2004 were shifted to the \n     hospital outpatient setting by the beginning of 2006. This \n     shift in site of care has resulted in a lack of continuity of \n     care and has had an adverse impact on health outcomes and \n     quality of life.\n       (7) The Office of Inspector General of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services also reported that 61 percent of \n     responding physicians indicated that they had sent patients \n     to hospitals for IVIG treatment, largely because of their \n     inability to purchase IVIG at prices below the Medicare \n     payment amounts. In addition, the Office of Inspector General \n     found that some physicians had stopped providing IVIG to \n     Medicare beneficiaries altogether.\n       (8) The Office of Inspector General's 2007 report concluded \n     that whatever improvement some providers saw in the \n     relationship of Medicare reimbursement for IVIG to prices \n     paid during the first 3 quarters of 2006 would be eroded if \n     manufacturers were to increase prices for IVIG in the future.\n       (9) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in \n     recognition of dislocations experienced by patients and \n     providers in obtaining IVIG since the change to the ASP+6 \n     reimbursement methodology, has provided a temporary \n     additional payment during 2006 and 2007 for IVIG \n     preadministration-related services to compensate physicians \n     and hospital outpatient departments for the extra resources \n     they have had to expend in locating and obtaining appropriate \n     IVIG products and in scheduling patient infusions.\n       (10) Approximately 10,000 Medicare beneficiaries receive \n     IVIG treatment for their primary immunodeficiency disease in \n     a variety of different settings. Those beneficiaries have no \n     other effective treatment for their condition.\n       (11) The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \n     Modernization Act of 2003 established an IVIG home infusion \n     benefit for persons with primary immune deficiency disease, \n     paying only for IVIG and specifically excluding coverage of \n     items and services related to administration of the product.\n       (12) The report of the Office of the Assistant Secretary \n     for Planning and Evaluation of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services, ``Analysis of Supply, Distribution, Demand, \n     and Access Issues Associated with Immune Globulin Intravenous \n     (IGIV)'', noted that, because of limitations in the Medicare \n     Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 \n     provision, Medicare's IVIG home infusion benefit is not \n     designed to provide reimbursement for more than the cost of \n     IVIG and does not cover the cost of infusion services (such \n     as nursing and clinical services and supplies) in the home. \n     As a consequence, the report found that home infusion \n     providers generally do not accept new patients who have \n     primary immune deficiency disease and only have Medicare \n     coverage. These limitations in service are caused by health \n     care providers--\n       (A) not being able to acquire IVIG at prices at or below \n     the Medicare part B reimbursement level; and\n       (B) not being reimbursed for the infusion services provided \n     by a nurse.\n       (13) Access to home infusion of IVIG for patients with \n     primary immune deficiency disease, who have a genetic or \n     intrinsic defect in their human immune system, will reduce \n     their exposure to infections at a time when their antibodies \n     are compromised and will improve the quality of care and \n     health of the patient.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) excessive prices for petroleum products have created, \n     or imminently threaten to create, severe economic \n     dislocations and hardships, including the loss of jobs, \n     business failures, disruption of economic activity, \n     curtailment of vital public services, and price increases \n     throughout the economy;\n       (2) those hardships and dislocations jeopardize the normal \n     flow of commerce and constitute a national energy and \n     economic crisis that is a threat to the public health, \n     safety, and welfare of the United States;\n       (3) consumers, workers, small businesses, and large \n     businesses of the United States are particularly vulnerable \n     to those price increase due to the failure of the President \n     to aggressively develop alternatives to petroleum and \n     petroleum products and to promote efficiency and \n     conservation;\n       (4) reliable and affordable supplies of crude oil and \n     products refined from crude oil (including gasoline, diesel \n     fuel, heating oil, and jet fuel) are vital to the economic \n     and national security of the United States given current \n     energy infrastructure and technology;\n       (5) the price of crude oil and products refined from crude \n     oil (including gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, and jet \n     fuel) have skyrocketed to record levels and are continuing to \n     rise;\n       (6) since 2001, oil prices have increased from $29 per \n     barrel to levels near $120 per barrel and gasoline prices \n     have more than doubled from $1.47 per gallon to more than \n     $3.50 per gallon;\n       (7) the record prices for crude oil and products refined \n     from crude oil (including gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, \n     and jet fuel)--\n       (A) are hurting millions of consumers, workers, small \n     businesses, and large businesses of the United States, and \n     threaten long-term damage to the economy and security of the \n     United States;\n       (B) are partially due to--\n       (i) the declining value of the dollar and a widespread lack \n     of confidence in the management of economic and foreign \n     policy by the President;\n       (ii) the accumulation of national debt and growing budget \n     deficits under the failed economic policies of the President; \n     and\n       (iii) high levels of military expenditures under the failed \n     policies of the President in Iraq; and\n       (C) are no longer justified by traditional forces of supply \n     and demand;\n       (8) rampant speculation in the markets for crude oil and \n     products refined from crude oil has magnified the price \n     increases and market volatility resulting from those \n     underlying causes of price increases; and\n       (9) Congress must take urgent action to protect consumers, \n     workers, and businesses of the United States from rampant \n     speculation in the energy markets and the price increases \n     resulting from the failed domestic and foreign policies of \n     the President.\n\n             TITLE I--TAX PROVISIONS RELATED TO OIL AND GAS\n\n     SEC. 101.

Res. 554\n\n       Whereas, on May 3, 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Burma, \n     leaving an estimated 22,500 people dead, 41,000 missing, and \n     1,000,000 homeless;\n       Whereas, on May 5, 2008, the United States embassy in Burma \n     issued a disaster declaration authorizing $250,000 in \n     immediate humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma;\n       Whereas, on May 5, 2008, First Lady Laura Bush stated that \n     the United States will ``work with the U.N. and other \n     international nongovernmental organizations to provide water, \n     sanitation, food, and shelter. More assistance will be \n     forthcoming'';\n       Whereas, on May 5, 2008, Department of State Deputy \n     Spokesman Tom Casey stated that the United States has ``a \n     disaster assistance response team that is standing by and \n     ready to go in to Burma to help try to assess need there'';\n       Whereas, on May 6, 2008, President George W.

We're prepared to move U.S. Navy \n     assets to help find those who've lost their lives, to help \n     find the missing, to help stabilize the situation. But in \n     order to do so, the military junta must allow our disaster \n     assessment teams into the country.'';\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\n       Whereas, on May 6, 2008, President Bush pledged $3,000,000 \n     in emergency assistance to victims of Cyclone Nargis, and \n     stated that allowing the disaster assistance response team to \n     enter the country would facilitate additional support;\n       Whereas the European Union has pledged to deliver \n     $3,000,000 in initial emergency disaster assistance to Burma;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations Country Team in \n     Burma, the average household in Burma is forced to spend \n     almost \\3/4\\ of its budget on food and 1 in 3 children under \n     the age of 5 is suffering from malnutrition;\n       Whereas the prevalence of tuberculosis in Burma is among \n     the highest in the world, with nearly 97,000 new cases \n     detected annually, malaria is the leading cause of mortality \n     in Burma, with 70 percent of the population living in areas \n     at risk, at least 37,000 died of HIV/AIDS in Burma in 2005 \n     and over 600,000 are currently infected, and the World Health \n     Organization has ranked the health sector of Burma as 190th \n     out of 191 countries;\n       Whereas the failure of Burma's ruling State Peace and \n     Development Council to meet the most basic humanitarian needs \n     of the people of Burma has caused enormous suffering inside \n     Burma and driven hundreds of thousands of Burmese citizens to \n     seek refuge in neighboring countries, creating a threat to \n     regional peace and stability; and\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, the State \n     Peace and Development Council continues to restrict the \n     access and freedom of movement of international \n     nongovernmental organizations to deliver humanitarian \n     assistance throughout Burma: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to express deep sympathy to and strong support for the \n     people of Burma, who have endured tremendous hardships over \n     many years and face especially dire humanitarian conditions \n     in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis;\n       (2) to support the decision of President Bush to provide \n     immediate emergency humanitarian assistance to Burma through \n     nongovernmental organizations that are not affiliated with \n     the Burmese regime or its officials and can effectively \n     provide such assistance directly to the people of Burma;\n       (3) to stand ready to appropriate additional funds, beyond \n     existing emergency international disaster assistance \n     resources, if necessary to help address dire humanitarian \n     conditions throughout Burma in the aftermath of Cyclone \n     Nargis and beyond;\n       (4) to call upon the State Peace and Development Council to \n     immediately lift restrictions on delivery of humanitarian \n     assistance and allow free and unfettered access to the United \n     States Government's disaster assistance response team and any \n     organizations that legitimately provide humanitarian \n     assistance; and\n       (5) that the United States Agency for International \n     Development should conduct a comprehensive evaluation of \n     which organizations are capable of providing humanitarian \n     assistance directly to the people throughout Burma without \n     interference by the State Peace and Development Council.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3907-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 80--URGING THE PRESIDENT TO DESIGNATE A \nNATIONAL AIRBORNE DAY IN RECOGNITION OF PERSONS WHO ARE SERVING OR HAVE \n          SERVED IN THE AIRBORNE FORCES OF THE ARMED SERVICES\n\n  Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Ms. \nSnowe, and Mr. Stevens) submitted the following concurrent resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 80\n\n       Whereas the airborne forces of the Armed Forces have a long \n     and honorable history as units of adventuresome, hardy, and \n     fierce warriors who, for the national security of the United \n     States and the defense of freedom and peace, project the \n     effective ground combat power of the United States by Air \n     Force air transport to the far reaches of the battle area \n     and, indeed, to the far corners of the world;\n       Whereas August 16 marks the anniversary of the first \n     official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940, an event \n     that validated the innovative concept of inserting United \n     States ground combat forces behind the battle line by means \n     of a parachute;\n       Whereas the United States experiment of airborne infantry \n     attack began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute Test \n     Platoon was first authorized by the Department of War, and \n     was launched when 48 volunteers began training in July 1940;\n       Whereas the success of the Parachute Test Platoon in the \n     days immediately preceding the entry of the United States \n     into World War II led to the formation of a formidable force \n     of airborne units that have served with distinction and have \n     had repeated success in armed hostilities;\n       Whereas among those airborne units are the former 11th, \n     13th, and 17th Airborne Divisions, the venerable 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the versatile 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), and the airborne regiments and battalions (some as \n     components of those divisions, some as separate units) that \n     achieved distinction as the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, the \n     173rd Airborne Brigade, the 187th Infantry (Airborne) \n     Regiment, the 503rd, 507th, 508th, 517th, 541st, and 542nd \n     Parachute Infantry Regiments, the 88th Glider Infantry \n     Regiment, the 509th, 551st, and 555th Parachute Infantry \n     Battalions, and the 550th Airborne Infantry Battalion;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne forces during \n     World War II prompted the evolution of those forces into a \n     diversified force of parachute and air assault units that, \n     over the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, \n     Panama, the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and have \n     engaged in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai \n     Peninsula, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force that has evolved from \n     those World War II beginnings is an agile, powerful force \n     that, in large part, is composed of the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and the \n     75th Ranger Regiment;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force also includes other \n     elite forces composed entirely of airborne trained and \n     qualified special operations warriors, including Army Special \n     Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, and \n     Air Force combat control teams, all or most of which comprise \n     the forces of the United States Special Operations Command;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), together with other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     been prosecuting the war against terrorism by carrying out \n     combat operations in Afghanistan, training operations in the \n     Philippines, and other operations elsewhere;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the President's announcement of \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), \n     the 173rd Airborne Brigade, and the 4th Brigade Combat Team \n     (Airborne) of the 25th Infantry Division, together with other \n     units of the Armed Forces, have been prosecuting the war \n     against terrorism, carrying out combat operations, conducting \n     civil affairs missions, and assisting in establishing \n     democracy in Iraq;\n       Whereas the airborne forces are and will continue to be at \n     the ready and the forefront until the Global War on Terrorism \n     is concluded;\n       Whereas of the members and former members of the United \n     States combat airborne forces, all have achieved distinction \n     by earning the right to wear the airborne's ``Silver Wings of \n     Courage'', thousands have achieved the distinction of making \n     combat jumps, 69 have earned the Medal of Honor, and hundreds \n     have earned the Distinguished-Service Cross, Silver Star, or \n     other decorations and awards for displays of such traits as \n     heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and valor;\n       Whereas the members and former members of the United States \n     combat airborne forces are members of a proud and honorable \n     fraternity of the profession of arms that is made exclusive \n     by those distinctions which, together with their special \n     skills and achievements, distinguish them as intrepid combat \n     parachutists, special operation

Res. 554\n\n       Whereas, on May 3, 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Burma, \n     leaving an estimated 22,500 people dead, 41,000 missing, and \n     1,000,000 homeless;\n       Whereas, on May 5, 2008, the United States embassy in Burma \n     issued a disaster declaration authorizing $250,000 in \n     immediate humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma;\n       Whereas, on May 5, 2008, First Lady Laura Bush stated that \n     the United States will ``work with the U.N. and other \n     international nongovernmental organizations to provide water, \n     sanitation, food, and shelter. More assistance will be \n     forthcoming'';\n       Whereas, on May 5, 2008, Department of State Deputy \n     Spokesman Tom Casey stated that the United States has ``a \n     disaster assistance response team that is standing by and \n     ready to go in to Burma to help try to assess need there'';\n       Whereas, on May 6, 2008, President George W.

We're prepared to move U.S. Navy \n     assets to help find those who've lost their lives, to help \n     find the missing, to help stabilize the situation. But in \n     order to do so, the military junta must allow our disaster \n     assessment teams into the country.'';\n       Whereas, on May 6, 2008, President Bush pledged $3,000,000 \n     in emergency assistance to victims of Cyclone Nargis, and \n     stated that allowing the disaster assistance response team to \n     enter the country would facilitate additional support;\n       Whereas the European Union has pledged to deliver \n     $3,000,000 in initial emergency disaster assistance to Burma;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations Country Team in \n     Burma, the average household in Burma is forced to spend \n     almost \\3/4\\ of its budget on food and 1 in 3 children under \n     the age of 5 is suffering from malnutrition;\n       Whereas the prevalence of tuberculosis in Burma is among \n     the highest in the world, with nearly 97,000 new cases \n     detected annually, malaria is the leading cause of mortality \n     in Burma, with 70 percent of the population living in areas \n     at risk, at least 37,000 died of HIV/AIDS in Burma in 2005 \n     and over 600,000 are currently infected, and the World Health \n     Organization has ranked the health sector of Burma as 190th \n     out of 191 countries;\n       Whereas the failure of Burma's ruling State Peace and \n     Development Council to meet the most basic humanitarian needs \n     of the people of Burma has caused enormous suffering inside \n     Burma and driven hundreds of thousands of Burmese citizens to \n     seek refuge in neighboring countries, creating a threat to \n     regional peace and stability; and\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, the State \n     Peace and Development Council continues to restrict the \n     access and freedom of movement of international \n     nongovernmental organizations to deliver humanitarian \n     assistance throughout Burma: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to express deep sympathy to and strong support for the \n     people of Burma, who have endured tremendous hardships over \n     many years and face especially dire humanitarian conditions \n     in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis;\n       (2) to support the decision of President Bush to provide \n     immediate emergency humanitarian assistance to Burma through \n     nongovernmental organizations that are not affiliated with \n     the Burmese regime or its officials and can effectively \n     provide such assistance directly to the people of Burma;\n       (3) to stand ready to appropriate additional funds, beyond \n     existing emergency international disaster assistance \n     resources, if necessary to help address dire humanitarian \n     conditions throughout Burma in the aftermath of Cyclone \n     Nargis and beyond;\n       (4) to call upon the State Peace and Development Council to \n     immediately lift restrictions on delivery of humanitarian \n     assistance and allow free and unfettered access to the United \n     States Government's disaster assistance response team and any \n     organizations that legitimately provide humanitarian \n     assistance; and\n       (5) that the United States Agency for International \n     Development should conduct a comprehensive evaluation of \n     which organizations are capable of providing humanitarian \n     assistance directly to the people throughout Burma without \n     interference by the State Peace and Development Council.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3930-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3930-S3931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL WOMEN'S HEALTH WEEK\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, before reading the concluding comments here, \nI wish to take a minute or so to summarize what happened today \nregarding the flood insurance bill.\n  I express my gratitude, first of all, to Senator Reid, the majority \nleader, for insisting that this flood insurance matter come before the \nSenate. This is an important bill. There are a lot of issues that our \nconstituents are facing,--the housing issue, on which I am spending a \ngreat deal of time, the economic issues generally, the price of \ngasoline, and the price of oil at $120 a barrel, causing staggering \nproblems across our country. The flood insurance issue, as we enter \nhurricane season coming up, could make a great deal of difference for \npeople in this country who are concerned about that issue and what \ncould happen with the cost of premiums, whether they are going to have \nthat coverage at all.\n  Senator Shelby of Alabama, my ranking member and former chairman of \nthe committee, along with Senator Bunning and others actually passed \nthis legislation in a previous Congress and weren't able to get it \nadopted. We adopted it again out of the Banking Committee earlier this \nyear, and I am optimistic that we will be able to bring final closure \nto this issue.\n  In light of the fact that there is a tremendous amount of debt, \nFEMA--the Federal Emergency Management Agency--had to borrow $17 \nbillion from the Federal Treasury to meet the claims of people who \nfaced the devastating loss as a result of the flooding that occurred \nwith the major natural disasters. Borrowing that money had an interest \npayment due on it, and that cost alone was raising the cost of \npremiums. This bill, which I hope we complete tomorrow, will forgive \nthat debt. That will remove that cost that is added to the premiums, \nwhich are not inexpensive but absolutely necessary if you are going to \nhave a flood insurance program.\n  I point out that the program generates about $2.5 billion worth of \nrevenues each year with the premiums collected. About a billion dollars \nof that is administrative costs.\n  When you have demands, as we did out of 2005 of $17 billion just in \nthe flood insurance area, you get some idea of how expensive this \nprogram can be if it is not well managed and actuarially sound. So we \nhave made this significant effort, which I think will be valuable to \npeople across the country and make a difference.\n  We still have major work to do on the housing issue. I would be \nremiss if I didn't say how disappointed I was earlier today to listen \nto the President of the United States standing with the Republican \nleadership of the House of Representatives, announcing that he intended \nto veto the housing legislation. Congressman Franks and his Republican \ncounterparts are working on it in the House, and we are working on it \nin the Banking Committee. We are nowhere near having a bill per se, so \nI was shocked to hear the President saying he was vetoing something \nthat doesn't exist yet. We are making an effort to have a bipartisan \nbill. I would have hoped he would say: I am watching what you are doing \nand I am interested, and I have ideas about what ought to be included, \nor excluded, and I invite the leadership in Congress to make sure we \nare involved. That would have been appropriate because we have dealt \nwith the leadership of the administration's agencies that have been \ndeeply involved in helping us craft the Hope for Homeowners Act. It \nwas, therefore, shocking to have the President of the United States, \ndespite the advice and counsel of some of the key economic advisers of \nthe administration who have been constructive in working with us on a \nway to keep people in their own homes, announce he intended to veto \nsomething even before we have had a chance to put it together.\n  The good news is that I believe my colleagues on the Banking \nCommittee, who are working on this, from the minority and Republican \nside, are still interested in hearing some ideas and working on this. \nThat is not to suggest they have agreed to anything. They have not. But \nwe are working--and our staffs are--to develop that compromise bill. \nThey haven't been cowed by the announcement by the administration that \nthey will veto anything we might do to keep hundreds of thousands of \npeople in their homes.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't note that it was only about a month ago \nor a month and a half ago that the Federal Government committed $29 \nbillion, without ever a vote occurring here, to make the merger between \nBear Stearns and JPMorgan occur. That $29 billion the Federal \nGovernment put into that deal made it possible for it to actually be \naccomplished.\n\n  I happen to think they probably did the right thing that Sunday night \nof March 16. But I find it somewhat shocking that the President of the \nUnited States had little or nothing to say about that commitment of \nFederal dollars, and yet the idea that we might do something to make it \npossible for middle-income, hard-working families to stay in that most \nimportant possession, their home, he objects to--a bill before it \nexists that might accomplish that goal, done in a bipartisan fashion, \ninvolving his administration, key regulators from his own Government. \nThat he would announce a veto of it is alarming to me, knowing how \ndamaging this mortgage crisis is in so many aspects of our lives: \ncommercial lending, student loans--they are all being adversely \naffected because of the mortgage crisis. The fact the President said, I \nam going to veto this bill no matter what you do up there, is \ndisappointing.\n  My hope is in the coming days, as we move toward a markup in the \nBanking Committee on this issue, that we will get cooperation and \nsupport. I cannot guarantee what we are doing will work, but I know \ninaction is not an option and failure is not an option. Too many of our \nfellow citizens are hurting with rising energy prices, health care \ncosts, the cost of higher education, not to mention all these other \ncosts, commodity increases and the like, and they need to know their \nGovernment is making an effort to make it possible for them to stay in \ntheir homes. That is why I feel so strongly about it.\n  Although we are dealing with flood insurance today, I did not want to \nhave people believe we are unmindful of what needs to be done in the \narea of home foreclosure. Mr. President, 7,000 to 8,000 foreclosures \nare filed every day, by 7,000 to 8,000 of our fellow citizens, and if \nyou add our next door neighbors who are adversely affected, that is \nmore than 20,000 people a day who have their life savings, their best \ninvestment put in jeopardy.\n  For those reasons, I am hopeful we can get more cooperation on that \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/07/senate-section/article/S3932-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
