Two \nmembers of the Senator's staff who had conversations with the defendant \nprotestors during the charged events have been subpoenaed by the \nprosecution and the defense. Senator Grassley would like to cooperate \nby providing testimony from these two members of his staff. This \nresolution would authorize those staff members to testify in connection \nwith this action, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, \nand any statements relating to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it wasn't too many years ago that sessions \nof the Senate were much shorter than they are now. During the \nsummertime, the months of July and August, people went home because it \nwas so hot. They simply couldn't handle the heat in this building and \nthis town. But that has changed now with air-conditioning.\n  We still traditionally take August as our break. We do it for good \nreason. There are a lot of things we have to do to catch up on work at \nhome. Senators have to travel throughout their States to catch up on \nthings. The State of Nevada, for example, is the seventh largest State \narea-wise in the country. Seventy percent of the people live in Las \nVegas; 20 percent live in Reno. But the other 10 percent are entitled \nto representation in the Senate, as are the two metropolitan areas. In \naddition, we have important obligations around the world. August is set \naside as a time when Members travel around the world to check assets \nour country has and obligations through treaties and other things.\n  The reason I mention that is we have a lot of work to do. This is a \nwork period of 4 short weeks, and we hope it is 4 short weeks. It \nwasn't but a month ago when Members of this body and the House were \ncriticizing the Iraqi Parliament for taking their summer vacation \nbecause they hadn't done the work they were supposed to do. The \nAmerican people are looking at us--not the Iraqi Parliament, the \nAmerican Congress--to make sure we also do our work. We have a schedule \nduring this 4-week work period we have to meet. If we don't do that, \nthe August recess period is going to be shorter. Everyone should \nunderstand that. I know I have come to the floor earlier in the year \ntalking about the need for us to do different things, and it has worked \nout very well. We have worked only one weekend. We have spent a few \nnights but not too many because Members have, on most occasions--when \nit comes time to finish our work before a work period ends, we are able \nto complete the work. I hope that will continue. We have a lot to do.\n  I think this could be one of the most, if not the most, important \nwork periods of the year. It was reported in the press today that we, \nthe majority, have filed 42 cloture motions this year already. Why? \nBecause everything we have had to do--motions to proceed, basically \neverything--the Republicans have had us go that route procedurally to \ntry to invoke cloture to move forward. We have not always been \nsuccessful, but most of the time we have because it was simply stalling \nwhen it came right down to it. On many occasions, the Republicans voted \nwith us, but they still got their 30 hours to slow things down.\n  In spite of that, we have been able to accomplish a lot. We, of \ncourse, passed an increase in the minimum wage for the first time in 10 \nyears. As a result of the supplemental appropriations bill the \nPresident gave us, we were forced into that legislation, not only the \nminimum wage bill but disaster relief which is 3 years overdue for \nranchers and farmers. We were able to, for the first time over the \nPresident's objections, get extra money for homeland security. We got a \nbillion dollars there. We were able to finally get money for the gulf, \n$7 billion. The President had gone there 22 times, but the money had \nnever been forthcoming. We were able, in the supplemental \nappropriations bill, to force that in. We were also able this year to \npass a budget, a good budget. We think it will set the pattern for what \nneeds to be done this year.\n  We have had other accomplishments. We also have things we have to do. \nThat is why this work period is so important. The Defense authorization \nbill is one thing. This gives us a chance to support our troops with a \nreadiness amendment, which will be the first amendment up, which \nrequires that active-duty troops have at least the same amount of time \nat home as the length of their previous tour overseas. This will also \nbe our chance to force responsible action in Iraq that the President up \nto this point has refused.\n  We have had, during the week we have been gone, a number of \nRepublicans of good will who have spoken out for the need to change \npolicy in Iraq. I appreciate very much their stepping forward, as do \nthe American people, Democrats and Republicans.\n  Second, we are going to do everything we can during this work period \nto reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program which \nprovides health insurance to 6 million children. SCHIP must be \nreauthorized before it expires. I hope we can all agree to this as \nimportant to keep the children healthy. We are also going to turn to \nthe Higher Education Access Act, a bill that will help more Americans \nafford college by addressing the alarming rise in tuition costs. It \ncould be and will be the most significant change in higher education \nsince the GI Bill of Rights. It is going to change programs. It is \ngoing to take moneys used to pay people who provide these loans, who \nare getting, in the minds of many, outrageous profits from the money \nthey give to young people to go to school, take that and put it into \nsomething that will really educate children.\n\n  Fourth, we are going to tackle appropriations bills. The first bill I \nwant to do is Homeland Security. This bill strengthens airport, \nseaport, and water security, supports our first responders, and plugs \nsecurity gaps that have been ignored for far too long.\n  Finally, we are going to send the 9/11 and ethics bills to \nconference. As I said during the last day we were here, no longer am I \ngoing to come here and hope that the good will of the Republicans will \nallow us to go to conference. We are going to finish these bills. If it \nmeans I have to file cloture to get conferences, that is what we will \ndo. It is too bad because on the ethics bill, it is important that we \ndo this. It is so important that we do ethics and lobbying reform to \naddress the culture of corruption. This legislation passed the House \nand the Senate with minor differences. We should complete them. We \nalmost got there the last week we were here, but at the last minute \nsomebody\n\n[[Page S8759]]\n\nstepped in and wanted to stop us from doing this--always some \ndiversionary tactic. As to 9/11, we got another letter today from the \n9/11 families saying do something about this.\n  Here is our work schedule. Let's make sure everybody understands what \nwe need to complete during this work period: Defense authorization; we \nare going to work hard at SCHIP; we are going to finish the conference \nreports on 9/11 and ethics and lobbying reform. We are also going to do \nthe Defense authorization bill, as I talked about. We are going to do \nthe reconciliation on the Higher Education Access Act, and we are going \nto do an appropriations bill or more, if we can. I repeat: It is time \nthat we start legislating for the American people. The minority has \ncertainly proven that they can slow things down here, and 42 times we \nhave had to file cloture. I hope we don't have to continue doing that. \nWe will address the issues I have talked about before we end the work \nperiod and break for the August recess.\n  The recess is important. I repeat: It gives Members the opportunity \nto travel home and abroad, which is so important. It widens our \nunderstanding of the issues we face. Two of our colleagues, for \nexample, both former members of the military, Senators McCain and Reed, \ntraveled to Iraq during this Fourth of July work period. They will have \na lot to report. I have already met with Jack Reed, and I have had a \nwonderful conversation with him. I don't think there is anyone in the \nSenate who has traveled there more than he has. I am quite sure that is \ntrue. The August recess is also a time to meet with constituents. That \nis also important.\n  We are sent here for one reason above all others; that is, to \nlegislate. That is what we must do. So I say as respectfully as I can \nto my friends, Democrats and Republicans, who are Senators, you need to \nkeep your August travel plans flexible. I believe we can address each \nof these issues I have mentioned in the next 4 weeks and complete our \nwork. The conference reports could go very quickly, but it is not just \nup to me, as we move this calendar along at a pace that allows for fair \ndebate but not obstruction. In recent weeks, we have seen some of our \nRepublican colleagues filibuster even issues that it appears they \nsupport, which is hard to comprehend, but that is what we have seen. \nThat is their right, but I don't think it is good for the country, and \nwe are simply going to do what we can to move this body along so we can \naccomplish passage of legislation.\n  President Wilson said on one occasion:\n\n       The commands of democracy are as imperative as its \n     privileges and opportunities are wide and generous. Its \n     compulsion is upon us.\n\n  So, Mr. President, the compulsion to get the job done is upon us now, \nand I look forward to a very successful work period. We are going to \nhave to put in some long hours, but certainly that should not be a \nhindrance to our work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8759-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I listened with interest to my good \nfriend, the majority leader. Let me make a few random observations \nbefore making some remarks about the Defense authorization bill.\n  He indicated there have been 42 cloture motions filed. That is quite \na lot, no question about it. The reason that was necessary, of course, \nis because the majority was trying to truncate the legislative process, \nwhich, in the Senate, unlike the House, gives the minority considerable \nopportunity to offer amendments.\n  Typically, the way these things are done is to be worked out. Cloture \nmotions do not always produce the desired result of the majority, and \nwe look forward to having fewer cloture motions, not more, as a better \nway to actually pass more legislation.\n  With regard to the August recess, I certainly would be prepared to \nstay here and work. I recall the majority leader and I were here the \nlast time that was tried in 1994, when we stayed here 2 weeks into the \nAugust recess, to try to pass the national health care plan supported \nby then-President Clinton and his First Lady, Hillary Clinton. After 2 \nweeks of frustration, Senator Mitchell gave up and the recess began. \nSometimes that kind of device would be helpful; other times it may not \nbe.\n  I worry a good bit about the fact we have not done any appropriations \nbills yet. The basic work of the Government is to fund the agencies of \nGovernment. We do it through 13 appropriations bills. We have not \npassed any yet. I do worry we will end up with a process that could \nlead us in the direction we went last year under my party and in 2002 \nwhen the Democrats were in the majority, which led to kind of a total \nmeltdown of the appropriations process. I hope that can be avoided. \nThere will be a lot of cooperation on this side of the aisle to prevent \nthat from happening. But we do need to schedule the bills and actually \npass them if we are going to have a chance to have anywhere near a \nnormal appropriations process.\n  With regard to the 9/11 bill, as my good friend the majority leader \nknows, we were prepared to go to conference on that bill the Friday \nbefore the recess. No request to go to conference was actually \npropounded on that day. I think if we can have our staffs exchange some \nlanguage, there is no good reason why we cannot go to conference on the \n9/11 bill very shortly, maybe even including today.\n  With regard to the lobbying bill, it was my intention to go to \nconference on the lobbying bill. We had an objection on this side of \nthe aisle. The objector came over here, made the objection, and that is \nthe way the Senate works. There is still strong support for that bill \non this side of the aisle. It was the first bill the majority leader \nbrought up, with my concurrence and cooperation. We passed it with only \ntwo dissenting votes, and I am very optimistic we can get that to \nconference as well.\n  So there will be a lot of cooperation on this side of the aisle to \ntry to advance the issues the majority leader believes we ought to \naddress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8759-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8759-S8760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. With that, Mr. President, let me make some \nobservations about the Defense authorization bill.\n  What Republicans would like to see is an open and comprehensive \ndebate. We know this debate is going to include a discussion of our \npolicy in Iraq. We welcome that too. There are a variety of different \nproposals on both sides of the aisle about how we ought to go forward \non that most important issue. Nobody has any doubt that is the No. 1 \nissue in this country, and we are certainly prepared to offer our \nsuggestions, as well as to react to the Democratic suggestions about \nwhere we should go from here.\n  But a couple of words of caution are in order as we proceed. Everyone \nshould know from the outset that Republicans will expect and insist on \nthe freedom to improve this bill with our own amendments. We will be \noffering them and expect to have them voted on, as well as Democratic \namendments.\n  Democrats have continually tried to block our efforts at improving \nlegislation earlier in this session, as evidenced by the record pace of \ncloture motions we have been discussing on the floor that have been \nfiled since January. I know there has been an effort to attempt to \npaint this record-setting pace of cloture motions as a reaction against \nalleged Republican intransigence, but, frankly, that is simply not the \ncase. It is an effort to try to truncate the legislative process in \nsuch a way that works to the disadvantage of the minority.\n  The Senate has always been a place of cooperation. Most of us on both \nsides have been in the majority and minority recently. We know the \ndifferent proposals that tend to please one and inhibit the other. The \nSenate is a ponderous place on purpose. It is exactly what Washington \nand the Founders predicted.\n\n  Republicans have insisted on our right to improve everything from \nethics reform to the minimum wage bill this year. We have improved, we \nbelieve, everything we have touched, and we will continue to insist on \nour rights to do that.\n\n[[Page S8760]]\n\n  Specifically, on this bill, the DOD authorization bill, which we will \nturn to at 3 o'clock, we will insist on amendments that respond \naggressively and practically to the ongoing terrorist threat both here \nand abroad.\n  It is important to remember whom we are fighting. General Petraeus \nhas said that 80 percent to 90 percent of the suicide bombers in Iraq \nare from outside the country, outside of Iraq. We are fighting al-\nQaida, other terror groups, and the states that support them.\n  We cannot allow these terrorists to gain a new sanctuary even closer \nto the United States than Afghanistan or to gain access to other \nungoverned areas in the Middle East that will give them a new stage to \ncarry out their attacks.\n  It has always been in the U.S. interest, and it remains in the U.S. \ninterest, to maintain stability in the Persian Gulf. It is important \nnot to forget that either. We need to guard against an emboldened Iran, \nwhich is facilitating and capitalizing on the weakness of Iraq for its \nown advantage on the world stage. We must reassure our allies in Iraq, \nthe Middle East, and the world that America remains committed to \nfighting terrorism wherever it is found.\n  Finally, as we proceed, we must remember we are at war and that our \nenemies will use any means at their disposal to harm us. They intend to \nstrike us at home and abroad. They will exploit any opening we give \nthem, and they will use every tool at their disposal.\n  Everyone in this Chamber has America's best interests at heart. But \nit will fall on Republicans in this debate to be particularly awake to \nthe complexity of the terrorist threat.\n  Now, it is no accident we have not been attacked at home in nearly 6 \nyears. We have kept terrorists at arm's length by bringing the fight to \nthem. Republican amendments will build on the lessons we have learned \nover the past 6 years. They will reflect our commitment to security and \ncontinued vigilance, and we will insist they be heard. Republicans will \nsucceed in improving this bill in ways that improve our war-fighting \nability and our counterterrorism tools.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate not only the comments of my \ndistinguished counterpart, the senior Senator from Kentucky, but the \nmanner in which they were offered, the tone. I would hope we can work \ntogether to get some of these things done, starting with this bill, the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  We have two wonderful Senators who are the managers of that bill, \nSenators Levin and Warner. They have worked together in that committee \nfor 25 years and are both dedicated patriots. They will do a good job \nmanaging this bill, no matter what happens on the floor.\n  I would also say that, coincidentally, I had a meeting today with the \npresident of the American Medical Association. He came to talk about \nthe SCHIP bill and how important it is we get that passed.\n  Also, in speaking with physicians about the Clinton health care plan \nthat we did spend a lot of time on, as everyone knows, that legislation \nstarted out with 80 percent of the American people supporting a change \nin the health care policy in this country. With the huge amounts of \nmoney spent by mainly the insurance industry, with their ``Harry and \nLouise'' ads, that reversed, when it was all over, with less than half \nthe people supporting that legislation. Huge amounts of money were \nspent denigrating that legislation.\n  Right now, as with the people who met with me today, they sure wish \nthat legislation passed. It would have solved a lot of the problems we \ndeal with here: medical malpractice and allowing the pooling of small \nemployers so they can compete with large employers and have affordable \ninsurance. But hindsight is 20/20. That was not accomplished. \nHopefully, we can, with SCHIP, set a tone for what we can do with \nlegislation as it relates to health care.\n  With the 9/11 and the ethics and lobbying reform, the proof is in the \npudding. Are we going to have more delays? As my distinguished friend \nhas indicated, if Republican staff comes to our staff and says: We are \nready to go to conference, we will go, just like that. But I am not \ngoing to come out here anymore and have somebody come out and sideswipe \nit: We cannot do it because of this or that, always something standing \nin the way of it.\n  The American people are watching us. We are going to finish those two \npieces of legislation before we leave in August. It is not a threat. It \nis what we have to do. The American people need us to do certain \nthings. Can't we certainly pass ethics and lobbying reform? Can't we \ncertainly pass the 9/11 Commission recommendations, which are 3 years \nold? The administration has not implemented those. In fact, as we know, \nwe talk about one reason it passed overwhelmingly here and in the House \nis the Bush administration is given Ds and Fs on the implementation of \nthis. We need to get this passed, and we need to get ethics reform \npassed. We need to get the 9/11 bill passed. I hope we can do that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I do not know if the majority leader \nwas preoccupied or not, but let me say again, we were prepared to go to \nconference on the 9/11 bill the Friday before the recess, and the \nrequest was not made by my good friend, which is fine. I would say, \nagain, we are prepared to go to conference on the 9/11 bill. I would \nsuggest we have our floor staffs work out the language. I do not think \nthere is any reason why we could not do that today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy. I am happy. I so appreciate \nthat, very much appreciate that. I think it is good we try to have a \ngood work environment the next few weeks. We have a lot of things to \ndo. We have been through one of the most difficult issues that has ever \nfaced this body, ever, in the 200-plus years we have been a country; \nthat is, immigration reform. Friends against friends, it was a very \ndifficult issue.\n  So I think it is time we are able to do what the Senate can do by \nunanimous consent. So I appreciate very much what my friend said. I \nlook forward to that. I think it will be something the American people \ncan look at and say: You know, those guys don't disagree on everything.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8760-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, most of the activity with regard to the \nterrorist plot in Great Britain occurred while we were on our breaks \nback home. I wanted to briefly discuss that today.\n  It seems to me that the terror plots in Great Britain must serve as a \nwake-up call to those of us in the United States who perhaps have been \ntoo complacent about the terrorist threat. These plots remind us of the \ndangers we really face each and every day, and we need to employ all \npossible intelligence and follow-up action in order to stop the attacks \nand roll back these terrorist groups.\n  The war against terrorists and on the radical ideologies that drive \nterrorism will go on and is going to go on for a long time, and attacks \nwill not occur every day. So we have to remain resolute in the face of \nthis long-term threat, never allowing temporary respites from violence \nto tempt us into thinking the terrorists have stopped recruiting and \nplotting.\n  Abroad we must confront the challenges not just of terrorist networks \nbut of states like Iran and Syria that provide funds and equipment for \nthe terrorists. At home we have to have adequate intelligence to find, \nmonitor, and disrupt terrorist cells that could strike at any time. It \nrequires vigilance and cooperation among many enforcement entities and, \nimportantly, the support of the American people. Against this threat, \nto say ``out of sight, out of mind'' can have no place.\n  Now, the first point I would like to make today is that as the plot \nin Great Britain revealed, this is not about grievances. This is about \nideology.\n  There are those at home who are members of what is called the Blame \nAmerica First crowd, which was a term coined by my friend, the late \nAmbassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, who say the Islamists hate us because of \nwhat we do. They allegedly hate us because we don't do enough to fight \npoverty, because of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, because of Iraq, \nor because of the latest Danish cartoon, or whatever. Of course, this \nis nonsense.\n  The radical ideology that spawns this terrorism has nothing to do \nwith such grievances or poverty. The perpetrators of the plots in Great \nBritain were doctors, not individuals radicalized by unemployment or \npoverty-stricken slums. These plots certainly were not the result of \nBritish policy. They unfolded on the very day that Gordon Brown, a \ncritic of Britain's roles in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, took office. \nNor did they have anything to do with American policy. From what we \nknow of the individuals involved, it appears the motivation was the \nsame as all of the other acts of terrorism in the name of militant \nIslam.\n  This radical doctrine had its roots in the early 20th century and \ngained momentum through the writings of radical Islamists such as \nSayyid Qutb in the 1950s and 1960s, long before the Iraq war. It has \neverything to do with the hatred of our values, our freedoms, all that \nwe stand for, and we see the hatred in attacks that go back several \ndecades.\n  Review them: The 1979 takeover of our Embassy in Tehran; the 1983 \nHezbollah bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut; the 1993 bombing of \nthe World Trade Center; the 1996 bombing of Khobar Towers; the 1998 \nEmbassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania; the 2000 attack on the USS \nCole; September 11, 2001, and all of the attacks since then, including \nBeslan, Madrid, London, and elsewhere. In every case, the rationale was \nthe same--advancement of the radical ideology of militant Islam; a \nperversion of the faith, to be sure, but based on their concept of the \nfaith nonetheless.\n\n  The sheer evil of the acts and the perpetrators shocks our souls, \nespecially because it is allegedly grounded in religion. People trained \nas doctors--those who are supposed to value and preserve life--were at \nthe center of the plot in Great Britain to destroy innocent life.\n  We in the West, who believe in reason and rationality, have trouble \ncomprehending the mentality of radical Islam and those who subscribe to \nit. But we need to understand it, to call it what it is, and not too \nshrink from this honesty because the terrorists and their sympathizers \nhide behind a great religion. Importantly, we must not seek to \nrationalize and explain the views and the behavior of our enemies \nthrough our values and experiences. Militant Islam seeks not to change \nour policies but to destroy our very way of life and replace it with a \nTaliban-like society ruled by Sharia law and its enforcers. Militant \nIslam has declared war on the West--be very clear about it. It is \nfundamentally at odds with freedom, with democracy, with the inherent \nhumanity of the individual, with critical thinking, and rational \ndecisionmaking, not to mention all other religious beliefs.\n  While it might be fueled by grievances, it is not caused by the West \nbut, rather, by the very backwardness and ideological rigidity that \nthey would impose on others.\n  The second point is this: We should be clear that militant Islam, \nthough bound together by common ideology, comes in various stripes, \nincluding al-Qaida, responsible for 9/11 and which may have inspired \nthe recent terror plots in Great Britain; Iran's radical regime, whose \nleader promises to ``wipe Israel off the map'' and envisions a ``world \nwithout America,'' and which is speeding toward the development of \nnuclear weapons; the Wahabbism of Saudi Arabia, which is funding \nradical ideology in mosques and madrassas all over the world, including \nhere at home; groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, which cloaks its \nradical ideology in a new veneer of tolerance while its activities \nsupport terrorist groups like Hamas and many others.\n  But state-sponsored testing of the United States and the West is also \nin full force. Iran is testing our resolve in Iraq where it is using \nits Revolutionary Guard and its terrorist client, Hezbollah, to train \nand arm those who are fighting our soldiers. Iran is testing the \nresolve of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan where it is providing \nsupport to al-Qaida. Syria is testing our resolve in Lebanon, where it \nis assassinating anti-Syrian officeholders while serving as a conduit \nfor the weapons that are rearming Hezbollah. Hamas is testing our \nresolve in Gaza where it launched a successful coup against the \nPalestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas.\n  Third, successful American response depends on resolve and support of \nthe American people. We must understand the nature of our enemy and its \nideology, confronting them head-on, with full confidence in the \nrightness of our cause. This is not a matter of moral relativism. We \nmust not allow ourselves to be gagged by faux political correctness. We \ncan say that these terrorists were bound together and motivated by a \nhateful ideology grounded in their interpretation of Islam without \ncondemning any other Muslims. We must not embrace groups who tell us \nthey stand for peace without renouncing violence in the name of Islam. \nWe must not reward evil with retreat from any of the battlefields where \nthe fight is raging, including Iraq and Afghanistan. And we must be \nwilling to support intelligence and enforcement activities, including \nincarcerating those who have plotted against or attacked us.\n  As we celebrate the success of protecting our homeland since 9/11 and \npreventing loss of life from the attempted attacks in Great Britain, \nlet our words and actions prove that we have not forgotten the resolve \nthat we displayed six years ago today, and let us not fall into the \ntemptation of blaming ourselves for the actions of those who, inspired \nby hatred, have declared war on us. It is not grievances which have \nspawned this hatred and these attacks but, rather, the hateful ideology \nof militant Islam.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the record a \nNew York Post op-ed by Irshad Manji, dated July 9, 2007.\n\n[[Page S8762]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Post, July 8, 2007]\n\n                            Islam's Problem\n\n                           (By Irshad Manji)\n\n       Last week, two very different Brits had their say about the \n     latest terrorist plots in their country. Prime Minister \n     Gordon Brown told the nation that ``we have got to separate \n     those great moderate members of our community from a few \n     extremists who wish to practice violence and inflict maximum \n     loss of life in the interests of a perversion of their \n     religion.'' By contrast, a former jihadist from Manchester \n     wrote that the ``real engine of our violence'' is ``Islamic \n     theology.''\n       Months ago, this young man informed me that as a militant \n     he raised most of his war chest not from obscenely rich \n     Saudis, but from middle-class Muslim dentists living in the \n     United Kingdom. There's sobering lesson here for the new \n     prime minister.\n       So far, those arrested in connection to the car bombs are, \n     by and large, medical professionals. The seeming paradox of \n     the privileged seeking to avenge grievance has many champions \n     of compassion scratching their heads. Aren't Muslim martyrs \n     supposed to be poor, disenfranchised, and resentful about \n     both?\n       We should have been stripped of that breezy simplification \n     by now. The 9/11 hijackers came from means. Mohamed Atta, \n     their ringleader, earned an engineering degree. He then moved \n     to the West, pursuing his post-graduate studies in Germany. \n     No servile goat-herder, that one.\n       In 2003, I interviewed Mohammad Al Hindi, the political \n     leader of Islamic Jihad in Gaza. A physician himself, Dr. Al \n     Hindi explained the difference between suicide and martyrdom. \n     ``Suicide is done out of despair,'' the good doctor \n     diagnosed. ``But most of our martyrs today were very \n     successful in their earthly lives.''\n       In short, it's not what the material world fails to deliver \n     that drives suicide bombers. It's something else. And, time \n     and again, the very people committing these acts have \n     articulated what that something else is: their religion.\n       Consider Mohammad Sidique Khan, the teaching assistant who \n     master minded the July 7, 2005 transit bombings in London.\n       In a taped testimony, Khan railed against British foreign \n     policy. But before bringing up Western imperialism, he \n     emphasized that ``Islam is our religion'' and ``the Prophet \n     is our role model.'' Khan gave priority to God, not to Iraq.\n       Now take Mohammed Bouyeri, the Dutch-born Moroccan Muslim \n     who murdered Amsterdam film director Theo van Gogh. Bouyeri \n     pumped several bullets into van Gogh's body. Knowing that \n     multiple shots would finish off his victim, why didn't \n     Bouyeri stop there? Why did he pull out a blade to decapitate \n     van Gogh?\n       Again, we must confront religious symbolism. The blade is \n     an implement associated with 7th-century tribal conflict. \n     Wielding it as a sword becomes a tribute to the founding \n     moment of Islam. Even the note stabbed into van Gogh's \n     corpse, although written in Dutch, had the unmistakable \n     rhythms of Arabic poetry .\n       Let's credit Bouyeri with honesty: At his trial he proudly \n     acknowledged acting from ``religious conviction.''\n       Despite integrating Muslims far more adroitly than most of \n     Europe, North America isn't immune. Last year in Toronto, \n     police nabbed 17 young Muslim men allegedly plotting to blow \n     up Canada's parliament buildings and behead the prime \n     minister. They called their campaign ``Operation Badr,'' a \n     reference to the Battle of Badr, the first decisive military \n     triumph achieved by the Prophet Mohammed. Clearly, the \n     Toronto 17 drew inspiration from religious history.\n       For people with big hearts and good will, this has to be \n     uncomfortable to hear. But they can take solace that the law-\n     and-order types have a hard time with it, too. After rounding \n     up the Toronto suspects, police held a press conference and \n     didn't once mention Islam or Muslims. At their second press \n     conference, police boasted about avoiding those words.\n       If the guardians of public safety intended their silence to \n     be a form of sensitivity, they instead accomplished a form of \n     artistry, airbrushing the role that religion plays in the \n     violence carried out under its banner.\n       They're in fine company: Moderate Muslims do the same.\n       While the vast majority of Muslims aren't extremists, a \n     more important distinction must start being made--the \n     distinction between moderate Muslims and reform-minded ones. \n     Moderate Muslims denounce violence in the name of Islam--but \n     deny that Islam has anything to do with it.\n       By their denial, moderates abandon the ground of \n     theological interpretation to those with malignant \n     intentions--effectively telling would-be terrorists that they \n     can get away with abuses of power because mainstream Muslims \n     won't challenge the fanatics with bold, competing \n     interpretations.\n       To do so would be to admit that religion is a factor. \n     Moderate Muslims can't go there.\n       Reform-minded Muslims say it's time to admit that Islam's \n     scripture and history are being exploited. They argue for re-\n     interpretation precisely to put the would-be terrorists on \n     notice that their monopoly is over. Re-interpreting doesn't \n     mean re-writing. It means re-thinking words and practices \n     that already exist--removing them from a seventh-century \n     tribal time warp and introducing them to a twenty first-\n     century pluralistic context.\n       Un-Islamic? God no. The Koran contains three times as many \n     verses calling on Muslims to think, analyze, and reflect than \n     passages that dictate what's absolutely right or wrong. In \n     that sense, reform minded Muslims are as authentic as \n     moderates, and quite possibly more constructive.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8762-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8762-S8764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, like all of us in the Senate, I have just \ncome back from a great week in Oregon. We own the summer. It is just \nwonderful to be home during these warm days and cool nights. Other \nparts of the country may have beautiful months other times in the year, \nbut nobody can beat an Oregon summer.\n  I want to talk a little bit about what I heard as I moved around the \nState. What I heard again and again is that folks at home want the \nSenate to change course in Iraq, and they want us to fix health care. \nWe are going to start on the first item today in a few minutes when we \ngo to the Defense authorization bill. I believe very strongly that we \ndon't support our courageous troops in Iraq by forcing them to referee \na civil war there. I think it will become clear this week that there is \ngrowing and bipartisan interest in the Senate to set a specific \ndeadline to force the Iraqis to make the decisions for themselves about \nhow they will govern their Nation.\n  So what I want to do is talk for a few minutes about health care--\nsomething I know the President pro tempore of the Senate has a great \npassion about as well, and certainly folks are talking about today--\nbecause the need to fix health care is so great. Of course, many have \nflocked to the Michael Moore movie as well, generating additional \ndebate about this issue.\n  The first matter on the health care agenda to come up is going to be \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program. In my view, passing a strong \nprogram for kids is about erasing a moral blot on our Nation. It is \nunconscionable that millions of kids, youngsters in Rhode Island and \nOregon and across the country, go to bed at night without good, \nquality, affordable health care. In a country as rich and strong as \nours, as the majority leader, Senator Reid, noted earlier this \nafternoon, clearly we can do this, and we can do it in a bipartisan \nway.\n  The Senate Finance Committee is not going to pass a children's health \nprogram that becomes a Trojan horse for government-run health care. \nThat is not going to happen in the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate \nFinance Committee is going to work in a bipartisan way under the \nleadership of Senator Baucus, working with Senator Grassley and Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Hatch, and I am very hopeful that there will be \nbipartisan agreement over the next few days that targets the \ndesperately needy youngsters in our country and is responsibly funded. \nI am hopeful that will come together this week, and members of the \nSenate Finance Committee will be working throughout the week on a \nbipartisan basis to bring that about.\n  But it is also very clear, in my view, that the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program was not created to solve our Nation's health \ncare crisis. In fact, I think when we get on the floor debating the \nchildren's health program, the Senate will see and the country will see \nthat this debate illustrates how broken our health care system is. We \nare clearly spending enough money; we are just not spending it in the \nright places.\n  For example, for the amount of money we are spending this year, our \ncountry could go out and hire a doctor for every seven families in the \nUnited States and pay that doctor $200,000 a year to care for seven \nfamilies. Whenever I bring this up with the physicians, they always \nsay: Ron, where do I go to get my seven families? So, clearly, we are \nspending enough money, and we are going to use the dollars even more \nefficiently, as the Senator from Rhode Island brings us his very \nconstructive proposals as they relate to better use of health \ninformation technology.\n\n[[Page S8763]]\n\n  Second, I believe we have the possibility of a real ideological truce \nnow in health care. As the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island \nknows from our hearing in the Senate Budget Committee, we saw a real \nconsensus emerging just in the course of that hearing. I think it is \nvery clear that Senators of both political parties understand that to \nfix health care, we must cover everybody. If we don't cover everybody, \npeople who are uninsured shift their bills to folks who are insured. So \ncolleagues on my side of the aisle who made the point about getting \neverybody coverage, in my view, have been accurate, and clearly the \ncountry and citizens of all political persuasions have come around to \nthat point of view.\n  But as we saw in our hearing in the Senate Budget Committee just \nrecently, there is also strong support for something the Republicans \nhave felt strongly about, and that is not having the Government run \neverything in health care. There ought to be a role for a healthy \nprivate sector, one where there is a fairer and more efficient market, \nand there ought to be more choices; in fact, a system much like Members \nof Congress enjoy today.\n  I am very pleased that I could join with Senator Bennett of Utah, a \nmember of the Republican leadership, in offering a bill based on just \nthose principles. It is S. 334, the Healthy Americans Act, and it is \nthe first bipartisan universal coverage bill in more than 13 years.\n  The distinguished President pro tempore of the Senate might be \ninterested in some history. The last bipartisan, universal coverage \nhealth bill was offered by the late Senator Chafee--not his son but the \nlate Senator Chafee--more than 13 years ago. So now we do have the \nopportunity for the Senate to come together on a bipartisan basis and \ndeal with the premier challenge at home, and that is fixing American \nhealth care.\n  I and Senator Bennett also believe there are some key challenges to \nbringing this country together to fix health care, and we believe \nthrough our legislation we have been able to address it. The first is \nhow do you make sure folks who do have coverage today--and that is the \nmajority of the people of our country--have a system that works for \nthem. So often in the past they have said: Well, we are not exactly \npleased with what we have, but the devil we know is better than the \ndevil we don't know, and those folks in Washington, we don't know if \nthey can organize a two-car parade, let alone fix American health care.\n  So the first thing Senator Bennett and I said is for people who have \ninsurance today, in Rhode Island, in Oregon, and elsewhere, we are \ngoing to take several steps to assure them that as part of fixing \nhealth care, we understand their needs.\n  The first is with the initial paychecks that are issued. If the \nHealthy Americans Act is adopted, workers win and employers win. \nWorkers win because they will have more cash in their pocket, and they \nwill have more private choices in a fixed marketplace where insurance \ncompanies can't cherry-pick. And they will have lifetime security where \nno one can ever take their coverage away. Employers will win with the \nfirst paychecks as well because they will get out from under the \nstaggering rates of cost growth in American health care.\n\n  We all know that employers in Rhode Island and Oregon and elsewhere \nsee their premiums go up more than 13 percent annually--far in excess \nof the rate of inflation. We cannot have our employers compete in tough \nglobal markets when they sustain those kinds of premium hikes and the \ncompetition they are up against internationally has the benefit of \ngovernment-run health care.\n  I think Senator Bennett and I have been able to make the kinds of \nchanges in our bill that show we have learned from some of the mistakes \nin the past--most recently in 1993 and 1994, when Congress last tried \nto fix health care. One area we focused on is to make sure we can get \nthe savings through cost containment right at the outset.\n  A group called the Lewin Group--considered the gold standard of \nhealth policy analysis--has looked at our legislation, and they found \nwe generated savings through our legislation with the cost containment \nneeded to fix health care. First, we redirect the money that is spent \nin the Federal Tax Code. Today, more than $200 billion is sent out \nthrough the Federal Tax Code so that if you are a high-flying CEO, you \ncan go out and get a designer smile plastered on your face and write \noff the cost of that operation on your taxes. But if you are a hard-\nworking woman who works at the corner furniture store in Rhode Island \nand your company doesn't have a health plan, you don't get anything. \nThat is not right. So Senator Bennett and I redirect the money under \nthe Federal Tax Code to give the bulk of the relief to people in the \nmiddle-income and lower middle-income brackets, and the Lewin \norganization found significant savings in our doing that.\n  They also found significant savings on the administrative side \nbecause we have a one-stop sign-up process, and all of the essential \ntransactions are done through technology transfers. Once you sign up, \nyou are in the system forever. They found significant administrative \nsavings through that.\n  The third area they found specific savings in is what is called the \ndisproportionate share program, where hospitals and the Government have \nto pick up the bills for folks who come to hospital emergency rooms and \nhave no coverage. Clearly, it would be much better to have those folks \nhaving private coverage targeted at outpatient services so they can get \ntheir health care in a way that is better for them and better for their \nfinances than to have them all flocking to hospital emergency rooms.\n  The fourth area in which we generate savings is by redirecting \ndollars that are now spent on the poor. In Oregon, we have more than 30 \ncategories of coverage for poor people under Medicaid, so that poor \npeople literally have to find a way to squeeze themselves into one box \nor another in order to find coverage--wildly inefficient and, frankly, \npretty dehumanizing to those who participate.\n  The better way to go is to make coverage for low-income people \nautomatic. Those who are of modest income would be eligible for a \nsubsidy, but it would be for private coverage.\n  Finally, we secure savings through significant reform of the private \ninsurance sector. Today, private insurance companies can cherry pick \nand take healthy people and send sick people to Government programs \nthat are more fragile than they are. That would be barred under our \nlegislation. There would be guaranteed issue. They could not \ndiscriminate against people with illnesses, so that in the insurance \nsector, under our bipartisan legislation, private insurance companies \nwould compete on the basis of price, benefits, and quality, rather than \nwho can find the healthiest people.\n  I see another colleague on the floor. I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 60 seconds to wrap up. If my colleague will indulge me, I \nwould appreciate it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I talked with our colleague about health \ncare, and I know he has an interest in a bipartisan effort. If the \nSenate begins with the children's health insurance program and we make \nit clear this is not some kind of Trojan horse for a Government-run \nhealth plan, but something that secures the needs for children, I think \nwe can do this in a bipartisan way and then, in effect, segue into \nanother bipartisan effort to fix health care that would get all \nAmericans under the tent for quality affordable coverage.\n  Senator Bennett and I have brought before the Senate a proposal, \nparticularly on the basis of the hearing in the Senate Budget Committee \n2 weeks ago, that we think can bring the Senate together, go where no \nCongress has been able to go since 1945, when Harry Truman made an \neffort to do it, and that is a rational system so that all Americans \nhave quality affordable coverage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S8764]]\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, before I begin my statement, I commend \nSenator Wyden on his vision for health care and his passion for helping \nto equalize our Tax Code in a way that would help every American buy \nprivate health insurance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8764-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8764-S8766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EARMARK REFORM\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Senate \nearmark transparency rules that have not been implemented after so many \nmonths. As my colleagues know, we passed two new Senate rules back in \nJanuary that would shine some light on the earmarking process. It would \nrequire us to be open and honest about how we spend American tax \ndollars.\n  Unfortunately, these Senate rules, which have nothing to do with the \nHouse of Representatives, have been held hostage so they can be gutted \nin secret when no one is looking. That is right; there are some in this \nChamber who don't want to disclose their earmarks, don't want to \ncertify in writing that they will not benefit financially from their \nearmarks. There are some who want to be able to continue the practice \nof adding secret earmarks to our bills in closed-door conference \ncommittees.\n  The earmark disclosure rule was originally offered this year as an \namendment to S. 1, the lobbying and ethics reform bill. I offered this \namendment because the disclosure requirements the majority leader \nincluded in his ethics reform bill only covered 5 percent of earmarks \nthat we pass every year. I believed then, as I do now, that disclosure \nof only 5 percent of our earmarks is not reform and represents business \nas usual.\n  As my colleagues know, the leadership on the other side of the aisle \noriginally opposed my amendment and actually tried to kill it. They \nsaid it was too broad and that the language, which came directly from \nSpeaker Pelosi in the House, was rushed and therefore flawed.\n  The majority leader said on January 11:\n\n       . . . the distinguished Senator from South Carolina has \n     said this is exactly like the House provision. I say to my \n     friend that is one of the problems I have with it because I, \n     frankly, do not think they spent the time we have on this.\n\n  The same day Senator Durbin said:\n\n       But the DeMint language is actually unworkable because it \n     is so broad. . . . Frankly, it would make this a very \n     burdensome responsibility.\n\n  Fortunately, the Senate refused to table the amendment and the \nDemocratic leadership was forced to support full earmark disclosure. To \nsave face, the other side came with a slightly modified version that \nthey said was better than the House language because it required 48 \nhours of notice on the Internet of all earmarks. We all agreed to this \nlanguage and passed the Durbin Amendment 98 to 0.\n  The Democratic leadership immediately changed their tune once the \nbill was passed. The majority leader said on January 16:\n\n       In effect, we have combined the best ideas from both sides \n     of the aisle, Democrat and Republican, to establish the \n     strongest possible disclosure rules in this regard.\n\n  Senator Durbin said:\n\n       I am pleased with this bipartisan solution. . . . I believe \n     it reflects the intent of all on both sides of the aisle to \n     make sure there is more disclosure.\n\n  Later in the debate, the Senate unanimously accepted an amendment \nprohibiting the practice of what we call airdropping earmarks in \nconference; that is, adding earmarks that were not included in either \nthe House or the Senate versions of the bill. Again, we all agreed to \nthis language and accepted it unanimously.\n  Unfortunately, that is when the public eye turned away from this \nissue and when the bipartisan support for earmark reform ended.\n  I came to this floor on Thursday, March 29--70 days after we passed \nthe Senate earmark transparency rules--and asked for consent to enact \nthem. But a Senator on the other side objected. The reason for his \nobjection, according to several news reports, was that the other side \nof the aisle was caught off guard and was not properly notified.\n  Well, that sounded somewhat plausible, so I came back to this floor \non Tuesday, April 17--89 days after we passed the Senate earmark \ntransparency rules which, again, have yet to be enacted. A Senator on \nthe other side still objected. But this time it was Senator Durbin who \nobjected--the very Senator who worked with me to author the new earmark \ndisclosure rule. He objected to his own amendment being enacted. He \nsaid he did so because he didn't believe we should enact ethics reform \nin a piecemeal way.\n  But then the majority immediately announced it would self-enforce \nsome of the new earmark transparency rules in a piecemeal way. They \nsaid they would allow each committee to decide if and how to disclose \ntheir earmarks.\n  The Congressional Research Service recently provided me with a review \nof all earmark rules being used in the Senate committees. The analysis \nshows that the rules have not been applied in many committees, and even \nthose that have been created informally cannot be enforced on the \nSenate floor. According to CRS, only 4 out of 18 committees have even \ncreated an informal rule.\n\n  This shows what we all know to be true: The rules are being \nimplemented in a piecemeal way, which is exactly what the other side \nsaid they wanted to avoid. It is clear we need a formal rule in place \nthat applies to all committees. That is what we voted for at the \nbeginning of the year when we wanted to show Americans we were going to \naddress the culture of corruption in Washington, and that is what we \nneed to do now.\n  I came down to this floor shortly before the July 4 recess to talk \nwith the majority leader about these earmark rules. He wanted to go to \nconference with the House bill, S. 1, the ethics and lobbying reform \nbill, and I wanted to get his personal assurances that these earmark \nrules would not be watered down or eliminated behind closed doors. \nUnfortunately, the majority leader told me he could not give me those \nassurances, which was a clear sign that the folks working on this bill \nhad plans to weaken the earmark transparency rules we adopted in \nJanuary.\n  I tried again to get consent to enact these rules on Thursday, June \n28, 161 days after they had passed, and again the other side objected. \nThe reason this time, which was a complete departure from what they \nsaid before, was that the other side planned to work with the House to \nchange the rules and that it was unreasonable for me to demand that \nthey be protected.\n  The majority leader said:\n\n       There will be some things that will wind up being a Senate \n     rule. Some things will wind up being a House rule. That is \n     part of what the conference is going to work out. No one is \n     trying to detract from anything that the distinguished \n     Senator from South Carolina wants. But just because you want \n     something doesn't mean that you are necessarily going to get \n     it.\n\n  Senator Schumer echoed their desire to change the rules by saying:\n\n        . . . maybe there are things that other people might add; \n     maybe there will be the kinds of legislative tradeoffs that \n     will make a stronger ethics bill. We all have no way of \n     knowing . . . To get 90 percent or 95 percent of what is a \n     good package, most people would say yes.\n\n  And Senator Durbin sought to belittle my effort to protect the \nearmark rules, saying:\n\n       It would seem that the Senator from South Carolina is \n     carping on a trifle here.\n\n  And I was carping on his bill. There are three words to describe what \nis going on here, Mr. President: business as usual. This is one of the \nworst flip-flop reversals I have ever seen. Even the Senator from \nIllinois, the very person who had previously praised the new rules, \nminimized their importance and supported efforts to change them.\n  I realize the other side never liked these rules to begin with. After \nall, they did try to kill them. But I thought they had come around and \nwere now supportive. I thought we agreed that earmark transparency was \na reasonable step to begin changing the way we spend American tax \ndollars and to end business as usual. It now appears I was mistaken.\n  Mr. President, 172 days have now gone by since we passed the Senate \nearmark transparency rules, and yet a few in the Chamber still refuse \nto enact them. Instead, these objections offer more excuses--excuses \nthat keep changing as time passes.\n  First they said the rules were too broad and the House wrote them \nincorrectly. Then, after the Senate leadership revised the rules to \ntheir liking,\n\n[[Page S8765]]\n\nthey support them. But now, after 6 months have passed, they are saying \nthe rules need to be fixed again, and this time by the House. I am \nsorry, I realize this may seem like a joke, but I am not making it up.\n  What we have here is obstruction, pure and simple. It has been 172 \ndays since we passed these earmark transparency rules, and the majority \nwill still not allow them to be enacted. Several Senators on the other \nside are determined to block these rules and prevent them from ever \nbeing implemented. They have now publicly acknowledged that they intend \nto change the rules behind closed doors and, according to several media \nreports, the majority leader is even willing to cancel the entire \nAugust recess to force those of us who want earmark reform to \ncapitulate. He wants us to stop fighting for the American taxpayers. \nThat is not going to happen. So the quicker we end the obstruction of \nthese earmark reform rules, the quicker we can get on to other \nbusiness.\n  I intend to fight for these rules even if it means staying here every \nday in August. In fact, that might mean the best outcome of all. We \nneed to have a national dialog in this country about how Congress \nspends Americans' hard-earned tax dollars. I think it would be good for \nthose in this Chamber to explain to the American people why they don't \nwant to be transparent in how we spend their money. That is a \ndiscussion we need to have here.\n  I am now going to seek consent one more time to enact these important \ndisclosure rules. And I ask the majority, if they don't like the \nlanguage they developed, then make suggestions of how they want to \nchange it. But in the meantime, I think we should go to conference on \nthis lobby and ethics reform bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Rules Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration and the Senate now to proceed to S. Res. 123 and \nS. Res. 206, the earmark disclosure resolutions, all en bloc; that the \nresolutions be agreed to and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable. I further ask that the Senate then proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 2316, the House-passed ethics and lobbying reform \nbill; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. \n1, as passed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill \nbe read a third time, passed, and the Senate insist on its amendment, \nrequest a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees at a ratio of 4 to 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). Is there objection?\n  The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, so we understand what happened, the Senate \npassed an ethics reform bill. It is a big bill. There are a lot of \nprovisions in the bill that we felt were necessary because of some of \nthe wrongdoing that occurred in Washington over the last several years. \nWe went after the Jack Abramoff scandal. Remember that lobbyist? He is \nin prison. He had a pretty sweetheart arrangement here. He was sticking \nthings in bills. It went on and on. I will not go into all the gruesome \ndetails, but we decided to break this kind of cozy relationship between \nlobbyists and some Members on Capitol Hill. And then we started to take \na look at some of the other aspects of things that were troubling \npeople.\n  We went into the question of gifts, how much can a Senator receive.\n  We went into the question of leaving the Senate and picking up a big-\npaying job as a lobbyist, within a few months making a lot of money. \nThat has happened too often. We said, let's slow down this revolving \ndoor.\n  We went after the disclosure of private employment negotiations that \nSenators and Congressmen were entering into while they were still \nsitting in the House of Representatives and in the Senate.\n  We expanded lobby disclosure requirements. We went to great lengths \nand said lobbyists have to tell us a lot more about what they are doing \nwith their money and time.\n  Then we went into prohibiting the old K Street Project. Unless you \nare a real insider on Capitol Hill, you may not remember that one, but \nthey used to have--I am not kidding now--weekly meetings in the office \nof a U.S. Senator where the lobbyists would come in and tell them the \namendments they wanted, and then the Senators would tell them what \nfundraisers were coming up. I don't know if there was any connection, \nbut some people thought there was a connection. We put an end to that \npractice.\n  Then we talked about Members who were convicted of certain crimes \nlosing their pensions. Understandable, if you are guilty of felonious \nconduct relating to official duties, that might follow.\n  Then we talked about the integrity of the process so Members couldn't \ndump little things in at the last minute in conference reports that \nhadn't been considered in the House and Senate.\n  And, of course, we went to the question of earmarks. That was an \nimportant part of this bill, but it sure wasn't the only part. Listen \nto everything I read.\n  So now we are trying to get this bill to conference. We want to take \nthis bill to conference and work with the House and pass the most \nsignificant ethics reform bill in the history of Congress. It is long \noverdue. I think most Americans would say: Why haven't you done it \nalready? I can tell you why for 12 days we haven't done it: Senator \nDeMint of South Carolina has objected. Senator DeMint, the man who took \nthe floor and used my name a dozen times, as a great ethics reformer is \nthe Senator who objects to going to conference to make these proposals \nwhich passed the Senate--similar measures passed the House--the law of \nthe land. Why? Because he picked one paragraph out of the bill related \nto earmarks and he wants a guarantee that is going to come out of the \nconference without a change. I believe it probably will. Mr. President, \ndo you know what the final vote was when it passed the Senate? It was \n98 to 0. It is a pretty good indication he is going to see either the \nexact language he proposed or something very close to it. But unless he \ngets a locked-down guarantee to get every word of that, he is going to \nstop all of these efforts at ethics reform. He is going to stop the \nefforts to put an end to the K Street Project, he is going to stop the \nefforts of more disclosure, he is going to stop the effort to eliminate \noutrageous gifts between Members of Congress and lobbyists, and he does \nthis in the name of ethics. I don't follow this at all.\n  For 12 days now, Senator DeMint has held up our effort to take the \nethics bill to conference. For 12 days, he has come to the floor and \nhas said it is because he really believes in ethics. It doesn't track. \nIt doesn't follow. It doesn't wash in Illinois or in South Carolina. I \nwish he showed a little more humility in this process. That he is going \nto stop the whole ethical reform because of his section--he is worried \nabout his section I don't think is right. I think he should trust in \nthe substance of his earmark reform, trust in the fact that 98 Senators \nsupported it, trust in the fact that in the end it was a bipartisan \nagreement. I offered an amendment on the Democratic side to his \namendment on the Republican side. What I offered was an amendment \ncalling for more disclosure. Put all the earmarks on the Internet so \nthe whole world can see them. I think that is the way it should be.\n  I chair a subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. My staff has \nbeen working long and hard over the last several weeks to put a bill \ntogether. We were on the phone late last night putting all the \nfinishing touches on it. It is going to be the most transparent \nappropriations bill covering these agencies in the history of the \nUnited States, and that is the way it should be. Every Member who has \nasked for anything in this bill, whether it is in bill language or \ncommittee report language, is going to be disclosed. Every Member has \nto stand by every request they make, and it is printed right there for \nthe world to see. That is the way it ought to be. That isn't enough for \nthe Senator from South Carolina. I am not sure what he wants beyond \nthat. We are already putting into practice what the Senate has \nvirtually accepted, with some slight modifications but nothing of \nsubstance. Yet he wants to stop the whole ethics process. I suppose \nthat is\n\n[[Page S8766]]\n\nhis idea of reform, to stop reform. But it is certainly not my idea of \nreform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the ethics bill that has \npassed the Senate and the House be sent to conference for \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. On behalf of the junior Senator from South Carolina, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I acknowledge my colleague on the other \nside of the aisle is standing in for the Senator from South Carolina, \nbut if we are ever going to get to ethics reform, we clearly have to \nmove to conference, and conference is going to require agreement on \nboth sides of the aisle and the understanding--incidentally, the \nSenator from South Carolina characterized the conference committee as \nthe secret conference committee. He is caught up in the old way of \ndoing things. The new way is that the doors will be open. He can come. \nIn fact, I hope the Republican leader will appoint him as a member of \nthe conference committee. Regardless, it is going to be open for him to \ncome and at least observe, if not participate, in this process.\n  It is a new day for the conference committees, and I certainly hope \nthe Senator from South Carolina will reconsider, will stop his ethics \nfilibuster, the DeMint ethics filibuster, which is now in its 12th day, \nand allow us to move to this ethics bill for its consideration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8766-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I was saying, Senator \nGraham and I have worked together over these past several years--he has \nbeen chairman and I have been the ranking member--and I have always \nfound our time on the subcommittee to be decidedly nonpartisan. All \nmembers of the Personnel Subcommittee have tried to do what is right by \nthe servicemembers and their families. We are always focused on how \nbest to serve those who serve us. So I say to Senator Graham: Thank you \nvery much.\n  This year, as in past years, the Personnel Subcommittee focused on \nimproving the quality of life of the men and women in the armed \nservices, including Active-Duty, National Guard and Reserve personnel \nand their families. There is an old axiom in the military that you \nrecruit the soldier, sailor, airman or marine, but you retain the \nfamily. In the wake of the difficulties exposed at Walter Reed, we felt \nespecially compelled this year to focus not just on the servicemember \nbut also on his or her family and I am pleased with the bill and \nrecommend it to my fellow Senators.\n  The bill before us authorizes $135 billion for military personnel, \nincluding pay, allowances, bonuses, death benefits, and permanent \nchange of station moves. The bill contains many important provisions \nthat will improve the quality of life of our men and women in uniform \nand their families.\n  First and foremost, the bill authorizes a 3.5 percent across-the-\nboard pay raise, which is half a percent higher than the average pay \nraise in the private sector as measured by the Employment Cost Index. \nIt is also half a percent higher than the administration's proposal of \na 3-percent increase in pay. This increased pay raise recognizes the \noutstanding service and the sacrifice of the men and women of the armed \nservices and their families.\n  The bill also addresses the administration's request to increase the \nend strength of the Army and the Marine Corps. The committee supports \nthe requested increases in end strength for the coming fiscal year but \nfunds the entire authorized end strength in the base budget rather than \nin a combination of the base budget and the war-related supplemental. \nThe committee believes the increases in end strength are no longer \nuniquely tied to the war effort. The bill authorizes fiscal year 2008 \nend strengths of 525,400 for the Army and 189,000 for the Marine Corps.\n  The bill would expand combat-related special compensation to all \nservicemembers eligible for retirement pay who have a combat-related \ndisability. This special compensation is currently denied to our \nwounded warriors who are medically retired with less than 20 years of \nservice.\n  The bill would also reduce below age 60 the age at which reservists \nmay begin to receive their retired pay by 3 months for every aggregate \nof 90 days of active duty performed under certain mobilization \nauthorities.\n  The bill authorizes all servicemembers to carry up to 90 days of \nleave from one fiscal year to the next and allows certain \nservicemembers to sell back up to 30 days of leave under special leave \naccrual provisions affecting deployed servicemembers.\n\n  The bill would change the death gratuity and survivor benefit plan to \nallow servicemembers to choose to leave death benefits to a guardian or \na caretaker of their minor child or children.\n  The bill also amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make it \neasier for spouses and children accompanying servicemembers assigned \noverseas to qualify for citizenship.\n  The bill includes provisions that would allow the Department of \nDefense to continue to provide top quality health care to \nservicemembers and their dependents. The bill authorizes $24.6 billion \nfor the Defense Health Program and takes steps to ensure that TRICARE \nis available to beneficiaries who desire to use it.\n  The bill enhances the ability of the services to attract critically \nshort health care personnel by authorizing a new bonus for referring to \nmilitary recruiters an individual who is commissioned in a health \nprofession, by authorizing an increase from $50,000 to $75,000 in the \nmaximum incentive special pay and multiyear retention bonus for medical \nofficers and by authorizing the Secretary of Defense to pay an \naccession bonus of up to $20,000 to participants in the Armed Forces \nHealth\n\n[[Page S8767]]\n\nProfessions Scholarship and Financial Assistance Program.\n  The committee rejected the administration's proposal to give DOD \nbroad authority to increase the cost of TRICARE for military retirees \nand their families and authorized the use of Federal pricing to reduce \nthe cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed through the TRICARE retail \npharmacy program.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes $50 million in Impact Aid to local \nschool districts, including $5 million for educational services to \nseverely disabled children and $10 million for districts experiencing \nrapid increases in the number of students due to rebasing, activation \nof new military units or base realignment and closure.\n  Before closing, I would like to say a few words about the Dignified \nTreatment of Wounded Warriors Act. The committee unanimously reported \nout this legislation on the 14th day of June as a stand-alone bill. It \nis very important to ensure that our wounded heroes and their families \nare provided the very best in medical care and transition services the \nGovernment can provide. I understand the Dignified Treatment of Wounded \nWarriors Bill will be offered as an amendment to this bill, so I \nencourage all my colleagues to support this extremely important and \ntimely piece of legislation.\n  Again, I would like to thank Senator Graham and all the members of \nthe Personnel Subcommittee. I look forward to working with our \ncolleagues to pass this important legislation as promptly as possible.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to say what a pleasure it is \nto join my good friend from Nebraska, a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, on the floor on the occasion of the 29th authorization bill \nthat I have been privileged to join with other colleagues on the floor \nsubmitting to the Senate. Earlier today, I had a lengthy meeting with \nSenator Levin, our distinguished chairman, and I have also had the \nbenefit of a report from the distinguished ranking member, Senator \nMcCain, who has returned from a trip to Iraq. So on behalf of our two \nprincipals, we are here today to initiate consideration of this all-\nimportant bill at a very critical juncture in the history of our great \nNation.\n  I am privileged to rise in support of this piece of legislation, Mr. \nPresident. The bill was voted out of our committee unanimously, and \nthat has usually been the case. I say that with a sense of pride \nthrough the many years I have served on the committee, over half that \ntime as either the chairman or the ranking member. Our committee is \nproud of the fact that members of the committee, as well as our \nrespective professional staffs, work together to try to achieve the \nhighest possible degree of bipartisanship, given that we are entrusted, \nunder the Constitution, the Senate, and the Senate has entrusted our \ncommittee with bringing forth each year the recommendations on behalf \nof the men and women in the Armed Forces.\n  I commend our distinguished chairman, Mr. Levin, and Mr. McCain, the \nranking member, for the markup session, which my colleague and I were \nin attendance I think throughout. It was done expeditiously, fairly, \nand openly, in terms of all Senators being given every possible option \nto present their views in preparing for the bill that is now on each \nSenator's desk. So again, I thank and join my colleague from Nebraska \nin thanking the chairman and ranking member and our staffs because I \nthink we have achieved a truly bipartisan endeavor on behalf of the \ncommittee and forwarded to the Senate.\n  As the ranking member, Mr. McCain, and I worked with our \nsubcommittees, and indeed Mr. Levin. I attended a number of \nsubcommittee meetings. We were fortunate to have strong chairmen of the \nsubcommittees and ranking members, as my colleague from Nebraska \nmentioned in his opening statement, together with a strong professional \nstaff, and their reports, by and large, were incorporated in the bill. \nTherefore, the committee has met its responsibility and fully funded--I \nrepeat, fully funded--the President's $648 billion budget request for \nnational defense.\n  As Members of the Congress, funding our Nation's defense is a \nfundamental responsibility. We must ensure our military is prepared, \nwell trained, and well equipped to defend us and our allies in today's \nvery complex world of threats. We must provide the best resources with \nthe best value for our Armed Forces. We owe that to our service men and \nwomen, to their families, and, indeed, to the taxpayers. I am proud to \nsay that, in my judgment, this bill meets those criteria.\n  The bill approves $2.7 billion for items on the Army Chief of Staff's \nUnfunded Requirements List, including $775 million for reactive armor \nand other Stryker requirements, $207 million for aviation survivability \nequipment, $102 million for combat training centers, and funding \nexplosive ordnance disposal equipment, night vision devices, and other \nweapons. These are critical items in our fight against al-Qaida, the \nTaliban, and other threats throughout the world. Given the dangers we \nface as a nation, our men and women in uniform should want for nothing \nin our battle against terror.\n  I selected the Army to start with because I am very admiring of the \nChief of Naval Operations, who is alleged to have said recently that \nwhile he is proud to be Chief of the Navy, his biggest concern today is \nthat of the needs of the U.S. Army, and, indeed, the President has \nrecently indicated that if all goes well in the course of the hearings \nin the Senate and our committee and the Senate confirms Admiral Mullins \nto be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he truly inherits that \nmantel of heavy responsibility showing equal regard for our services. \nBut he did single out the Army as an institution at this time badly in \nneed of the attention, not only of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \noffice but indeed of the Congress of the United States.\n  I believe with the increase in the end strength of the Army, we have \nmet the President's request to do what we can at this critical time to \nkeep our Army strong, particularly for those families who at this very \nmoment--thousands and thousands of families--have their loved ones \nserving abroad in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Likewise, the committee approved for the Navy the first next \ngeneration--that is the first ship in the next generation of our \ncarriers, proudly named, in large measure by the urging of the Senate, \nthe U.S.S. Gerald Ford for the former President of the United States, \nthe former Republican leader in the House of Representatives.\n  It has also restructured the littoral combat ship program to achieve \nmaximum value and accountability. Moreover, we approved $4.1 billion of \nMine Resistant Ambush Protected--that is the MRAP--vehicles for all the \nservices.\n  The committee also decided to assign fixed-wing, intra-theater \nairlift functions and missions to the Air Force and shift Army aircraft \nfunding in 2008 to the Air Force, which was unusual but necessary to \nachieve improved efficiency and synergy in our airlift capability.\n  While weapons and equipment are critical in any conflict, it is the \nsupport we give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines that \ndetermines success or failure.\n  We are asking more of our troops today than we did a generation ago--\nwith longer and successive deployments. Our troops deserve our respect \nand gratitude for the countless sacrifices they and their families make \ndaily. I welcome the committee's decision to approve a 3.5 percent \nacross-the-board pay raise for all military personnel and the \nauthorization of $135 billion in allowances, bonuses and other \nbenefits. We are improving the quality of life for our men and women in \nuniform while enhancing our future readiness.\n  The committee has approved measures that satisfy our current and \nfuture requirements. We've increased the end strengths of the Army and \nthe Marines to 525,400 and 189,000, respectively. By boosting the \nArmy's and the Marines' numbers, I hope we can build a more flexible \nactive-duty force and deploy reservists more prudently.\n  I thank the chairman for his leadership. The committee has approved a \nbill that meets the President's request, the needs of our troops and is \nfiscally responsible to our constituents. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me and members of the committee in supporting this year's Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  I wish to draw the attention of the Senate at this time to the \nfollowing. We today start this bill amidst great\n\n[[Page S8768]]\n\nconcern. We start very important legislation at a time in our history \nunlike any I have witnessed. I share the privilege of being among the \nelder Senators in this Chamber. The conflict in Iraq in particular is \nposing extraordinary challenges both to our President, the Commander in \nChief of the Armed Forces, and to the Congress which must provide the \nneeded support. Indeed, we owe no less than the greatest obligation to \nthe many people of our United States of America whose families, one way \nor another, are involved in these conflicts--largely by virtue of \nproudly wearing the uniform of one of our services--but there have been \nliterally tens of thousands of other Americans who are taking risks in \nthese conflicts to give support to the men and women of our Armed \nForces.\n  Many colleagues over the recess period have expressed their concerns, \nquite properly, about certain directions that our Nation could be \ntaking and is now taking, and otherwise, to address the conflicts--\nprimarily in Iraq. I anticipate a number of amendments will be brought \nforward in the coming days--weeks, perhaps--as the Senate debates this \nbill. I encourage that. I thoroughly believe the depth of the \ncomplexity of the Iraq situation deserves the attention of each and \nevery Senator. I hope they will avail themselves of such opportunities \nas they can to address their fellow Senators and convey their thoughts.\n  Several have recently spoken out very strongly on this issue. I \npersonally have commended each and every one, even though I may not \nfully agree with all of their statements. This is a critical time in \nAmerica's history. That is the purpose of this Senate, which is \nrecognized perhaps as the one forum among the legislative branches \nthroughout the world where there is literally almost total freedom for \nany Member of this body to come forward and address his or her fellow \nSenators and express his or her views.\n  I look forward in the coming days and weeks to engaging in debates. A \nnumber of us--I don't single myself out, but quite a few--have been \nasked by the press, do we have views at variance with the President's, \nat variance with those of some of our colleagues. I am speaking only \nfor myself. I have decided to withhold some of the views I currently am \nlooking at. I spent a good deal of time in the recess period visiting \npersonally at the various agencies and departments of our Federal \nGovernment entrusted with intelligence responsibilities, security \nresponsibilities, and other responsibilities with regard to these \nconflicts. I profited greatly. Each time, while I may not have agreed \nwith everything that was related to me, I was certainly impressed by \nthe quality of people and their professionalism throughout the Civil \nService ranks of our Federal Government with regard to their \ndischarging their individual responsibilities at this point in time in \nour history on issues which are extremely complex to resolve.\n  I also briefly responded to press inquiries this morning about the \ntiming of what thoughts I may have, and when I might share them with my \ncolleagues. I am frequently--today being an example--speaking privately \nwith a number of colleagues in this body on their views. But publicly I \nhave decided to withhold some ideas I may have which may be \nincorporated in one or more amendments until such time as the President \nhas had the opportunity to address the Nation.\n  I wish to go back in a very respectful way and remind the Senate of \nthe legislation, the appropriations bill passed some 6 or 7 weeks ago. \nThat bill included a bill that I and others brought to the Senate \nfloor. It received, I think, over a majority of votes. That bill that I \nbrought to the floor together with a number of cosponsors--indeed, my \ndistinguished colleague from Nebraska was very much an active party \nwith it--that bill was embraced in the final version of the \nappropriations bill which became the law of the land.\n  In that bill the provisions that we discussed and debated here in the \nSenate, and indeed which had passed by a majority vote, required as \nfollows. I wish to read the ``Reports Required'' portion.\n\n       The President shall submit an initial report, in classified \n     and unclassified format, to the Congress, not later than July \n     15, 2007, assessing the status of each of the specific \n     benchmarks established above, and declaring, in his judgment, \n     whether satisfactory progress toward meeting these benchmarks \n     is, or is not, being achieved.\n\n  I had the opportunity this morning to join his senior staff at the \nWhite House and discussed my views with them. We discussed this report. \nI left that meeting this morning with the definite impression that the \nWhite House and other elements of our Government are approaching this \nlegislative requirement--which originated in this Chamber and was \nadopted by this Chamber and eventually became law--they are approaching \nthat responsibility with an absolutely sincere depth of commitment.\n  I was asked by the press whether I thought they would brush it off. I \nresoundingly replied, ``No.'' As a matter of fact, I have reason to \nbelieve that the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense are \nvery actively working with senior White House staff and others--the \nDirector of our Intelligence, the Director of the CIA--they are all \nactively working in preparation of that report.\n  I read the next provision in our bill.\n\n       The President, having consulted with the Secretary of \n     State, the Secretary of Defense, the Commander of Multi-\n     National forces--Iraq, and the United States Ambassador to \n     Iraq, and the Commander of U.S. Central Command, will prepare \n     the report and submit [it] to the Congress.\n\n  Paragraph 3:\n\n       If the President's assessment of any of the specific \n     benchmarks established above is unsatisfactory, the President \n     shall include in that report a description of such revisions \n     to the political, economic, regional, and military components \n     of the strategy, as announced by the President on January 10, \n     2007. In addition, the President shall include in the report, \n     the advisability of implementing such aspects of the \n     bipartisan Iraq Study Group--commonly referred to as Baker-\n     Hamilton--as he deems appropriate.\n\n  No. 4:\n\n       The President shall submit a second report to the Congress, \n     not later than September 15, 2007, following the same \n     procedures and criteria, outlined above.\n\n  No. 5:\n\n       The reporting requirement detailed in section 1227 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 is \n     waived. . . .\n\n  --given that these reports are going to be put in.\n  Speaking only for myself, I am going to withhold any comments I have \nspecifically in large measure out of deference to exactly what we asked \nthe President to do and exactly which I feel the President is about to \ndo. I have reason to believe and it is my hope that it is done possibly \na little earlier than the 15th, since the 15th falls on a day this \nweekend, thereby giving Members the opportunity to see exactly what he \nhas done in response--again I reiterate--to the law as written by the \nCongress and a law that originated in this Chamber.\n  With that, I look forward to the week, working with my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The junior Senator \nfrom Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2012 to Amendment No. 2011\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I call up a bipartisan amendment with 29 of \nmy colleagues that is focused squarely on supporting our troops who are \nfighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. I now send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Webb, for himself, Mr. \n     Hagel, Mr. Reid, Mr. Levin, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Tester, Mrs. \n     McCaskill, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Harkin, \n     Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Pryor, Mr. \n     Sanders, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \n     Cantwell, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Biden, Ms. Stabenow, and \n     Ms. Landrieu proposes an amendment numbered 2012 to amendment \n     No. 2011.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To specify minimum periods between deployment of units and \n members of the Armed Forces for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation \n                           Enduring Freedom)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1031. MINIMUM PERIODS BETWEEN DEPLOYMENT FOR UNITS AND \n                   MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES FOR OPERATION IRAQI \n                   FREEDOM AND OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM.\n\n       (a) Minimum Period for Units and Members of the Regular \n     Components.--\n\n[[Page S8769]]\n\n       (1) In general.--No unit or member of the Armed Forces \n     specified in paragraph (3) may be deployed for Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom (including \n     participation in the NATO International Security Assistance \n     Force (Afghanistan)) unless the period between the deployment \n     of the unit or member is equal to or longer than the period \n     of such previous deployment.\n       (2) Sense of congress on optimal minimum period between \n     deployments.--It is the sense of Congress that the optimal \n     minimum period between the previous deployment of a unit or \n     member of the Armed Forces specified in paragraph (3) to \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom and a \n     subsequent deployment of the unit or member to Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom should be equal \n     to or longer than twice the period of such previous \n     deployment.\n       (3) Covered units and members.--The units and members of \n     the Armed Forces specified in this paragraph are as follows:\n       (A) Units and members of the regular Army.\n       (B) Units and members of the regular Marine Corps.\n       (C) Units and members of the regular Navy.\n       (D) Units and members of the regular Air Force.\n       (E) Units and members of the regular Coast Guard.\n       (b) Minimum Period for Units and Members of the Reserve \n     Components.--\n       (1) In general.--No unit or member of the Armed Forces \n     specified in paragraph (3) may be deployed for Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom (including \n     participation in the NATO International Security Assistance \n     Force (Afghanistan)) if the unit or member has been deployed \n     at any time within the three years preceding the date of the \n     deployment covered by this subsection.\n       (2) Sense of congress on mobilization and optimal minimum \n     period between deployments.--It is the sense of Congress \n     that--\n       (A) the units and members of the reserve components of the \n     Armed Forces should not be mobilized continuously for more \n     than one year; and\n       (B) the optimal minimum period between the previous \n     deployment of a unit or member of the Armed Forces specified \n     in paragraph (3) to Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation \n     Enduring Freedom and a subsequent deployment of the unit or \n     member to Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring \n     Freedom should be five years.\n       (3) Covered units and members.--The units and members of \n     the Armed Forces specified in this paragraph are as follows:\n       (A) Units and members of the Army Reserve.\n       (B) Units and members of the Army National Guard.\n       (C) Units and members of the Marine Corps Reserve.\n       (D) Units and members of the Navy Reserve.\n       (E) Units and members of the Air Force Reserve.\n       (F) Units and members of the Air National Guard.\n       (G) Units and members of the Coast Guard Reserve.\n       (c) Waiver by the President.--The President may waive the \n     limitation in subsection (a) or (b) with respect to the \n     deployment of a unit or member of the Armed Forces specified \n     in such subsection if the President certifies to Congress \n     that the deployment of the unit or member is necessary to \n     meet an operational emergency posing a threat to vital \n     national security interests of the United States.\n       (d) Waiver by Miliary Chief of Staff or Commandant for \n     Voluntary Mobilizations.--\n       (1) Army.--With respect to the deployment of a member of \n     the Army who has voluntarily requested mobilization, the \n     limitation in subsection (a) or (b) may be waived by the \n     Chief of Staff of the Army (or the designee of the Chief of \n     Staff of the Army).\n       (2) Navy.--With respect to the deployment of a member of \n     the Navy who has voluntarily requested mobilization, the \n     limitation in subsection (a) or (b) may be waived by the \n     Chief of Naval Operations (or the designee of the Chief of \n     Naval Operations).\n       (3) Marine corps.--With respect to the deployment of a \n     member of the Marine Corps who has voluntarily requested \n     mobilization, the limitation in subsection (a) or (b) may be \n     waived by the Commandant of the Marine Corps (or the designee \n     of the Commandant of the Marine Corps).\n       (4) Air force.--With respect to the deployment of a member \n     of the Air Force who has voluntarily requested mobilization, \n     the limitation in subsection (a) or (b) may be waived by the \n     Chief of Staff of the Air Force (or the designee of the Chief \n     of Staff of the Air Force).\n       (5) Coast guard.--With respect to the deployment of a \n     member of the Coast Guard who has voluntarily requested \n     mobilization, the limitation in subsection (a) or (b) may be \n     waived by the Commandant of the Coast Guard (or the designee \n     of the Commandant of the Coast Guard).\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to point out as of this point there \nare 29 cosponsors on this amendment. They include our majority leader \nas well as Senator Hagel as the lead Republican cosponsor, Senator \nLevin, the chair of our committee, Senators Obama, Clinton, Durbin, \nTester, Byrd, McCaskill, Kennedy, Salazar, Kerry, Harkin, Feinstein, \nSchumer, Brown, Pryor, Sanders, Murray, Klobuchar, Boxer, Mikulski, \nCantwell, Stabenow, Akaka, Dodd, Biden, and Landrieu.\n  This is an amendment that is focused squarely on supporting our \ntroops who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. It speaks directly to \ntheir welfare and to the needs of their families by establishing \nminimum periods between deployments for both our regular and reserve \ncomponents.\n  I offer this amendment having grown up as a military family member, \nhaving watched a father deployed, as one who has served as a marine and \nbeen deployed, as one who has had a family member deployed in this war, \nand also as someone who, for 3 years, was privileged to oversee our \nNational Guard and Reserve programs as Assistant Secretary of Defense, \nduring which time I also spent a good bit of energy looking at \nmobilization issues, including how manpower flow issues were predicted \nto have occurred if we went to war.\n  The manpower policies that are feeding the situations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan presently are unprecedented in our history. This not only \ninvolves the repeated use of a small pool of active Army and Marine \nCorps forces, it also regards the use of the National Guard and \nReserves at a tempo that we never could have anticipated when we were \ndesigning the total force concept.\n  It also involves the use of contractors doing so-called security \nwork, performing missions that historically have been the \nresponsibility of American military men and women. Now in the fifth \nyear of ground operations in Iraq, this deck of cards has come crashing \ndown on the backs of our soldiers and marines who have been deployed \nagain and again, while the rest of the country sits back and debates \nIraq as an intellectual or emotional exercise.\n  These men and women are doing a wonderful job. They are also paying a \nheavy price. That price became clearer in a wide variety of statistics, \nwhich I will address momentarily, as well as in the personal stories \nthat we who have positions of authority are hearing on a daily basis. I \nand other supporters of this amendment believe no matter what one's \nview is of America's involvement in Iraq, the time has come for the \nCongress to place reasonable restrictions on how America's finest, our \nmilitary men and women, are being used.\n  Stated simply, after more than 4 years of ground operations in Iraq, \nwe have reached the point where we can no longer allow the ever-\nchanging nature of this administration's operational policies to drive \nthe way our troops are being deployed. In fact, the reverse is true. \nThe availability of our troops should be the main determinant of how \nground operations should be conducted.\n  Other amendments will be debated during the days ahead relating to \nthe withdrawal of our forces from Iraq, the proposed timetables and \nfuture course of the war, but this is one area where we all, as \nDemocrats and Republicans, should be able to come together. This \nrelates in some measure to what the distinguished senior Senator from \nVirginia was talking about a few minutes ago--whether there is a report \ncoming out in a week, whether there is an evaluation taking place in \nSeptember. And no matter what any of us believe about the future \nconduct of the war or about this timetable or that timetable, we owe it \nto our troops and to their families to establish a minimum floor for \ntheir combat deployments.\n  If we are serious about supporting our troops, there is no better \nplace to start than to correct the current troop rotation policy by \nrequiring a minimum amount of time between deployments. I said this in \nthe Chamber in March: The motivation behind this amendment is simple. \nIt is the same motivation that impelled me more than 30 years ago when \nI first started working on veterans issues: How do we support the \ntroops? What does that mean? Who speaks for the troops?\n  Like you, I listen to what they are saying. Here is what a \nconstituent in Virginia wrote to me recently. Her husband is an Active-\nDuty Infantry officer who is presently deployed in Iraq. She wrote:\n\n       As an Army wife I brace myself for the possibility that he \n     may be extended for a few\n\n[[Page S8770]]\n\n     months based on the recent troop surge, and, of course, he \n     was. This morning on the news I heard that President Bush is \n     extending the Army troops again. Enough is enough.\n\n  She wrote.\n\n       I am a patriotic American and an Army wife, but even we \n     have our limits. My husband has lost numerous soldiers, we \n     have dozens of amputees at Walter Reed and elsewhere, and \n     morale is dropping. These men need to come home. Please speak \n     out against another extension. Please bring our overextended \n     soldiers home.\n\n  After 4 years of combat, we must provide our troops and their \nfamilies with a predictable operational tempo that has adequate dwell \ntime between deployments. We owe this to our active participants but \nalso to the participants in the National Guard and Reserves.\n  Why is this bipartisan amendment so important? We all know the reason \nwell enough: a small group of people is answering the call time and \nagain. The result is that our ground forces in particular are being \nburnt out. The evidence is everywhere. We see it in falling retentions \nof experienced midgrade officers and noncommissioned officers. The \nincreasing attrition rate among Army company-grade officers is serious \nenough that our committee, the Senate Committee on Armed Services, \nincluded a reporting requirement on the Army's retention programs and \nincentives in the authorization bill that is now before us.\n  We see it in the West Point classes. In 2000 and 2001, the most \nrecent classes that finished their initial 5-year obligations, we are \ntold that their attrition is five times the level that it was before \nIraq for such classes. The statistics we have been shown indicate that \n54 percent of the West Point class of 2000 left the Army by the end of \nlast year, and 46 percent of the class of 2001 left the Army by the end \nof last year.\n\n  Senator Warner mentioned Admiral Mullen who is a longtime friend, a \nNaval Academy classmate, now waiting for confirmation as the next \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He was recently asked what was \nthe thing about which he was most concerned. He said, ``The Army.'' And \nwe are not talking about equipment. We are talking about the Army.\n  The Marine Corps is also seeing an upward trend in the loss of \ncritical midgrade noncommissioned officers. We also find new evidence \nof troop burnout in more numerous mental health issues arising from \nmultiple combat deployments. These are statistically observable. There \nis a new report by the Department of Defense that documents a higher \nrate of mental health issues for servicemen deploying multiple times or \nfor more than 6 months. A survey of servicemembers after their \ndeployments found that 38 percent of our soldiers, 31 percent of our \nmarines, and 49 percent of the National Guard report psychological \nproblems following their combat deployments.\n  The failure of current rotation policies to protect the welfare of \nour troops and their family members in both Regular and Reserve \ncomponents is well documented. This is an example drawn from the pages \nof our servicemembers' own newspaper, the Stars and Stripes.\n  Last week, the paper described how Army SGT Troy Tweed, newly \nassigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Armored Division, is slated to \ndeploy to Iraq before a full year of dwell time at home. Sergeant Tweed \nreturned home 5 months ago from his last deployment to Iraq. He is one \nof many former members of his old brigade who is slated to deploy 3 to \n4 months early because they received a new assignment. This will be \nSergeant Tweed's fifth deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  He says to the Stars and Stripes:\n\n       It feels like the individual situation of soldiers isn't \n     taken into account, you are just like a number.\n\n  The newspaper said it best.\n\n       Soldiers like Tweed fall through the cracks.\n\n  Closer to home, the Virginia Army National Guard, roughly 1,400 \nmembers of the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, the famous Stonewall \nBrigade, has been mobilized. I would point out as an aside that this is \na brigade with a long history that dates back to the Civil War, and, in \nfact, one of my ancestors fought in that brigade during the Civil War, \nwas wounded at Antietam, and lost his life at Chancellorsville.\n  The brigade presently is in training in Mississippi and will deploy \nto Iraq in September. Deploying with this brigade are 700 members of \nthe 3rd Battalion who returned only 2 years ago from a deployment in \nAfghanistan. Forty percent of this battalion will be making its second \ncombat deployment in less than 3 years as members of the National \nGuard.\n  One colonel, a brigade commander stationed in Iraq, recently \ndescribed his soldiers this way: They have spent the last 4 years on a \ncontinuous cycle of fighting, training, deploying, and fighting, and \nthey see no end in sight. They have seen their closest friends killed \nand maimed, leaving young spouses and children as widows and single-\nparent kids. They want time for themselves and time to raise families \nfor a while.\n  When they look forward to a 15-month deployment with 12 months in \nbetween, they see their home station time as being compressed, with \nintensified training, which means more time away from families and \npersonal pursuits.\n  I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have heard similar \nstories. I would just like to point out that this cycle, the strategy \ndriving our troop rotation, must be reversed. The bipartisan amendment \nI introduced this afternoon takes a modest step to reverse this \npractice by establishing a floor for minimum periods between \ndeployments for both units and members.\n  It says if a unit or member of a Regular component deploys to Iraq or \nAfghanistan, they will have the same time at home, dwell time, before \nthey are deployed; for Guard and Reserves, they will have three times \nthe amount of time that they were deployed.\n  This is not a grand scheme to achieve an ideal troop rotation \nscenario. The ideal rotation scenario is two to one for Active, and \nfive to one for Guard and Reserves, which we put in this amendment as a \ngoal. What we are attempting to do is to put a floor under this and \nstate what would be optimal. I would point out that the Adjutant \nGeneral of my State of Virginia, MG Robert Newman, told us today that \nit is important to consider alternatives like this, like a minimum \ndwell time that will provide this sort of predictability.\n  Active Army units now deploy for 15 months with a 12-month period \nbetween deployments. Many Active Marine Corps units are also below the \none-to-one rotation cycle. Individual soldiers and marines who have \nrecently returned from deployment are also reassigned as backfills to \nnew units marked for deployment.\n  Dwell time is not downtime. It entails frequent absences as units \nretrain, refurbish, reequip, and assimilate new members. After the \nfirst month at home, for example, a marine generally spends 48 days in \nthe field away from family, firing on the rifle range, or on weekend \nduty.\n  This amendment provides for fair and reasonable waivers. It gives the \nPresident the waiver authority in the event of an operational emergency \nthat poses a vital threat to our national security. This is a low \nthreshold. It will allow the President to respond to any emergency \noperational requirement, including those in Iraq and Afghanistan by \ncertifying a need to waive the amendment's limitations.\n  It provides military departments the authority to waive individual \nvolunteers. In other words, if you want to go back sooner you can.\n  Contrary to some critics, the amendment does not micromanage the \nPresident in his role as Commander in Chief, nor does it tie the hands \nof our operational commanders in theaters. A more predictable dwell \ntime will be transparent to our forward-deployed commanders. Military \ndepartments have long experienced managing people as individuals. We \nfought the Vietnam war on an individual rotational policy, before the \nwidespread use of today's information technology systems that make it \nfar easier for us to monitor when an individual returned from a \ndeployment so that you have a date certain for when his dwell time \nwould expire.\n  There was some comment about constitutional authority. The \nconstitutional authority of this amendment is clear. Article I, section \n8, of the Constitution empowers the Congress to make rules for the \nGovernment and regulations of the land and naval forces.\n\n[[Page S8771]]\n\n  As Acting Secretary of Army Geren stated during his confirmation \nhearing last month:\n\n       Article I of the Constitution makes Congress and the Army \n     full partners.\n\n  There are precedents for this action. Congress has acted in a similar \nway in the past. The best recent example was in 1961 during the height \nof the Korean war when Congress intervened to ensure our servicemembers \nwere not sent to war before they were properly trained. The Selective \nService Act was amended to provide that every person inducted into the \nArmed Forces would receive full and adequate training for a period not \nless than 4 months.\n  The law also stipulated that no personnel during this 120-day period \nwould be assigned for duty outside the United States.\n  It could have been argued in the Korean war that we had manpower \nrequirements that should have allowed the Department of Defense or the \noperational commanders or the President as Commander in Chief to send \nmilitary people outside of the country before they had 120 days of \ntraining. But the Congress intervened and said: No; 120 days is \nessential for the well-being of our troops, just as this amendment \ntoday says that dwell time, time back home, is essential for the well-\nbeing of our troops.\n  This Chamber has a clear duty to assert our authority to prevent \nfurther damage to our military. The current strategy, the current \noperational policy does not justify the way we are deploying our \ntroops.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize this common interest we share in \naddressing the welfare of our troops and their families. I have been \nencouraged to hear sentiments echoed recently by some of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle who are equally interested in forging a \nnew road to the future, including Senators Lugar, Domenici, Voinovich, \nCollins, and even my senior colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner. \nThey have studied the course of the war in Iraq. They ask the same \nquestions that trouble us all: How can we continue to ask our troops to \nsacrifice indefinitely while the Iraqi Government is not making \nmeasurable progress, and many other questions.\n  The bottom line in all of this is that as we move forward responsibly \nto relocate our military from Iraq over a period of time, we cannot \ncontinue to do what we are doing to the troops we are sending over and \nover again. We seek a conclusion at the end of this engagement that \nwill enable us to withdraw our combat forces from Iraq, that will lead \nto progressively greater regional stability, that will allow us to \nfight international terrorism more effectively, and that will enable us \nto more fully address our broader strategic visions around the world. \nThe American people expect us to do that, to move our country forward \nin a collaborative way, but they also expect us to use our troops in a \nway that addresses their welfare and uses them in a way that is more \nproperly related to the tasks at hand in Iraq and Afghanistan. So we \ncan no longer continue to place such a disproportionately large burden \non the shoulders of so few people. We need a balance. It is up to the \nCongress to establish that balance.\n  As a young Army wife wrote to me recently: Enough is enough.\n  I thank my colleagues who have signed on as original cosponsors, and \nI urge all colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n             Unanimous-Consent Agreement--Executive Session\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at \n4:30, the Senate proceed to executive session; that there be 1 hour for \ndebate equally divided between Senators Leahy and Specter or their \ndesignees; that at 5:30 p.m., the Senate vote on Calendar No. 138, \nfollowed by 20 minutes for debate on Calendar No. 140, equally divided \nbetween Senators Leahy and Brownback; that at the conclusion or the \nyielding back of that time, the Senate vote on Calendar No. 140; that \nif Calendar No. 140 is confirmed, the Senate then vote on Calendar Nos. \n139 and 154; that the motions to reconsider be laid on the table, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Hagel \nas a cosponsor to my amendment No. 2000 to the 2008 National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2013 to Amendment No. 2012\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2013 to amendment No. 2012.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       This section shall take effect one day after the date of \n     this bill's enactment.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It is my understanding Senator Hagel wants to \nspeak on an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2012\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I appreciate the time.\n  I rise to support the Webb amendment on troop readiness. The \ndistinguished junior Senator from Virginia has taken, once again, an \nimportant leadership role on an issue that is as important to our \ncountry, to our military, and their families as any one issue, and that \nis readiness, because it is the men and women whom we ask to fight and \ndie for this country who must always be our highest priority. The men \nand women who serve this country in uniform and their families deserve \na policy worthy of their sacrifices. I appreciate the leadership of my \nfriend from Virginia on this issue. This is part of an amendment \nSenator Webb and I had introduced a couple of months ago.\n  In February of this year, GEN Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, reported to Congress that there is now, in his words, \n``significant'' risk that our military will not be able to respond to \nan emerging crisis in another part of the world. Since that time, the \nUnited States has sent more of our soldiers and more of our military \nequipment to Iraq.\n  The war in Iraq has pushed the U.S. military to the breaking point. \nI, like most of my colleagues, have been told by military leaders, both \non active duty and those who are retired, that we are doing tremendous \ndamage to our Army and to our Marine Corps, as well as our Army \nNational Guard. Our troops are being deployed longer than they should \nbe, more frequently than they should be, and without full training and \nequipment. We are eroding our military power at a time when our country \nfaces an increasing arc of challenges and threats across the globe. We \nare abusing our all-voluntary force in a dangerous and irresponsible \nway. Senator Webb recited a number of the facts--facts, not \ninterpretations, not subjective analysis, but facts--as to what is \nhappening to our military today because of the burden we are placing on \nthem in Iraq, our fifth year in Iraq, our sixth year in Afghanistan.\n  This amendment goes to the heart of ensuring the readiness of our \nmilitary and the time between deployments. This amendment will ensure \nthat all Active units that have deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan have \ntime at home that is at least equal to the length of the previous \ndeployment. If we can't commit at least that to our forces, then what \ncan we commit to them? For the National Guard and Reserves, our \namendment establishes a minimum 3 years between deployments. Longer and \nmore predictable dwell time will allow soldiers to rest, reequip, \nretrain, and return to their families. Our amendment has waiver \nauthority because there can be extraordinary circumstances that require \nextraordinary use of our military. We have used that over and over and \nover in Iraq.\n  Today, in our fifth year in Iraq, in the middle of a civil war, we \nmust return to the standards that allowed us to create the finest \nmilitary force the world has ever known, the best led, the best \neducated, the best trained, the\n\n[[Page S8772]]\n\nbest equipped, and the most committed military the world has ever \nknown. You can't make those kinds of militaries. You can't build those \nkinds of militaries overnight or even over 5 years. It took some of \nthis country's greatest military leaders post-World War II--more \nimportantly, post-Vietnam--such as General Powell, General Schwarzkopf, \nand many others, to commit their lives, 35 years of their lives to \nrebuild a broken military after we broke it in Vietnam. We are headed \nin the same direction unless we get control of this disaster now. \nNothing is more important to our country, to our society than our \npeople.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. I \nappreciate the leadership of the junior Senator from Virginia who knows \nsomething about the military, who knows something about war.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the Senator \nfrom Nebraska for his leadership on this issue and his support for this \namendment. It is my firm hope that people on the other side of the \naisle will understand this amendment for what it is and, no matter what \ntheir views of the propriety of the war in Iraq or the direction of the \nPresident's strategy, will understand this is a minimum bottom line in \nterms of how the U.S. military is used around the world.\n  For the record, Senator Hagel and I, to my knowledge, are the only \nveterans of ground combat in Vietnam in this body. It is a privilege \nand a pleasure to have him with me on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I commend Senator Hagel and \nSenator Webb. I was serving as a lieutenant and a captain in the U.S. \nArmy during Vietnam. I was not sent to Vietnam but clearly dealt with \nall of its aftermath in the duties I did carry in the military. I \nsupport the Webb amendment and appreciate his statement and the \nheartfelt statement of Senator Hagel.\n  Earlier, Senator Hagel had joined me in being an original cosponsor \nof an amendment the two of us will be offering later having to do with \nwidows and orphans. Senator Hagel is a longtime supporter of the effort \nto repeal this offset to the Survivor Benefit Plan by the dependent \nindemnity compensation.\n  What we have is Active-Duty servicemembers who pay for an insurance \nplan called the Survivor Benefit Plan. If they are killed in active \nduty, their families have some subsistence to carry on which they have \nprovided for because they did that additional paying for what is in \neffect an insurance plan. In another part of the law under the \nVeterans' Administration, there is something known as the dependent \nindemnity compensation, and it, too, takes care of survivors and \nfamilies. The problem is, the two offset each other and, as a result, \nparticularly with some of the privates and the corporals and the young \nsergeants who have provided for their families when they are deceased, \nthose young widows are having difficulty making financial ends meet. We \nhave to correct this.\n\n  Isn't it interesting all this goes back to statements made by \nPresident Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. In his second inaugural \naddress, he said that one of the greatest obligations of war was to \ntake care of the widow and the orphan. If we look at the cost of war--\nguns, ammunition, tanks, trucks, airplanes, body armor, all of that is \na cost of war. Transportation, logistics, all of that is a cost of war.\n  Well, there is another cost of war, and it is the cost of war in \ntaking care of the survivors. The U.S. Government ought to plan on, as \na cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, taking care of our veterans \nand their widows, widowers, and orphans.\n  So as we get into this Defense authorization bill, we are going to \nhave the privilege of honoring the men and women and families who have \ngiven the ultimate sacrifice in service to this Nation. We are going to \nhave the opportunity to remove the injustice facing our veterans. That \ninjustice is this offset which offsets the indemnity compensation--a \nbenefit from the Veterans' Administration--with the Survivor Benefit \nPlan, which is paid for by our veterans.\n  So when a veteran, as an Active-Duty military member, has paid out of \ntheir own paycheck into the Survivor Benefit Plan--it is similar to an \ninsurance program--they do not get the full benefit because of the \nsurviving spouse's and the children's eligibility under the Veterans' \nAdministration program, the Dependent Indemnity Compensation program.\n  Now, to offset those two is not right. So this amendment, No. 2000, \nis going to end that injustice. Senator Hagel and I will be offering it \nlater on, as we get on in this next 2 weeks, down the road on this \nDefense authorization bill. But for 7 years, this Senator has been \ntrying to pass this legislation that will remove this offset.\n  Last year, we passed it in the Senate by a whopping vote of 92 to 6, \nonly the leadership in the conference down in the House whacked it out \nlast year. We are going to try to prevent that from occurring. The \nobjection to it is it costs $8.2 billion over 10 years. But isn't it an \nobligation of the U.S. Government to take care of the families of their \nloved ones? I believe it is.\n  When the Senate passed this amendment that left out some \nbeneficiaries and required repayment of funds in the past, it was even \nmore. It was $9.6 billion. Well, it has now been calculated right at $8 \nbillion.\n  So that is coming down the road, and I am looking forward to getting \ninto it. I am looking forward to getting a lopsided, whopping vote \nagain in the Senate that will send a strong message to the conference \ncommittee to reconcile the House-passed and Senate-passed versions.\n  Now, I rise in my capacity as chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee. This overall bill is a good, \nbalanced bill, and it works to ensure the troops are trained, equipped, \nand supported. The bill was reported favorably to the Senate with a \nunanimous vote by our committee. It is a good indicator of the \nbipartisan support for the bill and a reflection of the manner in which \nthis committee has been led by Senator Levin, the chairman, Senator \nMcCain, the ranking member, and Senator Warner, the immediate past \nchairman, who has stepped in so often for Senator McCain, as he is \nright now but 7 or 8 feet from me in overlooking and managing this \nlegislation.\n  I wish to discuss the work of the subcommittee. The Strategic \nSubcommittee had a good year, and it has been a considerable pleasure \nfor me to work very closely with Senator Sessions of Alabama, as the \nranking member. Last year it was reversed. Senator Sessions was the \nchairman, and I was the ranking member. So we have worked together for \nseveral years with very difficult issues, sometimes contentious, but \nthey did not become contentious this year. We worked out almost all of \nthem.\n  We held five hearings and several briefings on a wide range of \nissues. These issues cover everything from space and intelligence, \nstrategic systems, such as bombers, submarines, ground-launched \nballistic missiles, the nuclear weapons programs, the missile defense \nprogram, and the bulk of the Defense-funded activities of the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  In the last several days, I have had the privilege of visiting our \nthree major National Defense Labs that concentrate on Department of \nEnergy nuclear weapons programs: first, Sandia and then Los Alamos--\nboth of them in New Mexico--and then on to Lawrence Livermore in \nCalifornia. I would commend to all Senators to go and see the work and \nbe briefed on the extraordinarily important stuff that is going on in \nthese national labs, being done by extraordinary people.\n\n  In the area of missile defense, this committee, our subcommittee, has \ncontinued implementing a policy we established last year, placing a \npriority on the development, testing, fielding, and improvement of \neffective near-term missile defense capabilities, particularly to \nprotect forward-deployed U.S. forces and allies against existing \nthreats from short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles.\n  Where are the threats? The threats the ballistic missile defense is \nbeing developed for now are different than what was announced 20 years \nago by President Reagan. After President\n\n[[Page S8773]]\n\nReagan and Gorbachev was--well, then he was the head of the Communist \nParty, and I do not remember if his title was President. But he was, in \neffect, the leader of the Soviet Union. After their meeting at \nReykjavik, Iceland, they started to bring down the numbers of these \nstrategic systems, such as the missiles and the warheads.\n  Later, President Reagan offered to Mikhail Gorbachev: Well, we will \ndevelop this system of national missile defense and we will give it to \nyou and we can both then have, in effect, two systems that assure \nmutually assured destruction because of so many thermonuclear warheads \nthat we can have to blunt each other.\n  Well, things changed along the way. The Soviet Union crumbled. But \nthe bulk of all that capability in the Soviet Union is retained by \nRussia. Happily, there has been the continued progress on the \ndismantling of the warheads in both the United States and Russia.\n  But as to the ballistic missile defense program, which had fits and \nstarts, the technical requirements are exceptional, and it has been \nvery difficult to achieve. The requirements of using it changed, and \nso, in effect, it is being developed now to protect against missiles \nthat may be launched by North Korea against us or against any allies--\nand Iran. Looking into the future, Iran does not have this real \ncapability today, but we are concerned they will in the future, \nparticularly if their nuclear program continues as they are threatening \nit will. So the ballistic missile defense program has considerably \nshifted over the last two decades into a different kind of program.\n  Now it is facing a crucial test coming up this next month. We will \nsee if all it has been advertised to be able to do, in fact, is done \nthrough this test that is going to try to calibrate if, with kinetic \nenergy, with an incoming missile warhead, we can have a ballistic \nmissile defense system that can hit in outer space that incoming \nwarhead and/or warheads--you can imagine what kind of accuracy that has \nto be--in the midcourse phase in outer space or in the reentry phase, \nas it is coming back through the Earth's atmosphere.\n  In order to provide protection against these existing or near-term \nmissile threats, our committee, in the bill, has authorized an \nadditional $315 million to increase or accelerate work on the near-term \nmissile defense capabilities. That includes $255 million for the Aegis \nBMD, the Patriot PAC-3, and the THAAD systems, which I will describe in \na minute. It also authorizes an additional $60 million for the joint \nIsrael-U.S. work on the Arrow missile defense system and on the short-\nrange missile defense. These increases are offset by reductions in far-\nterm and lower priority programs.\n  With respect to the overall funding, our committee authorized a total \nof $10.1 billion for the ballistic missile defense programs. That is a \nnet reduction of $231 million below the budget request for the Missile \nDefense Agency. That is a 2-percent reduction.\n  Let me summarize what is in the bill. The bill is going to authorize \nthe entire Army funding request for the Patriot PAC-3 program, \nincluding funding for its ``Pure Fleet'' initiative. The committee also \nauthorized an additional $75 million to procure 25 additional PAC-3 \nmissiles.\n  The Patriot PAC-3 system is our only ballistic missile defense system \nthat has already proven to be effective in combat, and we do not have \nenough PAC-3 units or missiles to provide the capabilities our \ncombatant commanders need today. The committee authorized an additional \n$75 million for the Aegis ballistic missile defense program to increase \nthe production rate of Standard Missile 3 interceptors, procure 15 \nadditional SM-3 missiles, and accelerate the work on the Aegis BMD \nsingle processor and open architecture program.\n\n  Now, in a unanimous consent request I previously made to go into \nexecutive session at 4:30, since I am not through with my statement, \nwhat is the pleasure of the Presiding Officer?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is up to the Senator to ask for unanimous \nconsent at this point if he wants to continue speaking and to revise \nthe earlier unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nunderstood that at 4:30 the Senate was to turn to the debate on the \npending judicial nominations which will be voted on at 5:30. Now, the \ntwo Senators who were to come to the floor at this appointed time--\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, why don't I suggest to the \nSenator that I continue with my statement until the Senators arrive.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to speak to the judicial nominees. I will tell my \ncolleague what I will do to accommodate the Senator, if he will give me \na few minutes and I will put this into the Record.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, why don't you, since I am in \nmid sentence, let me take about 5 more minutes and complete my \nstatement.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to accommodate my good friend in \nany way he wishes to be accommodated, if that is his desire, but with \nthe appearance of one of the Senators on the floor, I hope I can get in \nunder this unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nproceed for 5 more minutes, to be followed by the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Aegis BMD program provides \nan important and improving missile defense capability of $105 million, \nand that is to increase the missile production rate. The THAAD system \nhas shown good success in its testing program thus far. The bill offers \n$25 million new for the coproduction of the Arrow system and $10 \nmillion to study the suitability of the THAAD missile to serve as a \nfollow-on to Israel's Arrow system. We also have an increase of $25 \nmillion for the accelerated joint development of short-range ballistic \nmissile defense, and that is for Israel.\n  In our bill we had a budget request, and it included $310 million for \nthe proposed development of long-range missile defenses in Europe. That \nwas 10 interceptors in Poland and a large radar in the Czech Republic. \nThe U.S. is just starting negotiations with those nations, and it \nappears unlikely there are going to be any final agreements before \n2009. The proposed interceptor has not yet been developed and is not \nplanned to be tested until 2010. As a result, the proposed construction \nand deployment activities are premature. So what we do in the bill is \nreduce the request $85 million for construction activities, and we \nfence the remaining 2008 funds requested for deployment until two \nthings happen: No. 1, that the host nations have approved any missile \ndefense deployment agreements; and No. 2, that the Congress receives an \nindependent assessment examining the full range of options for missile \ndefense in Europe.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about the airborne laser. This is a program \nthat has been in some difficulty. What we did was reduce the funding of \n$548 million requested by $200 million. We discussed it at length in \nthe markup. The airborne laser is a very expensive, high-risk \ntechnology demonstration program of a chemical laser, and you have to \ntake huge quantities of chemicals and put them in a 747. There is \nexcellent technology that is being developed on a solid-state laser \nsystem, which would fill the volume only from me to Senator Warner. It \ncould easily be put into an airplane, but we think the cost of this \nprogram is exceptionally high. It is going to cost $5 billion; $3.5 \nbillion has already been spent. We felt to hold back on this \ndevelopment by only $200 million out of $548 million would be wise. I \nwill go into more detail at a later time.\n  We also authorized provisions to improve acquisition and oversight of \nballistic missile defense programs, and I won't go into the details on \nthat.\n  I will tell my colleagues, in conclusion, on our strategic forces \nwith regard to the B-52 bomber modernization program, we had unanimity.\n  With regard to the space programs where there has been difficulty \nwith a number of them, we had unanimity on that in the committee, and \nwe bring that forth in the report. I will provide those issues later.\n  Then on nuclear weapons issues, the reliable replacement warhead, we \ncontinue unanimously through the next year in what is called the phase \nII activities. Then an evaluation can be made as to whether to go \nforward in phase III. But there is a great deal of\n\n[[Page S8774]]\n\npromise that is shown in the reliable replacement warhead, which has a \ngreat deal of promise of being safer and more secure and less explosive \npower, more geared to today's targets.\n  So that is the report from our committee.\n  Mr. President, following the bloodiest of America's wars, President \nAbraham Lincoln, in his second inaugural address, said that one of the \ngreatest obligations in war is to take care of the widow and the \norphan. The U.S. Government ought to plan, as a cost of the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan, for taking care of our veterans and their widows, \nwidowers, and orphans.\n  Over the days ahead, this body will have the privilege of honoring \nthe men, women, and families who have given the ultimate sacrifice in \nservice to the Nation. We will have the opportunity to remove the last \ninjustice facing our veterans. That injustice is the one that offsets \ndependents indemnity compensation, a benefit from the Veterans' \nAdministration, with the Survivor Benefit Plan, which is paid for by \nour veterans. Those who pay out of their own paycheck into the Survivor \nBenefit Plan, which is like an insurance program to which survivors \nwould be entitled, don't get the full benefit because of the surviving \nspouses' and children's eligibility under the dependents indemnity \ncompensation through the Veterans' Administration.\n  I have filed amendment 2000 to end that injustice. I am pleased that \nSenator Hagel will join me in this endeavor as an equal cosponsor. For \n7 years I have been trying to pass this legislation that will remove \nthis offset to take care of the widows, widowers, and orphans who have \nlost a loved one to combat- or service-connected injuries. Last year, \nthis body passed a similar amendment by 92 to 6. I hope that all of my \nfellow Senators and the majority of the House will pass this amendment \nto the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n  Some who object to this amendment will say the cost is too high, $8.2 \nbillion over 10 years. But to those who object, isn't it an obligation \nof the Government to take care of the families affected by the loss of \ntheir loved ones? This Senator passionately and firmly believes it is. \nLast year, when the Senate passed this amendment that left out some \nbeneficiaries and required repayment of refunds, the cost was $9.6 \nbillion. Now, the cost is lower, all beneficiaries are covered, and the \nbeneficiaries will not have the burden of repaying refunds that should \nnot have been required in the first place. There should never have been \nan offset.\n  However, because of the offset, airmen, seamen and privates will find \nit difficult to make financial ends meet. I say that the families of \nthe men and women who do not return home from Iraq and Afghanistan, who \nhave already lost so much, should not have to endure financial \nhardships because of this benefits offset.\n  Now, the Senate has an opportunity to change this injustice as we \ndebate the National Defense Authorization Act. If we respond as we did \nlast year, passing this legislation with overwhelming support, then \nwhen it gets down to a conference committee, we must insist that the \nHouse support this provision in conference.\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak on the Senate Armed Services Committee \nbill being considered by the Senate, S. 1547, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. Overall it is a good, balanced \nbill that works to ensure the troops are trained, equipped, and \nsupported. The bill was reported favorably to the Senate on a unanimous \nvote of the committee, a good indicator of the bipartisan support for \nthe bill and a reflection on he manner in which the committee operates \nunder Senator Levin's leadership, and Senator Warner's leadership \nbefore that.\n  Specifically, however, I wish to discuss the work of the Subcommittee \non Strategic Forces, which I have had the privilege of chairing this \nyear. The Strategic Subcommittee had a good year and it has been a real \npleasure to work with Senator Jeff Sessions and his staff. We have \nworked together to resolve a number of difficult issues.\n  The committee held a total of five hearings and several briefings \ncovering the wide range of issues under the jurisdiction of the \nsubcommittee. This includes space and intelligence programs, strategic \nsystems such as bombers, and submarine and ground-launched ballistic \nmissiles, nuclear weapons programs and issues, the missile defense \nprogram, and the bulk of the defense-funded activities at the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  In the area of ballistic missile defense, the committee continued \nimplementing the policy we established last year--placing a priority on \nthe development, testing, fielding, and improvement of effective near-\nterm missile defense capabilities, particularly to protect forward-\ndeployed U.S. forces and allies against existing threats from short- \nand medium-range ballistic missiles.\n  In order to provide protection against existing and near-term missile \nthreats to our forward-deployed forces, allies, and friends, the bill \nwould authorize an additional $315 million to increase or accelerate \nwork on near-term missile defense capabilities. This includes $255 \nmillion for the Aegis BMD, Patriot PAC-3, and THAAD systems, which I \nwill describe shortly. It also authorizes an additional $60 million for \njoint US-Israeli work on the Arrow missile defense system and on short-\nrange missile defense. These increases are offset by reductions in far-\nterm and lower priority programs.\n  With respect to the overall level of funding, the committee \nauthorized a total of $10.1 billion for the ballistic missile defense \nprograms of the Missile Defense Agency and the Army. That is a net \nreduction of $231 million below the budget request for the Missile \nDefense Agency, just barely 2 percent.\n  In terms of specific budget actions, let me summarize what is in the \nbill. The bill would authorize the entire Army funding request for the \nPatriot PAC-3 program, including funding for its ``Pure Fleet'' \ninitiative. The committee also authorized an additional $75 million to \nprocure 25 additional PAC-3 missiles.\n  The Patriot PAC-3 system is our only ballistic missile defense system \nproven to be effective in combat, and we do not have enough PAC-3 units \nor missiles to provide the capabilities that our combatant commanders \nneed today.\n  The committee authorized an addition of $75 million for the Aegis \nBallistic Missile Defense, BMD, program to increase the production rate \nof Standard Missile-3, SM-3 interceptors, procure 15 additional SM-3 \nmissiles, and accelerate work on the Aegis BMD Signal Processor and \nOpen Architecture program.\n  The Aegis BMD program provides an important and improving missile \ndefense capability to our regional combatant commanders to defend \nagainst existing short- and medium-range missile threats. But our \nsenior military leaders responsible for missile defense have \nacknowledged that we need more of the SM-3 interceptors.\n  The committee approved an increase of $105 million for the Terminal \nHigh Altitude Area Defense, THAAD, system to increase the missile \nproduction rate, begin the upgrade of the evolved THAAD interceptor, \nand to conduct an additional test.\n  The THAAD system has shown good success in its testing program so \nfar, and it holds significant potential to defend many regions against \nmost ballistic missiles. But again, the Department has not planned or \nbudgeted for enough THAAD missiles or systems to provide the capability \nour combatant commanders need.\n  The bill would add $25 million for co-production of the Arrow \nmissile, and added $10 million to study the suitability of the THAAD \nmissile to serve as a follow-on to Israel's Arrow system.\n  The bill authorizes an increase of $25 million for accelerated joint \ndevelopment of a short-range ballistic missile defense, SRBMD, system \nfor Israel. This is intended to provide a capability to defend against \nthe type of short-range missiles and rockets that were fired at Israel \nlast summer from Lebanon.\n  I mentioned that the funding for these additions was offset by \nreductions in funding for lower priority, high-risk, or far-term \nprograms. I want to describe two of these reductions in the bill.\n  The budget request included $310 million for a proposed deployment of \nlong-range missile defenses in Europe: 10 interceptors in Poland and a \nlarge radar in the Czech Republic. The\n\n[[Page S8775]]\n\nUnited States is just starting negotiations with those nations, and it \nappears unlikely there will be any final agreements before 2009. In \naddition, the proposed interceptor has not yet been developed, and is \nnot planned to be tested until 2010. As a result the proposed \nconstruction and deployment activities are premature.\n  In the bill the subcommittee reduced the $85 million requested for \nconstruction activities and fenced the remaining fiscal year 2008 funds \nrequested for deployment until two things happen: 1) The host nations \nhave approved any missile defense deployment agreements; and, 2) The \nCongress receives an independent assessment examining the full range of \noptions for missile defense in Europe. All other activities could \ncontinue, such as studies, planning, and design activities, and \nnegotiations.\n  The bill would reduce funding for the Airborne Laser Program by $200 \nmillion from the $548 million requested. This is an issue we discussed \nduring the markup, and I want to provide some background on the \ncommittee's decision to reduce ABL funding.\n  The Airborne Laser is a very expensive, high-risk technology \ndemonstration program that is not scheduled to provide an operational \ncapability before 2018. So everyone should be clear that it is NOT a \nnear-term system.\n  The cost of the ABL program is very high, and the capability it might \nbe able to provide--if the technology can even work--appears rather \nlimited. The program has a history of cost overruns and schedule \ndelays.\n  Since the program started, the total cost of the development program \nto complete the first ABL shoot-down test in 2009 has ballooned to be \n$5 billion. And the Congressional Budget Office has an initial cost \nestimate that the ABL program could cost as much as $36 billion to \ndevelop, build, and operate a fleet of just seven Airborne Laser \naircraft.\n  For that huge sum of money, we could fund a very robust set of \nmissile defense capabilities with near-term programs like PAC-3, Aegis \nBMD, and THAAD.\n  The funding reduction in the bill would not terminate the ABL \nprogram, but it would cause some delay in the program. There have \nalready been four delays in the planned date of the first shoot-down \ntest, and this would probably mean an additional delay.\n  The policy we established in law last year makes it clear that our \npriority is on near-term, effective missile defense systems that can \nprovide needed capabilities against existing and near-term threats. The \nbill authorizes additional funding for exactly such systems, and \nreduces funding for systems like the Airborne Laser to offset the \nincreases.\n\n  The committee considered this matter during our markup, and defeated \nan amendment to restore the $200 million to the ABL program. I \nanticipate that we will consider the ABL again and at some length.\n  The committee also authorized provisions to improve acquisition and \noversight of ballistic missile defense programs. For example:\n  The bill would extend by 5 years the requirement for the Comptroller \nGeneral to assess the ballistic missile defense program annually.\n  The bill would require the Department of Defense, starting in fiscal \nyear 2009, to submit the budget request for the Missile Defense Agency \nusing regular budget categories (research and development, procurement, \noperation and maintenance, and military construction), and make certain \nacquisition and oversight improvements.\n  Until now, DOD has requested and Congress has approved MDA's use of \nexclusively RDT funds for all MDA activities, including fielding, \noperating, and building of missile defense systems. This is the only \nprogram for which this exception has been made, and it is no longer \nnecessary.\n  The bill would also ensure that the Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation has full access to missile defense test and evaluation data, \njust as is the case for all other major defense acquisition programs.\n  In the area of strategic forces, the bill includes additional funds \nto continue the B-52 Bomber modernization program and consolidates \nfunds for prompt global strike into a single defense-wide account. \nMoving the money from the Navy and Air Force lines to the combined line \nfor prompt global strike should allow a more focused approach to the \ntechnology challenges, such as thermal protection, and allow more \noptions to be explored, such as the Army's approach to prompt global \nstrike, which is currently not funded. In addition, consolidation \nshould allow the Strategic Command to have a more balanced program that \nmore closely meets the command's requirements. The bill also includes a \n3-year extension of the annual prompt global strike report.\n  The space programs continue to be one of the more difficult areas for \nthe subcommittee. Although there has been improvement in the management \nof most of the many space programs, the scope of the programs continues \nto challenge both the services and the contractors. All of the \ncommunication; missile warning; position, navigation, and timing--GPS; \nand weather satellite systems have simultaneous modernization programs \nunder way. In some instances the move to the next generation of \nprograms is occurring before the current modernization program is in \nplace, and in some cases the current modernization program is being \nterminated early to start the next one. All of this activity serves to \nexacerbate financial, technical, and schedule pressures on all of the \nprograms.\n  The Transformational Communications Program, T-Sat, the Global \nPositioning Satellite III and the Space-Based Infrared Satellite \nprogram--SBIRS--are all systems that fall into the category of multiple \nupgrade programs.\n  The bill includes additional funds for several satellite programs \nthat are being terminated early and where there is very high risk that \nthe follow-on program might not be ready on time. To alleviate the risk \nof these programs' gaps, funds are included to buy a fourth Advanced \nExtremely High Frequency communications satellite to ensure that there \nis no communications gap if there is an issue in the T-SAT program, and \nfor the third SBIRS missile warning satellite program, to ensure that \nthere is no gap in missile warning capability.\n  The T-SAT program itself is fully funded. While there is hope that \nthe first T-SAT will launch on time in fiscal year 2016, I would note \nthat there hasn't been one satellite to make its scheduled launch date \n8 years in advance.\n  The bill also terminates the space radar program and provides funds \nfor alternative approaches for space radar capabilities.\n  For the past several years the subcommittee has addressed a variety \nof contentious nuclear weapons issues. Again this year, the \nsubcommittee is faced with a difficult decision. The Departments of \nDefense and Energy, through the Nuclear Weapons Council, have approved \nthe start of a Reliable Replacement Warhead, RRW, program. This new \nwarhead could eventually be a replacement for the current W-76 warhead \nin the reentry vehicle for the Trident D-5 missile on ballistic missile \nsubmarines.\n  The Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration, \nNNSA, budget request for fiscal year 2008 includes a request for funds \nfor the RRW for phase 2A and phase 3 activities. At the time the budget \nwas submitted, the NNSA thought that it would be further along with \nphase 2 activities than it is, and considered the possibility of moving \nto phase 3 in fiscal year 2008. The bill includes funding for the RRW, \nconsolidated in a single line, but $43 million less than the $238 \nmillion requested. The bill clearly limits the work by the NNSA and the \nNavy to activities for RRW to phase 2A activities.\n  Let me explain what I mean by limiting activities to phase 2A \nactivities and why we took this action. The nuclear weapons acquisition \nprocess is organized in a phased approach from phase 1 to 7, with 6 \nbeing deployment and 7 being dismantlement. Any decision to manufacture \nor deploy an RRW, which would occur at phases 5 and 6 respectively, \nwill no doubt be very controversial. Over the course of the next 4 to 5 \nyears significant policy and technical discussion and debate will \nsurely take place on the RRW.\n  To begin the discussion, however, the bill recommends a cautious \nfirst step, recognizing that many questions need answers before any \nfinal decisions are\n\n[[Page S8776]]\n\nmade. The bill does not decide the fate of the RRW. That is a decision \nfor a future Congress and a future administration.\n  The bill also includes a requirement for new nuclear posture review \nand a sense of the Congress to help frame the nuclear policy debate for \nthe next administration. To ensure that weapons dismantlements \ncontinue, the bill includes an increase of $20 million to the budget \nrequest of $52 million to support nuclear weapons dismantlement.\n  I would like to note that last night I returned from an extensive 4-\nday visit to all three of the Department of Energy nuclear weapons \nlaboratories. While I discussed many issues with the laboratory \ndirectors and their staff, including nonproliferation issues, we spent \na considerable amount of time on the RRW. Most of the discussions were \nhighly classified, and so I cannot go into substantial detail here. But \nI want to ensure my colleagues that the progress made by the \nlaboratories under the Stockpile Stewardship Program is remarkable and \nthat there are many new opportunities to improve the safety, security, \nand reliability of nuclear weapons, which in turn should lead to very \nsubstantial reductions in the overall size of the stockpile--without a \nreturn to nuclear weapons testing.\n  Wrapping up the balance of the Department of Energy issues, the bill \nincludes two provisions that would task the GAO to review two \nsignificant areas of concern at DOE. The first study is on the \nstructure and management of the protective forces at DOE sites, and the \nsecond one on the future plans for the environmental restoration \nprograms.\n  In closing, the Strategic Subcommittee has a broad area of \nresponsibility, much of it controversial, but working with Senator \nSessions, we have been able to resolve the issues so the national \nsecurity interests of our country are foremost.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8776-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8776-S8785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF LIAM O'GRADY TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                      EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Liam O'Grady, \nof Virginia, to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unless the Senator from Virginia wants to \nmodify the pending unanimous consent request to make certain that this \nnomination is called at 5:30, there is now 1 hour of debate equally \ndivided on the nomination under the previous unanimous consent request, \nwhich would mean the vote would likely be in the range of 5:40.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am sorry, I was off the floor for a \nmoment. I hesitate to interfere with my Senator away from home. What is \nthe order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the pending unanimous consent request, \nthe debate was to begin at 4:30, with a vote at 5:30 on the judicial \nnomination. Senator Nelson asked unanimous consent and received it to \nproceed to speak and spoke until just a moment ago. So if we project 1 \nhour from now the debate for the judicial nominee, the vote is likely \nto occur near 5:40.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia wishes \nto take time for the Republican side?\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, actually, I had hoped to do it on the time of the \nDefense bill, but I yielded to the request of my colleague.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We will work out the time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I need 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield to the Senator from Virginia such time as he \nneeds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. He is always very courteous to the Senator from \nVirginia and I am appreciative of that.\n  I rise with a sense of great pleasure to support an outstanding \nVirginian, Judge Liam O'Grady, who has been nominated by the President \nto serve as an article III judge on the United States District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Virginia. I am pleased to note that Judge \nO'Grady also enjoys the support of my distinguished colleague, Senator \nWebb. Senator Webb, upon joining the Senate, has worked with me, as we \ndo on many things, in a very cooperative spirit to provide nominations \nto the President with respect to the judicial vacancies as they exist \nin our United States District Court in Virginia and to the Fourth \nCircuit, of which Virginia is one of the States served on that \ndistinguished judicial panel, which largely resides in Virginia. I \nthank my distinguished colleague, Senator Webb, because he has become a \nvery fast learner about the judicial process and we have worked \ntogether, and we now have nominations pending before the President with \nregard to the vacancies on the Fourth Circuit.\n  Turning to Judge O'Grady, he has been nominated to fill the seat that \nwas vacated by Judge Claude Hilton. For more than 20 years, Judge \nHilton served with distinction as an active judge in the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia. We are fortunate he is continuing to serve on the \ncourt in senior status. In my view, we are equally fortunate to have a \nnominee such as Liam O'Grady who is willing to continue his public \nservice on the bench.\n  Since joining the Virginia bar in 1978--quite a few years ago--Judge \nO'Grady has worked as a sole practitioner, as assistant Commonwealth's \nattorney, as an assistant United States attorney, as a partner in an \ninternational law firm, and for the last 4 years, he has worked with \nthe Eastern District of Virginia as a magistrate judge. Magistrate \njudges perform a very valuable function for our district courts.\n  His career has provided him with a wide array of experiences. As a \nsolo practitioner, he worked as a court-appointed criminal defense \nlawyer. As an assistant Commonwealth's attorney, he tried upwards of \n100 jury trials. As an assistant United States attorney, he focused on \nnarcotics and organized crime cases. As a partner at a well-known law \nfirm, he worked extensively on patent and trademark cases for a number \nof major industrial organizations in our country. As a magistrate \njudge, he has seen firsthand the extraordinary variety and volume of \ncases that come before a district judge serving not only in Virginia \nbut elsewhere in America.\n  Equally impressive is that despite the rigors of his career, he \nalways found time to give back to his community. He has helped shape \nyoung legal minds through the instruction of law at both George \nWashington University and George Mason University. Moreover, while in \nprivate practice, he set up a pro bono legal clinic in his law firm and \ntook court-appointed cases serving those in need.\n  It is clear to me that this outstanding nominee, now to be voted on \nshortly by the Senate, is eminently qualified to serve on this \nprestigious court. In addition to having the support of his home State \nSenators, Judge O'Grady received the highest--I repeat, the highest--\nrecommendation of the American Bar Association and was equally \nrecommended by a number of the bar associations of the Commonwealth of \nVirginia.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman, Senator Leahy, and Senator \nSpecter for providing the Virginia Senators an opportunity to present \nLiam O'Grady to the committee and for the committee to act in a very \nexpeditious way and now to bring this nomination to the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor and thank the distinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer. I want the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Virginia to know that, of course, I \nwill be supporting his nominee, Judge O'Grady. This is an example of \nhow quickly we can move judges when Senators work together. In this \ncase, one of the most distinguished Republican Senators,\n\n[[Page S8777]]\n\ncombined with a distinguished Democratic Member, helped move Judge \nO'Grady to the top of the list. I predict within the next hour or so he \nwill be confirmed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for the kind remarks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate continues to make progress today \nwith what I anticipate will be the confirmation of four more lifetime \nappointments to the Federal bench. Along with Judge O'Grady's \nnomination to the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, \nwe consider three nominations for lifetime appointments to the District \nCourt for the Western District of Michigan, those of Janet T. Neff, \nPaul Lewis Maloney, and Robert James Jonker. All four nominations are \nfor judicial emergency vacancies, and they all have the support of \ntheir home State Senators.\n  I thank Senators Levin, Stabenow, Warner and Webb for their work in \nconnection with these nominations.\n  It is unfortunate that the three nominees for the Western District of \nMichigan are not already on the bench helping to ease the backlog of \ncases in that district. All three were reported out of committee last \nfall, but were left pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar when \nsome on the other side of the aisle blocked their nominations. All \nthree are for vacancies that are judicial emergency vacancies--three \nemergencies in one Federal district.\n  The Senators from Michigan had worked with the White House on the \nPresident's nomination of three nominees to fill those emergency \nvacancies.\n  Working with then-Chairman Specter, the Democratic members of the \ncommittee cooperated to expedite their consideration and reported them \nto the Senate last year.\n  But last year Republicans were objecting to Senate votes on some of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees. According to press accounts, \nSenator Brownback had placed a hold on Judge Neff's nomination, \napparently related to her attendance at a commitment ceremony held by \nsome family friends several years ago in Massachusetts.\n  The Michigan nominations were not returned to the Senate by the \nPresident at the beginning of this year. Instead, their renominations \nwere inexplicably delayed for months.\n  When they were renominated, Senator Brownback sought another hearing \non the nomination of Judge Neff. As chairman, I honored his request. At \nthat second hearing in May, Senator Brownback again questioned Judge \nNeff extensively about her attending the commitment ceremony of a \nfamily friend. I then placed the nomination on our agenda and the \nJudiciary Committee reported it favorably for a second time.\n  It is time to act on the group of Michigan nominations at long last. \nThere is a dire situation in the Western District of Michigan. Judge \nRobert Holmes Bell, Chief Judge of the Western District, wrote to us \nabout the situation in that district, where several judges on senior \nstatus--one over 90 years old--continue to carry heavy caseloads to \nensure that justice is administered in that district. Judge Bell is the \nonly active judge.\n  The four nominations before us will bring this year's judicial \nconfirmations total to 25. It is our first day back after the Fourth of \nJuly recess, and we have already confirmed one and a half times as many \njudges as were confirmed during the entire 1996 session when President \nClinton's nominees were being reviewed by a Republican Senate majority. \nThat was the session in which not a single circuit court nominee was \nconfirmed.\n  We have already confirmed three circuit court judges in the early \nmonths of this session. As I have previously noted, that also puts us \nwell ahead of the pace established by the Republican majority in 1999 \nwhen to this date not a single circuit court nomination had yet been \nconfirmed. This also exceeds the total of 22 judges confirmed in all of \n2005.\n  With these confirmations, the Senate will have confirmed 125 judges \nwhile I have served as Judiciary chairman. During the more than 6 years \nof the Bush Presidency, more circuit court judges, more district court \njudges, and more total judges have been confirmed while I served as \nJudiciary chairman than during the tenures of either of the two \nRepublican chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities.\n  I have listed another four judicial nominations on the agenda for our \nbusiness meeting later this week and will be noticing another hearing \non judicial nominations on July 19. I do not intend to follow the \nRepublican example and pocket filibuster more than 60 of this \nPresident's nominees as they did President Clinton's nominees.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts lists 47 judicial \nvacancies after these nominations are confirmed, yet the President has \nsent us only 22 nominations for these vacancies. Twenty-five of these \nvacancies--over-half have no nominee. Of the 13 vacancies deemed by the \nAdministrative Office to be judicial emergencies, the President has yet \nto send us nominees for 8 of them. That means over half of the judicial \nemergency vacancies are without a nominee.\n  Of the 15 circuit court vacancies, two-thirds are without a nominee. \nIf the President had worked with the Senators from Rhode Island, New \nJersey, Maryland, California, Michigan, and the other States with the \nremaining circuit vacancies, we could be in position to make even more \nprogress.\n  As it is, we have cut the circuit vacancies nearly in half, from 26 \nto 15. Contrast that with the way the Republican-led Senate's lack of \naction on President Clinton's moderate and qualified nominees resulted \nin circuit court vacancies increasing from 17 to 26 and beyond. During \nmost of the Clinton years, the Republican-led Senate engaged in \nstrenuous efforts to keep circuit judgeships vacant in anticipation of \na Republican President. To a great extent they succeeded.\n  The Judiciary Committee has been working hard to make progress on \nthose nominations the President has sent to us. Of course, when he \nsends us well-qualified, consensus nominees with the support of his \nhome-State Senators like those before us today, we can have success.\n  Judge O'Grady is a Magistrate Judge in the U.S. District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Virginia, where he has sat since 2003. \nPreviously, he was a partner in the intellectual property law firm of \nFinnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett, & Dunner, LLP, an assistant U.S. \nattorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, an assistant commonwealth \nattorney for the Commonwealth of Virginia, and a sole practitioner.\n  Judge Neff has been a judge on the Michigan Court of Appeals, \nMichigan's intermediate appeals court, since January 1989.

I congratulate Judge \nO'Grady, Judge Neff, Judge Maloney, Mr. Jonker, and their families, on \ntheir confirmations today.\n\n\n                          Executive Privilege\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have a very serious matter that I will \ndiscuss at this time in my capacity as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. The Presiding Officer is one of the most distinguished \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Today, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Conyers and I received \nanother letter from White House Counsel Fred Fielding responding to \nduly authorized subpoenas with a blanket assertion of executive \nprivilege.\n  I had hoped that the Judiciary Committee subpoenas would be met with \ncompliance, not with confrontation. But instead they have been met, yet \nagain, with Nixonian stonewalling that shows this White House's disdain \nfor\n\n[[Page S8778]]\n\nour system of checks and balances. This is more stonewalling for a \nWhite House that believes it can unilaterally control the other coequal \nbranches of Government. It raises this question: What is the White \nHouse trying to hide by refusing to turn over this evidence?\n  From the outset of this scandal, the President spoke about the firing \nof U.S. attorneys as if it were a matter handled and decided by the \nAttorney General, and something Mr. Gonzales would have to explain to \nCongress and the American people. The President was hands off and arms' \nlength. He had to ask others whether anything was improperly done and \nrelied on a review by White House lawyers for his assertion that \nnothing improper was done.\n  This President and the Attorney General have both from time to time \nexpressed confidence that the Congress would get to the bottom of this \nas if they themselves had no idea what had transpired.\n  Are we now to understand from the White House claims of executive \nprivilege that, contrary to what the President said, these were \ndecisions made by the President? Is he taking responsibility for this \nscandal, for the firing of such well-regarded and well-performing U.S. \nattorneys?\n  When we had the Attorney General testify under oath, he didn't know \nwho added U.S. attorneys to the list of those to be fired, or the \nreasons they were added. Somehow they mysteriously arrived on the \nAttorney General's list. You know, it occurred to me when I flew down \nfrom Vermont today and I was looking in the paper, the latest Harry \nPotter movie is coming out. These mysterious lists sound like something \nwould you see in that movie, not in the White House or the Attorney \nGeneral's Office.\n  Indeed, the bottom line of the sworn testimony from the Attorney \nGeneral, the Deputy Attorney General, the Attorney General's former \nChief of Staff, the White House liaison, and other senior Justice \nDepartment officials was that while the President was not involved in \nthe decisionmaking that led to the unprecedented firings of several \nwell-performing prosecutors, these people were not responsible either. \nSo I ask, who made these decisions? Was it the political operatives at \nthe White House who set out to severely damage the careers of well-\nperforming U.S. attorneys?\n  Even this White House cannot dispute the evidence we have gathered to \ndate showing that White House officials were heavily involved in these \nfirings--not only heavily involved in these firings and in the Justice \nDepartment's responses to inquiries that I made, the distinguished \nPresiding Officer made, and others, Republicans and Democrats alike \nmade, about them.\n  The White House continues to try to have it both ways, but at the end \nof the day it cannot. The White House cannot block Congress from \nobtaining the relevant evidence and credibly assert that nothing \nimproper occurred. They are just saying: Trust us, we did nothing \nwrong.\n  Trust us? With the revelations that come out almost every single day \nof things that tell the American people they should not trust them. \nWhat is the White House hiding? Was the President involved, were his \nearlier statements to the American people therefore misleading and \ninaccurate? Is this an effort by the White House legal team to protect \nthe White House political operatives whose partisan machinations have \nbeen discovered in a new set of White House horrors?\n  Several weeks ago, after Mr. Fielding first conveyed the President's \nblank executive claim--and I have yet to hear directly from the \nPresident--Chairman Conyers and I sent a letter to the White House \nasking for a specific factual basis regarding each document withheld \nand the normal privilege log that would be shown at the time. I asked \nthe White House to provide this information so that it could \nsubstantiate its claim.\n  For months--and I have not done so precipitously but carefully--I \nhave been giving the White House every opportunity to provide \nvoluntarily the information we have sought. For months the only answer \nwe have received is the same unacceptable ``take it or leave it'' \noffer. I have tried to give the White House every opportunity to \nexplain its claims. A serious assertion of privilege--one they honestly \nbelieved in--would include an effort to demonstrate to the committee \nwhich documents and which parts of those documents are covered by any \nprivilege that is asserted and why. But it is apparent this White House \nis contemptuous of the Congress and believes it doesn't have to explain \nitself to anyone--not to the people's Representatives in Congress, but \nworse yet not to the American people.\n  The White House's refusal to provide a listing of those documents on \nwhich it asserts privilege, and a specific factual and legal basis for \nthe assertion of executive privilege claims, raises even more \nquestions. What is the White House so intent on hiding? What is it they \nare so afraid of becoming public that they cannot even identify the \ndocuments or the dates, authors, and recipients? Would we see the early \nand consistent involvement of the White House political operatives in \nwhat should be independent and neutral law enforcement decisions? Would \nwe see early and consistent involvement of White House political \noperatives who are trying to manipulate law enforcement?\n\n  Nor is the White House content with blanket assertions of privilege \nregarding matters in its control. It has now reached outside the White \nHouse to direct the Republican National Committee not to provide \ninformation it has to Congress and has today instructed a former White \nHouse official, Sara Taylor, not to cooperate with the investigation by \ntestifying to the best of her knowledge.\n  Mr. President, let me explain our attempts to procure the e-mails \nthat White House officials sent using Republican National Committee \naccounts. At first, they gave the impression that we would be happy to \ngive you those 60,000 of her e-mails, or 130,000 of Karl Rove's but, of \ncourse, they were all erased, so we cannot give them to you. When I and \nothers suggested that you cannot erase e-mails like that and that they \nare in a backup system somewhere else, they sent somebody who works in \nthe White House Press Secretary's Office out to tell the American \npeople that this is a ridiculous claim and that we now have Senators \npretending to be computer experts. Actually, no, that is an answer any \n12-year-old could have given. What happened? Suddenly, they found, yes, \nthey do have the e-mails. And as we had said, and as any 12-year-old \nwould have said, they weren't erased.\n  Ms. Taylor is scheduled to testify on Wednesday to comply with a \nsubpoena authorized by the committee. It is unfortunate that the White \nHouse is trying to interfere with Ms. Taylor's testimony before the \nSenate, and they are trying to interfere with Congress's responsibility \nto get to the truth behind the unprecedented firings of several U.S. \nattorneys.\n  Let's review the facts. Sometimes it is good to get outside the \nhyperbole of politics and just talk about the facts. There is clear \nevidence that Sara Taylor is one of several White House officials who \nplayed a key role in these firings and the administration's response to \ncover up the reasons behind them when questions first arose. The \nquestion I have is this: Why were they so eager to cover up what they \ndid?\n  There is also clear evidence that Ms. Taylor was part of 66,000 RNC \ne-mails being kept from the public as part of a White House effort to \navoid oversight by ignoring the laws meant to ensure a public record of \nofficial Government business. Basically, they are saying the law \napplies to everybody else, but they are above the law.\n  I am willing to discuss the matter in good faith with the White \nHouse. I have been trying to engage the White House for months in \ndiscussions to come to some sort of accommodation. I hope we can do \nthat. I am reluctant to agree to anything, though, that prevents \nCongress from doing our oversight job effectively. I have been here \nwith six administrations, with Republicans and Democrats alike, and we \nfound ways to work with Congress. Ultimately, even the Nixon \nadministration--the administration that was here before I arrived--\nfound ways.\n  This administration, unlike all those others, wants to obstruct and \nobfuscate. We should not lose sight of the fact that this is a serious \nmatter. This is about improper political influence on our justice \nsystem. It is about the White House manipulating the Justice\n\n[[Page S8779]]\n\nDepartment into its own political arm. It is about manipulating our \njustice system to pursue a partisan political agenda. It is about \npressuring prosecutors to bring cases of voter fraud to try to \ninfluence elections--of sending a partisan operative like Bradley \nSchlozman to Missouri to file charges on the eve of an election, in \ndirect violation of their own Justice Department guidelines.\n  It is about high-ranking officials misleading Congress and misleading \nthe American people about their political manipulation of justice. It \nis about the unprecedented and improper reach of politics into the \nDepartment's professional ranks, such as the admission by the \nDepartment's White House Liaison, Monica Goodling, that she improperly \nscreened career employees for political loyalty and wielded undue \npolitical influence over key law enforcement decisions and policies.\n  It is about political operatives pressuring prosecutors to bring \npartisan cases and seeking retribution against those who refused to \nbend to their political will, such as the example of New Mexico's U.S. \nattorney, David Iglesias, who was fired a few weeks after Karl Rove \ncomplained to the Attorney General about the lack of purported ``voter \nfraud'' enforcement cases in Mr. Iglesias's jurisdiction.\n  Along the way, this subversion of the justice system has included \nlying, misleading, stonewalling, and ignoring the Congress in our \nattempts to find out what happened. We know White House officials are \ninvolved, but it is difficult to get the facts when the White House, \neven as of today, refuses to provide even a single witness or a single \ndocument.\n  This administration has instituted an abusive policy of secrecy aimed \nat protecting themselves from embarrassment and accountability. \nApparently, the President and Vice President think they are above the \nlaw. In America, nobody is above the law, not even George Bush or Dick \nCheney.\n  The President has sought to make the Vice President's former Chief of \nStaff above the law when he granted him a form of amnesty last week. \nThe President chose to override a prosecution, jury trial, conviction, \nand prison sentence and to excuse his lying to Federal investigators \nand a grand jury and his perjury, and to reward his silence by giving \nMr. Libby what commentators have called a ``get out of jail free'' \ncard.\n  The lack of accountability for anyone in the Bush administration has \nreached new heights--or lows. It is not often that the New York Times \nand the Washington Times editorial boards agree, but they did about \nthis President's abrupt commutation of Mr. Libby's 30-month prison term \nfor perjury and obstruction of justice. The Washington Times opined \nthat President Bush's action is ``neither wise nor just,'' and it \ncontinued in its Independence Day editorial by saying:\n\n       Perjury is a serious crime. . . . The integrity of the \n     judicial process depends on fact-finding and truth-telling. A \n     jury found Libby guilty of not only perjury but also \n     obstruction of justice and lying to a grand jury.\n\n  I would add that the widely respected trial judge, who was nominated \nby President Bush and confirmed by the Senate at the time I chaired the \ncommittee in 2001, imposed a reasonable sentence which was actually at \nthe lower end of what the prosecutor recommended, and the DC Circuit \nrefused to stay the sentence pending appeal in accordance with the law.\n  The New York Times in a July 3 editorial entitled ``Soft on Crime'' \ncalled the President's action a ``baldly political act,'' noting that \n``[a]s president, he has repeatedly put himself and those on his team, \nespecially Mr. Cheney, above the law.'' They noted that the President \n``sounded like a man worried about what a former loyalist might say \nwhen actually staring into a prison cell.''\n  That Presidential act sent the message that silence, bad memory, and \nabject loyalty would be rewarded, just as the mass firings of U.S. \nattorneys sent the message that all remaining Federal prosecutors and \nlaw enforcement had better knuckle under to the political agenda of the \nadministration.\n  Untoward White House interference with Federal law enforcement is a \nserious matter. It corrupts Federal law enforcement, threatens our \nelections, and has seriously undercut the American people's confidence \nin the independence and evenhandedness of law enforcement.\n  Despite the attitude of the current administration, our Constitution \ndoes not include the phrase ``executive privilege'' or ``unitary \nexecutive.'' What the U.S. Constitution does provide in the oath of \noffice is that the President has to swear to ``faithfully execute the \nOffice of President of the United States'' and ``preserve, protect and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States.'' His essential duties \nrequire him to ``take care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' I \nhave grave concern with regard to how this administration is fulfilling \nthese sworn and essential duties. The political intrusion into the law \nenforcement functions of the Government through the scheme to fire and \nreplace our U.S. attorneys is a key part of that concern.\n  Congress will continue to pursue the truth behind this matter not \nonly because it is our constitutional responsibility but because it is \nthe right thing to do.\n  I hope the White House stops the stonewalling. I hope they accept my \noffer to negotiate a workable solution to the committee's oversight \nneeds so we can effectively get to the bottom of what was done wrong \nand what has gone wrong.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the existing order is to have \nconsideration of four nominees for the U.S. district court. I urge my \ncolleagues to confirm all of them.\n  The first is Liam O'Grady for the Eastern District of Virginia. I am \npleased to see that there are substantial Pennsylvania connections with \nthese nominees. Liam O'Grady received a bachelor's degree from Franklin \n& Marshall College in Lancaster. I am interested to see his \ndiversification of employment. He was a pension examiner for the United \nMine Workers of America, Welfare and Retirement Fund, as well as other \noutstanding credentials, and was rated unanimously ``well qualified'' \nby the American Bar Association.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the full records of these nominees \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I think it is unnecessary to speak at \nlength about any of these nominees because they all passed unanimously \nfrom the Judiciary Committee, and it would be my expectation, based on \nprior practices, that they would all be confirmed. I would be surprised \nif there were any negative votes at all. It may be even possible to \nabbreviate the proceedings today with some voice votes. That is the \ndecision for the distinguished chairman. We will come to that later.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am sorry, what was the question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I was commenting that all were passed out unanimously by \nthe Judiciary Committee. I said it was my expectation from prior \npractice that they would probably be confirmed unanimously. I would be \nsurprised if we have a dissenting vote among the four. And I said I am \nnot going to speak long. I am putting their records into the Record. I \nsaid it might even be possible to abbreviate the rollcalls. That is the \nchairman's call.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will be very happy to do that. I think \nthere are a lot of people who have stacks of paper since we have been \ngone who would probably be happy to have one or two rollcalls.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am sorry, I didn't understand.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Some may be happy to have one or two rollcall votes and \nget out of here.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In accordance with the practice Chairman Leahy and I \nadopted in the good old days.\n  The second nominee, Janet Neff, in the court of the Western District \nof\n\n[[Page S8780]]\n\nMichigan, was born in Wilkinsburg, PA, is a University of Pittsburgh \ngraduate, and is rated ``majority qualified'' and others rated ``well \nqualified.'' She has an outstanding academic and professional record.\n  The third nominee is Paul Lewis Maloney, again for the Western \nDistrict of Michigan, again a Pennsylvania connection. He received a \nbachelor's degree from Lehigh University. His ABA rating was \nunanimously ``well qualified.''\n  The fourth nominee is Robert James Jonker, again from the Western \nDistrict of Michigan. I am not distressed, but I note no Pennsylvania \nconnection here. But I know the distinguished presiding Senator from \nMichigan will be relieved to have these three nominees confirmed \nbecause there has been a judicial emergency, and on occasion the \nCongressman from the area has been on the Senate floor urging us to \nconfirm these nominees. I think we will get there today.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                              Liam O'Grady\n\n\n   United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia\n\n     Birth\n       September 24, 1950; Newark, New Jersey.\n     Legal Residence\n       Virginia.\n     Education\n       B.A., Franklin & Marshall College, 1973.\n       J.D., George Mason University School of Law, 1977.\n     Employment\n       Pension Examiner, United Mine Workers of America, Welfare & \n     Retirement Fund, 1973-1975.\n       Attorney Advisor and Law Clerk, Administrative Law Judge \n     George Koutras, Departments of Interior and Labor, 1976-1979.\n       Sole Practitioner, Private Practice, 1979-1982.\n       Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney, Office of the Virginia \n     Commonwealth's Attorney, 1982-1986.\n       Assistant U.S. Attorney, Department of Justice, 1986-1992--\n     Chief of the Narcotics Section (four years); Acting Chief of \n     the Criminal Division (one year).\n       Adjunct Professor, George Washington University, Columbia \n     Graduate School for Forensic Sciences, 1986-1994.\n       Partner, Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett, & Dunner, \n     LLP, 1992-2003.\n       U.S. Magistrate Judge, U.S. District Court, Eastern \n     District of Virginia, 2003-Present.\n     Selected Activities\n       Member, Virginia State Bar.\n       Member, American Bar Association.\n       Member, George Mason Inns of Court.\n       Member, American Intellectual Property Law Association.\n       Member, Arlington County Bar Association.\n       Coach, McLean Youth Soccer.\n     ABA Rating\n       Unanimous ``well qualified.''\n\n Liam O'Grady--U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia\n\n       Magistrate Judge Liam O'Grady was initially nominated to be \n     a U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia on \n     August 2, 2006.

Madam President, I wish to make a comment or two on the \nsubject broached by the distinguished chairman of the committee on the \ncurrent issue with the challenge on executive privilege where letters \nwere received today from the White House Counsel indicating that \nexecutive privilege would be asserted. It is my hope that we will yet \nbe able to resolve this controversy because of the importance of \ngetting the information which the Judiciary Committee has sought in its \noversight capacity.\n  We are dealing with a Department of Justice which I think, fairly \nstated, is dysfunctional. We have seen the Attorney General of the \nUnited States come before the Judiciary Committee and say he was not \ninvolved in discussions, not involved in deliberations, and then was \ncontradicted by three of his top deputies, contradicted by documentary \nevidence in the e-mails.\n  I think it is generally conceded that the President of the United \nStates has the authority to remove U.S. attorneys for no reason, just \nas President Clinton did when he took office in 1993, but you cannot \nremove a U.S. attorney for a bad reason.\n  There have been questions raised as to the request for the \nresignation from the U.S. attorney from San Diego, that she perhaps was \nhot on the trail of confederates of former Congressman Duke Cunningham, \nwho is serving 8 years in jail. I do not know whether that is true. We \nhave yet not had an explanation from the Department of Justice as to \nwhy her resignation was requested.\n  Similarly, a cloud has existed over the reasons for the requested \nresignation for the U.S. attorney from New Mexico, with some \nsuggestions that he was asked to resign because he would not bring \nprosecutions for vote fraud when he thought there was no basis, and \nsome of us thought there was a basis. That has not yet been explained, \nand the request for resignations generally has not been explained.\n  The Department of Justice is second only to the Department of Defense \nin importance to the United States. The Department of Justice has the \nresponsibility for investigating terrorism, has the responsibility for \ninvestigating and prosecuting drug dealers in international cartels, \nthe responsibility for investigating and prosecuting organized crime \nand violent crime. Yet it is pretty hard to make a more conclusive \ndescription than to say that the Department of Justice is \ndysfunctional, and the Attorney General insists on\n\n[[Page S8782]]\n\nstaying. I think, as to his own decision, it is a matter for him \npersonally. I am not going to tell him what to do, nor am I going to \nmake a recommendation to the President. Under separation of powers, it \nis the President's call. I don't want the President to tell me how to \nconduct my office in the Senate and I am not going to impede upon his \nexecutive authority, but I do believe that the inquiry which the \nJudiciary Committee is conducting might produce facts, if we get to the \nbottom of things, find out what they are, which would lead us to a new \nAttorney General, which I think is very much in the national interest.\n  So I am hopeful we can yet avoid the confrontation. I think, \ncandidly, there is a lot of posturing on both sides. I don't think it \nis realistic to seek a contempt citation brought against the \nPresident--that is newspaper talk--contempt citation brought against \nanybody in the executive branch, because there are arguments on both \nsides of this issue. I hope we can work it out so that we don't test \nthe good faith of the executive branch in asserting privilege or the \ngood faith of the legislative branch, the House of Representatives \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, in seeking \nfacts as part of our oversight responsibility. I hope we can work it \nout.\n  I said a long while ago I would be prepared to accept the President's \nterms, with only one exception, and that was the importance of having a \ntranscript as to what happens. The President made an offer on national \ntelevision months ago saying he would allow White House personnel to \ncome in and be informally questioned, but he did not want to have them \nunder oath, and I would prefer to see them under oath. But I would give \non that issue, because what they say is subject to a criminal \nprosecution with a 5-year penalty, the same as a perjury conviction for \na false official statement under 18 U.S. Code 1001.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question on \nthat point?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the distinguished Senator accept the offer of the \nPresident, if the rejoinder of the President was if we did it the way \nyou describe--transcript, knowing that the criminal code applies--but \nonce you have done that, there would be no followup? Even if you were \nto find something out during that meeting, there would be no followup; \nthere would be a promise of no subpoenas, there would be no further \nproceedings?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will be pleased to respond to that relevant inquiry. \nSenator Leahy and I have discussed this before. We have discussed just \nabout everything, because we do things on a joint basis--about as pure \nas Ivory Snow, 99.4. We have some disagreements, but we try to work \nthem out on a bipartisan basis because we think it is the right way to \napproach it.\n  The Senator from Vermont has said he thinks we would be barred from a \nfollowup, and I don't know whether that is part of the offer which the \nPresident has made, but we can get it clarified further. I do not think \nwe could make the commitment not to pursue a subpoena at a later time \nif we felt the informal interviews were insufficient. I don't think we \ncan give up our authority in that process, and if we could, I wouldn't \nagree to that because I don't know what the informal interviews are \ngoing to produce and I would want to retain the right to exercise our \nright to subpoena. I would acknowledge at the same time that if we \nexercise our right to a subpoena that the President could exercise \nwhatever rights he has on executive privilege. We would be back to \nsquare one, but at least we would have the advantage of the \nquestioning. I know the questioning of Senator Leahy, a tough \nprosecutor from Burlington, VT. I have been there. And on an informal \nbasis, Senator Leahy can extract quite a lot of information, and \nChairman Conyers has the capacity to extract a lot of information. I \nmight even have a relevant question or two to ask in the course of the \nproceedings.\n  I think we can get a lot of information. I want to have that \ninformation. I want to find out as much as I could before I go to court \non what is going to be a 2-year battle. It is going to outlast the \nPresident's term. It is going to outlast Attorney General Gonzales's \ntenure. I don't think the next President is going to reappoint Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales.\n  Let the record show there is a smile from staff in the back. It was \nintended to be not serious.\n  Then the President doesn't want there to be these witnesses to go \nbefore both committees, and that is all right. I think Chairman Conyers \nand Chairman Leahy, in consultation with their ranking members, can \nwork out a smaller group from the House and Senate, bipartisan, \nbicameral, sufficient to ask the questions. Then I would prefer that it \nbe public. But as long as the transcript is published, I would give \nthat up as well.\n  I think it is so important that we get to the bottom of this \nimportant issue so we can have the Department of Justice function in \nthe interest of the public that I am prepared to make those \nconcessions, but I want a transcript. I would even be willing to give \nup the transcript if I am compelled to. I would take the interviews \nrather than have nothing. It would be at least something. But I would \nsay to the President, the executive branch, that the transcript \nprotects not only the questioners but the persons being questioned so \nthere is no doubt as to what was said. I have been in closed-door \nmeetings and had a number of participants walk out and, in perfectly \ngood faith, have different versions as to what occurred. That happens \nwhen you are in a closed session. That happens when you are in a closed \nmeeting, in perfectly good faith. That is why a transcript would \nprotect Sara Taylor. It would protect Ms. Harriet Miers. It would \nprotect the people who are being questioned.\n\n  It is my hope we can yet work this out. Before taking the floor, I \nasked Senator Leahy if he would be willing to accept--he doesn't want \nto go as far as I do, and I can understand why he would insist on a \ntranscript--I say I would like to have a transcript--but rather than \nhave nothing, I would be willing to go into a closed session and have \nSenator Leahy question, Chairman Leahy question, Chairman Conyers \nquestion, and I question, some others question, to find out what we \ncan. If at the end of that process we feel it is necessary to revert to \nsubpoenas, we cannot, I think--but in any event should not--give up \nthat power that resides with the legislative branch. I don't think we \nhave the authority to give it up, but if we had the authority to give \nit up, I wouldn't want to give it up.\n  But I want to pursue this matter and I want to get the information. \nWhen you talk about a criminal citation, a citation for criminal \ncontempt, you are talking about a very serious matter. I have great \nempathy for the witnesses, Sara Taylor and Harriet Miers, who have been \nsubjected to these subpoenas. If they assert executive privilege, and I \nagree that they are compelled to, I think once they are instructed by \nthe President that the work they did for him is subject to his \nexecutive privilege, as he sees it, I think they have no choice. But \nwhen you bring a criminal contempt citation against Sara Taylor, people \naren't going to understand she is an innocent pawn in the midst of this \nproceeding. If you bring a criminal contempt citation against anybody, \nthere is an inference of some wrongdoing. You don't have a criminal \ncharge customarily unless there is probable cause to believe a crime \nhas been committed. That is when you have a warrant of arrest. That is \nwhen you have an indictment. Of course, a contempt citation is \ndifferent, but if you call it a citation for criminal contempt, that \nhas a tarring effect which is very serious and which is very profound.\n  The U.S. attorney has to bring the charge, and the U.S. attorney has \ndiscretion. It is not an automatic matter that if the Congress refers \nthe issue for a criminal contempt citation, it is mandated. U.S. \nattorneys have discretion as to what they do. They can bring it or not, \ndepending upon their conclusions, upon their allocation of resources. \nAnd they can bring it on what they want to do. I could see how a U.S. \nattorney might not want to spend a whole lot of time on this matter. I \ncan see how the taxpayers of the United States wouldn't like to spend a \nwhole lot of time on this matter. But that is where we are heading if \nthis posturing continues.\n\n[[Page S8783]]\n\n  Most importantly, we will not find out the underlying facts on the \nrequest for the resignations of these U.S. attorneys, and that is \nimportant to do so we can make a final evaluation by the Judiciary \nCommittee as to what our conclusions are on this matter, and it would \nbear heavily on the continued service, the continued activity, by \nAttorney General Gonzales in holding that position.\n  Madam President, I see the distinguished Senator from Kansas on the \nfloor, and we have a short time left until the votes start at 5:30, but \nI yield to Senator Brownback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I wish to address the nomination of Janet Neff, who is \nthe second nominee to come up. I can do so now or wait until after the \nfirst vote. I would defer to my colleague from Pennsylvania, if he \nwants to do it that way, or if there an order established on the vote \nor for debate on the second nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes provided to the Senator \nfrom Kansas after the first vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would be happy to take my time at that point in \ntime, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I think there is going to be real \ninterest on the part of the body in moving to the second vote, but \nthere are 10 minutes for the Senator from Kansas after the first vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would be happy, if I could, Madam President, to take \nthat time now. It won't be the full 10 minutes, but I wish to be able \nto discuss this. This is a matter of some concern. It has been pending \nfor over a year, and I think it is meritorious of the nominee that it \nbe brought forward.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I would ask the Senator from Kansas if \nhe would be willing to take 5 minutes and delay it to that extent.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Let us see if I can cover it, but if I can't, I will \ntake some time before the second vote occurs. This has been pending for \na year's period of time, and it is a significant matter.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I suggest we proceed to regular order \nthen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has time \nremaining, if you choose to yield that to the Senator or yield it back.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Ten minutes. I yield to the Senator from Kansas on the \nunderstanding that will be the time he would have had otherwise, and \nthat we may proceed then to the sequence of votes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is acceptable to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. There are \n9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for \naccommodating me. Also, we wish to accommodate the other Members who \nwill come in and I think will want to vote in a series of votes. I \nthink that is perfectly fine.\n  I wish to address the second nominee who will be up today, Janet T. \nNeff, for the District Court of the Western District of Michigan. The \nPresiding Officer has had an interest in this matter, as well as many \nothers. Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist 78, said this about judges:\n\n       The courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they \n     should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT, the \n     consequence would equally be the substitution of their \n     pleasure to that of the legislative body. The observation, if \n     it proves anything, would prove that there ought to be no \n     judges distinct from that body.\n\n  As we consider judicial nominees, we must consider whether they have \nthe temperament, disposition, and ideology to interpret the law without \nregard to their own personal will. Because I am not convinced Judge \nNeff can do that, I cannot support her nomination.\n  I wish to give the body some background on this matter. On June 28, \n2006, Judge Janet Neff was nominated by President Bush for a seat on \nthe U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. I wish to \npoint out that she was part of an overall package of judges that was \nput forward and that the Michigan Senators were part of this discussion \nof her nomination. I do not know if she would have been the top pick of \nthe President, but this is where we work together in this body, trying \nto get district judges the Senators from that State would support. \nThese were supported by my two distinguished colleagues from Michigan. \nThey were for Judge Neff.\n  In September of 2006, following her hearing before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, I became aware of Judge Neff's participation in a \nsame-sex commitment or marriage ceremony in Massachusetts in 2002. This \nwas reported in the New York Times.\n  This concerned me. I placed a hold on Judge Neff's nomination in \norder to ascertain her role in the ceremony and her position on the \nconstitutional validity of State bans on same-sex marriage. That is the \ncore issue. No. 1, factually, what is it that took place that she \nparticipated in and, No. 2, what is her view of the constitutionality \nof same sex marriages? She would be going on to the Federal bench and \nthis issue is likely to come in front of her.\n  With regard to her involvement in the 2002 Massachusetts commitment \nceremony, Judge Neff first responded to my concerns in a letter. She \ndescribed the context of the ceremony itself but declined to answer \nquestions regarding the legality of traditional marriage laws and \ninitiatives. For that reason, I requested a second hearing with Judge \nNeff, which was held on May 10, 2007. My distinguished colleague from \nVermont, the chairman of the committee, accommodated that hearing, and \nI appreciate that he did. At that hearing, Judge Neff testified she \nattended the commitment ceremony in Massachusetts as a close friend of \none of the women involved. She stated she did not ``lead'' the \nproceeding, as the New York Times reported but, rather, participated as \nthe homilist in the formal ceremony itself. Judge Neff testified that \nwhen she was asked to deliver the homily, she was pleased to do that.\n  I spent much time considering whether her role as a homilist can \nfairly be described as leading the ceremony. It is my belief, whether \nshe led the ceremony, she was an active participant and not a mere \nbystander.\n  I wish to make clear my decision to oppose Judge Neff's nomination is \nnot based merely on her involvement in this ceremony. Rather, her \nparticipation in this ceremony was simply the means I became aware of \nher approach to interpreting same-sex marriage laws, which are likely \nto come in front of her or have a good possibility of coming in front \nof her were she to be placed on the Federal bench.\n  After discussing her role in the ceremony, I asked about her \nunderstanding of the law regarding same-sex marriage. When asked \nwhether she feels the Constitution creates a right to same-sex \nmarriage, Judge Neff said that is a ``continuing legal controversy.''\n  When asked what her understanding is regarding Michigan statutory \ndefense of marriage law, she said, ``I really don't have an \nunderstanding of it.''\n  I would note for the record the State of Michigan passed a \nconstitutional amendment by a vote of the people in 2004, 59 percent to \n41 percent, defining marriage as a union of a man and woman. But prior \nto that, in 1996, prior to this commitment ceremony in 2002, the \nlegislature passed a State law defining marriage as between a man and a \nwoman--clearly the law of Michigan.\n  When asked her understanding regarding the law in Michigan, she said, \n``It's not entirely settled,'' even though the legislature had passed \nthis in 1996 and by 2004 the people of Michigan had passed a definition \nof marriage.\n  These answers of hers give me pause. Michigan's defense of marriage \nlaw, which has been on the books since 1996, says:\n\n       Marriage is inherently a unique relationship between a man \n     and a woman. As a matter of public policy, this State has a \n     special interest in encouraging, supporting and protecting \n     that unique relationship in order to promote, among other \n     goals, the stability and welfare of society and its children. \n     A marriage contracted between individuals of the same sex is \n     invalid in this State.\n\n  In addition to this statute, in 2004, the voters of Michigan passed a \nsimilar constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union of a man \nand a\n\n[[Page S8784]]\n\nwoman. In my opinion, the law of Michigan could not be more settled. \nThe fact that Judge Neff feels the court has to weigh in before this \nissue is settled suggests a misunderstanding of the role of the \njudiciary. The people of Michigan have spoken, similar to those of 27 \nother States. The amendment was a direct statement by the people of \nMichigan. Never is it more important to respect the will of the people \nthan with issues of fundamental family values. Those issues must be \ndecided by the people and not by Federal judges.\n  Because I am not persuaded that Judge Neff will fairly uphold the law \nof the State of Michigan, I cannot support her nomination for a \nlifetime appointment to the bench.\n  This has been a long and arduous journey and I recognize that for \nJudge Neff and I recognize that for the State of Michigan. I appreciate \nher willingness to come in front of us in the confirmation process. But \nI believe one of the most important aspects of my job as a Senator is \nthe consideration of judges for the Federal bench. I take the Senate's \nrole in the judicial nomination process very seriously. Individuals who \nare put in these positions assume lifetime appointments. We have a \nresponsibility to ensure they understand their role and are firmly \nrooted in the principles of law and justice and what they will do in \ninterpreting the law, not writing the law. They must be committed to \nfollowing the letter of the law without imposing their own ideologies.\n\n  Because I am not satisfied that Judge Neff can do this, on a very \nimportant, very controversial issue of our day, I cannot support her \nnomination. I have reached out. I met personally with Judge Neff. I met \nwith the Senators from the State of Michigan. This has been a long \nordeal.\n  It is my considered judgment that she is not well-set on her role as \na judge and more willing to consider her role as an activist in this \nparticular issue.\n  With that, I ask my colleagues and urge my colleagues to consider it \nand consider opposing and voting against Judge Neff's nomination.\n  I thank my colleagues for accommodating me. I urge a ``no'' vote on \nJudge Neff, the second nominee. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, does the Senator from Vermont have any \ntime remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have any further time on \nthis nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that 3 minutes of \nthe time I have reserved between this vote and the next vote be yielded \nto the distinguished senior Senator from Michigan at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam Present, do I have any time remaining? The only \nreason I am asking this is--I think that is a fair request, but I would \nlike to have a minute between the votes when our colleagues are \ngathered here. It seems it would be only fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could ask for a minute at that time, I would have \nno problem for 3 minutes for my colleague from Michigan. I think it is \nfair when our colleagues are present to hear some of this discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe the Presiding Officer would also need some time \nbetween the votes, and I believe that is not impacted by the current \nrequest; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will take it off my time between the votes. But there \nwill be time for both the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator \nfrom Vermont between the votes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is the Senator from Kansas asking for 1 minute?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Between the votes or no?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Between the votes. That is when your time would occur.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, before the Senator from Michigan speaks, \nthe first pending is who?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. O'Grady is the next.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask it be in order to ask for the yeas \nand nays on both the O'Grady and the Neff nominations at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays on those two and only those \ntwo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered on the two nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized for up to 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am pleased the long road to confirmation for three \nnominations for the Federal bench in the Western District of Michigan, \nJanet Neff, Robert Jonker, and Paul Maloney is apparently near the end \nof the road. Senator Stabenow and I worked with the White House on \nthese nominations. Last year they were unanimously reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee and again this year. The confirmation of these \nnominees has been blocked since last November. The sticking point of \nthe Senator who objected was that one of the nominees, Judge Neff, \npersonally attended a same-sex commitment ceremony of a family friend \nwho was a next-door neighbor of hers for 26 years.\n  When Judge Neff was asked to deliver some remarks, Judge Neff felt it \nwas similar to being asked by one of her own daughters to be part of an \nimportant event in her life.\n  The ceremony was entirely private. It took place in Massachusetts, \nwhere Judge Neff has no official capacity. The ceremony had no legal \neffect. Judge Neff took no official role in the ceremony whatsoever.\n  Her qualifications are clear. She currently serves on the Michigan \nCourt of Appeals, where she has served for a significant period of \ntime.\n  Judge Neff graduated with honors from the University of Pittsburgh in \n1967, then graduated from Wayne State University Law School in 1970. \nShe has had a distinguished legal career. After law school, Judge Neff \nserved as an estate and gift tax examiner for the Internal Revenue \nService and then as a research attorney for the Michigan Court of \nappeals, before becoming an assistant city attorney for the city of \nGrand Rapids. Judge Neff has also worked in private practice, served as \na commissioner for the Michigan Supreme Court and then as an assistant \nU.S. attorney. Judge Neff currently serves on the Michigan Court of \nAppeals. She has been granted numerous awards and honors, including the \nOutstanding Member for 2006 of the Women Lawyers Association of \nMichigan.\n  We are fortunate to have the opportunity today to confirm Judge Neff, \nalong with two other qualified nominees, Robert Jonker and Paul \nMaloney.\n  I only hope now that we finally have an opportunity to confirm these \nthree judges, that we will do so and do so overwhelmingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, it is my distinct pleasure to offer my \nsupport--along with my colleague Senator Warner--for the nomination of \nMagistrate Judge Liam O'Grady to be a judge on the U.S. District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  Since graduating from law school, Judge O'Grady's career has been as \nexpansive as it has been distinguished. Judge O'Grady currently serves \nas magistrate judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Virginia, where he has sat since 2003. Prior to taking the bench, \nJudge O'Grady was a partner at the law firm of Finnegan, Henderson, \nFarabow, Garrett, & Dunner, LLP, 1992-2003, an assistant U.S. Attorney \nin the Eastern District of Virginia, 1986-1992, and an assistant \nCommonwealth Attorney for the Commonwealth of Virginia. Judge O'Grady \nbegan his career as a law clerk to an administrative law judge for the \nDepartment of Labor and the Department of the Interior, 1976-1979, and \nwas subsequently a sole practitioner, 1979-1982.\n  Judge O'Grady has spent equal time in Federal and State courts and \nhas spent equal time handling criminal and civil matters. Judge O'Grady \nhas tried more than 100 cases before a jury.\n\n[[Page S8785]]\n\nMoreover, he has authored and published several scholarly articles, and \nhe has devoted countless hours in pro bono work for low-income and \nindigent clients. Judge O'Grady was unanimously rated ``well-\nqualified'' by the American Bar Association.\n  Judge O'Grady is married to Grace McPhearson O'Grady and has four \nchildren. He resides in McLean, VA. Judge O'Grady received a B.A. from \nFranklin & Marshall College, 1973, and a J.D. from George Mason \nUniversity School of Law, 1977.\n  As I have previously noted, the Constitution assigns a pivotal role \nto the Senate in the advice and consent process related to Federal \njudges. These judgeships are lifetime appointments, and Virginians \nexpect me to take very seriously my constitutional duties. In my mind, \nit matters not whether a nominee is a Republican or a Democrat, but \nrather whether the nominee will be respectful of the Constitution, and \nimpartial, balanced, and fair-minded to those appearing before him. \nAfter careful deliberation, including conferring with Senator Warner, I \nbelieve that Judge O'Grady meets these high standards.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to make these remarks about \nJudge O'Grady and for the expeditious way the Senate has moved his \nnomination through the process during the 110th Congress. Again, it is \nwith pride that I join Senator Warner in recommending Judge O'Grady to \neach of my colleagues in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Liam O'Grady, of Virginia, to be U.S. \ndistrict judge for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. \nDorgan), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from South \nDakota (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln), and the \nSenator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Neff, of Michigan, to \nbe United States District Judge for the Western District of Michigan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am about to yield momentarily to the Senator from \nMichigan. I know the Senator from Pennsylvania has assured, as I have, \nthe Senator from Kansas that he will have a minute. Then I will yield \nback whatever time remains so we can go to a rollcall vote on this \nnomination. Neither the Senator from Pennsylvania nor I will ask for \nrollcall votes on the remaining nominations. They would then have a \nvoice vote, assuming this one is confirmed.\n  I yield such time as the Senator from Michigan needs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank Judiciary Chairman Leahy and \nRanking Member Specter for their assistance in moving forward the \nnominations of Judge Paul Maloney and Judge Janet Neff and Robert \nJonker to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan.\n  Judge Paul Maloney has served as a circuit judge on the Berrien \nCounty Trial Court for over 10 years. Judge Maloney also brings a \nwealth of public service experience to the bench, including: working as \na Berrien County prosecutor, a deputy assistant attorney general in the \nDepartment of Justice and as chairman of the Michigan Sentencing \nCommission.\n  Judge Janet Neff has served as a judge on the Court of Appeals for \nthe Third District of Michigan for nearly 20 years. In addition to her \ndistinguished career on the bench, Judge Neff has been an active leader \nin Grand Rapids, including serving as the first woman president of the \nGrand Rapids Bar Association.\n  Robert Jonker has been a partner at Warner, Norcross & Judd in Grand \nRapids for over 12 years. A life-long Michiganian, Robert Jonker is a \ngraduate of Calvin College and the University of Michigan Law School, \nand has served as a law clerk for U.S. District Court Judge Robert \nFeikens in the Eastern District.\n  This situation is critical for my State. Currently, the Western \nDistrict has only one full-time judge hearing cases, and the Judicial \nConference has declared it a judicial emergency. Even when the bench is \nfull, this district presents logistical challenges because it covers \nMichigan cities all the way from Marquette to Benton Harbor--St. Joe.\n  I was deeply disappointed that in the last Congress, the Senate \nfailed to act on these three nominees despite a bipartisan agreement \nbetween myself and Senator Levin and the administration.\n  I am pleased the full Senate will be voting to confirm the three \nnominees, who will all bring distinguished legal careers to the Federal \nbench.\n  This is an important example of how we can work together. I hope the \nadministration sees the value of working together in a bipartisan \nfashion with the Senate to ensure an independent and impartial \njudiciary that is accessible to all.\n  Senator Levin and I have worked closely with the White House. While \nit has taken longer than we would have liked to come to this point, we \nare extremely pleased and grateful to our distinguished chairman, who \nhas worked very hard on our behalf, Senator Leahy, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Specter. Both Senators have worked hard to bring these \nnominees forward. These are three very distinguished people from \nMichigan with tremendous credentials for the bench. They will serve \nably, and I am proud to support them.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against \nJudge Neff going onto the bench for a lifetime appointment. I have met \ndirectly with her. I have been present for two hearings where she has \nspoken on the controversial issue of same-sex marriage, which we all \nagree should be decided by legislative bodies and by the people, not by \nthe courts. She has an\n\n[[Page S8786]]\n\nactivist view on this issue. She participated in a ceremony herself. \nThen, when asked about her view toward same-sex unions, she said she \nconsiders it a continuing legal controversy. Her words: I really don't \nhave an understanding of it, concerning the Michigan law. In Michigan, \nthe State has defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman, both \nby the legislature and the people. She says it is not entirely settled. \nHere is an activist on a core issue, a difficult issue, one I think we \nall believe should be decided by legislative bodies and not by the \ncourts. She would be one who would have a tendency to rule from the \nbench.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against Judge Neff.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Judge Neff was voted out of the committee \nwith strong bipartisan support and was on the agenda to be confirmed \nunder Republican control of the Senate last year when we had the snag \non judges. She has my strong support and the support of the committee. \nI urge that she be confirmed.\n  If nobody else is seeking recognition, I yield back the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is, Will the Senate \nadvise and consent to the nomination of Janet T. Neff, of Michigan, to \nbe United States District Judge for the Western District of Michigan?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, during the last week that we were not here \nduring the Fourth of July recess, there was a lot of misinformation \nfloating around about things that may or may not be happening \nconcerning the war on terrorism. I would like to make some \nclarifications, if I could.\n  I think it is very significant that we understand what is really \ngoing on, not what some of the media tell us is going on. I have found \nthrough my experience--and I say this: I come to the floor with \nprobably having made more trips to the Iraqi AOR, 14 in total, than any \nother Member, so I have been there quite a few times. I have watched \nthe changes as the changes have taken place.\n  Let me share with my colleagues, first of all, a little background. \nThe United States Code defines terrorism as premeditated, politically \nmotivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by \nsubnational groups or clandestine agents. Their goal is to inflict the \nmaximum amount of damage and pain to civilians irrespective of age, \nrace, gender, or religion. It will remain a global threat for the \nforeseeable future. It is global. I think a lot of people don't realize \nhow global this is but, if we just look at the things that have \nhappened recently, including terrorist attacks in Somalia, Kenya, and \nTanzania. We remember in those places the Embassies being blown up. The \nUnited States, France, Morocco, Turkey, Spain, Indonesia, Great \nBritain, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Philippines, Algeria, Yemen, and \nTunisia are just a partial list of some of the places where there have \nbeen terrorist attacks.\n  The National Counterterrorism Center reported approximately 14,000 \nterrorist attacks occurred in various countries during 2006. Over 50 \npercent of the attacks occurred in Iraq or Afghanistan. Reported \nincidents decreased for Europe, Eurasia, South Asia, and the Western \nHemisphere.\n  Now, the following terrorist-related attacks occurred within the past \n30 days outside of Iraq and Afghanistan. The mentality that somehow it \nis all happening in Iraq is false. There were some statements made in \ndeclaring certain areas in Iraq to potentially be the terrorism \ncapital, but we will talk about that in a minute.\n  A car bomb exploded outside of the Somalian Prime Minister's \nresidence killing six people. This is all in the last 30 days. A bomb \nexploded in front of a crowded tea shop in Thailand killing 1 woman and \nwounding 28 others. That was on June 8. An explosion outside the\n\n[[Page S8787]]\n\nAmbassador Hotel in Nairobi, Kenya, killed 1 and injured 37. I might \nadd that was a mere 3 days from the time I was actually staying in that \nhotel. A bomb exploded outside a clothing shop in Istanbul, Turkey, \nwounding 14 people. A car bomb in a Beirut seaside neighborhood killed \n10 people and wounded 11 others. Suicide bombers drove an SUV into the \nGlasgow airport doors, injuring six people. A suicide bomber drove into \na convoy of Spanish tourists, killing nine people and wounding five \nothers. That is just what has been taking place in the last month.\n  In the United States, President Bush organized and energized the \nFederal Government to pass the PATRIOT Act which broke down the walls \nbetween Federal law enforcement and intelligence communities. It \ncreated the Department of Homeland Security, merging 22 different \nGovernment organizations. It created the position of Director of \nNational Intelligence to seamlessly integrate operations of \nintelligence agencies.\n  We have had this problem for a long time. I recall when I was first \nelected, when I came from the House to the Senate, and my predecessor \nwas David Boren, who is now the President of Oklahoma University, and \nthe last thing he told me before I was sworn in was one of the biggest \nproblems we have is in coordinating our intelligence communities so \nthat everybody knows what everybody else is doing. We hadn't really \ndone that until 9/11 came along and we started getting serious about \nit. I am sure President Boren will be very glad to know that this is an \nimportant improvement that has been made. We directed the National \nSecurity Agency to monitor terrorist communications and established a \nprogram to detain and question key terrorist leaders and operatives. I \nknow there is a lot of talk about what is torture and what is not \ntorture. But we do know that HUMINT, human intelligence, is very, very \nimportant. It is something we have to consider, the lives of those who \nwould be lost versus the lives of criminals who are being interrogated.\n  We placed state-of-the-art equipment in major cities in the United \nStates to detect nuclear and radiological weapons and biological \nagents. We placed advanced screening and equipment and Homeland \nSecurity personnel at foreign ports to prescreen cargo headed for the \nUnited States.\n  I think it is very interesting that a lot of people are talking about \nhow much this has cost.\n  Everything I have read costs something. The question is, How many \nlives has it saved? That is something very difficult to ascertain. \nFighting the terrorists is a coalition of more than 90 nations. It is \nnot just the United States, it is the United States and 90 other \nnations--a coalition of nations that has sought to synchronize \ndiplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement, economic, financial, and \nmilitary power to attack terrorism globally. I believe it is working. \nAs the President has recently said, to strike our country, the \nterrorists only have to be right once. To protect our country, we have \nto be right 100 percent of the time. As we learned on 9/11, and many \ntimes in other countries, it only takes one time for them to be \nsuccessful. We know that some of the results are significant.\n  We captured an al-Qaida operative named Ali Saleh al-Marri in the \nUnited States, who we believe was targeting water reservoirs, the New \nYork Stock Exchange, and the U.S. military academies in December 2001. \nThis was the first post-9/11 plot that was thwarted. Al-Marri offered \nhimself as a martyr to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11. \nHe was his No. 1 man. He sent him to the United States after he \nreceived training in poisons at an al-Qaida camp.\n  It is kind of interesting that people say there is no connection \nbetween Iraq and al-Qaida when, in fact, we know now and can release \ninformation on several training camps that were there. Very likely, he \ncould have been trained in that particular camp.\n  The British authorities broke up a plot to blow up passenger \nairplanes flying to America, which could have rivaled 9/11. We know \nthat happened. The plot was foiled in August of 2006. They planned to \nblow up as many as 12 U.S.-bound passenger jets. They planned to use \nliquid explosives hidden in carry-on luggage. U.S.-British authorities \nhad a group under surveillance for many months, and many of the \nsuspects were British citizens of Pakistani origin. They thwarted that. \nThat didn't happen. That could have happened and, very likely, would \nhave except for all these efforts of the United States and other \ncountries.\n  We broke up two other post-9/11 aviation plots--one targeting the \nLibrary Tower in Los Angeles and the other targeting the east coast. An \nal-Qaida leader in Southeast Asia, known as Hambali, recruited Jemaah \nIslamiyah operatives of Asian origin. The plot was derailed early in \n2002 with international cooperation. Library Tower is the tallest \nbuilding west of the Mississippi, 1,018 feet tall. It is among the 25 \ntallest buildings in the world. That didn't happen. That was planned. \nIt could have happened. It was stopped by this combined effort.\n  Four men were indicted in an alleged plot to attack John F. Kennedy \nInternational Airport by blowing up a jet fuel supply. They planned to \nhit the fuel farms and a 40-mile aviation fuel supply pipeline, and \nthey specifically targeted the symbolism of JFK, sought to invoke \nemotional reaction saying, ``It is like killing the man twice.'' That \nis their statement. Suspects were tied to extremist groups in South \nAmerica and the Caribbean, specifically Guyana and Trinidad. One \nsuspect was a former airport cargo worker. They sought massive \ndisruption of the U.S. economy by cutting off this major artery of \ntravel that connects the United States to the rest of the world--over a \nthousand flights a day, half of which are international, 45 million \npassengers and 1.5 million tons of cargo a year.\n  They disrupted a plot by a group of al-Qaida-inspired extremists to \nkill American soldiers at Fort Dix in New Jersey, which was the result \nof a 16-month investigation by the Justice Department and the FBI. \nSuspects had taken an incriminating video to the store to be \ntransferred to DVD. The video showed calls for jihad and radical and \nviolent ranting in Arabic, including images of the men firing assault \nweapons.\n  Terrorists attempted to detonate two car bombs using cell phones in \nLondon's West End. That happened over the last recess we had. It \nheightened public awareness and quick police action prevented \ndetonations of two Mercedes car bombs. This was a concerted effort. We \nand the Brits were in on that. All others on this team worked very well \nand very effectively.\n  Now, in Iraq, we have had success that is critical to our long-term \nfight against terrorism. Osama bin Laden calls the struggle in Iraq a \n``war of destiny.'' Al-Qaida sees victory in Iraq as a religious \nstrategic imperative, a base from which to launch new attacks around \nthe globe.\n  While I am troubled the war has cost us, I believe it is absolutely \nnecessary for us to be able to have this success. I can recall a year \nago standing at this podium in the Senate quoting al-Qaida, saying \nRamadi--that province in Iraq was going to become the terrorist capital \nof Iraq. When I was in Ramadi a matter of days ago, we found that there \nare new groups of people cooperating now that never cooperated before. \nI think some of the people in this body who were talking about \nsurrender resolutions and all that--it got their attention. Maybe that \nperformed a useful function because all of a sudden the people woke up. \nI learned something there too. All these political leaders we hear \nabout, such as Prime Minister Maliki and Defense Minister Jasim and Dr. \nRubiya, and some of the rest--I thought they were the ones who were the \nleaders. I think it is the clerics in the mosques. All of a sudden, \nthey became concerned and, up until that time, we had been monitoring \nall of the procedures and the performances they have had on a weekly \nbasis in the mosques. Eighty-five percent of them have been, up until \nDecember of this last year, anti-American messages. As of April, there \nhaven't been any anti-American messages. That shows that the clerics \nhave gotten involved in this thing. In Tulsa, OK, we have neighborhood \nwatch programs, where people get neighbors to watch and see what is \ngoing on. This is happening throughout Iraq, where they are spraying \norange spray paint around IEDs that haven't\n\n[[Page S8788]]\n\nbeen detonated so our troops could disarm them. Those things have \nhappened. I think the joint security stations have been very successful \nin Baghdad. Instead of our troops going out and coming back into the \ngreen zone at night, they stay and get to know and develop close, \nintimate relationships with the Iraqi security forces and their \nfamilies. That has had a tremendously positive effect.\n  The future will be difficult in the fight against terrorism. It is \nnot a sprint, it is a marathon. We have to remain vigilant, determined, \nand strong. I want our troops to come home as badly as anybody. When \nyou think about the consequences of losing this thing, all it would \ntake for these people who are crying out about their feelings and \nsaying let's get out of Iraq, all it would take is one successful \nterrorist attack similar to those that have been stopped through this \njoint effort. We would have to pay dearly.\n  I hope people will sit back and realize we have access to information \nthe general public doesn't have. Sure, the polls show the majority of \npeople would like to have our troops come back. I would, too, but when \nyou ask the questions and give them the alternatives, they would rather \nwin this war than resign from it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8788-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FAIRNESS DOCTRINE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor, with Senator \nColeman, an amendment to prohibit the reimplementation of the Fairness \nDoctrine.\n  As we may remember, over the past few weeks, the Fairness Doctrine \nhas received a lot of attention. Some Senators spoke about the need to \nreinstitute this doctrine. The Fairness Doctrine is a regulation the \nFederal Communications Commission developed to require FCC-licensed \nbroadcasters to provide contrasting viewpoints on controversial issues. \nHowever, the FCC conducted a review of this regulation in 1985, \nconcluding that ``we no longer believe that the Fairness Doctrine \nserves the public interest.'' In explaining why the FCC reached this \nconclusion, they wrote:\n\n       The interest of the public is fully served by the \n     multiplicity of voices in the marketplace today and that the \n     intrusion by Government into the content of programming \n     unnecessarily restricts the journalistic freedoms of \n     broadcasters.\n\n  The FCC's refusal to enforce the Fairness Doctrine was later upheld \nin the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Why would a regulation that was found to be unnecessary over 20 years \nago be controversial today? Well, we found out why. On June 22, the \nCenter for American Progress issued a report called ``The Structural \nImbalance of Political Talk Radio.'' Keep in mind that the Center for \nAmerican Progress is a liberal think tank funded by George Soros and \nled by John Podesta and a lot of former Clinton White House people in \nit. The report issued was authored, in part, by a former Clinton White \nHouse adviser. This report, not surprisingly, found that 91 percent--I \nbelieve this to be true--of political talk radio programming was \nconservative and 9 percent was progressive or liberal. However, what is \nsurprising is the report suggested antifree market and antifree speech \nrecommendations to supposedly provide balance in talk radio \nprogramming. There is a very controversial statement I made in the \npresence of a couple of our fellow Senators not too long ago when they \nwere talking about the fact that there is so much conservative bias in \ntalk radio. I said it is market driven. That is what America is all \nabout. It is market driven. There is no market for the progressive or \nliberal programming.\n  I remember when the DOD was trying to feed the American Forces Radio \nand television services in the Armed Forces Network and have 50 percent \nof the programming be liberal. We fought that out on the floor of the \nSenate and we won because freedom of speech is more important. \nConsequently, we have gone back and let them decide--our troops--as to \nthe programming they want. It is all done in a fair way so our troops \nat least can hear what they want to hear over talk radio.\n  This is for those people who think they have balanced political talk \nradio. This is a report on that subject. As I go through this, first of \nall, it identifies the problem they consider--conservative bias. That \nis what the American people want. It says:\n\n       If commercial radio broadcasters are unwilling to abide by \n     these regulatory standards or the FCC is unable to \n     effectively regulate in the public interest, a spectrum use \n     fee should be levied on owners to directly support local, \n     regional, and national broadcasting.\n\n  That is this report. In other words, they are saying not only do \nthese people who, because of their popularity, because of the content \nand the way they deliver it--not only would they lose their programs, \nbut they would also have to give money to support public broadcasting. \nThis is the most outrageous thing I have ever seen.\n  I don't think this can happen in America. When you get John Podesta \nand the former Clinton White House team and their minds set to doing \nsomething, they are smart people, and I don't take this lightly. I ask \nas many people as possible to support our efforts to pass legislation \nto stop any effort to reinstitute the Fairness Doctrine. I think we \nshould call it something else, such as the Government-run broadcasting.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nresumes consideration tomorrow of Senator Webb's amendment No. 2012, \nthat the second-degree amendment be withdrawn and there be 4 hours for \ndebate equally divided in the usual form on that amendment, and that at \nthe conclusion or yielding back of that 4 hours, the Senate vote, \nwithout intervening action, on the Webb amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, I say to my good friend \nthe majority leader, this amendment was just laid down a couple hours \nago. The chairman of the committee and the ranking member of the \ncommittee were not even here today. The ranking member will be here \ntomorrow. He has not even had an opportunity to make his opening \nstatement. We wish to offer a side by side, probably to be offered by \nSenator Lindsey Graham, a member of the committee. I was hoping we \nmight be able to enter into a consent agreement that gave us a chance \nfor an alternative, which is frequently the way these things are \nhandled.\n  Bearing that in mind, Mr. President, I am constrained to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend has stated he would object to 4 \nhours, and I assume the same answer would be to 6 hours or 8 hours; is \nthat right, I say to my friend.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend the majority leader, \nyes, at the moment. I am hopeful we can work out an agreement under \nwhich we could have a side by side, which is the way these things are \noften done in the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. I understand that. Mr. President, what I suggest then is \nthis: Senator Levin has been here all day. He didn't give his opening \nstatement because he was occupied doing other business. He is here now. \nHe was here all today in the Senate. I talked with him earlier this \nmorning. What I suggest then is we get an agreement that if, in fact, I \nfile cloture tomorrow, we can have a cloture vote on Wednesday. That \nway we wouldn't do it tonight. We will work with the minority leader. I \nthink there is a strong possibility we could do side by sides. We \nwouldn't lose anything by waiting until tomorrow to see if we can work \nout some agreement.\n  What I am asking is that rather than my filing cloture tonight, \nhopefully I won't have to do it tomorrow, but if I did on this \namendment, rather than waiting until Thursday to vote on it, could I \nhave an agreement from my\n\n[[Page S8789]]\n\nfriend that we would vote on the cloture motion on Wednesday rather \nthan Thursday?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say to my friend the majority \nleader, I think that is fine. Just a suggestion: If we go down that \npath of trying to get cloture on every single amendment, if cloture is \ninvoked, then it would further delay completion of the bill potentially \nby somebody insisting on using postcloture time. We have no desire to \nmake it difficult to get through this bill. We would, however, like to \nhave votes on our amendments.\n  I think the better way to proceed, as the majority leader has \nsuggested, is to see if we can come to agreement on amendments and side \nby sides and move the process along, which sounds to me is what the \nmajority leader is suggesting, and that is fine with me.\n  Mr. REID. That is fine. What we will do, Mr. President, is hopefully \nnot have to file cloture on this amendment. If we do, we will have a \ncloture vote on Wednesday. I feel confident we can work something out. \nWe will certainly do our best on this side. Senator Levin is here. He \nis easy to work with, as is Senator Warner.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the cloture \nvote taking place on Wednesday?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, in January the Senate took an \nimportant step toward improving congressional accountability by passing \nthe Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act as part of S. 1. \nOne of the key provisions of this legislation attempts to shine light \non the process by which Members request the inclusion of specific \nprojects in legislation--in other words, earmarks.\n  That provision includes a requirement that each Senate committee make \npublic all congressional earmarks included in bills reported by the \ncommittee. We normally think of earmarks as part of the appropriations \nprocess, but the requirement in S. 1 applies to all bills and makes it \nclear that the term ``congressional earmark'' includes language \nauthorizing funds, not just appropriations language. The legislation \nincludes a specific requirement to disclose earmarks contained in \nclassified portions of reports ``to the extent practicable, consistent \nwith the need to protect national security.''\n  With that in mind, I rise today to formally describe for the Senate \nthe earmarks included in S. 1538, the Intelligence Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2008, a bill reported by the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence on May 31, 2007. This information was not included \nspecifically in the bill or report because we were wrestling with what, \nif anything, in the bill and classified annex met the definition of an \nearmark. The definition included in S. 1 is subject to some \ninterpretation.\n  Taking an expansive view of the definition, Vice Chairman Bond and I \nidentified three items that seem to fit. I ask to have a list of those \nearmarks printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nCongressional Earmarks Included in the Classified Annex Accompanying S. \n     1538, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008\n\n       A provision adding $200,000 to the office of the Director \n     of National Intelligence for an Intelligence Training Program \n     run by the Kennedy School of Government. This program was \n     started in fiscal year 2007 but the President did not request \n     funding for it for fiscal year 2008. The provision was added \n     at the request of Senator Rockefeller.\n       A provision adding $4,500,000 to the Naval Oceanographic \n     Command. This provision was added at the request of Senator \n     Lott.\n       A provision directing the expenditure of $5,000,000 for a \n     classified effort with the National Reconnaissance Office's \n     GEOINT/SIGINT Integrated Ground Development Engineering and \n     Management Expenditure Center.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On July 1, 2007, while picnicking near Lake Natoma outside Folsom, \nCA, Satendar Singh, a 26-year-old from Fiji, was attacked by a man \nhurling racist and homophobic insults. Singh and his friends, each of \neither Indian or Fijian descent, were harassed repeatedly for several \nhours by a nearby group of Russian-speaking men and women. That \nevening, about six men from that group approached Singh, again \ninsulting Singh and his friends. One of the men struck Singh, causing \nhim to fall to the ground and hit his head. Bleeding profusely, Singh \nwas taken to the hospital. He died 4 days later on July 5, 2007, after \nhis relatives and doctors agreed to take him off of life support. \nAccording to his friends, Singh was not gay, but officials maintain \nthat the attack was motivated by the belief on the part of the \nassailant that he was.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8789-4", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8789-S8791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              H. RES. 121\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President. On June 26, 2007, the Committee on Foreign \nAffairs of the U.S. House of Representatives met to consider and adopt \nH. Res. 121. This resolution was authored by Congressman Michael Honda \nof San Jose, CA.\n  H. Res. 121 expresses the sense of the U.S. House of Representatives \nthat the Government of Japan should formally acknowledge, apologize, \nand accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner \nfor its Imperial Armed Force's coercion of young women into sexual \nslavery, known to the world as ``comfort women,'' during its colonial \nand wartime occupation of Asia and the Pacific Islands from the 1930s \nthrough the duration of World War II.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that during the war period the men in \nthe Imperial Armed Forces of the Government of Japan did abuse, \nassault, and forcibly impose their wills upon women for sexual \npurposes. This was conduct and behavior that cannot in any way be \ncondoned or justified.\n  These events, according to H. Res. 121, occurred during the war \nperiod of the 1930s and 1940s. Records indicate that on August 31, \n1994, as the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II was \napproaching, then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama issued a statement \narticulating Japan's remorse and apology to comfort women.\n  His statement says in part, ``on the issue of wartime `comfort \nwomen,' which seriously stained the honor and dignity of many women, I \nwould like to take this opportunity once again to express my profound \nand sincere remorse and apologies.''\n  This statement was made in his official capacity as Prime Minister of \nJapan.\n  Subsequently, every successive Prime Minister since 1996--Prime \nMinisters Hashimoto, Obuchi, Mori, and Koizumi--have all issued letters \nof apologies to individual former comfort women, who have accepted an \napology letter along with atonement money offered to her by the Asian \nWoman's Fund. It should be noted that some former comfort women refused \nto accept the atonement money.\n  The Asian Women's Fund was established, sanctioned, and approved by \nthe Government of Japan. The letters addressed to former comfort women \nwere issued by the Prime Ministers of Japan in their official capacity, \nand recite, ``as Prime Minister of Japan, I thus extend anew my most \nsincere apologies\n\n[[Page S8790]]\n\nand remorse to all the women who underwent immeasurable and painful \nexperiences and suffered incurable physical and psychological wounds as \ncomfort women.\n  I believe that our country, painfully aware of its moral \nresponsibilities, with feelings of apology and remorse, should face up \nsquarely to its past history and accurately convey it to future \ngenerations.'' Japan's present Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, in a March \n1, 2007, news conference clearly indicated that Japan accepts \nresponsibility and expressly apologized to all its victims.\n  On March 11, 2007, Prime Minister Abe made the following statement:\n\n       I will stand by the Kono Statement. This is our consistent \n     position. Further, we have been apologizing to those who \n     suffered immeasurable pain and incurable psychological wounds \n     as comfort women. Former Prime Ministers, including Prime \n     Ministers Koizumi and Hashimoto have issued letters to the \n     comfort women. I would like to be clear that I carry the same \n     feeling.\n\n  The 1993 Kono statement made by the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei \nKono stated in part:\n\n       The then Japanese military was, directly or indirectly, \n     involved in the establishment and management of the comfort \n     stations and the transfer of comfort women. . . . The \n     Government of Japan would like to take this opportunity once \n     again to extend its sincere apologies and remorse to all \n     those, irrespective of place of origin, who suffered \n     immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological \n     wounds as comfort women.\n\n  During his visit to our Nation's Capitol in April 2007, Prime \nMinister Abe reconfirmed these sentiments in a meeting with bipartisan \nleaders of the House and Senate.\n  Prime Minister Abe also expressed similar statements in a meeting \nwith President Bush. At a joint press conference at Camp David, Abe, \nwhen describing his meeting with congressional leaders, said:\n\n       I, as Prime Minister of Japan, expressed my apologies, and \n     also expressed my apologies for the fact that they [comfort \n     women] were placed in that sort of circumstance.\n\n  In 1995 and 2005, the Japanese House of Representatives considered \nand adopted resolutions related to Japan's actions in World War II, \nincluding the comfort women issue. The 1995 resolution adopted by \nJapan's House of Representatives provides in part:\n\n       Solemnly reflecting upon the many instances of colonial \n     rule and acts of aggression that occurred in modern world \n     history, and recognizing that Japan carried out such acts in \n     the past and inflicted suffering on the people of other \n     countries especially in Asia, the Members of this House \n     hereby express deep remorse.\n\n  The Asian Women's Fund was established in 1995 with the cooperation \nof the Government of Japan and the Japanese people. The fund has \nextended letters of apology and payments, donated by the Japanese \npeople, to 285 former comfort women in the Philippines, the Republic of \nKorea, and Taiwan. Each of the 285 individuals received 2 million yen, \nor $17,000. The fund has also implemented medical and welfare projects.\n  I have taken the time to cite the above because of my concern over \nthe adoption of H. Res. 121, the Honda Resolution.\n  It should be noted that after World War II, the issue of compensation \nfor Japan's wartime crimes was settled, country by country, by the \nTreaty of San Francisco with the U.S. and by the relevant peace \ntreaties with other countries. Thus, from a purely legal standpoint, \nthe issue of the comfort women has been settled by treaties of peace.\n  Several questions come to mind as I read the text of statements made \non this matter, and the text of H. Res. 121. For example, what would be \nrequired of Japan under H. Res. 121 to ``formally acknowledge, \napologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and \nunequivocal manner''?\n  The statements of apology that I quoted earlier were issued by six \nPrime Ministers of Japan, each acting and speaking in his official \ncapacity.\n  I would think that in the world of diplomacy, these words would \nsuffice as official statements.\n  Another matter that should be noted is that these events occurred in \nthe 1930s and 1940s, and the acknowledgment and apology over the abuse \nof the comfort women have been made by successive Prime Ministers since \n1994.\n  I can think of many events in our own historic past that deserve an \nacknowledgement and apology issued by the United States. Nonetheless, \nour Government has not acknowledged these actions and other countries \nhave not officially reprimanded us because of it.\n  For example, soon after December 7, 1941, the United States contacted \nthe Governments of Chile and other South American countries and \nrequested that they round up their residents of Japanese ancestry and \nsend them to the United States to be used by the United States in \nnegotiations for the return of American prisoners of war held by Japan.\n  Many Latin Americans of Japanese descent were arrested, stripped of \ntheir passports or visas, and shipped to the United States. Once in the \nUnited States, they were treated as illegal aliens, subject to \ndeportation and repatriation.\n  The internees' vulnerable position under the law basically left their \nfate in the hands of the State Department and Department of Justice. \nThose caught in this situation were considered repatriable and thus \navailable for use in hostage exchanges with Japan.\n  I am happy to report to you that after many years of concern, the \nSenate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has \nconsidered this matter and reported favorably on a measure to study \nthis matter. However, the bill still faces consideration by the full \nSenate, the House of Representatives, and the White House.\n  And yet has any country suggested we should ``formally acknowledge, \napologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and \nunequivocal manner'' for this matter?\n  Nor have the legislatures of other nations criticized and accused us \nfor Executive Order 9066, which directed the United States Army to \nestablish 10 concentration camps in various parts of the United States \nto intern residents of Japanese ancestry. The majority of them were \nAmerican citizens. As investigations disclosed in later years, their \nincarceration or internment was based only upon race. No crime had been \ncommitted, no act of treason, no act of sabotage.\n  Consequently, four decades later, the Congress finally acknowledged \nand apologized for the actions of the U.S. Government in the Civil \nRights Act of 1988.\n  There exist many other such events in our history that could be \ndiscussed, but these incidents in particular are of interest because \nthey involve the men and women whose ancestry lies in the nation of \nJapan.\n  Regardless of the historical example, the question remains the same: \nhow would the U.S. Government have reacted if the legislature of some \nother nation had condemned our historical actions in World War II?\n  Diplomatic protocol among friendly nations and allies calls for \nconsideration and sensitive handling of such matters.\n  In the case at hand, I respectfully suggest that the Government of \nJapan, through six of its Prime Ministers, and through two acts \nconsidered by its House of Representatives, has issued statements of \nacknowledgement and apology since 1994.\n  I would suggest that so many apologies should suffice.\n  The payment of $17,000 to each survivor may not suffice because no \namount of monetary compensation would be sufficient to clear away such \nmemories just as much as the payment of $20,000 to each internee of \nJapanese ancestry in the United States for years of incarceration by \nthe United States in the concentration camps was not sufficient to wipe \naway that memory either. Nevertheless, payments have been made and \naccepted.\n  As a final matter, it may be interesting to note that a Gallup Poll \nconducted in February and March 2007 sets forth the following: 74 \npercent of the general public, and 91 percent of opinion leaders \nthought of Japan as a dependable ally or friend. 48 percent of the \ngeneral public, and 53 percent of opinion leaders considered Japan to \nbe the most important U.S. partner in the Asia region, followed by \nChina, which scored 34 percent among the general public, and 38 percent \namong opinion leaders. 67 percent of the general public, and 86 percent \nof opinion leaders described U.S. relations with Japan as ``good'' or \n``excellent.'' 87 percent of the general public, and 88 percent of \nopinion leaders supported the maintenance of the Japan-U.S. Security \nTreaty.\n\n[[Page S8791]]\n\n  Finally, when asked whether Japan shared common values with the \nUnited States, 83 percent of the general public, and 94 percent of \nopinion leaders agreed. The only country that received a higher score \nwas the United Kingdom, by only 2 percent for each group.\n  These numbers and responses to the Gallup Poll should suggest our \nrelationship with Japan is excellent. The general public believes it, \nand our Government has said so as well. Why should we involve ourselves \nin a legislative act that would jeopardize a relationship as good as we \nshare with Japan?\n  Is this how we Americans should conduct ourselves with the Japanese, \nour friends and allies?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8791-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING DETECTIVE DAVID RICH\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today with a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude I honor the life of a dedicated State trooper from Indiana. \nDavid Rich, 41 years old, died on July 5, 2007, from a gunshot wound he \nsuffered in the line of duty as an Indiana master trooper detective. \nDavid risked his life every day to serve and protect Hoosiers in order \nto make Indiana a better place.\n  David comes from, and leaves behind, a family devoted to Indiana law \nenforcement. His father, former Miami County Sheriff and retired State \ntrooper Jim Rich, and his mother Linda, instilled in him a sense of \npublic service and respect for the law. Along with his brother, Indiana \nState Police Captain Robert Rich, David followed in his father's \nfootsteps, taking the oath to serve and protect. He is also survived by \nhis sister, Kimberly, and three nieces and one nephew.\n  David was an 18-year veteran of the State police and was well loved \nby his community. Although a great State trooper, he was best known for \nhis devotion and loyalty to his family. He was a loving husband to \nConnie and took enormous pride in raising their 7-year-old daughter, \nLauren, and 4-year-old twins, Carson and Connor.\n  His final act exemplified what kind of person David truly was. While \noff duty, David pulled over to aid a man whom he thought needed help. \nIn a senseless act of violence, David was tragically shot and killed by \nthis man. Even when off duty, David showed his dedication to serve, \nprotect, and help those in need. It is a terrible tragedy that this \nnonsensical act took the precious life of such an honorable man.\n  SGT Tony Slocum, who worked with David, said Indiana ``lost a very, \nvery good man,'' and described him as one of the nicest people he has \never met. David would have done anything to help anyone in need ``as \nhe's done here on many occasions at the post,'' Slocum said. ``He might \ngive you the proverbial shirt off his back.''\n  Today, I join David's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in \nthe example he set, bravely serving to make America a safer place. It \nis his heroism and strength of character that people will remember when \nthey think of David, a memory that will burn brightly during these \ncontinuing days of conflict and grief.\n  When I think about David's profound commitment to protect and the \npain that accompanies the unjust loss of this outstanding trooper, I \nhope that some comfort can be brought to all the loved ones David left \nbehind through the words of Peter 3:14:\n\n       but even if you should suffer for what is right, you are \n     blessed.\n\n  Both David's final altruistic act, as well as his everyday lifestyle, \nepitomized doing ``what is right.'' May God be with all of you who \nmourn this tragic loss, as I know He is with David.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of David Rich in the record of \nthe U.S. Senate for his service to the State of Indiana and the United \nStates of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8791-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8791-S8792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO VERMONT FROST HEAVES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to tell my friends in the Senate \nabout the Vermont Frost Heaves, the bumps in the road that we \nVermonters are actually proud to claim as our own. Unlike the frost \nheaves New Englanders have come to know too well under the dented rims \nof our cars and trucks, these basketball-playing Vermont Frost Heaves \nare pioneers, superb athletes, role models, and as of this spring, \nchampions of the American Basketball Association.\n  The Frost Heaves' motto, ``we're going to be their bumps in the \nroad,'' rang true many a winter's evening this year. With an overall \nrecord of 34-6 and a league record of 30-6, the Frost Heaves quickly \nbecame unfamiliar with losing, energizing Bump the moose, the team's \nmascot, and thousands of cowbell-ringing fans. Then, on March 29, 2007, \nwhile the sap was still running out of sugar bushes, the Frost Heaves \ncharged their way to a triumphant 143-to-95 title victory over the \nTexas Tycoons, adding an exclamation point to the success of their \ninaugural season.\n  From the birth of the Vermont Frost Heaves, founder and owner Alex \nWolff found a way to tie Vermonters into the team, captivating fans \nnear and far and promising to be sustainable, local, built to scale, of \nthe community, and embracing the Internet revolution. As a professional \njournalist found in the pages of Sports Illustrated, Wolff documented \nhis journey growing a championship team with fan participation along \nthe way. The result--a team beloved by Vermont.\n  Under Wolff's ambitious leadership, and with the permission of his \nwife Vanessa, the Wolffs created a family-friendly, affordable source \nof entertainment in central and northern Vermont. With a home schedule \nsplit between two of the most historic gymnasiums in the State, the \nBarre Auditorium and Memorial Auditorium, fans from throughout Vermont \nhad the opportunity to support their team. As the Wolffs explain, ``we \nwanted to create a legacy for Vermont,'' and that is just what they \nhave done.\n  After Wolff put the selection of their coach to a worldwide vote, the \nfans chose coach Will Voigt, a native of Cabot, VT, to be their \nskipper. Voigt, a three-star athlete before embarking upon a successful \ncoaching career, left a coaching position in Norway to return to the \nGreen Mountains.\n  The team starred three Vermonters, Kerry Lyons of Milton, Dana Martin \nof Stowe, and B.J. Robertson of Burlington. Lyons led the Milton High \nSchool Yellow Jackets to four Vermont State final fours. He was named \nConference Player of the Year and was chosen as an All-State selection. \nHe then attended Lyndon State College where he served as the team \ncaptain for 3 years. Lyons returned to Lyndon State after graduation \nserving as the assistant coach for both the men's and women's \nbasketball teams during the 2000 to 2001 season.\n  Dana Martin attended Stowe High School and Proctor Academy in New \nHampshire and continued on to play basketball for Skidmore College. \nMartin was the first basketball player from Skidmore to enter the \nprofessional ranks, playing in Germany after graduation, where he led \nhis team in scoring with more than 22 points a game. Martin has offered \na basketball camp for the past six summers in his hometown of Stowe for \nelementary school students aspiring to follow in Martin's Frost Heave \nfootsteps.\n  B.J. Robertson is a graduate of Burlington High School and St. \nMichael's College, entertaining Vermonters with his pizzazz at both the \nhigh school and college levels. He is the all-time leading scorer at \nBurlington High, a record his brother owned prior to his arrival on the \nscene. Well known by high school sports aficionados, Robertson was \nnamed ``Mr. Basketball'' by the Burlington Free Press his senior year. \nAt St. Michael's, Robertson played in 104 games at the collegiate \nlevel, starting 91 of them in 4 years. He consistently was among the \nleaders on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball for the \nPurple Knights\n  Other Frost Heaves players came by way of New York, New Jersey, \nMaryland, Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, and even as far as Senegal. \nAaron Cook led the Frost Heaves in scoring and minutes played for the \ninaugural season, averaging 16.3 points on 22 minutes. Kelvin Parker \nled the team in field goal percentage. Antonio Burks led the team in \nfree throw percentage, completing nearly 83 percent of shots from the \nfoul line. John Bryant led the team in rebounding, with 246 for the \nseason, also leading the team in blocks.\n\n[[Page S8792]]\n\nTravarus Bennett led the team in steals, his quick hands averaged 2.6 \nper game. Markus Austin, Johann Collins, Kevin Mickens, Antoine Hyman, \nTyrone Levett, Issa Konare, Melvin Creddle, and Tyrone Barley round out \nthe roster of the championship squad.\n  The extended Frost Heaves coaching staff includes assistant coaches \nWayne Lafley and Marvin Safford; strength and conditioning coach Scott \nCaulfield; assistant coach and statistician Mark Saltus; and athletic \ntrainer Meggan Robinson. The Frost Heaves staff worked to establish a \nbalance of physical strength and mental toughness in each player.\n  Today, the sounds of cowbells echoing off the necks of Holsteins \ngrazing in the fields of Vermont instills a bit of excitement in Frost \nHeaves' fans eagerly awaiting another winter of basketball. I hope my \nfriends in the Senate will joining me in congratulating the Vermont \nFrost Heaves for a great season and wishing them even more success next \nwinter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8792-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO RAY KUNTZ\n\n Mr. BAUCUS.

I remember \nattending the Watkins & Shepard driving school, and I can say firsthand \nthat it was top notch.\n  Now, Ray will undertake a new challenge, taking the reins of the \nAmerican Trucking Association as the chairman. Ray is no stranger to \nthe ATA, and he is no stranger to success. As vice-chairman of the ATA, \nRay helped to revolutionize the trucking industry. Combining cutting-\nedge technology and a passion for trucking, Ray helped to launch \nGetTrucking.com. This innovative Web site used humor, timely \ninformation, and eye-grabbing graphics to help recruit new drivers and \nkeep trucking the vanguard of America's transportation industry.\n  As chairman, Ray will continue to use his drive, his creativity, and \nhis passion to lead the ATA boldly into the 21st century. With his \nchairmanship, Ray has made the working folks the hallmark of his term. \nFor those of us who know him, this is no surprise. Ray has always \nremembered his roots and the hard-working men and women he has served \nalong the way.\n  With Ray at the helm, the ATA is on the path to an even more \nsuccessful future as the voice of the men and women who are either \nbehind the wheel, or behind the scenes, of the trucking \nindustry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8792-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               125TH ANNIVERSARY OF GRAFTON, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

On \nJune 21 to 23, the residents of Grafton gathered to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Grafton is a vibrant community in northeastern North Dakota with the \nPark River running through it. Grafton serves as the county seat of \nWalsh County. The post office in Grafton was established with Thomas E. \nCooper serving as postmaster on May 20, 1879. Cooper named the \ncommunity after his wife's home of Grafton County, NH. By 1883, the \ncity had 2,000 residents, with Stewart Cairncross serving as the first \nmayor. Today, Grafton is still one of the larger communities in North \nDakota.\n  Residents of Grafton are proud of their community and what it has to \noffer. Residents strongly support the youth in the community and enjoy \nlocal sports events. Annually, the community hosts a ``Spirit of the \nSeason'' festival, which includes breakfast with Santa, live concerts, \nhorse-drawn wagon rides, and a bonfire in the park.\n  Grafton residents have been dedicated to increasing the size of the \ncommunity through economic development. Since implementing this \nprogram, the community is now home to Marvin Windows and Doors, a \nvibrant business that has helped fund incentives for individuals \nwishing to relocate to Grafton.\n  The community of Grafton celebrated its 125th anniversary with live \nmusic, parades, a demolition derby, and tours of the Heritage Village \nand the school.\n  Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating \nGrafton, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing \nthem well in the future.

On July 13 \nto 15, the residents of Dunseith will gather to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Dunseith is a historic community located in north central North \nDakota, only 14 miles away from the Canadian border. Founded by Giles \nGilbert in 1882, Dunseith was settled by European immigrants and \nmembers of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. In its early years, \npeople were drawn to Dunseith because of the amount of land in the area \nmade available under the Homestead Act.\n  Just a short distance from Dunseith is the International Peace \nGarden. Founded in 1932, this 2,339-acre garden along the northern \nborder symbolizes the peace, cooperation, and friendship between the \nUnited States and Canada. It is a treasure of more than 150,000 \nflowers, fountains, a sunken garden, and other notable structures that \npromote the garden's message of peace.\n  Dunseith really is, as the residents say, an area undiscovered by the \nrest of the country. With the beautiful Turtle Mountains just nearby, \nresidents like to spend time hunting, fishing, hiking, biking, and \nparticipating in various other outdoor activities.\n  Today, Dunseith has much to celebrate. Its quasquicentennial \ncelebration is occurring at the same time as the International Peace \nGarden's 75th anniversary, and it is bound to be a weekend worth taking \nin. With 450 registered participants already, the guests will enjoy an \nall-school reunion, parade, art show, all faith service, demolition \nderby, and much more.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating \nDunseith, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing \nthem well in the future.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th \nanniversary. On July 20 to 22, the residents of Portland will gather to \ncelebrate their community's history and founding.\n  The rural community of Portland is located in the beautiful and \nserene valley of the Goose River. Like so many rural towns in North \nDakota, Portland was established by a railroad. The town was named \nPortland because railroad officials considered it the midway point \nbetween Portland, ME, and Portland, OR. In 1883 it was incorporated as\n\n[[Page S8793]]\n\na village. The Dakota territory's first insurance company was chartered \nin Portland in 1885.\n  Portland has come a long way since its beginnings in the early 1880s. \nThe town has built a rich heritage of agriculture but has also grown to \nincorporate technology, manufacturing, and health services. Portland \nhas been described by its citizens as the way America is supposed to \nbe. The MayPort Community Center offers the chance for recreational \nactivities such as ice skating and hockey.\n  The community of Portland is the ideal location for its residents to \ngrow and prosper together.

Mr. President, today I recognize a community in \nNorth Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. On July 13 \nto 15, the residents of Arthur will gather to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Arthur is a small town in eastern North Dakota with a population of \n402. Despite its small size, Arthur holds an important place in North \nDakota's history. Originally named Rosedale, the settlement was renamed \nArthur in 1881 in honor of Chester Alan Arthur, the 21st President of \nthe United States. The post office was established in 1881, as was the \nlumber yard and the first general store, the Hall-Larson Store. Arthur \nwas incorporated as a village in 1921.\n  Today, the economy of Arthur is largely based on agriculture. The \nArthur Mercantile, the First State Bank, and the Arthur Companies are \nfamily businesses that have been present in the community for over 100 \nyears. This is a remarkable feat for such a small town. The town is \nalso home to the Arthur Center, a notable good samaritan center, which \nwill celebrate its 80th anniversary this summer, and two churches.\n  Arthur's motto ``small town, big heart'' truly captures the essence \nof the town and its residents. The people of Arthur enjoy socializing, \nattending sporting events, and working together for the betterment of \nthe community.

It is places such as Arthur that have \nhelped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this \nfine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Arthur has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8793-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THE LONE STAR FUGITIVE TASK FORCE\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Lone \nStar Fugitive Task Force, LSFTF, for its exemplary service to the \nWestern District of Texas. The LSFTF, which commenced its work in May \nof 2005, is the principal law enforcement agency responsible for \nfugitive enforcement in the Western District of Texas. Sponsored by the \nprestigious U.S. Marshals Service, the LSFTF maintains offices in \nAlpine, Austin, Del Rio, El Paso, Midland, Pecos, San Antonio, and \nWaco. Bringing both local and Federal fugitives to justice, the task \nforce continues to serve the public through its unrelenting hard work.\n  Although the LSFTF has only been in existence for 2 years, it led the \nNation in arrests in 2006 and has been recognized as one of the most \neffective fugitive task forces in the United States. Garnering acclaim \nacross the Nation, the task force has not only protected the citizens \nof the Texas localities in which it is based but has also helped \nconstruct a safer nation as a whole.\n  The Lone Star Fugitive Task Force's perpetual success in capturing \nperilous fugitives stems in part from its innovative officer \ninstruction and groundbreaking education in modern fugitive hunting \ntechniques.\n  Realizing the value of its proximity to the Mexican border, the LSFTF \nfrequently works in tandem with Mexican law enforcement officials in \norder to promote international security. The organization has earned a \nstellar reputation among surrounding districts and across international \nborders for its reliability in dealing with fugitives fleeing across \nnational boundary lines into Mexico.\n  In April 2006, the resolute task force played an instrumental role in \nleading Operation FALCON II, a 7-day collaborative effort between law \nenforcement agencies across the Western United States. The operation \nwas immeasurably successful in apprehending thousands of fugitives, \nincluding hundreds which were being sought out for sexual offenses.\n  In response to its sustained track record of excellence, the Lone \nStar Fugitive Task Force was selected to host, in September 2006, the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children's, NCMEC, national \npilot training program, made possible by the Adam Walsh Child \nProtection and Safety Act passed earlier that year. Under the guidance \nof the LSFTF, the program's agenda focused on the improvement of vital \nskills for U.S. marshals to gain a better understanding of the motives \nand patterns of sexual offenders. Such an ambitious plan has aided the \nU.S. Marshal Service in their success in detaining this dangerous \nvariety of criminal.\n  From its own pioneering methods to its cooperative efforts and rigid \nstyle of law enforcement, the LSFTF has made a positive impact on the \ncommunities it serves and continues to set a shining example for law \nenforcement agencies across the country. By doing so, the organization \nhas, in its own modest way, assisted in ensuring the freedom and well-\nbeing of Americans across the country.\n  For these reasons, among many others, I would like to recognize the \nLone Star Fugitive Task Force for its tremendous success. By bringing \nhazardous fugitives to justice and striving to improve the security of \nthe general public, the LSFTF successfully works for the betterment of \nthe communities and the Nation it humbly serves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8793-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2007, \nthe following enrolled bills, previously signed by the Speaker of the \nHouse, were signed on July 2, 2007, during the adjournment of the \nSenate, by the President pro tempore (Mr. Byrd):\n\n       S. 277.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npreserve access to community cancer care by Medicare beneficiaries; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce the Community Cancer Care Preservation Act, which will ensure \nMedicare beneficiaries' access to community-based cancer treatment and \nprovide Medicare reimbursement assistance for oncologists providing \nvital cancer care services.\n  Cancer takes a great toll on our friends, family and our Nation. In \nthe U.S. cancer causes one out of every four deaths. Although the \nnumber of cancer diagnoses appears to have plateaued, more than 1.4 \nmillion Americans will still find out they have a form of cancer in \n2007, and 560,000 will die, keeping cancer the second-leading cause of \ndeath in the U.S. In 2005, over 2 million new cases of cancer were \ndiagnosed, the most prevalent of which were breast, prostate, lung, and \ncolorectal.\n  While these statistics are daunting, according to the American Cancer \nSociety, the number of Americans who died of cancer in 2006 dropped for \na second straight year. This decrease is the result of earlier \ndetection and diagnosis, more effective and targeted cancer therapies, \nand greater accessibility to quality care provided by oncologists. \nThese vital services have allowed millions of individuals to lead \nhealthy and productive lives after successfully battling cancer.\n  In 2006, 43.2 million individuals were enrolled in Medicare; of those \nbeneficiaries over 29 percent have had cancer during their lives, 12.5 \nmillion beneficiaries. With such a large percentage of our seniors \nfacing this horrible disease, the need for access to community cancer \ncare is critical.\n  Community cancer clinics treat 84 percent of Americans with cancer. \nCommunity cancer centers are free-standing outpatient facilities that \nprovide comprehensive cancer care in a physician's office setting and \nare located in patients' communities. These clinics are especially \ncritical in rural areas where access to larger cancer clinics may not \nbe available. They provide patients with early diagnoses, effective \ncancer therapies, and innovative and supportive care that reduces \nfatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain. The accessibility of treatment in \nthe hands of skilled community oncologists has decreased the cancer \nmortality rate.\n  On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \nModernization Act of 2003, MMA, was signed into law by President Bush. \nThis legislation contained numerous provisions that were beneficial to \nAmerica's seniors and medical facilities; however, it also provided a \nreduction in Medicare's reimbursement for oncology treatment. The \nprovisions sought to bring a balance to the reimbursement for the cost \nof cancer drugs and services. Prior to the implementation of the law, \nthe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, CMS, reimbursed the cost \nof cancer treatment drugs at a very high level. This level provided \nsufficient funding to supplement the costs of care and the storage of \nthe prescription drugs, which were not being provided adequate \nreimbursement. The law enacted reimbursement reductions for the cost of \nprescription drugs while increasing the funding provided for cancer \ncare services; however, that increase did not sufficiently offset \noncologists' losses from the reduction in cancer drug reimbursement.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that Medicare \nreimbursements to oncologists would be reduced by $4.2 billion from \n2004-2013. PricewaterhouseCoopers, an independent auditing firm, \nestimates that reductions will reach $14.7 billion over that time. This \nincreased reduction will have a debilitating effect on oncologists' \nability to provide cancer treatment to Medicare beneficiaries, \nespecially those in the community setting.\n  For 2005, CMS provided an estimated $300 million in Medicare funding \nto community cancer clinics via a demonstration project, in part as \nstop-gap funding for Medicare reimbursement cuts. This funding was \nreduced to $150 million in 2006 and has been eliminated in 2007. These \ndecreases, in addition to other reductions in services payments, have \nresulted in a $200-300 million reduction in reimbursement in 2007. \nHowever, this reimbursement reduction may be larger than estimated. CMS \ndid not factor in the delay in the adjustment of reimbursement rates \nwhen a drug manufacturer increases the price for cancer therapies and \nthe inability of some beneficiaries to pay their Medicare 20 percent \ncoinsurance payment. When accounting for these reductions, the overall \ncut to cancer care will likely exceed $300-400 million.\n  The MMA mandated a transitional increase of 32 percent in service \nfees in 2004, falling to 3 percent in 2005, and 0 percent in 2006. This \nwas done to provide time for CMS to pay for essential unpaid medical \nservices, such as pharmacy facilities and treatment planning. In 2005, \nCMS created a cancer care demonstration project as a quality \nenhancement initiative to examine the effects of oncology drugs on \npatients. This demonstration project also provided $300 million in \ncritical funding because CMS had not increased the reimbursement for \nessential unpaid medical services. On June 29, 2005, I sent a letter \nwith 38 other Senators to President Bush requesting an extension of the \ndemonstration project through 2006. CMS, however, announced a new \noncology demonstration project for 2006 that examines the quality of \ncancer care in relation to treatment guidelines, but at least $150 \nmillion less than the previous funding level.\n\n  Accordingly, I am introducing legislation to provide assistance to \ncommunity oncologists that are disadvantaged by CMS reforms brought \nforth under the MMA. The bill's $1.7 billion cost, over the next 5 \nyears, is a relatively small cost in the face of the vast reductions in \nCMS's reimbursement to oncologists. Let me briefly summarize the \nprovisions of this legislation.\n  1. Sales Price Updates: Currently, CMS updates the prices for cancer \ntreatment drugs quarterly, however there is a 6-month lag from when \nprices increase in the marketplace and when CMS applies that \ninformation to increase reimbursement. For example, a price change in \nthe first quarter will not be reflected until reimbursement in the \nthird quarter. This forces community cancer clinics to often pay \nincreased prices for prescription drugs without increased \nreimbursement. This legislation requires the sales price for oncology \ndrug reimbursement be updated as changes occur in the price to provide \na more accurate reimbursement to oncologists for the cost of drugs \nevery 2 months. This will provide reimbursements to oncologists that \nare fair and reflective of market costs.\n  2. Removal of the Prompt Pay Discount: The prompt pay discount is a \ndiscount from the pharmaceutical manufacturer to the wholesaler, not \nthe community cancer clinic, for prompt payment on prescription drugs. \nHowever, the MMA requires that this prompt pay discount be included in \nthe calculation of average sales price, ASP, which forms the basis for \nthe Medicare drug reimbursement provided, by the manufacturer. This has \nthe impact of lowering ASP, thus artificially lowering drug \nreimbursement to community cancer clinics. My legislation would remove \nthe prompt pay discount from ASP, requiring CMS to reimburse \noncologists at the price they actually pay for drugs without the \ninclusion of discounts.\n  3. Increase in Payments for Chemotherapy Administration: The MMA \nincreased the payment for the first hour\n\n[[Page S8798]]\n\nof chemotherapy administration by 32 percent on a transitional basis in \n2004. The intent of this was to provide an increase in payment for \ncancer care services that were under-reimbursed but subsidized by \noverpayments for cancer drugs under the previous system. While the MMA \nattempted to balance the payment for both drugs and services, including \nincreasing payments to cover the increasing costs of delivering quality \ncancer care, the 32 percent was temporary and expired at the end of \n2004. This legislation re-establishes 2004 levels of reimbursement.\n  Further, cancer patients can receive multiple hours of chemotherapy \nand must be constantly monitored by skilled oncology nurses. Payment \nfor the cost of providing quality cancer care must ensure patient \nsafety during the process of administering often toxic medications, \nwhich can produce life-threatening side effects. To meet this need, \nthis bill also provides an increase in funding for the subsequent hours \nof chemotherapy administration at 70 percent of the first hour payment \nrate.\n  4. Payments for Oncological Drug Storage: CMS reimbursement for \noncology prescription drugs does not provide adequate funding for \nstorage and care needs. The prescription drugs for cancer care often \nrequire refrigeration and specialized handling, as some drugs are \nhighly toxic. These special provisions result in an increased cost, \nwhich is why my legislation provides a 2 percent increase in drug \nreimbursement to account for the storage and care of oncology drugs.\n  5. Oncology Treatment Planning: Oncology treatment planning provides \na personalized treatment program for oncology patients. This \nlegislation creates two payment codes for treatment planning: moderate \nand complex. Radiation oncologists are currently reimbursed for \ntreatment planning; however, medical oncologists, who provide the \ntreatment plan foundation, are not reimbursed for treatment planning.\n  As both chairman and ranking member of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I have sought to \nincrease funding for the National Institutes of Health, and the \nNational Cancer Institute, NCI. Since becoming chairman of the LHHS \nSubcommittee, the funding for NIH has increased from $11.3 billion in \nfiscal year 1996 to $29 billion in 2007, an increase of 157 percent, \nwhile funding for the NCI increased from $2.3 billion in fiscal year \n1996 to $4.8 billion in 2007, an increase of 109 percent.\n  In 1970, President Nixon declared war on cancer. Had that war been \nprosecuted with the same diligence as other wars, my former chief of \nstaff, Carey Lackman, a beautiful young lady of 48, would not have died \nof breast cancer. One of my very best friends, a very distinguished \nFederal judge, Chief Judge Edward R. Becker, would not have died of \nprostate cancer. All of us know people who have been stricken by \ncancer, who have been incapacitated with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, \nwho have been victims of heart disease, or many other maladies.\n  I sustained an episode with Hodgkin's lymphoma cancer 2 years ago. \nThat trauma, that illness, I think, could have been prevented had that \nwar on cancer declared by the President of the United States in 1970 \nbeen prosecuted with sufficient intensity.\n  This legislation provides Medicare reimbursement assistance for \ncommunity oncologists and ensures Medicare beneficiaries' access to \ncommunity-based cancer treatment. I encourage my colleagues to work \nwith Senator Casey and me to move this legislation forward promptly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 1753. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit to employers for the costs of implementing wellness \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, culminating many months of \nconsultation with health experts and business, Senator Gordon Smith and \nI will introduce the Healthy Workforce Act.\n  The aim of this bill is to help American businesses to provide a \nwhole range of opportunities for their employees to live healthier \nlives. The idea is to make it easier for businesses to push more of \ntheir health care investments upstream, helping their employees to get \nhealthy an stay healthy, and to stay out of the hospital.\n  Corporate America traditionally has not been a major player in the \nfield of wellness and disease prevention. But that is rapidly changing \nas you can tell by the presence of these important business leaders, \nhere, this morning. This is extremely encouraging. Because corporate \nAmerica has the expertise, the resources, and the enlightened self-\ninterest to make a huge difference in the way we approach health care \nin this country.\n  So, in introducing this bill, Senator Smith and I are making \nsomething of a business proposition, a proposal for a partnership. We \nbelieve that the Federal Government needs to provide incentives in the \nform of tax credits and, in return, we want corporate America to step \nmore boldly into the field of wellness and disease prevention.\n  Here is what the Healthy Workforce Act would do. It would give a 50-\npercent tax credit to businesses that offer a qualified comprehensive \nwellness program to their employees. For a company to receive the 50-\npercent credit, the employee wellness program must include three of the \nfollowing four components:\n  First, a health awareness and education component, which could \ninclude health risk assessments and screenings.\n  Second, a behavioral change component, for instance: counseling, \nseminars, or self-help materials to help employees to lead healthier \nlifestyles.\n  Third, a supportive environment component. This might include \noffering meaningful incentives to participating employees, for example, \na reduction in health premiums, or allowing employees to exercise \nduring the workday.\n  And fourth, creation of an employee engagement committee, which would \ntailor the wellness program to the needs of the workforce at a \nparticular company.\n  I am pleased that the Healthy Workforce Act already has the support \nof the American Heart Association, the Coalition on Catastrophic and \nChronic Health Care Costs, and a whole range of other public health \ngroups and others in the business community.\n  As I said, employee wellness is a matter of enlightened corporate \nself-interest. Employees who are fit are less likely to call in sick. \nThey have more energy and self-confidence. They are more resistant to \nstress. They have better attitudes. Obviously, corporate America also \nhas a profound interest in keeping down health insurance costs.\n  But businesses can't get this job done alone. It is high time for the \nFederal Government to step up to the plate in a very robust way. And \nthat is exactly what the Healthy Workforce Act is all about.\n  In conclusion, I just want to emphasize, again, that this bill is the \nproduct of a pretty amazing collaboration. There is tremendous \nexpertise and good will in both the business community and in the \npublic health community. Their ideas and input have made this a better \nbill. And I deeply appreciate their assistance. I look forward to \ncontinuing this partnership and working to pass this critically needed \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/09/senate-section/article/S8798-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8798-S8799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 263--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION \n IN STATE OF IOWA V.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Presidential Signing \n     Statements Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 1072. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) While the executive branch has a role in enacting \n     legislation, it is clear that this is a limited role. Article \n     I, section 7 of the Constitution provides that when a bill is \n     presented to the President, he may either sign it or veto it \n     with his objections, and his veto is subject to a \n     congressional override by two-thirds majorities in the House \n     of Representatives and Senate.\n       (2) As the President signs a bill into law, the President \n     sometimes issues a statement elaborating on his views of a \n     bill.\n       (3) This practice began in the early 1800s, and such \n     statements have been issued by Presidents including James \n     Monroe, Andrew Jackson, John Tyler, Franklin Delano \n     Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. \n     Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald \n     Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.\n       (4) Much more recently, some courts have begun using \n     presidential signing statements as a source of authority in \n     the interpretation of Acts of Congress.\n       (5) This judicial use of presidential signing statements is \n     inappropriate, because it in effect gives these statements \n     the force of law. As the Supreme Court itself has explained, \n     Article I, section 7, of the Constitution provides a \n     ``single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, \n     procedure'' for the making of Federal law. I.N.S. v. Chadha, \n     462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983). Presidential signing statements are \n     not passed by both Houses of Congress pursuant to Article I, \n     section 7, so they are not the supreme law of the land. It is \n     inappropriate, therefore, for courts to rely on presidential \n     signing statements as a source of authority in the \n     interpretation of Acts of Congress.\n       (6) The Supreme Court's reliance on presidential signing \n     statements has been sporadic and unpredictable. In some \n     cases, such as Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 719 n.1 \n     (1986), the Supreme Court has relied on presidential signing \n     statements as a source of authority, while in other cases, \n     such as the recent military tribunals case, Hamdan v. \n     Rumsfeld, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (2006), it has conspicuously \n     declined to do so. This inconsistency has the unfortunate \n     effect of rendering the interpretation of Federal law \n     unpredictable.\n       (7) As the Hamdan case demonstrates, the Justices of the \n     Supreme Court appear to disagree with one another on the \n     propriety of reliance on presidential signing statements in \n     the interpretation of Federal law. The Supreme Court, with \n     its nine competing perspectives and its jurisdictional \n     restriction to cases and controversies, may remain unable to \n     resolve this difference of opinion and establish a clear rule \n     abjuring such reliance.\n       (8) Congress has the power to resolve judicial disputes \n     such as this by enacting rules of statutory interpretation. \n     This power flows from Article I, section 8, clause 18, which \n     gives Congress the power ``To make all laws which shall be \n     necessary and proper for carrying into execution the \n     foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this \n     Constitution in the government of the United States, or in \n     any department or officer thereof''. Rules of statutory \n     interpretation are necessary and proper to bring into \n     execution the legislative power.\n       (9) Congress can and should exercise this power over the \n     interpretation of Federal statutes in a systematic and \n     comprehensive manner.\n       (10) Congress hereby exercises this power to forbid \n     judicial reliance on presidential signing statements as a \n     source of authority in the interpretation of Acts of \n     Congress.\n\n     SEC. 1073. DEFINITION.\n\n       As used in this subtitle, the term ``presidential signing \n     statement'' means a statement issued by the President about a \n     bill, in conjunction with signing that bill into law pursuant \n     to Article I, section 7, of the Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 1074. JUDICIAL USE OF PRESIDENTIAL SIGNING STATEMENTS.\n\n       In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, no \n     Federal or State court shall rely on or defer to a \n     presidential signing statement as a source of authority.\n\n     SEC. 1075. CONGRESSIONAL RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN COURT \n                   PROCEEDINGS OR SUBMIT CLARIFYING RESOLUTION.\n\n       (a) Congressional Right to Participate as Amicus Curiae.--\n     In any action, suit, or proceeding in any Federal or State \n     court (including the Supreme Court of the United States), \n     regarding the construction or constitutionality, or both, of \n     any Act of Congress in which a presidential signing statement \n     was issued, the Federal or State Court shall permit the \n     United States Senate, through the Office of Senate Legal \n     Counsel, as authorized in section 701 of the Ethics in \n     Government Act of 1978 (2 U.S.C. 288), or the United States \n     House of Representatives, through the Office of General \n     Counsel for the United States House of Representatives, or \n     both, to participate as an amicus curiae, and to present an \n     oral argument on the question of the Act's construction or \n     constitutionality, or both. Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to confer standing on any party seeking to bring, \n     or jurisdiction on any court with respect to, any civil or \n     criminal action, including suit for court costs, against \n     Congress, either House of Congress, a Member of Congress, a \n     committee or subcommittee of a House of Congress, any office \n     or agency of Congress, or any officer or employee of a House \n     of Congress or any office or agency of Congress.\n       (b) Congressional Right to Submit Clarifying Resolution.--\n     In any suit referenced in subsection (a), the full Congress \n     may pass a concurrent resolution declaring its view of the \n     proper interpretation of the Act of Congress at issue, \n     clarifying Congress's intent or clarifying Congress's \n     findings of fact, or both.

NORWOOD LIVING ORGAN DONATION ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 77, H.R. 710.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 710) to amend the National Organ Transplant \n     Act to provide that criminal penalties do not apply to paired \n     donation of human kidneys, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this bipartisan substitute is nearly \nidentical to S.487, which I introduced along with Senators Bond, \nDorgan, Graham, Durbin, Mikulski, Pryor, Cardin, Isakson, Coleman, \nBrown, and Chambliss, and which passed the Senate on February 15, 2007. \nCompanion legislation was introduced in the House where it was renamed \nin honor of our House colleague, the late Representative Charles \nNorwood, a longtime advocate of organ donation, who sponsored the \nlegislation earlier this year along with Representative Jay Inslee.\n  Our legislation, the Living Kidney Organ Donation Clarification Act, \nwill save lives by increasing the number of kidneys available for \ntransplantation through a process called paired organ donation. It \naddresses this relatively new procedure, which is supported by numerous \nmedical organizations, including the United Network for Organ Sharing, \nthe American Society of Transplant Surgeons, the American Society of \nTransplantation, the National Kidney Foundation and the American \nSociety of Pediatric Nephrology. Paired organ donation, which did not \nexist when the National Organ Transplant Act, NOTA, was enacted more \nthan two decades ago, will make it possible for thousands of people who \nwish to donate a kidney to a spouse, family member or friend, but find \nthat they are medically incompatible, to still become living kidney \ndonors.\n  The legislation is necessary because the National Organ Transplant \nAct, NOTA, which contains a prohibition intended by Congress to \npreclude purchasing organs, is unintentionally impeding the \nfacilitation of matching incompatible pairs. Our legislation would \nsimply add kidney paired donation to the list of other living-related \ndonation exemptions that Congress originally placed in NOTA. It removes \nan unintended impediment to kidney paired donations by clarifying \nambiguous language in section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act, \nNOTA. That section has been interpreted by a number of transplant \ncenters to prohibit such donations. In section 301 of NOTA, Congress \nprohibited the buying and selling of organs. Subsection (a), titled \n``Prohibition of organ purchases,'' says: ``It shall be unlawful for \nany person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any \nhuman organ for valuable consideration. . . .'' This legislation does \nnot remove or alter any current provision of NOTA, but simply adds a \nline to section 301 which states that paired donations do not violate \nit.\n  Congress surely never intended that the living donation arrangements \nthat permit kidney paired donation be impeded by NOTA. Our bill simply \nmakes that clear. Some transplant professionals involved in these and \nother innovative living kidney donation arrangements have proceeded in \nthe reasonable belief that these arrangements do not violate section of \n301 of NOTA, but they contend that they are doing so under a cloud.\n\n[[Page S8880]]\n\n  In the process of kidney paired donor transplants, a pair consisting \nof a kidney transplant candidate and a biologically incompatible living \ndonor is matched with another such pair to enable two transplants that \notherwise would not occur. In other words, the intended recipient of \neach donor is incompatible with the intended donor but compatible with \nthe other donor in the arrangement.\n  No Federal dollars are needed to implement this change. And, for each \npatient who receives a kidney, Medicare will save roughly $220,000 in \ndialysis costs. It is essential that we make the intent of Congress \nexplicit so that transplant centers which have hesitated to implement \nincompatible living kidney donation programs can feel free to do so.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Levin \namendment at the desk be considered and agreed to, the bill, as \namended, be read three times, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed \nin the Record, the above occurring with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.
