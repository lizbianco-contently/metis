Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about an issue \nthat seems to be the most pressing of any we have before us; that is, \nto fund our troops in Iraq.\n  I came to the floor on the 64th day following the President's \nsubmission to the Congress of legislation for funding our troops in the \nfield. I believed it was important that we urge Congress to complete \nits work on this legislation immediately. How could there be anything \nmore pressing than making funding available for our troops? Certainly, \nthe time is now.\n  It is now day 77, and we still don't have a bill to send to the \nPresident. It is time we do so. In fact, the conference committee has \nnot even met. Even though both houses of Congress have passed the \nmeasure, they have yet to come together between the Houses in order to \ndo something. Our military leaders are people in the best position\n\n[[Page S4824]]\n\nto prioritize the needs of our troops. They are the ones who know what \nneeds to be done and what the timing is. They have left no doubt that \nthis funding is urgently needed, without arbitrary deadlines or \nunrelated pork, both of which are in the bill.\n  Unfortunately, there are a number of Members who want to call the \nshots and micromanage the execution of the war. I understand there are \ndifferent views about the war. There are different views about what our \nrole should be. But the fact is, we are there now. We have had a change \nin direction. We have some new ideas, new leadership. But we have the \ntroops there. They need to be supported financially so they cannot only \ndo their job, certainly, but protect themselves. If we don't get this \nfunding to the troops, the first thing to be cut without this \nsupplemental will be facilities maintenance throughout the services, \nparticularly the Army.\n  In addition, counseling programs for both troops and their families \nwill have to be cut back. As to this idea that there is no hurry, that \nwe can find the money somewhere else, Members need to be sure they \nunderstand that finding it somewhere else takes it away from someone \nelse who has earned it, either through service or families of service \npeople. More and more troops and their families are seeking counseling, \nand reducing funding at this critical time certainly needs to be \navoided.\n  Failing to act immediately will have real-life impacts on military \npersonnel. I should think we could come to that understanding. I don't \nknow quite what the timing is seeking to do--apparently, impress on the \nPresident the points of view being made on the other side of the aisle \nor whatever. But he has made it clear what he is going to do. We know \nthat. We know we have to go there and get it vetoed, come back and find \nsomething that is acceptable. All that takes time. All the time we \nspend puts more risk on the military and their families.\n  I believe failing to enact this legislation very soon will have real-\nlife impacts on our military personnel. I can't find much reason for \nthat. If we can't take care of our troops' mental health and see that \nthey aren't living in dilapidated barracks, we will have a hard time \nensuring they are able to fight when the Nation calls. I hope we can \ncontinue to remember what giving these people are doing, what they are \nsacrificing. We need, of course, to support them.\n  It is very simple. If our troops don't have the training to deploy, \nthen our soldiers and sailors overseas cannot come home, and that is \nkind of the situation we are increasingly in now. At this point the \nonly priority should be funding our troops in the field. Even though we \nhave other work to do, certainly if we look at priorities, what could \nbe more important than dealing with the needs of our troops overseas.\n  I don't know if James Baker would have been any clearer when we \nreiterated that the Iraq Study Group report does not set timetables or \ndeadlines for the troop withdrawal.\n  James Baker said:\n\n       The [Iraq Study Group] report does not set timetables or \n     deadlines for the removal of troops, as contemplated by the \n     supplemental spending bill the House and the Senate passed. \n     In fact, the report specifically opposes that approach. As \n     many military and political leaders told us, an arbitrary \n     deadline would allow the enemy to wait us out and strengthen \n     the positions of extremists over moderates.\n\n  Several months ago the President indicated he would establish a new \ndirection in Iraq. General Petraeus is back in Washington today to \nreport on the counterinsurgency plan. Certainly, it isn't doing \neverything we want it to yet. It hasn't achieved success yet. But it is \nmoving in the right direction. We have a change in people. We have a \nchange in leadership. We have a change in the plan. It has only been 3 \nmonths since we installed the general and only 60 percent of the troops \nare in place he had wanted and suggested were necessary. Despite these \nmodest improvements, the other side wants to pack up and admit defeat. \nThey are also claiming the war is lost, and that is unfortunate, \nespecially when our troops hear those comments. In any event, I hope \nthis Congress does what is responsible and sends the President a bill. \nOur troops deserve to know Congress will provide them with the funding \nthey need to succeed.\n  I wanted to talk on that issue. It is one of the most important we \nhave. I look forward to proceeding with what will be before us on the \nfloor now, education. Sharpening up our competitiveness is very \nimportant. I am hopeful we can assure Members that this program with \nthis money and additional spending will have some impact. As we look at \nit, we have lots of programs that are designed to strengthen education, \nyet we don't have a very good measurement of whether those dollars are \ncausing things to happen that we hoped they would.\n  I look forward to that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains in \nmorning business on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/23/senate-section/article/S4824-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4824-S4825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, for the past several weeks, there has been \na lot of debate and discussion about the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill that has been pending now before Congress for more \nthan 2 months. Completion of this emergency supplemental is critical \nfor our troops serving on the front lines and for their families here \nat home.\n  The President has requested, and Congress should be prepared to send \nimmediately to the White House, a clean bill that meets our obligations \nto the troops. This legislation should not be used as a vehicle to pass \nbillions of dollars of unrelated Federal spending or impose artificial \ndeadlines on our commanders in the field. We have to move forward with \nthis important military funding legislation because our troops deserve \nnothing less.\n  I want to highlight a few of the items that are included in this \nsupplemental appropriations bill so our colleagues can appreciate how \nessential it is to get these funds to our troops as soon as possible.\n  This funding will ensure that our forces who are engaged in \noperations overseas have the very best force protection equipment \navailable, as well as the most effective weaponry, communications gear, \nmunitions, and other essential items.\n  For example, high priority items in the supplemental for our forces \nin Iraq and Afghanistan include: funding for body armor and other \npersonal protection items; aircraft survivability components, radios, \nnight vision equipment, armored vehicles, and high mobility, \nmultipurpose vehicle Fragmentation Kits; funding for Improvised \nExplosive Device Defeat Systems, at $2.4 billion.\n  Yes, that Improvised Explosive Device Defeat System is the very type \nof technology we need to protect our troops from the type of weapon \nthat has been more responsible than virtually any other for injuring \nour soldiers.\n  In the supplemental, more than $5 billion in funding is designed for \nthe ongoing surge of U.S. forces to support General Petraeus's revised \nstrategy in Baghdad. Nearly $4 billion in funding is to accelerate the \ntransition of two Army brigade combat teams and establish a new Marine \nCorps regimental combat team. Nearly $2 billion is to increase the size \nof the Army and Marine Corps to build combat capability, and lengthen \nthe time soldiers and marines have between deployments.\n  There is some very important equipment our troops are being denied \nwhile we linger in passing this important supplemental. As I mentioned \na moment ago, IEDs, or improvised explosive devices, continue to strike \nour troops during ambushes, and IEDs are responsible for a substantial \nnumber of the casualties.\n  The Marines and the Army have responded to enemy tactics with the \nacquisition of substantial numbers of up-armored HMMWVs and advanced \narmor kits for other vehicles. But the Army\n\n[[Page S4825]]\n\nand Marines must continue to develop and field a mine-resistant ambush \nprotected, MRAP, combat vehicle fleet capable of sustained operations \non an IED-heavy battlefield.\n  A type of the so-called MRAP is depicted on this chart I have in the \nChamber. I believe this particular one shown here is known as the \nCougar. What is distinctive about this vehicle, which is so important \nto get to our troops, is it represents a change in technology, with a \nV-shaped hull underlying this vehicle, which actually will disperse the \nenergy from an improvised explosive device away from the troops located \ninside the vehicle.\n  I had occasion to visit a manufacturing facility located in Sealy, \nTX, owned by Armor Holdings, which is constructing these very same \nvehicles, which are the subject of some of the funds contained in the \nsupplemental.\n  The President's fiscal year 2007 supplemental request asked for $1.83 \nbillion for mine-resistant ambush protected, or MRAP, vehicles like \nthis one shown in the picture. In addition, Senator Biden offered an \namendment, which passed the Senate 98 to 0, that provided an additional \n$1.5 billion in funding for these critical MRAP vehicles. The total \nMRAP funding in the supplemental is now almost $4 billion.\n  From what I saw in Sealy at the Armor Holdings facility, and from \nwhat I have heard from our troops, this is exactly the kind of \nequipment they need but which is now being delayed as Congress \ncontinues to debate this supplemental appropriations bill.\n  The mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle is an armored combat \nvehicle capable of providing superior protection to our warfighters \nagainst these kinds of IEDs.\n  According to Marine Corps BG John Allen, Deputy Commander of \nCoalition Forces in Anbar Province, in more than 300 attacks since last \nyear, no marines have died while riding in a new fortified MRAP armed \nvehicle. There has been an average of less than one injured marine per \nattack on the vehicles, while attacks on other types of vehicles caused \nmore than two casualties per attack, including deaths, according to \nBrigadier General Allen.\n\n  Our deployed servicemembers in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve this \nlatest class of armored protection to protect them against the ever-\npresent IED threat, and they do not need funding for this important \nvehicle to be held up.\n  Let me close by highlighting the effect of delayed supplemental \nfunding on our military.\n  The Army announced on April 16 that because of the lack of passage of \nthis supplemental, it will materially slow spending to various places. \nIn order to stretch the money it has, the Army will tell commanders to \nslow spending in certain areas so war-related activities and support to \nfamilies can continue. The Department of Defense will also request that \nCongress approve the temporary reprogramming of $1.6 billion from Navy \nand Air Force pay accounts to the Army's operating account.\n  Beginning in mid-April--about this time--the Army has begun to slow \nthe purchase of repair parts and other supplies, relying instead on \nexisting inventory to keep equipment operational. Priority will be \ngiven to repair and refurbishment of immediately needed war-fighting \nequipment, while training and other nonmission critical equipment \nrepair will be deferred.\n  In addition, the purchase of day-to-day supplies with governmental \ncharge cards will be restricted, nonessential travel will be postponed \nor canceled, and shipment of equipment and supplies will be restricted \nor deferred altogether, unless needed immediately for war efforts. The \nArmy has added it will also delay the repair of facilities and \nenvironmental programs unless the work is for safety or health reasons, \nor has effects on family support.\n  These actions carry significant consequences, including substantial \ndisruption to installation functions, decreasing efficiency, and \npotentially further degrading the readiness of nondeployed units.\n  These decisions may actually add to the Army's costs over time. Just \nas importantly, as Army Deputy Budget Director William Campbell said in \nthe New York Times:\n\n       Frankly, what I worry about is that second- or third-order \n     effect that might affect a soldier or a soldier's safety or \n     his ability to do a mission.\n\n  Mr. Campbell said:\n\n       As we put these brakes on, I do worry about the impact that \n     we don't know about, that someone will take some action \n     trying to do the right thing, but it will have a negative \n     impact on the ability of a soldier to do his or her job.\n\n  The New York Times also reported that unless the budget standoff is \nresolved by the end of June, Pentagon officials have warned that units \npreparing to go to Iraq may not have enough money to undertake all of \ntheir required training.\n  It should go without saying, but apparently it needs to be said \nagain, our troops need this funding, and they need it soon. Without it, \nit is simply a fact that our troops will be put at increased risk. We \nhave been ready for weeks to work in good faith to pass a clean \nsupplemental funding bill the President can sign as soon as possible. \nBut every day we do not fund our troops is a day their ability to fight \nthis war is weakened and they are exposed to additional danger.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To strike the NIST working capital fund provision)\n\n       On page 44, beginning with line 16 strike through line 2 on \n     page 45.\n       On page 45, line 3, strike ``(d)'' and insert ``(c)''.\n       On page 47, line 8, strike ``(e)'' and insert ``(d)''.\n       On page 47, line 21, strike ``(f)'' and insert ``(e)''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, at this point I will yield the floor. I \nknow my colleague from Tennessee wishes to speak about a variety of \nissues, and then there is another amendment which we also will be \nsending to the desk for Senator Inouye, who will be here fairly \nshortly, related to provisions that have come from the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we have Senator Inouye here, who has \nplayed a major role in the development of this legislation, and I \nbelieve we will have a little later Senator Stevens, who is right \nbehind me now, and Senator Domenici after that. So I am going to let \nthe two distinguished chairs of the Commerce Committee speak.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, technological innovation is the lifeblood \nof U.S. economic growth and well-being. To achieve growth and success, \nthe United States must continue to support the two critical components \nnecessary during the early stages of the innovation ecosystem: \neducation and basic research.\n  A pipeline of well-educated secondary school students feeds into the \ncollege ranks, which in turn feeds into the graduate schools. Graduate \nstudents engage in challenging and cutting edge\n\n[[Page S4826]]\n\nresearch led by principal investigators that often are funded by \nFederal grants. Many times the students and scientists will make a \nbreakthrough discovery of innovation and attempt to commercialize it. \nIf successful, they will have created the next great generation, great \nAmerican company that sells the next great product, employing thousands \nof people and driving this economy's economic growth further.\n  The United States has the luxury of claiming many of the world's top \nscientific minds. These leading scientists either emigrate to the \nUnited States because we provide some of the best facilities and \nresources or they are home grown, having excelled through the U.S. \neducational system to reach the top echelons of their respective \ndisciplines. However, this premier standing we have enjoyed in the past \nis in serious jeopardy. As a result, many believe our economic \nprosperity is at risk.\n  Today the Senate has a unique opportunity to respond to the Nation's \ndefining economic challenge in the 21st century, and that is how to \nremain strong and competitive in the face of the emerging challenges \nfrom India, China, and the rest of the world. We have examined the \nexpert reports and today the Senate is considering S. 761, the America \nCOMPETES Act.\n  S. 761 is a bipartisan product of several committees including: the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee; the Energy Committee; \nand the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. As chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, which was instrumental in developing Divisions \nA and D of the bill, I encourage my colleagues to support S. 761.\n  Many point out that the United States' declining scientific prowess \nis palpable. They cite, for example, the country's dismal proficiency \nscores: less than one-third of U.S. fourth-graders performed at or \nabove a level deemed ``proficient'' and about one-fifth of eighth-\ngraders lacked the competency to perform basic math computations. U.S. \n15-year-olds ranked 22 out of 28 Organization for Economic Co-Operation \nDevelopment, OECD, countries tested in mathematics. This is a troubling \nstatistic. In math and science education our country is losing ground \nto the likes of Germany, China, and Japan. In the United States, only \n32 percent graduate with college degrees in science and engineering, \nwhile 36 percent of German undergraduates receive degrees in science \nand engineering. In China it is 59 percent, and in Japan, 66 percent of \nundergraduates receive science and engineering degrees.\n  In 2004, China graduated over 600,000 engineers; India, 350,000; and \nthe United States, less than 70,000. These statistics are alarming and \nwill have dire consequences as the U.S. talent pipeline begins to dry \nup. To respond, the America COMPETES Act emphasizes science, education, \nand technology as the keystones of a comprehensive American \ncompetitiveness agenda.\n  We considered programs in several agencies. Within the Department of \nCommerce, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, is \ncharged with promoting U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness \nby advancing measurement science, standards, and technology. The bill \nwould continue NIST on a 10-year doubling path and promote high-risk, \nhigh-reward research within the agency.\n  Also within the Department of Commerce. the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, NOAA, conducts significant basic \natmospheric and oceanographic research, including climate change \nresearch. Its management decisions and operational programs rely on a \nstrong scientific and technical underpinning. Some have argued that the \nocean truly is the last frontier on Earth, and ocean research and \ntechnology may have broad impacts on improving health and understanding \nour environment. Toward this end, our committee included modest \nprovisions on NOAA research and education, which we hope to strengthen \nduring the course of debate on S. 761.\n  The bill also includes the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration in the administration's competitiveness agenda. Like the \noceans, space captivates the minds of our young people and can help \nattract them into a lifelong study of science.\n  America COMPETES continues the Senate's commitment to doubling the \nfunding of the National Science Foundation. The Foundation is the \nNation's premier investment in undirected, basic science. The bulk of \nits funding is distributed as competitive grants. The bill includes \nprovisions to ensure all States, including small States like Hawaii, \ncan share in important research funding. After all, good ideas know no \nboundaries. In order to be strong, we will need the ideas and \nleadership of researchers and entrepreneurs in every corner of the \nNation.\n  I was pleased to work with my colleagues on the HELP Committee to \ndevelop the NSF education provisions. I am proud to have included \nprograms to encourage women to have careers in science, technology, \nmathematics, and engineering.\n  In recent years, we have passed legislation affecting interagency \nresearch in nanotechnology, information technology, computer security, \nclimate change, oceans and human health, earthquake research, wind \nresearch, and aeronautics research. The America COMPETES Act provides \nfor a Science Summit to encourage interactivity and knowledge sharing \nbetween science, scientists, and industry.\n  I would like to end by noting that technology and innovation pervade \nmany policy problems that the Commerce Committee and the Congress face. \nChanges in telecommunications policy are being driven by innovation. In \nparticular, low broadband penetration is cited as a factor in the loss \nof competitiveness in many U.S. regions. Also, our transportation \ninfrastructure would benefit from increased investment and deployment \nof new technologies, such as investment in technologies that can \nincrease energy independence.\n  To succeed in a whole host of arenas, we need scientific discoveries \nand a technologically savvy workforce. If enacted, the America COMPETES \nAct can provide the first step for this country to get back into the \nglobal race. Many countries are looking to overtake us to claim \ntechnological and economic superiority. While we continue to lead, we \ncannot take this lead for granted. I fully support what we are trying \nto accomplish with the America COMPETES Act and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues towards its final passage.\n  Mr. President, working with Senators Stevens, Hutchison, other \ncommittee members, and members of other committees, we have developed a \nsmall package of amendments to the Commerce Committee sections of the \nbill. We took an expansive view of American competitiveness and wanted \nto ensure that the research agencies in our Government and jurisdiction \ncould fully participate in interagency programs to address innovation \nand competitiveness.\n  This amendment is just the provisions regarding the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration, to align them with those addressing the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration. I hope we can agree to \neven stronger provisions to promote ocean education. The oceans, like \nouter space, hold such a lure for young people and can draw them into a \nlifelong study in key fields of science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics. These students may someday invent products that keep our \nNation economically competitive.\n  The amendment also strikes a provision related to the sale of \nstandard reference materials by the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology that could have resulted in a million dollars of direct \nspending. With this amendment, the bill contains no direct spending.\n  The amendment adjusts the authorization levels for the National \nScience Foundation, so that the increase will not fluctuate but will be \na consistent 15 percent annually.\n  As amended, the fiscal year 2008 level for NSF is $300 million over \nthe President's requested level, reflecting the $302 million in new \neducation programs authorized in the bill. In addition, the amendment \nchanges the authorized funding level for NSF's education and human \nresources programs to $1.05 billion in fiscal year 2008, and for the \nexperimental program for competitive research, to $125 million in \nfiscal year 2008. These programs would grow annually from fiscal year \n2009 to fiscal year 2011 at the same rate that NSF overall funding \ngrows.\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\n  Finally, there are a series of technical changes to the bill that, \nfirst, add mathematics and engineering and technology in the Science \nSummit in section 1101; second, change the goal for increasing \nparticipation in two NSF fellowship and traineeship programs to a 4-\nyear goal, matching the pendency of the authorizations in the bill; and \nthird, on behalf of Senator Hutchison, we make a clarifying change to \nsection 4006 regarding NSF priorities.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate all of my colleagues' help in improving \nthe Commerce Committee section and look forward to adopting this modest \nagreement and amendment so that we can begin to debate S. 761 in \nearnest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Alaska speaks \nand while the Senator from Hawaii will be here for a while longer, I \nwanted to call attention to their leadership on this bill and their \nsense of urgency about the importance of it in the Commerce Committee.\n  I wanted to relate specifically an event a year ago, in August, in \nBeijing, China, which I related on the floor when the bill was \nintroduced. I think it puts into perspective why so many Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle have worked on that, why the bill is being \nintroduced by both the Democratic and Republican leaders, and why it \ncame directly to the floor and is ready for action.\n  Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye took a group of Senators to China. \nThey were especially well received--this Congressional Medal of Honor \nwinner and this Flying Tiger pilot who flew the first cargo plane into \nBeijing toward the end of World War II. As a result, we spent an hour \nwith President Hu and another hour with the No. 2 man, Vice Premier Wu. \nWe talked about all of the things one would expect in that discussion: \nNorth Korea, Iran, and Iraq. But the subject, I recall, about which \nboth of those leaders of China were most animated was the subject we \nare discussing on the floor today: How is China going to increase its \nbrainpower advantage so it can create more jobs?\n  President Hu told us that he had done what we are doing today but in \nthe Chinese way. He had, a month earlier, gone to the Great Hall of the \nPeople in China and assembled their national academy of science and \nengineering of China and established a 15-year goal for innovation and \ndeclared they would spend a certain amount in research and investment. \nThat was the way they were going to raise their standard of living to \ncompete with the United States. We see that with the recruitment of \nChinese-born scholars who were educated in the United States and are \ngoing back to China to create even better universities there. We saw, \nunder the sponsorship of these two Senators, that the two top leaders \nof that country understand very well America's brainpower advantage, \nwhich has been the greatest source of this remarkably high standard of \nliving we have, and the fact that we produce 30 percent of all of the \nmoney in the world for just 5 percent of the people. I wanted to \nacknowledge their leadership and put into perspective that visit just \nlast year in China.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I agree wholeheartedly with my friend. We \nshould not take the Chinese goal lightly. They mean business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I strongly support S. 761, which Senator \nInouye just discussed. This is the America COMPETES Act. Fifty-six \nSenators, including members of both parties' leadership and several \ncommittee chairmen, are cosponsors of this important legislation.\n  When it was first brought to my attention last year, I tried to see \nif we could organize a joint committee of the Congress to act on this \nsubject because I believe it is extremely important. Having read the \nAugustine report, I knew we had to move as quickly as possible. That \nwas not possible last year, but I believe it is this year.\n  Many reports have revealed the serious competitive challenges we \nface. In 2003, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment, OECD, compared 15-year-old students living in 40 \nindustrialized nations. For America, the results were very dire. Our \nstudents placed 16th in reading, 23rd in science, and 29th in math.\n  Carl Sagan said it best when he wrote this:\n\n       We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and \n     technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about \n     science and technology.\n\n  Another report I mentioned before, the Augustine report, entitled \n``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' contains the findings of the \nCommission chaired by Norman Augustine, the retired chairman and CEO of \nLockheed Martin. This study also paints an alarming picture of \nAmerica's ability to compete in the 21st century.\n  Economists informed Commission members that ``about half of the U.S. \neconomic growth since World War II has been the result of technological \ninnovation.'' But Commission members also discovered that our young \npeople now spend more time watching television than they do in school \nor studying for school. They determined that hiring one engineer in \nAmerica now carries the same cost as hiring eight engineers in India. \nThey reported that 38 percent of the scientists and engineers with \ndoctorates in our country were born abroad. If those young men and \nwomen choose to live and work in other countries, America will face a \nsevere shortage of talented workers.\n  If we are to maintain our competitive edge, we must improve the \neducation our students receive in science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics. We must equip our teachers with the tools and resources \nthey need, and we must encourage those who study in America to stay in \nAmerica.\n  This legislation we are now considering is a tremendous step forward \nin these efforts. S. 761 seeks to ensure our Nation remains the global \nleader in innovation. It would increase Federal investment in basic \nresearch, improve educational opportunities for young students to \nbecome excited about these fields, and develop an innovation \ninfrastructure appropriate for the 21st century.\n  The America COMPETES Act is the result of bipartisan cooperation \nbetween three committees: Commerce, Energy, and HELP. Since last year, \nthese committees have worked together to address key concerns and \nsolutions identified by the Council on Competitiveness and the National \nAcademies.\n  A number of Senators also deserve recognition for their leadership on \nthis matter: Senators Bingaman, Alexander, Ensign, Hutchison, Domenici, \nInouye, Kennedy, Lieberman, Mikulski, and Nelson. They all deserve our \ndeepest gratitude, and I am sure there are others. Without their hard \nwork and dedication, our bill would not have reached the Senate floor.\n  In closing, let me say that educating the next generation of American \ninnovators must be a priority for this Congress. Our Nation is at the \ncrossroads, and the decisions we make today will affect us for decades \nto come. This bill, when enacted, will reaffirm our commitment to \nAmerica's economic future. I urge each of our colleagues to support its \nswift passage.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to say to the Senator from \nAlaska that if he, who last year was President pro tempore of the \nSenate, and Senator Inouye, one of our leading Senators on the \nDemocratic side, had not from the beginning placed such a priority on \nthis legislation, it could never have made its way through the \ncommittees and reached this point. So I salute them for their \nwillingness to look into our country's future and see the importance of \nthis issue.\n  Mr. President, if the Senator from Hawaii doesn't have further \ncomments at the moment, I might use the time for the next few moments \nto talk about a couple of items. One is how we got here with this \nlegislation and, two, more about what it does.\n  First, let me say on behalf of the leadership, Senators Reid, \nMcConnell, Bingaman, Inouye, and others, we hope that Senators will \nbring their amendments today, or early. Let us see them so that we can \ntalk about them and, if necessary, vote on them.\n  The Democratic leader and the Republican leader have created an \nenvironment in which we can deal with this bill in the way the Senate \nought to be\n\n[[Page S4828]]\n\ndealing with a piece of legislation that is at least on a subject as \nimportant as any other subject that will be before us. In other words, \nthe bill is on the floor. We are ready to receive amendments. We are \nready to vote on amendments, if necessary. I am sure the Democratic \nleader, who will announce his schedule, would like to finish the bill \nby Wednesday sometime because we have other important legislation to \nconsider this week. So I hope we make the most of today, tomorrow, and \nWednesday.\n  Just a word about how the Senate got here. I mentioned earlier that \nin China, President Hu could simply call a meeting in the Great Hall of \nthe People and, with his national academies of science and engineering, \ndeclare that: This is where we are going for the next 15 years. In \nChina, that works pretty well, and that is likely where they are going. \nThey have very specific goals, for example, for the amount of gross \ndomestic product they will be spending on research and development, \nwhat they will be doing with their universities, and how they hope to \nimprove their schools.\n  In the United States, we have to work in a little different way. The \nresult we have here today with this legislation, which is 2,008 pages \nlong--and I know that because I reread it over the weekend. It came in \na different way.\n  Senator Bingaman and I, with the encouragement and sponsorship of \nSenator Domenici, who was chairman of one of the affected committees \nhere, literally asked the National Academy of Sciences this question a \ncouple of years ago: What are the top 10 actions in priority order that \nFederal policymakers could take over the next 10 years to help the \nUnited States keep our advantage in science and technology?\n  We figured that Members of Congress were not necessarily the best \nones to make those recommendations. I am sure the Presiding Officer has \nsome idea of some math or science program he thinks might be best or at \nleast he has two or three friends who have an idea. I know the Senator \nfrom Hawaii has one. I have five or six myself. We thought perhaps we \nshould ask the people who are supposed to know.\n  We asked the National Academy of Sciences, the Academy of \nEngineering, and the Institute of Medicine exactly what should we in \nthe Congress be doing. It is my view most ideas fail around here for \nthe lack of an idea, so we asked them specifically for an idea.\n  The academies took us seriously. They assembled an all-star panel of \nbusiness, Government, and university leaders headed by Norman \nAugustine, as the Senator from Alaska said, the former chairman and CEO \nof Lockheed Martin, a member himself of the National Academy of \nEngineering. That panel included three Nobel Prize winners.\n  Those very busy people, including university president Bob Gates, now \nSecretary of Defense, and the Nobel Prize winners, gave up their \nsummer, and they took our question seriously. Exactly what does the \nUnited States need to do to keep our brain power advantage, is really \nthe question. We asked for 10 and they gave us 20 recommendations.\n  The recommendations are in this report, ``Rising Above the Gathering \nStorm,'' to which the two Senators have referred. To their credit, they \nput it in priority order. I will talk more in a minute about what the \npriorities are.\n  They started with kindergarten through 12th grade, 10,000 teachers, \n10 million minds, K-12 science and math education: ``Sowing the Seeds \nthrough Science and Engineering Research,'' ``Best and Brightest in \nScience and Engineering Higher Education,'' ``Incentives for Innovation \nand the Investment Environment.'' They gave us 20 recommendations in \npriority order.\n  That was not the only idea before the Senate at that time, nor were \nthose of us in the Senate the only ones involved. Representatives \nSherwood Boehlert and Mark Gordon of the House Committee on Science had \njoined us in asking this question. I know Representative Gordon, who is \nnow chairman of the House Science Committee, moved forward quickly to \nintroduce in the House of Representatives similar legislation.\n  What did we do when we got these 20 recommendations? As I mentioned, \nthey were not the only recommendations. Senator Bingaman and Senator \nHutchison, for example, had been working for many years to increase the \nnumber of children, especially low-income children, who could take the \nadvanced placement courses. Those are a ticket to college, and there \nare a lot of bright kids who don't have the money to pay for the tests \nor who go to schools where the teachers are not trained to teach the \ncourses. They have been working on that for a long time. Senator Bond \nfrom Missouri and Senator Mikulski of Maryland have been speaking about \nthis for a long time. Then there was an excellent piece of legislation \nby Senator Lieberman and Senator Ensign which had in it recommendations \nfrom the Council on Competitiveness. Many of those recommendations were \nthen included in the Commerce Committee's hearings and deliberations.\n  So the question is how to take all this information in the Senate \nwhere people have lots of different ideas and get it all together into \none bill and get it passed. Senator Stevens said: Let's form a joint \ncommittee. That is a little harder to do than before. Senator Inouye \nonce served on a joint committee--well, it was a special committee in \nthe Watergate days, but there are not that many around here because we \nhave our own committees.\n  What happened was our senior Members of the Senate, such as Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye, Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy, Senator \nDomenici and Senator Bingaman, just by the force of their own \npersonalities worked together to create an environment with the help of \na lot of staff members to say: Let's take all of these ideas and let's \nwork in a genuinely bipartisan way.\n  We then had a Republican Congress last year. Senator Domenici, who \nwill be here a little later this afternoon, was chairman of the Energy \nCommittee. He went to the White House to talk with the President about \nthis issue. He invited me to go with him, but he didn't just invite me, \nhe invited Senator Bingaman, his ranking Democrat, to go with him. So \nall the way we have worked together on this legislation.\n  Then we sat down shortly after this report came out, which I suppose \nwas in 2005 in the fall, and had a series of what we call homework \nsessions. We invited representatives from the National Science \nFoundation, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of \nEducation, the President's science adviser, and a whole variety of \nother people within the administration who were already working on \nthese subjects to get their advice about these ideas and other ideas as \nwe formed legislation. That is the kind of input this legislation has \nhad.\n  Finally, Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman introduced what we \ncall the PACE Act, Protect America's Competitive Edge Act. \nSymbolically, it had 70 cosponsors in the Senate--34 Republicans and 35 \nDemocrats.\n  So we have gotten to the beginning of 2006. I will say a little bit \nmore in a moment about exactly what was in that legislation, but let me \ncontinue with the process because it is fairly remarkable and helped to \nproduce this legislation which I found in rereading it over the weekend \nis remarkably coherent. It is in plain English. It is organized by \nsections. I could understand virtually every section. I have been \nreading it as we went along. Maybe this is a model for other complex \nlegislation we have in the Senate.\n  The President, in his State of the Union Address in 2006, and again \nthis year, put the issue front and center with what he called his \nAmerican competitiveness agenda. The President included $6 billion in \nhis budget for just the first year. In March of last year, the Energy \nCommittee reported eight provisions related to energy research and math \nand science education for students and teachers in association with the \nNational Labs. So eight provisions of the Augustine report were \nreported out by the Energy Committee.\n\n  Then in May the Commerce Committee reported a bill that included \nideas from the Augustine report, as well as the President's Council on \nCompetitiveness. We had it from two committees.\n  Then the immigration bill passed the Senate. The immigration bill \ndidn't finally become law, but it passed the Senate with pretty big \nnumbers, and\n\n[[Page S4829]]\n\nincluded within it were three provisions that tackled some of the most \narchaic provisions in our immigration laws, those provisions which \nbasically prevent our insourcing of brain power.\n  We have more than 500,000 foreign students who come here every year \nto study. They include some of the brightest people in the world, and \nwe make them swear before they come that they will go home when, in \nfact, we should want most of them to stay here and create jobs for us \nso we can keep our standard of living.\n  So three provisions from the Augustine report were in that \nimmigration bill that passed the Senate last year, and it is my hope \nthat when the Senate takes up immigration legislation before Memorial \nDay, which the majority leader has said we are likely to do, that \nlegislation will, again, have the provisions from the Augustine report \nand other recommendations that will make it easier to attract and keep \nin our country the brightest men and women from around the world. If \nthey are going to create good jobs somewhere, let's create them in the \nUnited States for Americans to have.\n  The Defense authorization bill included a provision related to \nsupport for early career researchers funded by the Pentagon. There are \nso many good applications from so many talented people in the United \nStates for basic research or even applied research that the \ninvestigators, as they are called, are sometimes in their forties \nbefore they win their first grant. That is discouraging to many of the \nbrightest young minds in the United States. These recommendations have \nsought to include changes, and the Defense authorization bill last year \ntook a step in that direction.\n  One of the major recommendations of both of the reports I just \nmentioned was making permanent the research and development tax credit \nso that our brightest manufacturing jobs can stay here rather than be \ncreated overseas.\n  In the so-called tax extender last year, the tax credit was \ntemporarily extended, and so that was dealt with last year. Last year, \njust before Senators went home for the elections in October, the two \nleaders, Senator Frist then the majority leader, and Senator Reid then \nthe Democratic leader, introduced a package--it was numbered S. 3936--\nthat included the work of the Energy and Commerce Committees and added \nan education component to improve our children's knowledge of math, \nscience, and critical foreign languages.\n  That bipartisan product was the work of the chairman and ranking \nmembers of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the \nCommerce and Energy Committees.\n  We tried to be good stewards of the public money as we went through \nthis process. That working group last year trimmed $3 billion from what \nthe committees passed in order to make it more affordable. We did our \nbest to stay close to the President's budget number, although we \nslightly exceeded that number.\n  This year, to bring us to where we are today, the majority leader, \nSenator Reid, and Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, took that \nbill, the one introduced last year by Senator Frist and Senator Reid, \nand reintroduced it by removing authorizations for 2007 since we have \nalready finished work on 2007 and are looking ahead to 2008. That is \nthe bill we are considering today, the America COMPETES Act.\n  That is a long train ride. To those who may be outside the Senate, \nthey may think that is unnecessarily complex. We didn't really need to \nknow all that. I think it is important for the American people to know \nall that. It is especially important for Senators and their staffs to \nknow all that because virtually every Member of the Senate has had 2 \nyears to get their say. I know on the Commerce Committee there have \nbeen long meetings of members of both sides. I know that is true with \nthe staff meetings. Not all would write every provision of the bill the \nway it is, but that is the nature of work in the Senate. It is a very \ngood piece of legislation. It may be improved on the Senate floor by \namendment, but it has been a long and good process.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator Alexander, \nfor his broad and very intricate history of the bipartisanship. If all \nof us in this body followed this process on all major legislation, this \nwould be a historic session, and I hope it is so. This will be one of \nthe first I can look back to and say we tried and we succeeded. And I \nthink we are going to succeed. I thank the Senator from Tennessee very \nmuch.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. His example with \nSenator Stevens is a good example for all of us. I hope he is right. \nThe American people know we all have our principles, and we have our \npolitics. They know that. But I believe they also know there are some \nissues that are simply too big for one party to solve, whether it is \nIraq, whether it is immigration, whether it is energy independence, \nwhether it is affordable health care. And one of those issues is how do \nwe keep our brain power advantage so we can keep our jobs from going \noverseas to India and China.\n  It will take a comprehensive approach. We take for granted sometimes \nthat we produce 30 percent of all the money in the world for 5 percent \nof the people. That is one of my favorite statistics. If I were a \ncitizen of China or of India and I was looking at the United States and \nI saw that disproportionately our wealth comes from our brain power, I \nwould be encouraged because many of the brightest people in the world \nare in China and in India, wonderful researchers, wonderful scientists. \nThere is no reason in the world that they cannot use that great \nresource they have to improve their standard of living, and they are \nsetting about to do it.\n  If the Senator from Hawaii has no objection, I thought I might talk a \nlittle about what is in the bill, just to go over it.\n  As I said, for those who like to read whole bills, it is 208 pages, \nbut any contractor will tell you that it is cheaper to start from \nscratch in building a house sometimes than remodeling it. I think we \nmay have found something here working together in a bipartisan way. In \nstarting from scratch, we actually may have produced a better organized \nbill, more straightforward than trying to remodel a lot of existing \nlaws. But here is what we sought to do.\n  Based upon these recommendations, this legislation doubles funding \nfor the National Science Foundation over 5 years. Now, this is the work \nof Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens and their committee. This is \nmerely an authorization bill--it doesn't appropriate a penny, but it \nhas to be within the budget. Senator Bingaman offered an amendment, \nwhich I joined in with during our budget discussion, and it created \nroom in the budget, nearly $1 billion of room in the budget, for the \nfirst year appropriations of the America COMPETES Act. So these dollars \nare within the budget, and I will talk a little more about the dollars \na little later.\n  I might say one thing about the dollars. The dollars are an \nadditional $16 billion in spending over the next 4 years. That is real \nmoney. But we might remember on what else we spend money. That is about \n2 months of the war in Iraq. We spend about $8 billion a month on the \nwar in Iraq. We spent $237 billion on debt last year, $378 billion on \nMedicare, $545 on Social Security, and $100 billion or so on \nhurricanes. These are all very important priorities, but somehow we \nhave to put gas in the engine, and the gas in the engine is our brain \npower advantage.\n  We have to invest in research, education--K-12--in order to keep the \nadvantage that creates the dollars that pay these bills for our most \nimportant programs. But we have worked hard. We have worked hard to \nhave fiscal discipline. The $16 billion over the next 4 years that this \nbill would authorize to spend, and which is within the budget for this \nyear, is a significant savings over the original legislation last year. \nMore than $3 billion over the 4 years in authorized funding has been \ncut from last year's competitiveness bills passed by the Energy and \nCommerce Committees.\n  We also worked hard to avoid duplicative undergraduate scholarship \nprograms that were proposed in earlier legislation, and it reduced the \ncost of a number of other proposed and existing programs. For example, \nthe Robert Noyse scholarship program of the National Science Foundation \nwas very\n\n[[Page S4830]]\n\nsimilar to a recommendation of the Augustine report. So after \ndiscussions with the National Science Foundation in our homework \nsessions, we thought, well, why create a new duplicative program when \nwe already have a good one. So we simply sought to expand it.\n  With regard to the education and energy portions of the bill, the \ntotal cost closely tracks the President's proposed American Competitive \nInitiative. Remember, he put in $6 billion in his budget last year. The \nPresident has proposed over 10 years doubling research funding at the \nNational Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science. The cost \nof the commerce portion of this legislation is a bit higher, but that \nis because Chairman Inouye and Cochairman Stevens agreed last year that \nthey wanted to double the National Science Foundation's funding at a \nfaster rate, of about 5 years rather than 10. So I would argue that \nthis is progrowth legislation and a small price to pay for that growth \nin our standard of living.\n  Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Hawaii that any time \nhe would like to interrupt my presentation, I hope he will.\n  Some of the specific provisions are the doubling of funding for the \nNational Science Foundation, I just mentioned, from $5.6 billion in the \ncurrent year to $11.2 billion in 2011. Before I arrived, the Congress \ndoubled funding for the National Institutes of Health with a great \npayoff, most people felt, in terms of our health and research for cures \nfor diseases. But we did not do as good a job during that period of \ntime on the physical sciences, which are also important to the health \nsciences. This, hopefully, will begin to change that.\n  Second, setting the Department of Energy's Office of Science on track \nto double in funding over 10 years, and increasing from $3.6 billion in \nthe current year to $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2011; establishing the \ninnovation acceleration research program, which will direct Federal \nagencies funding research and science and technology to set as a goal \ndedicating approximately 8 percent of their research and development \nbudgets toward high-risk frontier research. This was a recommendation \nof both of the major organizations, the Augustine committee and the \nCouncil on Competitiveness.\n  What this means is that there are so many good proposals before the \npeer review and merit review groups that give out basic research grants \nthat they obviously tend to be a little more conservative when \npresented with so many good ideas. The disadvantage of that is that it \nreduces the impulse to take a few risks, to roll the dice, or to try \nsome idea that has less of a chance of succeeding but might be the next \nGoogle or the next hybrid or the next Internet or the next stealth \ninvention. So this legislation encourages all through the America \nCOMPETES Act in virtually every section that we fund, the idea of \nsetting as a goal--not a mandate but as a goal--8 percent of the \nresearch and development budget toward this high-risk frontier \nresearch.\n  Next, it authorizes bringing the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology up from $703 million next year to $937 million in fiscal \nyear 2011. It would direct NASA to increase funding for basic research. \nIt will authorize coordinating ocean and atmospheric research and \neducation at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and \nother agencies to promote U.S. leadership in these important fields. \nThis has been a major priority of Senator Inouye, as well as others.\n  The Augustine committee, at our request, was asked to give us some \npriorities and not just give us a random list. And I might say, when \nthey gave us 20 recommendations instead of 10, and they gave them in \npriority, they didn't just go out and get the first 20 they heard \nabout. Over the summer, the working group of 21 members--and I am sure \nthe Council on Competitiveness did the same--considered hundreds of \nideas. So our leading scientists and the people we asked to give us \ntheir best advice on science and their best advice on medicine and \ntheir best advice on engineering, they waded through dozens and dozens \nof operating programs and other ideas and gave us just a handful of the \nbest ideas.\n\n  This has been a tremendously important screening process. I believe \none reason this has been so broadly accepted in the Senate and by those \noutside the Senate is that it is not just one Senator's idea of what is \na great math program or another's best friend's idea of a good research \nprogram. This is, in effect, a merit-based, peer-reviewed set of \nrecommendations and an answer to the question as to what are the most \nimportant things we can do to keep our brain power advantage.\n  So, No. 1, authorizing competitive grants to States to better align \nelementary and secondary education with knowledge and skills needed for \nsuccess in colleges and universities and the Armed Forces.\n  Now, what that means in plain English is to make sure our elementary, \nmiddle, and high schools are teaching what students need in order to go \nto college, to go to work, and to go to the Armed Forces. That is the \nkey.\n  Next, strengthen the skills of thousands of math and science teachers \nby establishing training and educational programs at summer institutes \nhosted by the National Laboratories, and increasing support for the \nteacher institutes at the National Science Foundation's institutes.\n  One Senator said to me the other day: This is new, isn't it, the idea \nof giving the National Laboratories such a specific role in training \noutstanding math and science teachers and inspiring math and science \nstudents to learn and achieve more in math and science? The answer is, \nyes, it is new. But the feeling of the Augustine commission and others \nis that we have a crisis in math and science. And that is not too \nstrong a word.\n  The former Governor of North Carolina, Jim Hunt, told me the \nUniversity of North Carolina only graduated three physics teachers in a \nrecent year from its college of education. So we are not going to learn \nmuch physics if we don't have anybody teaching much physics. So why not \ntake advantage of these remarkable National Laboratories we have around \nthe country. I guess there are about two dozen or so of them, like the \nOak Ridge Laboratory in the State of Tennessee, but there is also Los \nAlamos and Lawrence Livermore. They are all around the country. If you \nare going to inspire a student or inspire a teacher to be active in \nmath and science, why not place them in an environment for 4 weeks in \nthe summer with some of the finest math and science researchers and \nindividuals in the United States?\n  It would be a choice for a young musician--give them a choice whether \nto be on the road with Johnny Cash or be in the business office at the \nGrand Ole Opry, and they will go on the road every time because that is \nhow a singer learns to be a singer. And that is how a student learns \nwhat they can do with math and the joy of mathematics.\n  When I was Governor of Tennessee we created summer academies--we \ncalled them the Governor's schools--for outstanding students and \nteachers of various subjects. About 20 States have done the same thing. \nWe have found it is the best money we ever spent to offer 4 weeks at \nthe University of Tennessee connected to the Oak Ridge National \nLaboratory for 200 of the most outstanding high school juniors \ninterested in science and math. The teachers love to teach them, the \nstudents love to come. Instead of becoming a nerd in their rural \nschool, suddenly they are with 200 peers, and they are all celebrated \nfor their academic achievements. Why not use these National \nLaboratories to our advantage?\n  No other country in the world has the National Laboratories that we \nhave. One thing they can do is to help inspire the next generation of \nmath and science students and improve this generation and the next \ngeneration of math and science teachers.\n  So expanding the Robert Noyse teaching scholarship program at the \nNational Science Foundation--this is a very fine program at the \nNational Science Foundation which has had for a long time a role in \neducation as well as research. This program trains individuals to \nbecome math and science teachers in high-need local education agencies.\n  Assisting States in establishing or expanding statewide specialty \nschools in math and science. Now, I don't know whether the State of \nVirginia or the State of Hawaii has a full-time residential school in \nscience and math. I know\n\n[[Page S4831]]\n\nthe State of North Carolina does, and I went to see it. Governor Jim \nHunt set it up. I went to see it when I was Governor. We didn't believe \nwe had enough money to create one in Tennessee, so we created those \nsummer academies about which I just spoke. But Governor Bredesen, our \ncurrent Democratic Governor of Tennessee, wants to start, and has made \na very small start, of what we call in the legislation a specialty \nschool in math and science, and several other States have followed \nNorth Carolina's example. This would help States up to about a 50-\npercent level. All the rest of the money would have to be private, \nState, or local.\n  Establish schools like the North Carolina residential high school for \nmath and science. Not only will it give gifted students a greater \nknowledge, but it helps us compete with the world. North Carolina has \nfelt as though over the last 20 years it has helped keep many of those \nbright students in North Carolina because if they go there to school, \nthey may go there to college, or at least they may come back if they go \nsomewhere else, and then they create more jobs and build up that \neconomy.\n  Facilitating the expansion of advanced placement in international \nbaccalaureate programs by increasing the number of teachers prepared to \nteach those courses and foreign language courses. The AP courses, \nadvanced placement courses, are a ticket to success. College entrance \nexaminers read them carefully. If you get a 4 or a 5--those are the \nhighest grades in math or science--or if you take several of them, your \nchances of being admitted to a variety of institutions are increased. \nBut they are offered to a very limited number of the students--not \nlimited by their brains but limited by their money. They either do not \nhave the money to pay for the tests or they do not go to the schools \nwhere there are enough teachers who are trained to teach in the \npreparation for their tests.\n\n  This builds on a program in Houston, TX, which has been very \nsuccessful in the last 10 years, of expanding the opportunities for \nlow-income students to take more advanced placement courses to prepare \nfor college and also to train teachers to meet that demand.\n  Senator Hutchison and Senator Bingaman have been two of the leaders \nin this for 10 years in the Senate.\n  There are a variety of other proposals. Adopting another program from \nTexas, the You Teach program--this wasn't sent over from the White \nHouse although this is two straight Texas programs; this is from the \nNational Academy of Sciences, because they have a terrific program at \nthe University of Texas at Austin, where they take students who are \nenrolled in chemistry and recruit them into the College of Education \nwith an attractive scholarship and then the idea was to pay them \n$10,000 a year to teach at a high-needs school for 5 years after they \nleave. In other words, they get the people into teaching and they will \nput them in the schools where they are needed the most. That is called \nthe You Teach program. It would expand that.\n  There was a program from the University of Pennsylvania which would \ntake teachers who are now teaching and give them intensive summer \ntraining and improve their ability to teach math and science, all \ntoward the same objectives.\n  Then the President proposed Math Now grants, improving the teaching \nof mathematics in the elementary and middle schools. That is in here as \nwell, after it went through the process. Then we expand the programs to \nincrease the number of students who study critical foreign languages \nand become proficient. That was recognized here for a variety of \nreasons as a part of keeping our brain power advantage.\n  Finally, there are a number of proposals that would identify \ncontinuing organizations within the White House and Cabinet councils \nand other studies to try to keep a spotlight on this subject.\n  This is not the whole answer to the book ``The World Is Flat.'' It is \non the same subject. It is part of the answer. It is a good start. In \nfact, it is a very good beginning. But we need to continue this \nattention to our position in competitiveness.\n  What I have tried to review here is how this legislation came to the \nfloor, why it has attracted this unusual leadership from the majority \nleader and Republican leader, why it has had such a sense of urgency \nfrom senior leaders such as Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and \nothers, why today it has 56 sponsors, why the House of Representatives \nis considering legislation on a parallel track, and why I believe there \nis no more important piece of legislation that will come before us in \nthis session of Congress.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 904, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished chairman of \nthe Energy Committee, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the pending \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 906\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to send to the desk a \nmanagers' package, which I described earlier, from the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for himself and Mr. \n     Stevens, proposes an amendment numbered 906.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S4832]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the amendment, the \nmanagers' package the Senator from Hawaii has proposed. I wish to make \ntwo points about it.\n  The first is it reduces the cost of the bill by $280 million over 4 \nyears. That is important to all of us and it is especially important to \nsome of us. We are trying to spend money wisely.\n  At the same time, there are significant increases in the National \nScience Foundation education programs--about $300 million, in fact, \nover the President's requested level. But it is important that we know \nwhat these are. They are directly in line with the recommendations of \nthe Augustine report and the Council on Competitiveness. Remember, we \nasked them to put these recommendations in priority order. The first \nthing is not the R tax credit, it is not bringing in more foreign \nstudents--it is not. The first thing was kindergarten through 12th \ngrade math and science education. That is where our academies believed \nwe had the biggest problem. So this new money for education programs in \nthe National Science Foundation goes to graduate research fellows, to \ngraduate education, research traineeships for a program called \nProfessional Science Masters. This is a program where colleges are \nhelping students earn master's degrees, not necessarily with the goal \nof going on to a Ph.D., but a master's degree that might take you on \ninto a highly technical field in business; in other words, making us \nmore competitive. It includes the Robert Noyce scholarships, which were \nexpanded to help train more math and science teachers, and the teachers \ninstitutes in the summer.\n  These programs are education programs of the National Science \nFoundation, but we save $280 million over 4 years, and we have directed \nthose toward nonduplicative programs that are consistent with the \ncommission reports.\n  I wonder if, before Senator Domenici speaks, I could say a word. \nSenator Domenici is here. He is going to speak now. I am going to step \nto the side while he does. But I wish to say a word about Senator \nDomenici's crucial role.\n  I have already spoken to the fact that without the sense of urgency \nof Senators Inouye and Stevens, we would never have gotten to this \npoint. But Senator Domenici was there at the beginning of this work. \nEven though, in our caucus, only one Senator is more senior, he stepped \nback and created an environment so Senator Bingaman and I and many \nother Senators could work on this. He watched it very carefully, he \nsupervised it, he chaired it, but he left room for us, many of us, to \nwork on this.\n  When it came time to go to the White House, it was Senator Domenici \nwho asked the President if we could come see him. It was Senator \nDomenici who, rather than go down by himself as a Senator might have \ndone, invited his junior colleague, me, to go with him. But more \nimportant than that, he invited his senior colleague, the Democratic \nSenator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, to go. It was Senator \nDomenici who insisted in the Energy and Commerce Committee he chaired \nthat all this work be done in a bipartisan way. So because of that and \nthe way Senators Stevens and Inouye work, we were able to do this.\n  It was a Domenici-Bingaman piece of legislation called the Protect \nAmerica's Competitiveness Act that was introduced last year with 70 \nsponsors, 35 Democrats and 35 Republicans.\n  So before, Senator Domenici came, I thanked and saluted other \nSenators whose leadership has made a difference. But no one has been \nmore responsible for this piece of legislation coming through.\n  Now that the assistant Democratic leader is here, I want to use this \noccasion to say how much I, and many of us, appreciate the way he and \nthe majority leader have handled this piece of legislation; created an \nenvironment in which we have it on the floor in a way it can succeed. \nSenator Durbin, the Presiding Officer, has been a strong supporter of \nthis legislation and a cosponsor of it from the beginning. I also \nwanted to recognize that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is now over 60 years ago that a \nbrilliant, charismatic man arrived on the scene in my home State of New \nMexico. He cut an odd figure and began a strange recruiting effort for \na secret project at an undisclosed location for an undetermined period \nof time.\n  Who was this man and what was the upshot? His name was J. Robert \nOppenheimer, a brilliant and charismatic American physicist. We all \nknow something of him, and we might have different views, one from \nanother. But he was collecting the best scientific minds of his time \nworldwide, not just Americans, for he had the Fermis from Italy, \nhusband and wife. Some say, as they assessed the brilliance of the \nteam, Enrico Fermi led the pack. I don't know which; it was 60 years \nago. But I do know they were asked and recruited by Mr. J. Robert \nOppenheimer. He was collecting the minds and taking them on a \nmysterious journey to a remote mesa in New Mexico. The task was to \ndevelop the first atomic bomb. The collective scientific brain power of \nthe Manhattan Project, and the awesome power it produced, would change \nthe world forever. The scientists at Los Alamos ushered in a new era. \nTheir sacrifice and their ingenuity created a story for the ages.\n  More specifically, their legacy for us is to consider today, and is \nto find out that there is great value in an awesome power of science \nand mathematics education. That is what brings me to the Senate floor, \nand that is why I rise in strong support of this bill under \nconsideration.\n  Today is a great day. Today the Senate begins a process of rising \nabove the gathering storm. Let's hope. Let's hope. Those words, \n``Rising Above The Gathering Storm,'' are part of the title of the \nNational Academy of Science report released in 2005 on American future \ncompetitiveness and standard of living of our people. The report was \nwritten by a distinguished group chaired by a former Lockheed chairman, \nchief executive officer Norm Augustine. Mr. Augustine's committee \nincluded three Nobel laureates, presidents of leading American \nuniversities, including then Texas A president and current Secretary \nof Defense, Robert Gates, and the chief executive officers of \ncorporations with global reach.\n  After an intensive 10 weeks, the committee presented a significant \nchallenge to our Nation. The findings of the ``Gathering Storm'' report \nand the 20 communications within tell us one thing above all else: \nAmerica is not doing enough to harness and develop its national brain \npower. Yes, that is a strange thing to say. We are not doing enough to \nharness and develop our national brain power. Today we are here to \nbegin to remedy this problem and to meet the challenge set forth in the \nreport.\n  I am so grateful that even after 34 years in the Senate I can find an \nissue such as this to get excited about. I can find an issue such as \nthis that Senators from both sides of the aisle can get excited about. \nThey do not talk about their parties when we have these meetings. Most \ninteresting. Maybe they go back to their rooms and talk about the \nDemocratic party, how it can use this report, or the Republican party. \nThey talk about America's brain power is on the wane, meaning that, \nbelieve it or not, we can do something about it. That is a nice \nobservation. We can do something about the waning brain power of \nAmerica; meaning these young kids, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 \nyears of age, have within them the same collective brain power that was \npresent when Oppenheimer went looking for the best. It was not just \nassumed that there were smart people; they knew there were people with \nbrain power. Right? They just didn't have them in place. They were \nscattered about. Fermi was over here, some guys were over in Eastern \nEurope, and a bunch of them were over on the West Coast. But somebody \nhad to put them together. They collected brain power that unlocked the \natomic bomb.\n\n[[Page S4833]]\n\n  Now, we are not going to do that. What we are trying to do is look \nback and say, how do we do the things that experts tell us will, in \nfact, increase the brain power of our people. It is there the same as \nit is in China. They are just producing more. Does it mean they have \nmore? No, it does not. It means they have decided it is the greatest \nthing for them, so they are educating more and more and more. So is \nIndia. We are sitting over here with all of the greatest institutions \nto do the educating, but we do not have--it has not been coalesced even \naround the essence of a plan that has, as its goal, brain power \ncollection, brain power enhancement; brain power is on the wane. Let's \nbuild it back.\n  That is what we are trying to do. Today, we begin to remedy the \nproblem and meet the challenges set forth in the report called the \n``Gathering Storm.'' It tells us in a few pages why it is a storm. It \ntells us in a few pages why it is a gathering storm. It tells us in a \nfew pages that we are actually selling ourselves short. It tells us if \nwe do not decide to build this brain power back, we are going to lose. \nWe are going to lose a war which some of us do not even know we are \nfighting. We are going to lose the war for brain power equality and we \ndo not even know we are fighting.\n\n  This ``Gathering Storm'' report identifies the two challenges linked \nto scientific and engineering excellence: first, creating high quality \njobs for the American people, and, secondly, responding to America's \nneed for clean, affordable, and reliable energy.\n  The report was aimed at enhancing our Nation's human financial \nknowledge and capital to ensure our prosperity. It addressed increasing \nAmerica's talent pool by vastly improving science and mathematics \neducation in kindergarten through grade 12. The report, ``Gathering \nStorm,'' called for significant advances in science and engineering \nprograms in our Nation's higher education, improving our economic \npolicy, from intellectual property protection to research and \ndevelopment tax credits and tax incentives for U.S.-based innovation.\n  The report also provides us with some worrisome indicators. The \nfollowing few facts should sound alarm bells throughout this Chamber \nand this Nation. I trust people will listen. Senators have participated \nfrom both sides of the aisle, from all vintages. Some are young, some \nhave just come, they are excited, some have been here a long time. I am \nnot going to say such as the Senator from New Mexico, I am going to say \nsuch as the Senator from Hawaii, and he is enthused. Some have been \neven here as long as the Senator from Alaska, and that is a long time, \nlonger than me, and he is excited. Right? What it means is if you put \nthe right plate in front of us, we can get excited about doing \nsomething for our great country.\n  This report provided us with some worrisome indicators. I am going to \ntell you about them in a minute. In 2001, U.S. industries spent more on \ntort litigation than research and development. Look at that. That is \nnot happening to our competitors, I tell you.\n  If we want people over here to say, well, there is some good to that, \nwe are gaining something on that, well, we will have an awfully long \ndialog on the floor on that one fact. Are we gaining that much benefit \nfor the American people out of our tort system, as we are when we say \nthat costs us as much in dollars? It says here: Industry spent more on \nlitigation than it did on research and development.\n  Chemical companies closed 70 facilities around the United States in \n2004. I might say to my friend, of the 120 chemical companies being \nbuilt at the time of the release of the Augustine report with a price \ntag of $1 billion or more, 1 was in the United States and 50 were in \nChina. Got it? Those are chemical plants. People say: Oh, chemical \nplants; bad stuff. We are not talking about chemical plants, bad stuff. \nWe are talking about chemical plants where you use the chemical product \nfor all kinds of things that make you a strong nation, that make things \nfor people to use in their house, that make things you can use \noutdoors. The chemical plants are an evidence of basic industry, and \nAmerica built 1, China built 50. That is pretty startling, is it not?\n  Of the nearly 1.1 million U.S. high school seniors who took the \ncollege entrance exam in 2002, less than 6 percent had plans to study \nengineering. That is a 33-percent decrease from 10 years earlier. \nPretty big stuff. Meanwhile, more than 50 percent of the U.S. science \nand engineering workforce is approaching retirement. Startling.\n  Now, Senators, these statistics show that the challenge to our \nNation's standard of living is before us and the Senate must act. I am \nproud to join this bipartisan group of Senators introducing the America \nCOMPETES Act of 2007, commonly referred to as the competitiveness bill.\n  Through this legislation, we are addressing nearly every one of the \nrecommendations made by this significant report. Enacting this bill \nwill be a culmination of a remarkable cooperative effort, with work \ncutting across three Senate committees, and with valuable contributions \nfrom a large number of colleagues in the Senate. This bill has the \nsupport of both leaders in the Senate and the collective support of our \nNation's boardrooms, classrooms, and laboratories.\n\n  I will speak briefly about the area of the bill over which the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee has jurisdiction. We know that \nfollowing through on recommendations of the Augustine Commission will \nrequire new commitments and participation from several Federal \nagencies. The Department of Energy has a major role to play in meeting \nthis challenge. This legislation doubles funding for the Office of \nScience over the next decade--that is healthy and hearty, and many will \nlook forward to it with great enthusiasm--the largest source of Federal \nsupport for basic science in the physical sciences. The President \ncalled for the increase in announcing his American Competitiveness \nInitiative last year.\n  The Augustine report stressed the importance of increasing our \nnational commitment to basic research in the physical sciences. The \nAmerica COMPETES Act responds by putting the Department of Energy \nOffice of Science on a path to double in funding over the next decade. \nAs the largest Federal funder of basic research in the physical \nsciences, the Office of Science is of critical importance.\n  More than 58 Nobel Prize winners since 1936 have been supported by \nthe Department of Energy at some time in their careers. Eighteen Nobel \nPrizes have been awarded to Department of Energy laboratory employees \nand another 13 to researchers who employed the National Laboratory \nfacilities in their award-winning discoveries. Most of the 40 winners \nof the prestigious Enrico Fermi Presidential awards have done research \nsupported by the Department.\n  A few years ago, we made a commitment to double funding in the \nNational Institutes of Health to support the biological sciences. We \nmade good on that commitment. We said it, and we did it. It is now time \nthat we address the role physical sciences play and stand together to \nsupport such growth of key agencies such as the DOE Office of Science. \nBy doing so, we will not be taking away from other Department functions \nor laboratory resources.\n  In fact, I was cosponsors with Senators Bingaman and Alexander to an \namendment in this year's budget resolution. We have a few people who \nknow something about that, too. It is rather tricky, and sometimes you \nhave to do some things you don't quite understand. Then you catch on. \nBut we did put in a billion dollars for new authorizations provided in \nthat budget, so that the legislation we are going to enact will not \ntake money from Peter to pay Paul. We won't be taking money out of the \nDepartment of Energy to pay for the new items in the Department of \nEnergy. We would be called down here on the floor, and we would lose. I \nhope we have done it right so we can prove our point.\n  This bill leverages the tremendous talent and technological \ninvestment of our laboratories and its system. These new provisions \nwill build on education and outreach work the labs have undertaken for \nyears. Through this legislation, the national labs will provide \nopportunities for high school students from across the Nation to gain \nhands-on experience in science and engineering fields; assist States in \nestablishing specialty schools in math and science; strengthen the \nskills of thousands of\n\n[[Page S4834]]\n\nmath and science teachers by establishing training and education \nprograms at summer institutes hosted at National Laboratories; \nestablish partnerships between the National Laboratories and local high \nschools and centers of excellence in math and science.\n  I have spoken quite a bit recently about the importance of engaging \nChina in the challenge of energy security and global climate change. I \nhave written to the President about this important issue. It should be \nclear to all of us that our energy, environmental, and educational \nchallenges cannot be considered in a bubble; rather, they must be \nconsidered in light of global competitiveness, challenges that face us \nall. To maintain our technological edge, we must improve our \neducational systems and the research and development we do in \ncorporations, universities, and Government laboratories throughout our \nNation. This must lead us to higher brainpower for our people.\n  The challenge is great, like others this Nation has faced. The \nchallenge was great 60 years ago in New Mexico. They were busy trying \nto put a team together to build the first atomic bomb--can you \nimagine--from scratch. The idea alone is all they had. They put it \ntogether and built it. They found the manpower to do it. We have the \nmanpower. We are just not using it. We are not letting it build itself \nas required.\n  I commend the authors of the Augustine report. I commend my \ncolleagues for their hard work on this legislation. I am hopeful we \nwill rise above the gathering storm. If we do, people will say: You had \na lot to do, maybe more than you thought, but you sought out and found \nwhat was most important; that is, taking the gathering storm and making \nsure it did not end up hurting our great Nation but, rather, was the \nstimulus for us to increase the collective brainpower of our young \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of a \nbill that addresses many of the challenges facing Georgia and our \nNation during this time of increasing global competitiveness. I am a \ncosponsor of the America COMPETES Act because it will ensure that the \nUnited States will be able to sustain a vigorous economy, an unrivaled \nnational defense, a first-rate health care and education system, a \nhealthy environment, and a hopeful and prosperous future for \ngenerations to come.\n  Although the United States has the strongest scientific and \ntechnological enterprise in the world, we are now experiencing the slow \nbut steady effects of globalization. These effects, led most notably by \nmodern advances in communications, have made the world a smaller place \nand have dramatically increased worldwide competition.\n  The leadership in science and technology that the United States has \nenjoyed since World War II is being seriously threatened by the \nburgeoning and thriving economies and workforces in countries such as \nChina and India. I believe in order to keep our competitive edge and to \nmaintain our dominance in the fields of science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics, it is imperative we make a long-term \ninvestment in our future scientists, professors, and engineers. We can \ndo so by improving science and mathematics education, and by providing \nschools, universities, and research centers throughout the country with \nnecessary funding.\n  Recently, Microsoft Corporation founder Bill Gates testified before \nCongress, and he said:\n\n       The U.S. cannot maintain its economic leadership unless our \n     workforce consists of people who have the knowledge and \n     skills needed to drive innovation.\n\n  Mr. President, that is a very accurate statement, and that is why we \nneed to pass this bill. With the funding and programs provided for in \nthis bill, it will be easier to educate and grow an innovative \nworkforce that is highly skilled and highly trained. The America \nCOMPETES Act recognizes that better educated students make a smarter, \nmore efficient workforce. And that is an important investment for this \nNation.\n  As an example of what funding for science and mathematics education \ncan do, let me tell you about a program that is doing great things in \nmy home State of Georgia. The Georgia Academy of Mathematics, \nEngineering, and Science, or GAMES, was established at Middle Georgia \nCollege in Cochran, GA, during the fall of 1997. GAMES is a \nresidential, joint enrollment program for top-performing high school \njuniors and seniors. The program allows students to obtain high school \nand college credits simultaneously while enrolled in full-time college \ncourses. Most students in the GAMES program major in mathematics, \nscience, or engineering.\n  The GAMES program enrollment continues to grow each year and has \nearned the reputation of an academic alternative for gifted students \nall across Georgia. Over the 10 years this program has been in \nexistence, students who have been accepted into GAMES have averaged a \n3.85 GPA and an SAT score of 1246. After completing the GAMES program, \n48 percent of the students enrolled in the program have transferred to \nthe Georgia Institute of Technology. The GAMES program allows these \nstudents to earn a firm foundation in science, technology, and physics \nbefore entering Georgia Tech.\n  Many GAMES graduates are pursuing and/or have received their Ph.D. in \nmathematics, science, or engineering. I commend Dr. Richard Federinko, \npresident of Middle Georgia College, and the entire faculty and staff \nfor their hard work in making the GAMES program a major success.\n  GAMES is just one program in one State, and we need more like it \nthroughout the country. This legislation will open the door and perhaps \nexpand these types of programs into other States and allow more bright \nyoung people to enter the fields of science, math, and technology.\n  My fellow colleagues, time is of the essence. We can no longer afford \nto be complacent and just assume the United States will continue to be \nthe world's leading innovator. Without action, our grandchildren face \nthe genuine possibility of living in an America that is not the \npreeminent leader in scientific and technological advancements. I urge \neach of you to join me in support of this critical piece of \nlegislation.\n  I want to particularly commend my long-time dear friend, Senator \nLamar Alexander from Tennessee, for playing a leading roll in the \ndrafting of this legislation and for working so hard to make sure the \npolicy in this legislation is the right kind of policy to promote \nscience, math, and technology in our schools, not just from the eighth \ngrade forward, from the ninth grade forward, but from kindergarten \nforward.\n  I say to Senator Alexander, I know he has been ably assisted by \nSenator Bingaman, as well as others, in a bipartisan way to make sure \nAmerica's educational system continues to be the preeminent system in \nthe world and that we give these bright minds the opportunity to \ndevelop, and that we make sure--from the standpoint of developing \nengineers in the future, from the standpoint of developing medical \nresearchers in the future, from the standpoint of developing doctors \nand other types of engineers in that field--we continue to lead the \nworld not just in the production of individuals from a numbers \nstandpoint but in the production of quality individuals to develop \ntechnology, to develop our research capability, as well as to make sure \nfrom a professional standpoint we have the engineers and the physicians \nwho will continue to lead the world.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \nhis comments but, more importantly, for his leadership. We usually \nthink of Senator Chambliss in terms of leadership on intelligence \nmatters, Armed Services matters, on agricultural matters, where he is \nthe ranking member. But from the very beginning on this legislation, he \nhas been out front.\n  I can remember when Norm Augustine, chairman of the Augustine \ncommittee, came to the Senate and had a dinner with us right around the \ncorner. Senator Chambliss was one of the first\n\n[[Page S4835]]\n\nSenators there. He has been one of the major leaders in this endeavor \nfor the last 2 years. His comments about the Georgia residential high \nschool for math and science illustrates a good way to help take this \nlegislation from the abstract and put it in concrete terms. Section \n3171 of this legislation, specialty schools for math and science, will \nassist States in establishing or expanding such residential high \nschools for math and science.\n\n  I spoke a little earlier on the floor about North Carolina's math and \nscience program which they have had for 25 years. Tennessee is a little \nbehind. We haven't had one yet; we have summer governor schools for \nmath and science. This legislation would authorize the Congress to \nappropriate funds which could pay for up to 50 percent of the cost of \noperating that school in Georgia which would permit Georgia, if it \nwished, to expand that school. The Senator cited in his remarks one \ngood reason to do it in addition to the Nation's competitiveness. I \nthink I heard him say 48 percent of the students went to Georgia Tech. \nSo if our goal is to keep bright students at home to create jobs for us \nin the United States, a more specific goal is to keep bright Georgia \nstudents at home so they can create jobs for Georgians.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion through the Chair.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Certainly.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I simply say the Senator is exactly correct; 47 \npercent of our students do go on to Georgia Tech. I wish we could get \nmore of them at the University of Georgia where they happened to let me \ngo, but at Georgia Tech we are doing a terrific job of taking these \nbright young minds that are being developed, as we said earlier, not \njust at the eighth and ninth grade level, but thanks to you and the \nleadership of folks like you, at a much earlier age. Our GAMES program, \nincidentally, was put into effect and implemented by our former \ncolleague Senator Zell Miller, when he was the Governor of our State, \nand somebody whom I know you worked very closely with over the years. \nIt is a great concept. It is forward thinking, as this legislation is \nvery forward thinking from the standpoint of making sure that these \ngreat minds are developed at a very early age.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his great work on this \nand I commend this legislation to all of our colleagues.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, our former colleague Zell Miller was Lieutenant \nGovernor of Georgia when I was a Governor. He was a professor by \nprofession and he was always interested in education and very skillful \nin education policy. Every Governor I know spends a lot of time trying \nto think of how we are going to recruit jobs. Well, if you study it, \nyou learn after a while you don't recruit nearly as many as you grow. \nThe way you grow them is with brain power. So the single best thing any \nState can do to create the largest number of good new jobs in that \nState is to keep the brightest kids at home. Governor Miller, when he \nwas there, initiated the HOPE scholarship, which played a major role in \nattracting many of the brightest Georgia students, and I would say many \nof the brightest Tennessee students to come across the border to go to \nthe University of Georgia, and then the residential school for math and \nscience did the same. This legislation would permit every other State \nto do the same, and it is just one of the things it would do.\n  If I may, if the Senator from Georgia is finished with his remarks, \nhe has highlighted an area I wish to enlarge on. Sometimes our \nlegislation, particularly when we talk about big phrases such as \ncompetitiveness and globalization, takes us off into the stratosphere \nand one might say: Well, what does that have to do with me? We have \njust talked about one example. If you are the Governor of Georgia or \nTennessee or Illinois and you are thinking: What can I do over the next \n10 years to grow the largest number of good new jobs, a residential \nschool for math and science is a very good start.\n  I remember as Governor, after we recruited the Nissan plant and the \nSaturn plant, I was feeling pretty good. Then I counted up the number \nof jobs, and it was 10,000 or 12,000 jobs in a State that employs 2.5 \nmillion people. We were losing 200,000 or 250,000 jobs per year, so we \nhad to be creating that many more. In our country, in the United States \nof America, we are losing jobs all the time. We don't want that to \nhappen, but that is happening. So the real test of our society is: Can \nwe create a lot more good new jobs than we are losing, a constant \nsupply of good new jobs. Most of that comes from the subject of this \nlegislation: from brain power, better schools, better colleges, better \nuniversities, more research, and especially technological innovation.\n  Illinois, I am told, already has such an academy: the Illinois Math \nand Science Academy, a residential high school. I am sure the Presiding \nOfficer is very familiar with it. He may have helped start it, given \nhis long tenure in the Congress. This legislation would give it an \nopportunity as well to expand.\n  On the subject of creating new jobs, the chief State school officers \nare in town. That means the superintendent of education of Illinois and \nTennessee's commissioner of education are here in town. I am meeting \nwith them tomorrow at about noon for a while, and what I can tell \nthem--even though they probably heard all about math and science they \nwant to hear through No Child Left Behind--is we are doing a number of \nthings to help them at least authorize funding to help them succeed. \nFor example, we are authorizing grants to States to promote alignment \nof elementary and secondary education with knowledge and skills. That \nmeans in plain English helping States line up the math and science they \nare teaching with what you need to know to go into the Armed Forces, \nwhat you need to know to go to college, what you need to know to go to \nwork. Sometimes there is not a good fit there. This would help schools \nand education systems, those chief State school officers, do that.\n  The second thing we would be doing is strengthening the skills of \nthousands of math and science teachers by using our national \nlaboratories in Illinois, New Mexico, Tennessee, and around our \ncountry, and a host of summer institutions and academies for \noutstanding teachers of math and science, as well as for students, but \nespecially for teachers.\n  I found in my experience as Governor, one of the most successful and \nproductive things we did were Governors' schools, where we would take \nthe Governors' schools for teachers of mathematics or teachers of \nreading, or students of international affairs, and the students would \ncome for 2 to 4 weeks--sometimes it would only be teachers, but the \nstudents would come, you would bring in a core of faculty members from \naround the State, too. It would inspire those students so much, and \nwhat could be more inspiring for math and science teachers than to have \na chance to be at the National Labs with Nobel Prize winners and some \nof the outstanding scientists in the world. It would refresh them, \nexcite them, improve their skills, and help them carry a sense of \nmission back to their classrooms to inspire a new generation of math \nstudents and hopefully math and science teachers.\n\n  I can say to the chief State school officers of our various States, \nwe are expanding the Robert Noyce teacher scholarship program at the \nNational Science Foundation to recruit and train individuals to become \nmath and science teachers in high-need, local education agencies. We \nare finding as we review No Child Left Behind in elementary and \nsecondary education that 80 percent of our schools are, we can say, \nachieving, or even high achieving. In other words, their students, by \ncategory, are meeting what we call adequate yearly progress, so let's \ncatch them doing something right. About 5 percent of those schools--I \nhave missed it in one category--I would say they are still achieving \npretty well. Only about 15 percent of the schools are high need, and \nusually what we find is they are children of low income, children whose \nparents haven't been able to help them, children whose parents have \nneglected them, children who have not yet learned English, children who \nhave just arrived in this country and may not be in the same school in \nJanuary they were in October, children who are hard to teach, and \nchildren who need more than even good teachers are usually able to give \nthem. I am coming to\n\n[[Page S4836]]\n\nthe conclusion that we need to train teachers especially to help these \nchildren. About 10 or 15 percent of all the children in our public \nschools across the country are these children, and these are the ones \nwe are leaving behind.\n  Well, we are expanding teacher scholarship programs at the National \nScience Foundation to recruit and train individuals to become math and \nscience teachers in high-need educational agencies. We are assisting, \nwe have just said, teachers in establishing statewide specialty schools \nin math and science, and we will use the National Laboratories' staff \nto help with that. For example, if Tennessee wants to expand the new \nmath and science academy Governor Bredesen has established--I salute \nhim for doing it; he has wanted to do it for a while, but it is \nexpensive and he only has a few students in it. This legislation makes \nit possible to use the National Laboratory staff to help Governor \nBredesen in Tennessee expand and enlarge and make better the summer \nresidential school for math and science.\n  I can say to the chief State school officers tomorrow, and they can \ntake it back to their States across the country, that if the Congress \nenacts this legislation sponsored by the majority leader and the \nRepublican leader, with 56 Senators on both sides of the aisle, its \ngoal is to train 70,000 more teachers so they can teach advanced \nplacement courses in math, sciences, and foreign language, so we can \nbring to the number of 700,000 the number of students who can take \nadvanced placement courses in math, sciences, and critical foreign \nlanguage.\n  As we have said before in the debate on this bill, students who don't \nget to take those AP courses now don't take them because they are not \nsmart enough or because their brains don't work well enough; they don't \ntake it often because they can't afford it or because the teachers \naren't available to teach them in the schools they attend, so this will \nhelp to remedy that.\n  I can say to the chief State school officers, Governor Jim Hunt of \nNorth Carolina, one of our leading educators in America, a former \nGovernor for 16 years in that State, who testified before the \nPresident's Commission on Higher Education that the University of North \nCarolina only graduated three physics teachers in 1 year at its College \nof Education. As I mentioned earlier, if we are not teaching physics, \nnobody is going to be learning it. So what are we going to do about \nthat?\n  What this suggests is that after reviewing programs from all over the \ncountry, the Augustine commission recommends that we expand the You \nTeach program at the University of Texas. So there will be money that \nmay be appropriated under this law that would permit universities to do \nas they do in Texas, in Austin, to go into the chemistry and biology \nprograms and recruit students who are majoring in those science \nsubjects, or a student who is majoring in math, and give them a \nscholarship to go to the College of Education and become a teacher of \nchemistry or biology or math.\n  Now, the Augustine report recommended that we then pay $10,000 a year \nin fellowships for those students so they can go into teaching in high-\nneed areas, rather than for IBM or Google or Dell or some other high-\npaying job. That part of our provision is not in this legislation, the \n$10,000 fellowship. I would like to see it in there.\n  Senator Reid, the majority leader, the principal sponsor of this \nlegislation, suggested when he introduced the bill the other day, that \nhe had a very good experience--he and Paul Simon, the former \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois--with finding ways to give stipends \nto teachers of math and science so they would stay in teaching. Well, \nthis You Teach program at the University of Texas is now going to be \navailable in Michigan, Tennessee, and other States around the country \nso we can recruit outstanding students into teaching.\n  In addition, the Augustine commission, after reviewing dozens and \ndozens and dozens of programs, found an especially good program at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania in science called Penn Science, and instead \nof recruiting students into teaching, it takes existing teachers and \nputs them through continuous training during the summer and during the \nyear so they can be even better teachers of science.\n  I can say to the chief State school officers who are meeting in \nWashington, DC today that this legislation will permit you in Wyoming \nand in Tennessee and in New York and in Michigan and wherever to create \na partnership between our National Laboratories and local high-need \nschools to establish centers of excellence in math and science \neducation. So suddenly you match up a high-needs school with one of the \ngreatest National Laboratories in the world. What can be more exciting \nfor the teachers in that school or the students? It might go from being \na high-needs school to one with a line around the block of students \nwaiting to get in the door.\n  This legislation also has significant authorization for funding for a \nprogram called Math Now. This is the President's proposal, from his \nAmerican Competitiveness Act which has been included in this \nlegislation, and it would provide grants to improve math instruction in \nthe elementary and middle grades and provide targeted help to \nstruggling students so all students can master grade level math \nstandards.\n  Finally, I can say to the chief State school officers who are meeting \nin Washington--and I will say it to them directly tomorrow at lunch--\nthat the bill also authorizes expanding programs to increase the number \nof students from elementary school through postsecondary education who \nstudy critical foreign languages. We find this not just in our military \nneeds in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world, but we increasingly \nlive in a worldwide economy, and our students, our citizens will be \nbetter citizens, more effective citizens, if more of us speak more than \none language. There is a long list.\n  There are 10 or 11 programs that either expand or create efforts to, \nas the Augustine commission says, ``increase America's talent pool by \nvastly improving K through 12 science and mathematics education.''\n  Senator Bingaman, I, Senator Domenici, and the House Members asked \nour national academies: Please tell us exactly what we need to do to \nkeep our brain power advantage so we can keep our jobs. We understand \nthat since World War II, more than half of this remarkably high \nstandard of living we have has come through innovation and technology. \nWe understand that and we have an idea or two and we have friends with \nan idea or two about what to do, but tell us exactly what to do about \nit. Tell us in priority order. They put down K-12--vastly improving K-\n12 science and mathematics education.\n  I see the Senator from New Mexico is present. We have had a good \ndiscussion this afternoon. Some of the principal advocates have been \nhere, and I especially appreciate Senators Stevens and Inouye who have \ngiven a great sense of urgency to this legislation. The Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Stabenow, has as well. Michigan has a tremendous \nnumber of research institutes and great universities that add fuel to \nthe economic resurgence of that State and every other State.\n  Really, we are all interested in this legislation. The key is, How do \nwe put it together in a way that we can get it through this interesting \nprocess we call the Senate? I think we are reasonably close to doing \nthat, thanks to the senior leadership of this body and Senator Bingaman \nand Senator Domenici on the Energy Committee.\n  Madam President, I will conclude my remarks now and yield he floor to \nSenator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I appreciate the good work my \ncolleague from Tennessee, as comanager of the bill, has been doing on \nthis issue, as I have been unavoidably detained over in the Energy \nCommittee.\n  It is my understanding, unless someone knows otherwise, that all \ndebate expected on the pending amendment has taken place. As far as I \nhave been informed, the Senate is ready to dispense with the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 906) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 908\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I send another amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am also heartened because this decision represents \na step towards restoring the American people's right to govern \nthemselves through their elected representatives.\n  For too long, the Supreme Court has set itself up as an antagonist to \nthe people and has shown unfortunate disregard for the judgments of \nthose our governmental system is supposed to serve.\n  The decision yesterday is a departure from that trend, and it should \ngive us all cautious optimism that the Supreme Court is coming around \nto a greater level of respect for the elected branches on questions of \nfundamental moral values.\n  I also want to send a word of congratulations and thanks to the man \nwho made this legislation a reality, former Senator Rick Santorum. \nDuring the debates on this bill back in 2003, I can remember Senator \nSantorum being on the Senate floor virtually full-time, taking on all \ncomers, engaging on every point, showing his skills as a debater, and \ndisplaying the passion and spirit that defined him during his two terms \nin the Senate.\n  Senator Santorum was our leader in the debates on this bill, and the \nSupreme Court's affirmation of the bill's constitutionality yesterday \nshould be a moment of great pride for our former colleague. This bill \nis part of his legacy, and we owe him a debt of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/23/senate-section/article/S4837-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4837-S4838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FILIPINO VETERANS EQUITY ACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I wish to update our colleagues on an \nimportant issue that the Veterans' Affairs Committee is dealing with; \nnamely, providing long overdue recognition to all those veterans of the \nPhilippines Armed Forces who served under U.S. command during the \nSecond World War.\n  Recently, the Veterans' Affairs Committee, which I am privileged to \nchair, held a hearing on S. 57, the Filipino Veterans Equity Act of \n2007. This important legislation, introduced by my good friend and \nsenior Senator, Mr. Inouye, would end more than 50 years of inequality \nfor Filipino veterans who have served our country, and it has my strong \nsupport. During our hearing, the committee received testimony from \nFilipino veterans who spoke of their service under U.S. military \ncommand and their difficulties with a VA system that doesn't recognize \nthem as veterans.\n  Until 1946, the Philippines was not completely independent from the \nUnited States. When America entered the Second World War, the Filipino \nmilitary was a part of the U.S. Armed Forces, under the command of the \nU.S. Armed Forces of the Far East. All military forces of the \nCommonwealth of the Philippines were ordered by President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt to serve under the command of the U.S. military, and they \nserved bravely, fighting for our country and their freedom.\n  In 1946, Congress limited veterans' benefits to only a portion of \nFilipinos who served in World War II. While some of the inequity has \nbeen corrected in recent years, this injustice still remains. Filipino \nveterans of the U.S. military do not have equal access to the health \ncare and benefits they have earned through service. S. 57 would end the \ninequity and give Filipino veterans who fought under the command of \nU.S. military the benefits and care they earned.\n  Some who oppose S. 57 say we cannot afford it. While I, too, am \nconcerned\n\n[[Page S4838]]\n\nabout costs, I am committed to finding offsets to cover the expense. \nAfter all, fiscal responsibility is not the only kind of responsibility \nthere is. Our country has a deeper responsibility to the men and women \nwho have served in our military, whether they were born in America or \nthe Philippines. We need a solution that is both morally responsible to \nFilipino veterans and fiscally responsible with taxpayer dollars.\n  Many of the brothers-in-arms of those who testified at our hearing \nhave since passed away, never having been recognized by the United \nStates for their service. I find that shameful. Following the hearing, \nI asked myself how we could stray from our moral commitment to these \nmen for over half a century and then argue that it is too expensive to \ngive those who are left the benefits they have earned.\n  With that in mind, let us look to fulfill both responsibilities, \nrather than neglecting the Filipino veterans who remain with us today. \nWe have gone down that path for over half of a century, denying them \ncare and benefits. Today we find many Filipino veterans living their \ntwilight years in the pain of poverty, without access to the relief \navailable to other veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces. Allowing this to \ngo on without searching vigorously for a realistic solution is not the \nresponsible response. These veterans deserve better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/23/senate-section/article/S4838-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, today I commemorate National Small \nBusiness Week, which President Bush designated for April 22-28, 2007. \nAs ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I simply cannot understate the vital role of small \nbusiness in our Nation's economy. Small businesses comprise 99 percent \nof all businesses in the United States, employ more than half of the \ntotal private sector workforce, and are responsible for the creation of \nmore than two-thirds of all new jobs each year. It is essential that we \nin Congress continue to support small businesses' efforts to grow and \ndo what they do best--create new jobs.\n  If there is one concern we have all heard time and again, it is the \nexorbitant cost to small businesses of providing health insurance to \ntheir employees. In fact, small business owners in all 50 States have \ncited rising health insurance costs as their number one concern. Health \ninsurance premiums have increased at double-digit percentage levels in \n4 of the past 6 years--far outpacing inflation and wage gains. \nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, last year the average health \npolicy for an individual was $4,242; the average family plan cost \n$11,480.\n  As we are all well aware, these sharply rising costs are leading \nfewer and fewer small businesses to offer health insurance to their \nemployees. According to Kaiser, in 2002, 58 percent of our Nation's \nsmallest businesses, those with less than 10 employees, offered health \ninsurance. In 2004, only 52 percent were able to offer their employees \nhealth insurance. Today, just 48 percent of our smallest businesses are \nnow able to offer health insurance as a workplace benefit. As you can \nsee, that is a 10 percentage point reduction over the past 5 years. \nClearly, we are heading in the wrong direction.\n  Further compounding the problem is the fact that small group \ninsurance markets exhibit no real competition. No competition means \nhigher costs. And higher costs mean no health insurance. I recently \nrequested a Government Accountability Office report, which revealed a \nstaggering consolidation in the State small group insurance markets. \nToday, the five largest carriers now have more than a 75 percent market \nshare in 26 States--and control 98 percent of the small group market in \nMaine.\n  This trend is simply unacceptable and represents nothing short of a \ncrisis--and one that can and must be fixed, now. In the Senate, I have \nbeen a longstanding champion of small business health plans and I have \nintroduced legislation in the past two Congresses that would allow \nsmall businesses to ``pool'' together, across State lines, and offer \nuniform health insurance plans to their employees, at significantly \nlower costs.\n  I firmly believe that small business health plans are a critical \nsolution to the small business health insurance crisis. It is a matter \nof simple fairness. Just like larger businesses and unions, I believe \nsmall businesses should have the option to purchase health plans across \nState lines with uniform benefits packages. It would allow them to shop \nfor affordable, quality plans with much lower administrative costs \nwhile at the same time drastically shrinking the ranks of the nearly 47 \nmillion Americans living without health insurance.\n  Moving forward this year, we need to leave no stone unturned in our \nsearch for solutions to this crisis. For example, we should examine \nways to use the Tax Code as a mechanism for increasing access to health \ncare, including through ``pooling mechanisms, and injecting competition \ninto the State small group insurance markets. This is why I am \ncurrently working with a number of my colleagues in the Senate, on both \nsides of the political aisle, to forge a bipartisan bill that will pass \nthe Senate and be signed into law. Senate Finance Committee Chairman \nBaucus has announced that we will soon consider health care legislation \nin the Finance Committee--and I look forward to a robust productive \ndebate there. I also thank Senator Enzi for all of his tremendous \nefforts in getting legislation passed through the HELP Committee last \nyear, and for having that legislation considered on the Senate floor \nfor the first time ever.\n  Frankly, now is a time for action, not words. It is incumbent upon \nthis Congress to think ``outside of the box'' to solve this crisis. We \nneed to consider all options on the table, including a number of \nrecently passed State reforms. We are at a critical juncture on this \nissue. The United States has the greatest health care system in the \nworld, and yet nearly 47 million Americans are uninsured. Our goal \nought to be providing health care access for all, and that means \ngreatly expanding coverage so that we can significantly reduce our \nNation's uninsured.\n  We must figure out how to solve the persistent criticisms that have \nmired small business health insurance legislation in Congress. We must \naddress how to allow health insurers to provide lower cost products to \nsmall businesses across State lines while maintaining the most widely \naccepted and necessary benefits and services. We must tackle questions \nof how to ``rate,'' or price, these products--and also how this can be \ndone in a uniform manner, without jeopardizing consumer protections. \nAnd we can and we must do all this without injuring existing health \ninsurance markets in the States. Plain and simple, Congress must bring \nup small business health insurance legislation this year, in a \nbipartisan, comprehensive way that can secure significant bipartisan \nsupport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/23/senate-section/article/S4838-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4838-S4839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS WEEK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last week we joined together in the \naftermath of the tragic killings at Virginia Tech to mourn and support \nthe families of the victims and the Virginia Tech community. This week \nwe join together once again to commemorate National Crime Victims' \nRights Week.\n  Yesterday marked the official beginning of National Crime Victims' \nRights Week. Since 1981, communities in Vermont and across the Nation \nhave observed this week through candlelight vigils and public rallies \nto renew our commitment to crime victims and their families. It is \nimportant, especially during this time of national sorrow, that we \nrecognize the needs of crime victims and their family members and work \ntogether to promote victims' rights and services.\n  We have been able to make some progress during the past 26 years to \nprovide victims with greater rights and assistance. In particular, I \nhave been honored to support passage of the Victims of Crime Act of \n1984, VOCA, Public Law 98-473, which established the Crime Victims \nFund, ``the Fund.'' The fund allows the Federal Government to provide \ngrants to State crime victim compensation programs, direct victim \nassistance services and services to victims of Federal crimes. Nearly \n90 percent of the fund is used to award State crime victim compensation \nand victim assistance formula grants. These\n\n[[Page S4839]]\n\nVOCA-funded victim assistance programs serve nearly 4 million crime \nvictims each year, including victims of domestic violence, sexual \nassault, child abuse, elder abuse, and drunk driving, as well as \nsurvivors of homicide victims. Our VOCA-funded compensation programs \nhave helped hundreds of thousands of victims of violent crime.\n  The Crime Victims Fund is the Nation's premier vehicle for supporting \nvictims' services. It bears repeating that the Crime Victims Fund does \nnot receive a dime from tax revenue or appropriated funding. Instead, \nit is made up of criminal fines, forfeited bail bonds, penalties, and \nspecial assessments.\n  Since fiscal year 2000, Congress has set a cap on annual fund \nobligations expressly for the purpose of ensuring ``that a stable level \nof funding will remain available for these programs in future years.'' \nThe ``rainy day'' fund created by this spending cap has been used to \nmake up the difference between annual deposits and distributions three \ntimes during the past 7 years.\n  The future of the fund is being threatened, however. After 26 years \nof progress, the Bush administration is proposing to rescind all \namounts remaining in the fund at the end of fiscal year 2008. That \nwould leave the fund with a balance of zero going into fiscal year 2009 \nand create a disastrous situation for providers of victims' services. \nOver the last few years, the Senate has successfully blocked several \npast attempts by this administration to rescind the fund's remaining \nbalance and has supported the retention of all amounts deposited into \nthe fund. Over the past 6 years, the Bush administration has squandered \nrecord surpluses and racked up $8.5 trillion in Federal debt. It is \nwrong to try to pay for its failed fiscal policies by emptying out the \nCrime Victims Fund. These resources are appropriately set aside to \nassist victims of crime.\n  In order to preserve the fund once again, Senator Crapo and I, joined \nby more than a dozen other Senators are sending a letter this week to \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee asking that the committee oppose \nthe administration's proposal to empty the Crime Victims Fund and, \ninstead, permit those amounts to remain in the fund, in accordance with \nlaw, to be used for the important programs and services needed by crime \nvictims.\n  Also, last week the Vermont Department of Corrections received a \n$400,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice to implement a \nStatewide Automated Victim Information and Notification, SAVIN, system \nto provide timely notifications to crime victims who request it. \nPrograms like these give crime victims some peace of mind and \nfacilitate communication among the courts and corrections and other law \nenforcement officials.\n  We need to renew our national commitment to crime victims. The Senate \ncan help by recognizing the importance of the Crime Victims Fund and \nsupporting its essential role in helping crime victims and their \nfamilies meet critical expenses, recover from the horrific crimes they \nendured, and move forward with their lives. I urge Senators on both \nsides of the aisle to honor our longstanding commitment to crime \nvictims by working together to commemorate victims of crime and to \npreserve the Crime Victims Fund.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/23/senate-section/article/S4839-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 CONGRATULATING DR.

It is especially fitting that we \nrecognize this organization during National Small Business Week.\n  The NSBA can trace its founding back to DeWitt M. Emery, a determined \nsmall business owner struggling to keep his business running in the \nmidst of the Great Depression. As owner of the Monroe Letterhead \nCorporation in Akron, OH, Mr. Emery labored to keep his small business \nrunning while feeling burdened by the increasing cost of doing \nbusiness--including higher material costs and wages.\n  Frustrated by the lack of support for small businesses in national \npolitics, and inspired by an idea to make his and his peers' voices \nheard, Mr. Emery founded the National Small Business Men's Association \non November 13, 1937. One hundred sixty small business owners out of \n200 who received Mr. Emery's recruitment letter joined the organization \nthat now boasts a reach of over 150,000 small businesses.\n  In keeping with the organization's responsiveness to the ever-\nchanging small business climate, and to be more inclusive of the \ngrowing number of women small business owners, the group changed its \nname in 1962 to the National Small Business Association.\n  In 1986, the organization changed its name again to National Small \nBusiness United when it joined with Small Business United, or SBU, a \nrival organization that started 5 years earlier. SBU and its member \ngroups, such as the Smaller Business Association of New England, or \nSBANE, helped establish the current organization's vast network of \nsmall business affiliates. After the merger, the new organization \nbecame responsible for running the SBANE-created Washington \nPresentation. In addition to SBANE, some of the other NSBA affiliates \nare the Arizona Small Business Association, the Small Business \nAssociation of Michigan, Missouri Merchants and Manufacturers \nAssociation, SMC Business Councils, Council of Smaller Enterprises and \nSmall Business California. Thanks to its strong affiliates NSBA has \nemerged as a vibrant grassroots organization.\n  In 2003, the oldest small business advocacy group changed its name \nback to the National Small Business Association. Through its name \nchanges and merger, the organization's commitment to representing small \nbusiness owners has been unwavering, and today's group boasts a wide \nvariety of members from carpenters to investors, from manufacturers to \ngrocers. NSBA truly represents the diversity of our Nation's small \nbusinesses. As chairman of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I work with NSBA's members in my State and across the \nNation, welcoming their insights and unique perspective.\n  I find it important to note that today's small business owners \nstruggle with some of the same issues that plagued Mr. Emery in 1937, \nand many new issues. From access to capital to health care, we will \ncontinue to work with small businesses as they strive to maintain and \ngrow their firms--and as they make a significant contribution to our \neconomy. Through the efforts of advocacy groups like the NSBA working \nwith us to pass legislation, we have been able to assist thousands of \ndetermined small business owners like Mr. Emery. The tireless work of \nthe NSBA is testament to the resolve and spirit of small business \nowners, and I am gratified that the current organization leads the \ncharge on many important issues. I invite the Senate to join me in \nhonoring NSBA and its distinguished history of nonpartisan work on \nbehalf of small businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/23/senate-section/article/S4840-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMs. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1257.

A bill to provide grants to States to improve high schools \nand raise graduation rates while ensuring rigorous standards, to \ndevelop and implement effective school models for struggling students \nand dropouts, and to improve State policies to raise graduation rates, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes of the \nSenate's time to talk about a bill that I introduced, along with \nSenator Burr and Senator Kennedy, entitled the Graduation Promise Act \nof 2007, or GPA.\n  This bill would create a Federal-State-local partnership to improve \nthe Nation's graduation rates and help transform our lowest performing \nhigh schools. This is a bill we just introduced today.\n  I thank Senator Burr and Senator Kennedy for their commitment to \nimproving our high schools and for increasing graduation rates in this \ncountry. I am very pleased to be working with both of them on this \nlegislation. I am also very glad that GPA, this legislation we have \nintroduced, is supported by the Alliance for Excellent Education, by \nthe Center for American Progress, by Jobs for the Future, by the \nNational Council of La Raza, by First Focus, and many other education \ngroups.\n  Nearly 20 years ago, the Nation's Governors met for the first \neducation summit and, as far as I know, for the only national education \nsummit in our country's history. They met with the first President Bush \nin Charlottesville, VA. They agreed to set high expectations for \neducation for the coming decade. That was the decade following 1989.\n  One of those standards they set was for an increase in high school \ngraduation rates to 90 percent by the year 2000. Today, we are not even \nclose to achieving that goal. In fact, the Nation's graduation rate has \nstagnated at around 70 percent instead of 90 percent. Graduation rates \nfor Hispanic and African-American students are lower than that. In my \nhome State of New Mexico, by some estimates, the graduation rate is \nless than 60 percent in some high schools.\n  Many students are entering the ninth grade significantly behind in \ntheir reading and mathematics skills. They are ill-prepared to master \nthe challenges of the typical high school curriculum. Not surprisingly, \nthese students are more prone to academic failure and grade retention \nand, accordingly, the dropout rates among these students are \ndisturbingly high, specifically in the ninth grade.\n  But low graduation rates are only one broad indicator of the crisis \naffecting our Nation's high schools. Even if a student makes it to \ngraduation, only a third of all students who enter the ninth grade will \ngraduate with the skills and the knowledge necessary to go on to \ncollege or to succeed in the modern workplace. They are not receiving \nthe kind of quality education that permits a seamless transition to a \njob or postsecondary education. Again, this problem disproportionately \naffects minority students. Only 16 percent of Hispanic students and 23 \npercent of African-American students graduate prepared for college, \ncompared to 40 percent for other students.\n  This situation is simply unacceptable. In the global technology-based \neconomy we live in today, a high school diploma is a minimum \nqualification for most jobs in our fastest growing sectors. The United \nStates ranks 19th in high school graduation rates among major \nindustrial democracies.\n  The Federal Government recognized that investments in early childhood \nand elementary grades are critical to a student's academic growth and \nsuccess. Still, attention and resources must be sustained throughout \nthe middle and high school years as well if the national goal of \nleaving no child behind is to be met. Unfortunately, we have not been \ndoing this. Only about 8 percent of all title I dollars go to our high \nschools today.\n  Our continued economic security hinges on preparing our young people \nto enter college and to enter the 21st century workforce. In fact, our \nnational security depends on it.\n  Fortunately, research has come to light that will help us to better \nunderstand the factors behind the low graduation and student \nperformance data. For instance, we can identify the high schools that \nare producing the majority of dropouts in this country. These schools--\nroughly 2,000 schools I am referring to--represent about 15 percent of \nall high schools in the country, and they have persistently low rates \nof graduation and low rates of grade promotion.\n  If we look at the typical senior class at one of these high schools, \nit will have decreased in size by at least 40 percent since the \nstudents entered the school 4 years earlier. These high schools are in \nevery State. They tend to be concentrated in urban areas, and they \nserve more than a third of our African-American and Hispanic students \nnationwide. Unfortunately, there are 23 of these high schools in my \nhome State of New Mexico.\n  Research has also shed light on the specific factors that allow us to \npredict who is going to drop out of high school. We can identify with \nup to 80 percent accuracy the future dropouts as early as the ninth \ngrade. We can do so by looking at such predictors as course failure, \npoor attendance, behavior problems, and retention in earlier grades. \nStudents who enter high school significantly lagging behind in their \nacademics and who show signs of becoming disengaged from the school are \nprone to drop out unless additional support is put in place.\n  Finally, research-based solutions with solid evidence of success are \ntransforming of our high schools with low graduation rates. \nRestructuring schools into smaller, more personalized learning \nenvironments ensures that students become engaged from the time they \nenter the ninth grade on. Sustained efforts to boost attendance ensure \nthey will not fall further behind.\n  Schools that have combined these efforts with a high-quality \ncurriculum and structural improvements have been very successful at \nimproving student performance and improving graduation rates. They have \ndone so with transitional math and English for ninth graders that will \nhelp them catch up by offering challenging curricula and tangible \ncontextual applications of\n\n[[Page S4844]]\n\nlearning in order to rekindle the interests of these students and \ncreating teaching teams, targeting professional development for the \nteachers to help them meet this challenge. A combination of these \ninterventions has improved student performance and increased graduation \nrates. We know this problem can be solved to meet the goal.\n  This legislation has been introduced by Senators Burr and Kennedy, \nand I hope very much this legislation and many of its provisions can be \nincluded when we get to a markup of the No Child Left Behind \nlegislation later this year.\n  I submit we cannot afford to let the estimated 2,000 failing high \nschools continue to push students off the path to prosperity. \nCollectively, these schools serve about 2.4 million students. We need \nto ensure for the continued prosperity of the country that these \nstudents remain in school and graduate with the skills needed to become \nproductive citizens.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1185\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Graduation Promise Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) In general.--The terms ``local educational agency'', \n     ``secondary school'', and ``State educational agency'' have \n     the meanings given the terms in section 9101 of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7801).\n       (2) Graduation rate.--The term ``graduation rate'' (except \n     when used as part of the term ``averaged freshmen graduation \n     rate'') has the meaning given the term in section \n     1111(b)(2)(C)(vi) of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(2)(C)(vi)).\n       (3) High-priority.--The term ``high-priority'', when used \n     with respect to a secondary school, means a school that--\n       (A) has low student achievement; and\n       (B)(i) has a low graduation rate; or\n       (ii) feeds students into a high school that has a low \n     graduation rate.\n       (4) High school.--The term ``high school'' means a \n     secondary school in which the--\n       (A) entering grade of the school is not lower than grade 6; \n     and\n       (B) highest grade of the school is--\n       (i) grade 12; or\n       (ii) in the case of a secondary school approved by a State \n     to issue a regular diploma concurrently with a postsecondary \n     degree or with not more than 2 years' worth of postsecondary \n     academic credit, grade 13.\n       (5) Institution of higher education.--The term \n     ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given the \n     term in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n     (20 U.S.C. 1001(a)).\n       (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Education.\n       (7) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n     States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin \n     Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau.\n\n      TITLE I--HIGH SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT AND DROPOUT REDUCTION FUND\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) About a third of our Nation's high school students fail \n     to graduate in 4 years, and another third graduate without \n     the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in college or the \n     workplace. The outcomes for minority students are even worse: \n     only about 52 percent of Hispanic, 56 percent of African-\n     American, and 57 percent of Native-American students graduate \n     on time, compared to 78 percent of white students.\n       (2) More than a decade after Congress declared a national \n     goal that 90 percent of American high school students \n     graduate from high school we are far from that target and \n     graduation rates have stagnated.\n       (3) Half of the Nation's dropouts attend a ``dropout \n     factory''-- schools where 40 percent or more of the freshman \n     class has disappeared by the time the students reach their \n     senior year. These schools, which are located in nearly every \n     State, primarily serve minority and poor students, and have \n     fewer resources and less qualified teachers than schools in \n     more affluent neighborhoods with larger numbers of white \n     students. In fact, almost half of African-American students \n     and nearly 40 percent of Latino students--compared to only 11 \n     percent of white students--attend high schools in which \n     graduation is not the norm.\n       (4) If the Nation's high schools and colleges raise the \n     graduation rates of Hispanic, African-American, and Native-\n     American students to the levels of white students by 2020, \n     the potential increase in personal income across the Nation \n     would add, conservatively, more than $310,000,000,000 to the \n     United States economy.\n       (5) If the high school graduation rate for male students \n     increased by just 5 percent, the Nation could save almost \n     $5,000,000,000 a year in reduced spending on crime-related \n     expenses such as prisons and medical costs for victims. An \n     additional $2,700,000,000 could be generated in income if \n     these high school graduates went on to college at the same \n     rate as other male students.\n       (6) A high school diploma is increasingly important for \n     success in the 21st century economy. In fact, an estimated 80 \n     percent of current jobs and approximately 90 percent of the \n     fastest-growing, highest-paying jobs require some sort of \n     education beyond high school.\n       (7) The Nation spends more than $1,400,000,000 a year to \n     provide remedial courses to community college students who \n     recently completed high school. And that figure does not \n     include the almost $2,300,000,000 that the economy loses \n     because students who take remedial courses, particularly in \n     reading, are more likely to leave college without getting a \n     degree, and thereby reduce their earning potential. Across \n     the Nation, 42 percent of community college freshmen and 20 \n     percent of freshmen in 4-year institutions enroll in at least \n     1 remedial course.\n       (8) Business and higher education consistently report that \n     students are leaving high school unprepared for the demands \n     of college and the workplace. According to a survey of the \n     National Association of Manufacturers, more than 80 percent \n     of manufacturing companies are experiencing a shortage of \n     qualified workers. More than two-thirds of manufacturing \n     companies said that businesses train employees to raise basic \n     skills, a sure sign that a high school education is deficient \n     even for the few jobs that require nothing further. Forty \n     percent of employers considered graduates deficient in their \n     overall preparation for the workplace.\n       (9) For decades, Federal funding has largely been spent on \n     grades Pre-K to 6 and higher education, with dramatically \n     less given the middle and high school grades. While children \n     in their early years must build a strong foundation for \n     learning, research also clearly demonstrates the need to \n     continue the investment at each stage of the education \n     process or risk losing much of the benefit of the early \n     effort.\n       (10) The United States has made some progress in education \n     outcomes in the early years of education and in higher \n     education, but has seen decline in the middle and high school \n     years. In terms of demonstrating return on investment, where \n     Federal educational commitment has been made, positive \n     outcomes have resulted.\n       (11) Only 8 percent of title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) \n     participants are high school students, leaving millions of \n     title I-eligible, high school students in low-performing \n     schools without the focused support, external assistance, and \n     resources for improvement that title I was created to \n     provide. Because title I funds serve as the trigger for \n     school improvement requirements in the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965, this also means that most \n     low-income, low-performing high schools are not required to \n     (or supported to) implement school improvement activities.\n       (12) While the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) includes a strong focus on \n     identifying low-performing schools, America still needs a \n     comprehensive strategy to support and improve chronically \n     low-performing schools and districts. School improvement \n     strategies should be tailored based on a variety of \n     indicators and data, so that educators can create and \n     implement successful school improvement strategies to address \n     the needs of the individual schools.\n       (13) Most districts and State educational agencies do not \n     necessarily have the capacity or infrastructure to guide, \n     support, and fund school improvement strategies where they \n     are needed, but good models for turning around low-performing \n     high schools do exist. Federal support should be used to \n     build this capacity based on evidence from successful high \n     schools.\n       (14) If the Nation is to maintain and increase its \n     competitiveness in the global economy, it must invest in a \n     systemic approach to improving its high schools so that every \n     child graduates prepared for success.\n\n     SEC. 102.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) With close to a third of our Nation's high school \n     students failing to graduate in 4 years, and another third \n     graduating without the skills and knowledge needed to succeed \n     in college or the workplace, new models of high school are \n     clearly needed, especially for struggling students who are \n     not on track to a high school diploma.\n       (2) Researchers have identified leading indicators that, \n     taken together, are as much as 85 percent predictive of which \n     9th graders will not graduate from high school 4 years later.\n       (3) In the 2000 high schools nationwide with estimated 4-\n     year graduation rates of 60 percent or lower, 80 percent of \n     the 9th graders are significantly behind in skills or \n     credits. By a conservative estimate, this adds up to not \n     fewer than 500,000 students who are not on track to \n     graduation.\n       (4) Poor outcomes for struggling students are endemic in \n     cities, towns, and rural areas across the country. Graduation \n     rates for students who are not on-track to an on-time \n     graduation in ninth grade are as low as 20 percent.\n       (5) Schools designed to accelerate students' learning and \n     get them on track to a college-ready diploma make a \n     difference. The Early College High School Initiative has \n     started 130 schools serving approximately 16,000 students in \n     23 States. Early results indicate that in the first programs \n     to graduate students, over 95 percent earned a high school \n     diploma, over 57 percent earned an associate's degree, and \n     over 80 percent were accepted at a 4-year college\n       (6) Most States and districts have limited capacity to \n     expand and spread proven practices and models for improving \n     graduation rates within a high standards environment.\n       (7) The Nation's young people understand the value of \n     education and will persist, often against considerable odds, \n     to further their education. From 1980 to 2002, a period of \n     time with no discernible increase in the country's graduation \n     rates, the percentage of 10th graders aspiring to a \n     bachelor's degree or higher increased from 40 percent to 80 \n     percent, with the largest increase among low-income youth.\n       (8) Young people who fall behind and drop out of high \n     school often report that they regret leaving and wish they \n     had been encouraged and supported to work harder while they \n     were in school. Many persevere despite a lack of school \n     options or pathways designed to help them succeed. Close to \n     60 percent of dropouts eventually earn a high school \n     credential--in most cases a GED certificate. Almost half of \n     these students--44 percent--later enroll in 2-year or 4-year \n     colleges, but despite their efforts fewer than 10 percent \n     earn a postsecondary degree.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to facilitate the development and implementation of \n     effective secondary school models for struggling students and \n     dropouts; and\n       (2) to build the capacity of State educational agencies, \n     local educational agencies, nonprofit organizations, and \n     institutions of higher education to implement effective \n     secondary school models for struggling students and dropouts.\n\n     SEC. 202.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Frontrunner States have begun to move more aggressively \n     on the dual challenge of raising high school graduation rates \n     while also raising the standards to the level of a college \n     and work-ready diploma.\n       (2) Seven States are publically reporting 4-year cohort \n     graduation rates and 20 States plan to publically report by \n     2008.\n       (3) Thirteen States now require students to take a college-\n     and work-ready course of study to earn a diploma, up from \n     just 3 in 2006. Another 16 States report that they plan to \n     raise requirements during 2007.\n       (4) States that act aggressively to raise graduation rates \n     without conceding ground on academic proficiency are gaining \n     traction in such cutting- edge policy areas as: dual \n     enrollment to support early college high schools that lead to \n     high school diplomas and 2 years of postsecondary credit; \n     expanding high school accountability to include indicators to \n     reward schools for keeping struggling students in school and \n     on track to proficiency; the development of new secondary \n     educational options, including both small school models and \n     recovery or alternative models for struggling students and \n     dropouts.\n       (5) Even frontrunner States have not yet adopted a \n     comprehensive set of policies to support high standards and \n     high graduation rates. They lack the supports and resources \n     to track implementation of the policies they have put in \n     place or to partner with districts to build further capacity \n     to carry out evidence-based practices and programming.\n       (6) Past Federal educational initiatives have been \n     effective in supporting and accelerating bolder, more \n     strategic action with positive results, for example the \n     National Science Foundation State Systemic Initiative.\n       (7) Supporting frontrunner States to become laboratories of \n     innovation and models for other States will accelerate the \n     number of young people graduating from high schools across \n     the Nation who are college and career ready.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) provide incentives for States to strengthen and develop \n     new State policies in order to substantially raise the \n     graduation rate in the State while ensuring rigorous \n     secondary education content standards and assessments; and\n       (2) evaluate the effectiveness of such changes to the State \n     policies.\n\n     SEC. 302. SYSTEMIC INITIATIVE TO IMPROVE HIGH SCHOOL \n                   GRADUATION RATE.\n\n       (a) Grant Program Authorized.--The Secretary is authorized \n     to award grants, on a competitive basis, to States that meet \n     the requirements of section 303 to enable such States to \n     design and align State policies in order to act as \n     laboratories of innovation by reducing barriers and creating \n     incentives to improve outcomes for high school students.\n       (b) Number of Grants; Duration.--\n       (1) Number of grants.--For each of the first 3 consecutive \n     years of the grant program under this title, the Secretary \n     shall award 4 or more grants under this title, except that \n     the Secretary shall award a total of not more than 20 grants \n     under this title for all 3 such years.\n       (2) Duration of grant.--Each grant awarded under this title \n     shall be for a period of 5 years.\n\n     SEC. 303.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     title $40,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and the 4 succeeding \n     fiscal years.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, while many measures are being taken at \nthe Federal, State and local levels to improve student achievement in \nAmerica, our high school students are still being left behind. High \nschool students continue to lag in both math and reading. In 12th \ngrade, less than a quarter of students scored proficient or better on \nthe math assessment, and only 35 percent were proficient or better on \nthe reading assessment.\n  Furthermore, Federal funding is not currently going to the high \nschools that are in the most need. The main source of Federal funds is \nthrough the title I program. Yet only 8 percent of students who benefit \nfrom these funds are in high school. Ninety percent of high schools \nwith very low graduation rates have many low-income students.\n  The statistics on high school graduation rates are staggering. About \n1,000 high schools across the country only graduate half their \nstudents, and only about 70 percent of high school students graduate on \ntime. Among African Americans and Latinos, only 55 percent graduate on \ntime. It is clear that high schools need more assistance in supporting \nand retaining students.\n  The continued partnership between local, State and the Federal \nGovernment is essential in improving secondary education in America. \nThat is why the Graduation Promise Act provides the necessary funding \nto improve the capacity of low-performing high schools, decrease \ndropout rates and increase student achievement. The act speaks directly \nto the root of the problem, providing support to high schools and \nmiddle schools to both assist and retain students who may have fallen \nbetween the cracks.\n  The Graduation Promise Act would make great strides in helping high \nschool students achieve to their fullest potential. The act would \nprovide $2.5 billion to build capacity for secondary school \nimprovement, and at the same time provide States and local school \ndistricts with the resources to ensure high schools with the greatest \nchallenges receive the support they need to implement research-based \ninterventions.\n  Research shows that we can identify students who are most at-risk for \nnot completing high school as early as sixth grade. With early \nintervention, quality teachers, small classes, and\n\n[[Page S4852]]\n\ndata-driven instruction we can ensure that these students make \nprogress, stay in school and succeed.\n  The act assists these efforts by supporting the development and \ndissemination of highly effective secondary school models for students \nmost at risk of being left behind. It would also strengthen state \nimprovement systems to identify, differentiate among, and target the \nlevel of reform and resources necessary to improve low-performing high \nschools, while ensuring transparency and accountability. Finally, the \nact would support states' continuing efforts to align State policies \nand systems to meet the goal of college and career-ready graduation for \nall students.\n  Bringing our schools into the 21st century is the ultimate goal of \nthis important piece of legislation. Local schools, States and the \nFederal Government must continue to work together to modernize the \npractices and models that are being used to ensure success from all of \nour high school students. Updating the system for the current times is \na difficult process, but with the assistance of the Graduation Promise \nAct, all high school students can be given the tools necessary to \nsucceed both in school and beyond.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Bingaman and Senator Burr, for their \ngood work on this initiative and their leadership on this issue. I look \nforward to working with them on this and many other important issues as \nwe move forward with the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Act. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 1186. A bill to amend the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \nControl Act of 1974 to provide for the expedited consideration of \ncertain proposed rescissions of budget authority; to the Committee on \nthe Budget.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleague in \nthe other body, Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, in introducing the \nCongressional Accountability and Line-Item Veto Act of 2007. \nCongressman Ryan and I belong to different political parties, and \ndiffer on many important issues. But we do share at least two things in \ncommon--our hometown of Janesville, WI, and an abiding respect for \nWisconsin's tradition of fiscal responsibility.\n  The measure we are each introducing today would grant the President \nspecific authority to rescind or cancel congressional earmarks, \nincluding earmarked spending, tax breaks, and tariff benefits. This new \nauthority would sunset at the end of 2012, ensuring that Congress will \nhave a chance to review its use under two different Administrations \nbefore considering whether or not to extend it. While not a true line-\nitem veto bill, our measure provides for fast-track consideration of \nthe President's proposed cancellation of earmarks. Thus, unlike current \nlaw, it ensures that for the specific category of congressional \nearmarks, the President will get an up or down vote on his proposed \ncancellations.\n  There have been a number of so-called line-item veto proposals \noffered in the past several years. But the measure Congressman Ryan and \nI propose today is unique in that it specifically targets the very \nitems that every line-item veto proponent cites when promoting a \nparticular measure, namely earmarks. When President Bush asked for this \nkind of authority, the examples he gave when citing wasteful spending \nhe wanted to target were congressional earmarks. When Members of the \nHouse or Senate tout a new line-item veto authority to go after \ngovernment waste, the examples they give are congressional earmarks. \nWhen editorial pages argue for a new line-item veto, they, too, cite \ncongressional earmarks as the reason for granting the President this \nnew authority.\n  That is exactly what our bill does. It provides the President with \nnew expedited rescission authority--what has been commonly referred to \nas a line-item veto--to cancel congressional earmarks. The definitions \nof earmarks that we use are the very definitions upon which each house \nhas agreed in passing legislation earlier this year.\n  Unauthorized congressional earmarks are a growing problem. By one \nestimate, in 2004 alone more than $50 billion in earmarks were passed. \nThere is no excuse for a system that allows that kind of wasteful \nspending year after year, and while I have opposed granting the \nPresident line-item veto authority to effectively reshape programs like \nMedicare and Medicaid, for this specific category, I support giving the \nPresident this additional tool.\n  Under our proposal, wasteful spending doesn't have anywhere to hide. \nIt's out in the open, so that both Congress and the President have a \nchance to get rid of wasteful projects before they would become law.\n  The taxpayers--who pay the price for these projects--deserve a \nprocess that shows some real fiscal discipline, and that's what we are \ntrying to get at with this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows\n\n                                 S. 118\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the life and \nachievements of Arkansas native George Howard, Jr., who died Saturday, \nApril 21, 2007 at Jefferson Regional Medical Center in Pine Bluff, AR. \nHoward, a remarkable lawyer and civil-rights leader, was Arkansas's \nfirst black Federal judge. I am pleased to honor his legacy today by \nintroducing legislation to designate the Pine Bluff Federal building \nand courthouse the ``George Howard, Jr. Federal Building and United \nStates Courthouse.''\n  Judge Howard will be remembered for a number of remarkable \nprofessional accomplishments. He was named by President Carter to a \nlifetime appointment as U.S. District Court Judge for Arkansas's \nEastern and Western districts in 1980. Prior to taking office as a \nFederal judge, Mr. Howard worked as an attorney in private practice and \nserved as President of the State Council of Branches of the NAACP.\n  He graduated from law school at the University of Arkansas at \nFayetteville in 1954. Though not the first black student to graduate \nfrom the U of A law school, he was one of the earliest and was the \nfirst black student to live in campus housing. Judge Howard also served \nin the U.S. Navy during World War II.\n  His hard work, dedication to his country and profession, and historic \ncontribution to the State of Arkansas should be celebrated and \nremembered. For this reason, I urge the Senate to adopt this \nlegislation honoring Judge George Howard, Jr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/23/senate-section/article/S4855-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 165--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF REPRESENTATIVE JUANITA \n                   MILLENDER-MCDONALD, OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, \nMr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mr. Brown, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nBunning, Mr. Burr, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. \nCasey, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nColeman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Craig, \nMr. Crapo, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, \nMr. Durbin, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Graham, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Hutchison, \nMr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nKerry, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, \nMr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lugar, \nMr. Martinez, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Mikulski, \nMs. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nelson of \nNebraska, Mr. Obama, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, \nMr. Salazar, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \nSmith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Sununu, \nMr. Tester, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thune, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \nWarner, Mr. Webb, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Sullivan \n     Charitable Trusts and the Progress Investment Associates, \n     through which numerous economic development and social \n     services programs have been developed and funded;\n       Whereas, in 1963, in response to a lack of job \n     opportunities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Reverend \n     Sullivan led more than 400 ministers in a successful boycott \n     that opened up more than 4,000 jobs for African-Americans;\n       Whereas, Reverend Sullivan met the need for job training by \n     establishing the Opportunities Industrialization Center, \n     which has grown to more than 75 training centers throughout \n     the Nation;\n       Whereas, recognizing the need to take his struggle to \n     alleviate the plight of the poor abroad, in 1969 Reverend \n     Sullivan established Opportunities Industrialization Centers \n     International, which has grown to more than 40 centers in 16 \n     African nations, Poland, and the Philippines;\n       Whereas, when Reverend Sullivan saw the need to create a \n     broader array of programs in Africa, he established the \n     International Foundation for Education and Self-Help, which \n     has conducted numerous initiatives, including Schools for \n     Africa, fellowship programs, and innovative teacher and \n     banker training programs since 1988;\n       Whereas, in 2001, the Leon H. Sullivan Foundation was \n     established posthumously to support Reverend Sullivan's \n     life's mission through the work of his many established \n     organizations;\n       Whereas, the Leon H. Sullivan Foundation presents the \n     biennial Leon H. Sullivan Summits in Africa, which have \n     provided a forum for leaders of African nations together with \n     more than 18,000 African-Americans and Friends of Africa to \n     interact with their counterparts and produce programs to meet \n     the needs of the poor and disadvantaged in African nations;\n       Whereas, in 1977, Reverend Sullivan helped to promulgate \n     the Sullivan Principles, a code of conduct for human rights \n     and equal opportunity for companies operating in South \n     Africa, and the Sullivan Principles helped end apartheid in \n     South Africa;\n       Whereas, Reverend Sullivan expanded on the Sullivan \n     Principles in 1999, by creating the Global Sullivan \n     Principles, which encourage corporate social responsibility \n     and promote global human rights and political, economic, and \n     social justice;\n       Whereas, more than 250 governments, corporations, and \n     universities on 5 continents have endorsed the Global \n     Sullivan Principles since their initiation;\n       Whereas, 10 African heads of state endorsed the Global \n     Sullivan Principles at the Leon H. Sullivan Summit in Abuja, \n     Nigeria, in July 2006;\n       Whereas, plans for the 8th Leon H. Sullivan Summit in \n     Tanzania in 2008 include broader regional endorsement of the \n     Global Sullivan Principles among African nations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the life of the Reverend Leon H. Sullivan;\n       (2) salutes the positive impact of the Reverend Sullivan's \n     achievements domestically and internationally; and\n       (3) encourages the continued pursuit of Reverend Sullivan's \n     mission to help the poor and disenfranchised around the \n     world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/23/senate-section/article/S4855-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4855-S4856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 903.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study \n     Abroad Foundation Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 3502. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to President George W. Bush, ``America's \n     leadership and national security rest on our commitment to \n     educate and prepare our youth for active engagement in the \n     international community.''.\n       (2) According to former President William J. Clinton, \n     ``Today, the defense of United States interests, the \n     effective management of global issues, and even an \n     understanding of our Nation's diversity require ever-greater \n     contact with, and understanding of, people and cultures \n     beyond our borders.''.\n       (3) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission \n     on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program \n     pursuant to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations \n     and Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199). \n     Pursuant to its mandate, the Commission has submitted to \n     Congress and the President a report of its recommendations \n     for greatly expanding the opportunity for students at \n     institutions of higher education in the United States to \n     study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in developing \n     nations.\n       (4) Studies consistently show that United States students \n     score below their counterparts in other advanced countries on \n     indicators of international knowledge. This lack of global \n     literacy is a national liability in an age of global trade \n     and business, global interdependence, and global terror.\n       (5) By numbers ranging from 77 to more than 90 percent, \n     Americans believe that it is important for their children to \n     learn other languages, study abroad, attend a college where \n     they can interact with international students, learn about \n     other countries and cultures, and generally be prepared for \n     the global age, according to a December 2005 national survey \n     commissioned by NAFSA: Association of International \n     Educators.\n       (6) In today's world, it is more important than ever for \n     the United States to be a responsible, constructive leader \n     that other countries are willing to follow. Such leadership \n     cannot be sustained without an informed citizenry with much \n     more knowledge and awareness of the world than most Americans \n     currently possess.\n       (7) Study abroad has proven to be a very effective means of \n     imparting international and foreign-language competency to \n     students.\n       (8) In any given year, only approximately one percent of \n     all students enrolled in United States institutions of higher \n     education study abroad.\n       (9) Less than 10 percent of the students who graduate from \n     United States institutions of higher education with bachelors \n     degrees have studied abroad.\n       (10) Far more study abroad must take place in the \n     developing countries. Ninety-five percent of the world's \n     population growth over the next 50 years will occur outside \n     of Europe. Yet in the academic year 2004-2005, 60 percent of \n     United States students studying abroad studied in Europe, and \n     45 percent studied in four countries--the United Kingdom, \n     Italy, Spain, and France--according to the Institute of \n     International Education.\n       (11) The Final Report of the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (The 9/11 Commission \n     Report) recommended that the United States increase support \n     for ``scholarship, exchange, and library programs''. The 9/11 \n     Public Discourse Project, successor to the 9/11 Commission, \n     noted in its November 14, 2005, status report that this \n     recommendation was ``unfulfilled,'' and stated that ``The \n     U.S. should increase support for scholarship and exchange \n     programs, our most powerful tool to shape attitudes over the \n     course of a generation.''. In its December 5, 2005, Final \n     Report on the 9/11 Commission Recommendations, the 9/11 \n     Public Discourse Project gave the government a grade of ``D'' \n     for its implementation of this recommendation.\n       (12) Investing in a national study abroad program would \n     help turn a grade of ``D'' into an ``A'' by equipping United \n     States students to communicate United States values and way \n     of life through the unique dialogue that\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\n     takes place among citizens from around the world when \n     individuals study abroad.\n\n     SEC. 3503. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to significantly enhance the global competitiveness and \n     international knowledge base of the United States by ensuring \n     that more students in United States institutions of higher \n     education have the opportunity to acquire foreign language \n     skills and international knowledge through significantly \n     expanded study abroad;\n       (2) to enhance the foreign policy capacity of the United \n     States by significantly expanding and diversifying the talent \n     pool of individuals with non-traditional foreign language \n     skills and cultural knowledge in the United States who are \n     available for recruitment by United States foreign affairs \n     agencies, legislative branch agencies, and nongovernmental \n     organizations involved in foreign affairs activities;\n       (3) to ensure that an increasing portion of study abroad by \n     United States students will take place in nontraditional \n     study abroad destinations such as the People's Republic of \n     China, countries of the Middle East region, and developing \n     countries; and\n       (4) to create greater cultural understanding of the United \n     States by exposing foreign students and their families to \n     American students in countries that have not traditionally \n     hosted large numbers of American students.\n\n     SEC. 3504.

SULLIVAN\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 166, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 166) commemorating the lifetime \n     achievement of the Reverend Leon H. Sullivan.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today in support of a resolution \nhonoring the lifetime achievement of the Reverend Leon H. Sullivan. My \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, Senator\n\n[[Page S4862]]\n\nSpecter, has joined me as an original cosponsor of this resolution.\n  Tomorrow marks the 6-year anniversary of the passing of one of \nAmerica's great leaders. He was a man who changed the face of the \nworld, a man of faith who achieved his mission in life through concrete \naction as well as his preaching. His family, friends, and colleagues \nappropriately refer to him as a ``giant among men''--a colossal force \nwho helped overcome some of the greatest challenges of the 20th \ncentury. So I am honored to stand here today to acknowledge the \nextraordinary lifetime achievements of the late Reverend Leon H. \nSullivan.\n  Originally from West Virginia, Leon Sullivan grew up during the Great \nDepression while racial segregation still ruled the United States. He \nrecalled it as a time when all of the White children walked down the \nleft side of the street and all of the Black children walked on the \nright side of the street. It was a time when skin color often dictated \none's place in society. When Reverend Sullivan was an 8-year-old, he \nwas reprimanded for sitting at a drugstore counter and drinking a soda. \nA burly White man yelled at the young Leon: ``Stand on your own two \nfeet, you can't sit here.''\n  When we think of Leon Sullivan today as a man, as a reverend, and as \na leader, we think of his entire life, and his was a life of courage \nand compassion, a life of struggle and triumph, a life of faith and \nfamily--his own family and the human family--and, finally, his was a \nlife for others and for God.\n  When he was young and dealing with the kind of discrimination I just \ndescribed, that kind of experience kindled a fire within his heart, and \nLeon Sullivan made the decision to commit his life to fighting \nsegregation and injustice.\n  Throughout his teenage years, he found inspiration in the founding \ndocuments of the United States. He understood that the principle of \nequality expressed in the Declaration of Independence and the \nConstitution transcends skin color. He repeatedly defied tradition and \ndeliberately frequented restaurants, libraries, and shops where Blacks \nwere not welcome, often reciting passages from the Declaration of \nIndependence, fearlessly challenging racism and confronting prejudice \nwhere he found it.\n  After graduating from high school, Leon Sullivan was awarded an \nathletic scholarship to West Virginia State College, where he played \nfootball and basketball and also enjoyed the Kappa Alpha Psi \nfraternity.\n  After graduation, he was called to the ministry, a vocation that \nallowed him to address the religious needs of his people while \ncontinuing his fight against segregation and injustice. He moved first \nto Harlem, where he worked with the Reverend Adam Clayton Powell at the \nAbyssinian Baptist Church and attended Union Theological Seminary. He \nwas offered a position in Philadelphia and soon emerged as a powerful \nsource of inspiration as the pastor of the Zion Baptist Church, where \nhe focused on the temporal as well as the spiritual well-being of his \npeople.\n  He once said:\n\n       I felt that God did not just want people to have milk and \n     honey in heaven . . . He wanted them to have some ham and \n     eggs on earth. I believe that God just doesn't want you to go \n     to the pearly gates. He wants you to have a better life on \n     earth, and if you have a better life on earth and treat \n     people right, you'll get to the pearly gates.\n\n  As part of his ministerial role, Reverend Sullivan spoke eloquently \nabout social justice, calling on people to ``help the little man and \naid those who cannot survive on their own.'' For over a decade, he \nhelped and counseled hundreds of parishioners and others, but his \nrealization that racial segregation would prevent his vision from \nbecoming a reality led him to join the civil rights moment. He was one \nof the first civil rights leaders to recognize how the economic power \nof his people could be harnessed to promote the cause of racial \nequality. He created the Selective Patronage Movement, through which \n400 Black ministers in Philadelphia mobilized their parishioners to \nboycott businesses which practiced discrimination. Exercising economic \npower through the Selective Patronage Movement led to the opening of \nthousands of jobs in previously segregated companies in Philadelphia \nalone.\n  These victories inspired Sullivan to create the Opportunities \nIndustrial Utilization Center of America, the so-called OIC, which \nprovided and still provides today comprehensive training so that \nmotivated workers can be prepared to take advantage of opportunities \nopening up to them. As he said, ``Integration without preparation \nbrings frustration.'' Originally based in Philadelphia, the OIC \ncaptured the attention of President Lyndon Johnson, who worked directly \nwith Reverend Sullivan to improve the infrastructure and efficiency of \nthe organization and ultimately bring it to the national stage. Today, \nOIC America has chapters in 30 States and has helped thousands of \nAfrican Americans achieve success through its emphasis on self-reliance \nand self-improvement.\n  The nationally recognized success of OIC led the chairman of General \nMotors to approach Reverend Sullivan about serving on the GM board of \ndirectors. The Reverend accepted the offer and served for over 20 years \nas the first African American on the GM board.\n  His service to GM brought him face to face again with racism, this \ntime in the international arena. Reverend Sullivan traveled to South \nAfrica, where he was targeted as a troublesome visitor because of his \nmeetings with anti- apartheid organizers. As he was leaving the \ncountry, he was stopped at the airport and strip-searched. Reverend \nSullivan, the pastor of one of the largest churches in the United \nStates, a director of General Motors, stood there in his underwear and \nasked the White officials in charge why this was happening.\n  The official said, ``I am doing to you what I have to do.''\n  Reverend Sullivan replied: ``When I get back, I am going to do to you \nwhat I have to do.''\n  What Leon Sullivan did was bring the economic power of corporate \nAmerica on the heads of those who supported apartheid in South Africa. \nUnder what came to be known as the Sullivan Principles, hundreds of \nmultinational corporations publicly opposed racism and discrimination \nin South Africa. When the statement of principle failed to change the \nstatus quo fast enough, Reverend Sullivan raised the stakes. In his \nwords: ``I threatened South Africa and said in 2 years Mandela must be \nfreed, apartheid must end and blacks must vote or else I will bring \nevery American company I can out of South Africa . . . ''\n  His efforts eventually evolved into a full campaign of disinvestment \nby hundreds of companies and by institutional investors holding \nhundreds of billions of dollars in corporate stock. And it worked. \nApartheid collapsed, and Nelson Mandela went from prisoner to head of \nstate.\n  Reverend Sullivan's work continued long after the end of apartheid. \nIn 1999, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan invited him to deliver a \nspeech at the United Nations, expanding his moral code of corporate \nsocial responsibility into the internally accepted Global Sullivan \nPrinciples.\n  Beyond this, he led a campaign to rescue African children from the \noverall lack of schools, infrastructure, hospitals and security.\n  Reverend Sullivan said of children:\n\n       Children do not get here on their own . . . They didn't ask \n     to be here . . . They didn't ask who their mothers or fathers \n     would be or the situations in which they were born. So what \n     society has to do is reach and get the most out of that child \n     you can . . .\n\n  What I and so many others admired most about the Reverend Leon \nSullivan was his compassion for those truly in need. He called those of \nus who are able to stand on our own feet and improve ourselves, while \nalways protecting the helpless.\n\n  Now I stand in this Chamber, on the floor of the Senate, to honor the \nenergy and compassion of this great man dedicated to his noble causes. \nI have only touched on a few of the many contributions to our Nation \nand our world. These examples illustrate his unique ability to fight \ndiscrimination and injustice across the globe. From childhood until his \ndeath, Leon Sullivan believed in the future and demonstrated a \nrelentless optimism regardless of the obstacles that tried to prohibit \nsuccess. He characterized his life's work by saying:\n\n       I would not be doing what I am doing if I weren't \n     optimistic about it. I'm reaching\n\n[[Page S4863]]\n\n     into a barrel and taking out a little hand at a time, not a \n     whole lot . . . but if enough hands go down in the next \n     fifty, seventy-five, hundred years, we'll clean out that \n     barrel.\n\n  As we know, when so many of us pass on, most good people do, in fact, \nleave a legacy of family and close friends. Reverend Sullivan certainly \ndid that. With us today is his family, represented by his daughter Hope \nand his friends and colleagues, many who worked with him for decades. \nBut Leon Sullivan left a legacy far beyond family and friends. The Zion \nBaptist Church remains a bastion of faith and good works in north \nPhiladelphia. OIC of America and OIC International continue to prepare \nthousands for productive, well-paying jobs. The International \nFoundation for Education and Self-Help trains students for careers \nranging from teaching to banking. The Sullivan Charitable Trust and \nProgress Investment Associates carries on his economic and real estate \ndevelopment initiatives. The Leon Sullivan Foundation presents its \nbiannual summit meeting in Africa, encouraging cooperation between \nAfrican Americans and countries and leaders throughout the continent of \nAfrica. The Global Sullivan Principles serve as a beacon for corporate \nsocial responsibility and human rights throughout the world. South \nAfrica, the nation that Reverend Sullivan helped free from apartheid, \nstill struggles, yet stands as a shining example of what people \nspeaking truth and wielding moral force can do in our world.\n  For all this and so much more that remains unsaid today, we honor the \nRev. Leon Sullivan--today and always.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nthereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 166) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 166\n\n       Whereas, the late Reverend Leon H. Sullivan dedicated his \n     life to alleviating the plight of the poor and the \n     disadvantaged in America and worldwide;\n       Whereas, Reverend Sullivan received numerous honors and \n     awards during his lifetime, including recognition by LIFE \n     magazine in 1963 as one of the 100 outstanding young adults \n     in America, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1992, and \n     the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights in 1999;\n       Whereas, having dedicated 37 years of his ministerial \n     vocation to the historic Zion Baptist Church of Philadelphia, \n     Reverend Sullivan's leadership and innovation led to the \n     creation of one of the largest congregations in the Nation \n     during his time;\n       Whereas, in 1966, as part of his 10-36 Plan to encourage \n     individuals to invest in the economic future of their \n     communities, Reverend Sullivan founded the Leon H. Sullivan \n     Charitable Trusts and the Progress Investment Associates, \n     through which numerous economic development and social \n     services programs have been developed and funded;\n       Whereas, in 1963, in response to a lack of job \n     opportunities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Reverend \n     Sullivan led more than 400 ministers in a successful boycott \n     that opened up more than 4,000 jobs for African-Americans;\n       Whereas, Reverend Sullivan met the need for job training by \n     establishing the Opportunities Industrialization Center, \n     which has grown to more than 75 training centers throughout \n     the Nation;\n       Whereas, recognizing the need to take his struggle to \n     alleviate the plight of the poor abroad, in 1969 Reverend \n     Sullivan established Opportunities Industrialization Centers \n     International, which has grown to more than 40 centers in 16 \n     African nations, Poland, and the Philippines;\n       Whereas, when Reverend Sullivan saw the need to create a \n     broader array of programs in Africa, he established the \n     International Foundation for Education and Self-Help, which \n     has conducted numerous initiatives, including Schools for \n     Africa, fellowship programs, and innovative teacher and \n     banker training programs since 1988;\n       Whereas, in 2001, the Leon H. Sullivan Foundation was \n     established posthumously to support Reverend Sullivan's \n     life's mission through the work of his many established \n     organizations;\n       Whereas, the Leon H. Sullivan Foundation presents the \n     biennial Leon H. Sullivan Summits in Africa, which have \n     provided a forum for leaders of African nations together with \n     more than 18,000 African-Americans and Friends of Africa to \n     interact with their counterparts and produce programs to meet \n     the needs of the poor and disadvantaged in African nations;\n       Whereas, in 1977, Reverend Sullivan helped to promulgate \n     the Sullivan Principles, a code of conduct for human rights \n     and equal opportunity for companies operating in South \n     Africa, and the Sullivan Principles helped end apartheid in \n     South Africa;\n       Whereas, Reverend Sullivan expanded on the Sullivan \n     Principles in 1999, by creating the Global Sullivan \n     Principles, which encourage corporate social responsibility \n     and promote global human rights and political, economic, and \n     social justice;\n       Whereas, more than 250 governments, corporations, and \n     universities on 5 continents have endorsed the Global \n     Sullivan Principles since their initiation;\n       Whereas, 10 African heads of state endorsed the Global \n     Sullivan Principles at the Leon H. Sullivan Summit in Abuja, \n     Nigeria, in July 2006;\n       Whereas, plans for the 8th Leon H. Sullivan Summit in \n     Tanzania in 2008 include broader regional endorsement of the \n     Global Sullivan Principles among African nations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the life of the Reverend Leon H. Sullivan;\n       (2) salutes the positive impact of the Reverend Sullivan's \n     achievements domestically and internationally; and\n       (3) encourages the continued pursuit of Reverend Sullivan's \n     mission to help the poor and disenfranchised around the \n     world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/23/senate-section/article/S4863-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4863-S4864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE AMERICAN NATIONAL RED CROSS GOVERNANCE MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1681, which was \nreceived from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1681) to amend the Congressional Charter of \n     The American National Red Cross.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased the Senate is considering \nH.R. 1681, the American National Red Cross Governance Modernization Act \nof 2007. The Judiciary Committee approved and the Senate passed our \nversion of this bill last month, and I look forward to approving the \nRed Cross Governance bill again with the House-passed language. I want \nto thank my colleagues, Senator Grassley and Senator Kennedy, for their \nhard work on this issue and for introducing this important bill. I also \nwant to congratulate the American Red Cross on appointing a new \nPresident and CEO last week. Mark W. Everson, currently the \nCommissioner of Internal Revenue was approved unanimously by the Board \nof Governors to head the American Red Cross, effective next month. I \ncongratulate him on his appointment and thank current Chairwoman, \nBonnie McElveen-Hunter for her dedicated leadership.\n  Just last week we had the opportunity to see the importance of the \nRed Cross and the good work they are doing on behalf of our citizens. \nIn response to the horrific shootings on Virginia Tech's campus, the \nAmerican Red Cross mobilized their local chapter and provided 200-300 \nhot meals to rescue workers and police officers and ensured that Red \nCross mental health workers were available to students, faculty and \nfamily members. I am glad the Senate and House have worked together to \npass this bill to enhance the American Red Cross' governance structure \nso they can better provide these crucial services in all emergencies.\n  Since its founding by Clara Barton in 1881, the American Red Cross \nhas provided essential relief services to those affected by famine, \nfloods and natural and manmade disasters. Last year alone, the American \nRed Cross responded to approximately 75,000 disasters with the help of \nmore than one million volunteers and thirty-five thousand employees. As \na key participant in the United States' disaster relief plan, the \nAmerican Red Cross is charged with helping the United States prevent, \nprepare and respond to national emergencies. Over the past several \nyears, however, the American Red Cross has been strained by disasters \nof an unparalleled scope; the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \nthe December 2004 Asian tsunami and the 2005 hurricane season that \nincluded the enormously destructive hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. \nThese events all challenged the Red Cross's ability to respond to \ndisasters quickly and effectively.\n  In order to improve its disaster relief services, the American Red \nCross's Board of Governors unanimously voted\n\n[[Page S4864]]\n\nto accept recommendations given by an independent advisory board, which \nexamined the American Red Cross's governance structure and practices. \nH.R. 1681 reflects these recommendations and would improve the American \nRed Cross's governance structure by centralizing and reorganizing its \ninfrastructure. Some notable enhancements include reducing its board \nsize from 50 members to 20 in order to facilitate emergency action, \ngiving the board all the powers in governing and managing the American \nRed Cross, and establishing a Presidential Advisory Council composed of \neight to ten principal officers of the executive departments and senior \nofficers of the Armed Forces to provide governmental input and support. \nAdditionally, the modernized charter would enhance congressional \noversight and transparency by creating an Ombudsman who would provide \nan annual report to Congress articulating any concerns of volunteers, \nemployees, donors, clients and the public. The House adopted two \namendments to the Senate-passed language that would clarify and ensure \nthat the chapters of the American Red Cross are geographically and \nregionally diverse and that the American Red Cross will reach out to \nlocal charitable and faith-based organizations when providing relief \nservices in local communities. These improvements to the bill make no \nstatutory changes and I hope my colleagues will support them.\n  According to the American Red Cross's end of the year report, \nHurricane Katrina created a record of 1.4 million families, or around 4 \nmillion people, who needed emergency assistance such as food, clothing \nand other necessities. My wife, Marcelle, was one of hundreds of \nthousands of volunteers dedicated to providing these essential relief \nservices to victims of Katrina. No one knows when the next disaster \nwill strike. Congress must do everything in our power to ensure that \nthe American Red Cross can continue and improve upon the essential \nhumanitarian work on which the United States and the world relies. I \ncommend the Red Cross for taking important action to reform itself and \nI urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1681) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/23/senate-section/article/S4864-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 2007\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.
