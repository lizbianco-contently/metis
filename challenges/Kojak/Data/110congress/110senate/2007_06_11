Mr. President, we have spent 2 weeks on the immigration \nbill, and we listened to hour after hour of debate. I don't think there \nis a single Senator, no matter how one may have finally voted on the \nmotion to proceed or not to proceed to the bill, who doesn't see an \nurgent need to fix our badly broken immigration system. Even those \npeople who oppose this legislation vehemently believe the system is \nbroken and needs to be fixed.\n  So everyone agrees that we need to fix it, and I think the best way \nto fix it is to legislate. When it came time to vote on the bipartisan \ncompromise last Thursday, 7 Republicans joined with 38 Democrats to \ninvoke cloture. Let us put that in proper perspective. Fourth-fifths of \nDemocrats voted to proceed to complete this legislation, and one-\nseventh of the Republicans voted to proceed. That is 80 percent and 14 \npercent--80 percent of the Democrats said move forward and 14 percent \nof the Republicans said move forward. Eighty-six percent of the \nRepublicans said no.\n  Today, in an hour or so, I am going to send a letter to President \nBush to lay out my hope that we can still move forward on this \nlegislation, but I want him to know that further progress will require \nactive support from more Republicans, which is something he has to make \nsure his Republicans understand.\n  I see in today's Roll Call newspaper that one Republican Senator \nsaid: I think the Democrats are going to have to take care of most of \nthose votes, the newspaper article says. Without mentioning the \nSenator's name, the article states:\n\n       Put the onus on Democrats to make up the 15-vote deficit on \n     cloture, saying Republicans have nearly maxed out support \n     on their side.\n\n  This appears on page 24 of Roll Call: ``I think the Democrats are \ngoing to have to deal with most of those [votes],'' the Senator said.\n  Mr. President, 80 percent and 14 percent. It is the President's bill. \nSo if other Republican Senators feel the\n\n[[Page S7418]]\n\nsame as the Senator who is expressed on page 24 of Roll Call, saying we \nhave to overcome the 15-vote deficit, it won't happen. We have about \nmaxed out at 80 percent.\n  The letter I am going to send to the President will say a number of \nthings. Among other things, it will say:\n\n       A strong spirit of bipartisanship has held together the \n     coalition of Democrats and Republicans who negotiated the \n     compromise and has sustained the Senate through 2 full weeks \n     of debate on the bill. Unfortunately, that bipartisanship was \n     largely absent in a crucial vote last Thursday.\n\n  Then I will go on to state to the President the percentages I just \noutlined.\n  I further say in the letter to the President:\n\n       We appreciate the efforts of you and other Republicans who \n     have worked with us to get the bill this far. But we believe \n     it will take stronger leadership by you to ensure that \n     opponents of the bill do not block the path to final passage. \n     Simply put, we need many more than seven Republicans to vote \n     for cloture and final passage of the bill.\n\n  This letter will be signed by Senators Reid, Durbin, Schumer, and \nMurray, the Democratic leadership team.\n  I want to get the bill done. The overwhelming majority of the \nDemocratic caucus has already voted for cloture. The American people \nare certainly looking to Congress for leadership. We hope President \nBush and his Republican allies in Congress will find a way to work with \nus to deliver this bill to the immigrants, businesses, and all other \nAmericans who deserve it.\n  If we see new cooperation and a clear way forward from the Republican \ncaucus, I will do everything possible to readdress the immigration \nissue after the debate on the Energy bill is completed. And it is \ndifficult for me to even say this because I really wanted to move next \nto the Defense authorization bill. If we can work out something, when \nwe finish this Energy bill, to complete immigration, I want to do that.\n  Finally, Mr. President, on energy, we will turn our focus this week \nto one of the great remaining challenges of our time: our national \nenergy policy.\n  In 1931, Thomas Alva Edison had a meeting with Henry Ford, whose cars \nwere driving up consumer demand for gasoline. This is what Edison told \nFord:\n\n       I'd put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source \n     of power! I hope we don't have to wait until oil and coal run \n     out before we tackle that.\n\n  Here it is, 76 years later--76 years later--and we haven't tackled \nour addiction to oil, and it has grown into a three-pronged crisis: \nthreatening our economy, threatening our Nation's security, and \nthreatening our environment.\n  Today, we will use 21 million barrels of oil and tomorrow the same. \nHow much is 21 million barrels of oil? It is a ditch 10 feet deep and \n200 football fields long or a ditch 10 feet deep and 11 miles long. \nEvery day, we use that oil--every day.\n  The bill we begin debate on today--the Renewable Fuels, Consumer \nProtection Energy Efficiency Act of 2007--takes several major steps \ntoward reducing our dependence on foreign oil, promoting renewable \nenergy that we produce right here in America, and protecting our \nenvironment from global warming. This bill is a substitute to H.R. 6. \nThis bill is a bipartisan bill.\n  A number of my chairmen came to me and said: We have this great \nlegislation in my committee; can we bring it forward? I said: No, we \nhave to have an energy bill; our initial energy bill has to be \nbipartisan. So the Energy Committee, under the direction of Senators \nBingaman and Domenici, came up with a good package. That is part of \nwhat we are going to be debating in the Senate.\n  Then, in the Commerce Committee, Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye \nalso came up with an extremely important piece of legislation dealing \nwith CAFE standards, which is making cars more efficient. That is going \nto be in the bill to be brought to the floor.\n  Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe also worked together to come up with \nanother piece of legislation that we have put in this one bill. Their \npart of this bill is also excellent and deals with green buildings and \nmaking the massive fleet of Federal cars more energy efficient. It is a \ngood piece of legislation, and it is a bipartisan bill.\n  There will be people wanting to put tax measures on this, but I think \nwe should wait until the tax committee--Senators Baucus and Grassley--\ndoes that. This is a bill which we should try to protect the bipartisan \naspect of. It really is quite a good bill, and if we are able to pass \nit, we will save 4 million barrels of oil every day. That is pretty \ngood.\n  This bill will set new energy efficiency standards for lighting, \nappliances, and water use. This bill alone will save \\1/2\\ trillion \ngallons of water every year. For a place like Nevada, where we get 4 \ninches of rain every year in Las Vegas, that is a lot of water.\n  This is a bill which protects consumers by punishing companies that \nprice gouge and manipulate supply for their profits. It is a bill which \ninvests in carbon capture and storage, and it directs the President and \nhis Cabinet to improve diplomatic relations with our energy partners in \norder to give us more leverage in the global energy market.\n  Altogether, this bill will save American consumers tens of billions \nof dollars every year, cut our oil consumption, reduce our dependence \non foreign energy, and, by the way, might just save the planet while we \nare at it.\n  It is a good, important bill, a bipartisan bill, and as I have \nindicated, many of my colleagues will be tempted to offer tax \namendments. I ask that they wait until the Finance Committee has had an \nopportunity to make recommendations on an energy tax amendment before \nany additional amendments are offered on this bill.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote in favor of the motion to proceed. In \nfact, I hope we can proceed to the bill immediately and not have to use \nthe 30 hours. That will allow time for more amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7418-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, just a brief word about the immigration \nbill. We could have been wrapping it up tonight.\n  As I indicated to my good friend, the majority leader, on Thursday \nafternoon, I thought there was every reason to believe we could have \nfinished the immigration bill by tonight. Instead, we ended up having \nanother cloture vote--in my view, a day or two premature--taking Friday \noff, and today spending our time on a meaningless resolution giving the \nPresident advice about whom the Attorney General ought to be.\n  Having said that, I appreciate the comments of the majority leader \nthat he would like to finish the immigration bill. There is a \nsubstantial number of Republican Senators who believe this bill would \nbe an improvement over the current situation, over the status quo, and \nso I hope we will be able to chart a path to get us back on track at \nsome point and hopefully complete, on a bipartisan basis, what could \nwell be the most important domestic achievement of this Congress.\n  I am pleased to hear the majority leader say there is a possibility \nthat we could get back to this measure and wrap it up.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the issues \nsurrounding\n\n[[Page S7419]]\n\nthe removal of eight U.S. attorneys last year. Attorney General \nGonzales has claimed that he had no involvement in the firing of the \nU.S. attorneys. In fact, this is his statement. He said:\n\n       I was not involved in seeing any memos, was not involved in \n     any discussions about what was going on. That's basically \n     what I knew as the Attorney General.\n\n  That is really a stunning claim. His own Chief of Staff, Kyle \nSampson, admitted the Attorney General misled the country. He is not \nalone. Kyle Sampson, former Chief of Staff to the Attorney General, \nsaid:\n\n       I don't think the Attorney General's statement that he was \n     not involved in any discussions . . . was accurate. I \n     remember discussing with him this process of asking certain \n     U.S. attorneys to resign.\n\n  The Washington Post reported, on Michael Battle, the former Director \nof the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, and I quote from that \nstory:\n\n       The former Justice Department official who carried out the \n     firings of eight U.S. attorneys last year told Congress . . . \n     that a memo on the firings was distributed at a November 27 \n     meeting attended by Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales.\n\n  NBC News reported on William Mercer, the Acting Associate Attorney \nGeneral:\n\n       Justice Department official William W. Mercer told \n     congressional investigators on April 11 that he attended a \n     meeting with the Attorney General . . . to discuss ``fired \n     U.S. Attorney Carol Lamm's situation.''\n\n  It is simply not credible that the Attorney General of the United \nStates had no role in the removal of eight U.S. attorneys. After all, \nhe is the head of the Justice Department. To his credit, the Attorney \nGeneral did eventually admit that he had misspoken in describing his \nlack of involvement. Given the growing public record, I don't think he \nhad much choice.\n  However, to the great disappointment of people on both sides of the \naisle, the Attorney General failed miserably in his attempt to set the \nrecord straight. In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, the Attorney General used the words, ``I don't recall,'' or \na variant on those words, 64 times. ``I don't recall,'' ``I don't have \nany recollection,'' ``I have no memory''--64 times. Some counts have \nthat number at over 70. Some even approach 90.\n  Time after time, the Attorney General was unable to respond to even \nbasic questions. He couldn't explain or couldn't remember why the U.S. \nattorneys were fired or how he was involved. Again, his performance was \ntruly stunning. His inability or refusal to answer basic questions \nraises serious issues. Is he incompetent or is he simply playing the \nloyal soldier? Why were these U.S. attorneys removed?\n  Unfortunately, the answer that immediately suggests itself is that \nthese firings were politically motivated. Let's look at some of the \nfired U.S. attorneys and the possible political reasons for their \ndismissal. Here we have them.\n  David Iglesias, New Mexico--there was a probe of Democrats not \ncompleted quickly enough. We had prominent Republicans complaining that \nhe had not reached conclusion on a probe of Democrats quickly enough.\n  Carol Lamm, in California--she secured the conviction of a Republican \nCongressman, also had indicted the No. 3 official at the CIA, and was \ninvestigating a Republican Congressman.\n  Daniel Ogden, Nevada--investigated a Republican Governor and former \nRepublican Congressman.\n  Bud Cummins in Arkansas--was replaced by a Karl Rove operative. He \ninvestigated a Republican Governor of Missouri.\n  John McCay, in Washington State--to the dismay of local GOP \npartisans, did not investigate the gubernatorial election won by a \nDemocrat.\n  Paul Charlton, Arizona--he investigated Republican Congressman Jim \nColby and Rick Renzi.\n  You start to connect the dots here. They said the reason these people \nwere removed was because of poor performance. At least that is the \nassertion of the Attorney General. But if you look at the written \nreviews of these same U.S. attorneys, ones who had been removed and \nones for whom you can find a clear partisan reason for their removal--\nlook at the written reviews of their performance, which is the reason \ngiven by the Attorney General for their removal.\n  David Iglesias, New Mexico, written review:\n\n       Respected by the judiciary, agencies and staff . . . \n     complied with department priorities.\n\n  Carol Lamm, California:\n\n       Effective manager and respected leader.\n\n  Daniel Ogden, Nevada:\n\n       Overall evaluation was very positive.\n\n  Bud Cummins of Arkansas:\n\n       Very competent and highly regarded.\n\n  John McCay, Washington State:\n\n       Effective, well-regarded and capable leader.\n\n  Paul Charlton, Arizona:\n\n       Well respected . . . established goals that were \n     appropriate to meet the priorities of the department.\n\n  What do we have here? The Attorney General says he wasn't involved. \nOthers of his own staff say he was involved. Then he says it was \nperformance reasons for which these people were removed, but if you \nlook at the written reviews of the people who were removed, their \nperformance reviews were excellent.\n  But what you do have is a clear political motivation in case after \ncase involving these U.S. attorneys. When you go back to the reason the \nAttorney General is giving now, that it is performance based, here is \nwhat the former supervisor of these prosecutors said:\n\n       Comey added that:\n       The reasons given for their firings have not been \n     consistent with my experience. . . .\n\n  And that:\n\n       I had very positive encounters with these folks.\n       Comey was effusive in his praise of several of the fired \n     prosecutors.\n\n  Comey was the Deputy Attorney General, and he described Paul Charlton \nof Arizona as `` one of the best.'' He said he had a very positive view \nof David Iglesias of New Mexico, and called Daniel Ogden of Las Vegas \n``straight as a Nevada highway and a fired-up guy.''\n  Of John McCay of Seattle, Comey said:\n\n       I was inspired by him.\n  Now, it doesn't take long to figure out what has happened. The \nAttorney General comes and testifies he can't recall, he doesn't \nremember, that he wasn't really a part of it. He is contradicted by his \nown staff. Then he says it is performance based, but the performance \nreviews are without exception positive for these people who have been \nfired. Their supervisor, who was Deputy Attorney General, has rave \nreviews for virtually all of them.\n  Let's connect the dots. These are politically motivated firings. I \ndon't know what other conclusion one can come to, and that is a very \nserious matter. I have been in the Senate for more than 20 years. I \nhave never come to the floor and raised questions about the political \nmotivation of an Attorney General--never. I do so now, and I do it \nbecause I believe this is a serious matter.\n  When the administration of justice becomes politically tainted in \nthis country, that is an enormously serious matter. There is no longer, \nin my mind, any question but that this Attorney General has tainted his \noffice. That is only further demonstrated by his late night visit to \nthe hospital bed of the Attorney General of the United States, at that \ntime John Ashcroft, to get him to sign documents that he refused to \nsign about the legality of certain actions of this administration.\n  We have seen enough. This Attorney General needs to leave his office. \nHe has tainted his office. He does not deserve the high responsibility \nand enormous honor serving as Attorney General of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7419-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7419-S7421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               MEDIA BIAS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, recently I returned from Iraq where I \nvisited Tikrit, Baghdad, Bamadi, and Balad with three of my \ncongressional colleagues. We had the opportunity to meet with the \ncommanding officers and troops on each location. On the floor of the \nSenate I spoke to you about witnessing firsthand some of the progress \nbeing made. Since I have seen so little coverage of that progress, I \nthink progress bears repeating.\n\n[[Page S7420]]\n\n  The new plan, the counterinsurgency plan, is showing initial signs of \nprogress. Violence in al-Qaim, Haditha, Hit, Ramadi, and Falluja has \ndramatically decreased due to local leaders now siding with coalition \nforces pursuing al-Qaida in Iraq.\n  In Baghdad, U.S. and Iraqi security forces are clearing and holding \nsome of the most dangerous areas, and sectarian violence has decreased.\n  I was especially impressed with the successes in Ramadi, where only a \nfew months ago some were claiming it lost forever, and al-Qaida said it \nwas going to establish its headquarters there. In April, attacks in \nRamadi decreased by 74 percent. All 23 tribal areas in Ramadi are \ncooperating with U.S. forces to fight al-Qaida militants, 263 weapons \ncaches were discovered in the preceding 3 months, and Iraqis are \nvolunteering by the thousands to join the Army and local police force.\n  I am disappointed this progress has not been widely covered by the \nmedia in the United States. In fact, the only TV coverage I have seen \nwas a 60-second clip by Nick Johnson of CNN, who did an excellent job. \nI see the LA Times had a story, ``Iraqi Tribal Chiefs Forming an Anti-\nInsurgent Party.''\n  The frustration at the failure of our media to call the successes \nwhat they were is very high. Earlier last week, my office received an \ne-mail from one of our troops serving in Iraq. He detailed an exciting \nsuccess story, the establishment of a new joint command precinct for \nIraqi police, Iraqi Army and Marines, the first such precinct \nheadquarters to be established in Falluja. His e-mail detailed what a \nsuccess the operation had been. Almost 200 Iraqis volunteered for \npolice recruitment, hundreds more received outpatient medical care, \ndamage claims were settled, and all present received food and oil \nrations. And the Iraqis seemed to be very pleased to be cooperating \nwith the United States.\n  But the enemy, being very clever, working to thwart any and all \nprogress, reacted to this success story by sending in some poor suicide \nbomber. Thanks to aggressive patrolling efforts by Iraqi forces, the \nbomber was forced to detonate his vest almost half a mile away when he \nwas halted by police. He caused superficial wounds to one Iraqi \ncivilian and killed himself. No one else was injured, no other damage \ncaused. In the aftermath of the incident the precinct signed up an \nadditional 75 recruits for police service.\n  As this American warrior wrote to us:\n\n       This bomber failed. He failed to kill innocents and he \n     failed to deter the progress of standing up Iraqi police.\n\n  But to his frustration there was no coverage of this good news story. \nIndeed, the media, the U.S. media totally misreported the story. A \nnumber of media outlets carried these headlines. From the Baltimore \nSun, ``Attack on Iraq Police, At Least 20 Dead.''\n  From the Los Angeles Times, ``Twenty Iraqis Die in Suicide Attacks.''\n  Our correspondent wrote that he was shocked. He checked it out every \nway he could, but it appears to have been a false report. The headlines \nrefer to the failed attack but depicted a dramatically different \noutcome. There has been no apparent retraction, so thousands upon \nthousands, maybe hundreds of thousands who saw the headline assumed yet \nanother tragic incident occurred in Falluja and just lumped that in \nwith all the other bad news that makes up a grim picture of Iraq. And \nyou see why our men and women fighting over there are frustrated.\n  The following morning our correspondent found himself in another \nsituation. He learned a combined Iraqi Army police and U.S. Marine \npatrol in Falluja encountered a small band of insurgents at a suicide \nvehicle factory. The police engaged the enemy, killing four of them, \nand the Iraqi Army and Marines trapped additional escaping insurgents, \nkilling three more. Two large trucks laden with explosives and rigged \nto be suicide vehicles were found.\n  This was a best case scenario: enemy killed in his tracks, weapon was \ndiscovered before it caused any harm, there were no civilian casualties \nwhatsoever, and U.S. demolition forces blew up the two suicide \nvehicles. Instead of celebrating this success, the e-mail noted--the \nwriter noted it was disappointing to read a headline, ``Children \nKilled.''\n  According to the story, the U.S. tank fired a high-explosive round at \ninsurgents placing an IED in Fallujah yesterday, killing three Iraqi \nchildren. The insurgents got away. To anyone watching the news that \nday, it would seem the war in Iraq is being lost and the terrorists are \nwinning. While there has been significant progress in Iraq, there is no \ndoubt we are losing the war of information. I couldn't have said it \nbetter than the young man who wrote my office in frustration, who said:\n\n       What incredible economy of effort the enemy is afforded \n     when U.S. media is their megaphone. Why spend precious \n     resources on developing your own propaganda machine when you \n     can make your opponent's own news outlets scream your message \n     louder than you ever hoped to do independently.\n\n  The young man ended his e-mail by saying the incidents he detailed \nwere very important to him and his comrades who were serving in Iraq. \nTypical of our brave warfighters, the young man stressed that he and \nhis fellow soldiers will continue to fight the fight. He acknowledged \nthere will be mistakes, setbacks, and casualties that the world will \nhear about, but there will also be successes, victories over enemy \ncombatants, progress, stability, and growth in the new Iraq, but, \ntragically, it appears no one is going to hear about that in our media \nsince it has been increasingly clear that our media is unwilling or \nable to report anything except bloody headlines and bad news. The U.S. \nGovernment has a responsibility to do a better job of public diplomacy, \nstrategic influence getting our story out.\n  The U.S. military has made a real difference in Iraqi communities. \nThere are examples of good stories, such as the local new precinct \njoint command headquarters. But somehow we are not doing an adequate \njob of spreading the news. Let me cite an example from today's \nWashington Post page A11: ``Tribal Coalition In Anbar Said To Be \nCrumbling.'' Well, I have missed it, perhaps, if I saw anything in the \nWashington Post about the coalition. About 23 sheiks in the tribal \nareas are cooperating with the United States. But when you read the \nstory a little farther, you see the headline is about one Sunni leader \nwho has great concern about another Sunni leader, and calls him a \n``traitor.'' Unfortunately, this happens to go on frequently among \ntribes.\n  When you read farther down in the story, we finally interview General \nPetraeus. General Petraeus said: I think they have done this for their \nlives. This is not just a business deal that they have struck; when you \noppose al-Qaida, you are putting it all on the line. This is not an \neconomic issue.\n  That was the message from our commander. He did not get the headline. \nThere was another member of the council who said that: The salvation is \nlike one family. There are no problems between us and the members.\n  U.S. military officials said virtually everyone in Anbar belongs to a \ntribe and that rather than ignore that fact, they were trying to \nexploit it.\n\n       There is an overlay of government structure and tribal \n     structure, and the two, when they work well, mesh and, in a \n     sense, complement each other in Anbar.\n\n  I was able to see an article, a TV story by Ollie North this past \nSunday, a war story. He was talking about the good old days in World \nWar II. If there was anything good about the old days in World War II, \nHollywood and the media were on the same side as our troops. What a \nwonderful vestige of the old times.\n  I thought this was a great opportunity to see what had happened in \nthe past. The war of ideas and public opinion is not just critical in \nIraq, it is critical in the broad war on terror.\n  As we know from reading the statements of Ayman al-Zawahari, the No. \n2 in command, he knows they cannot win the war militarily; they can win \nit only by influencing public opinion in the United States. \nUnfortunately, recent congressional action indicates the terrorists may \nnot be far off base. Resolutions to withdraw from Iraq, delaying \nfunding for the troops, telling the Sunni terror cells and the Shia \nmilitias that America's political will is wavering--the supporters of \nthese resolutions are sending a message: Hang on, the United States \nwill not have the political will to outlast them. Our men and women in \nuniform are right to be disheartened that we have not only the media \nbut some Members of Congress who are unduly influenced by our enemy. It \nis critical that we not fall into this trap set by al-Qaida and the\n\n[[Page S7421]]\n\nother Islamic terrorists who wish to defeat us. It is about time we \nrealize our brave men and women in Iraq are putting their lives on the \nline, they are under fire every day. They are fighting a battle and \nthey are making progress in the global war on terror. They need the \nfunds for equipment, which we finally passed to them, but they also \ndeserve our moral support and support in winning the hearts and minds \nnot only of the United States but of the world.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7421-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7421-S7426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NO CONFIDENCE RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will decide \nwhether to end debate on proceeding to Senate Joint Resolution 14, \nwhich expresses the sense of the Senate that the Attorney General no \nlonger holds the confidence of the Senate or the American people.\n  I rise to oppose this so-called no confidence resolution on both \nprocedural and substantive grounds and will urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst ending debate. To paraphrase Shakespeare, whether or not this \njoint resolution amounts to sound and fury, it signifies nothing. It is \nnothing more than a bit of political theater which should be rejected \nout of hand.\n  Let me make two points about its form and two points about its \nsubstance before offering a few comments about the controversy from \nwhich it arose. The first point I want to make about its form is that \nthis measure would express the sense or opinion of the Senate through a \njoint resolution. As opposed to regular Senate resolutions that require \nonly Senate passage, joint resolutions are legislative vehicles \nrequiring passage by both houses and signature by the President.\n  We use joint resolutions to propose constitutional amendments and \nsome other legislative business, but this legislative vehicle is simply \nthe wrong way to conduct non-legislative business such as expressing \nthe opinion of one house. In a report dated today, the Congressional \nResearch Service concludes that the form of this measure as a joint \nresolution is inappropriate for what it purports to do.\n  I think this is significant and the reason for this conclusion is \nobvious. If this joint resolution should somehow pass the Senate--which \nI certainly expect it will not--it will be sent to the House.\n  How on Earth can the House vote on the sense of the Senate? What \ncould a House vote about the Senate's opinion on this matter possibly \nmean? By a negative vote, would the House be saying that what the \nSenate has expressed as its own opinion is really not the Senate's \nopinion? This makes no sense whatsoever. In fact, the House already has \nits own resolution regarding the Attorney General's service, and it is \na regular House resolution.\n  The sponsors of S.J. Res 14 either do not understand or have \ndisregarded how the legislative process is supposed to work. I suspect \nit is the latter, using this political ploy to force the President's \ninvolvement.\n  Either way, this body should reject it out of hand.\n  The Senate has not used a joint resolution in the past on the rare \noccasion when it has sought to criticize executive branch officials. \nResolutions in the 109th Congress to censure the President or condemn \nremarks by a former Cabinet Secretary were Senate resolutions.\n  The resolution to censure the President introduced in the 106th \nCongress, offered by one of the cosponsors of today's joint resolution, \nwas a Senate resolution. Resolutions in the 81st and 82nd Congresses \ndemanding the resignation of Secretary of State Dean Acheson were \nSenate resolutions. The resolution to censure and condemn President \nJames Buchanan in 1862 was a Senate resolution. Our only attempt to \ncensure the Attorney General, back in 1886, was through Senate \nresolutions. This unprecedented use of a joint resolution would distort \nour legislative procedure, and I urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  The second point about the form of this measure is that it purports \nto be a no confidence resolution. Parliaments take no-confidence votes \nfor an obvious reason. In a parliamentary system of government, the \nlegislative body's confidence or support is necessary for the head of \ngovernment and cabinet ministers to serve.\n  For an equally obvious reason, the so-called no-confidence resolution \nbefore us should be rejected. This is not a parliament. In our \nPresidential system of government, the separation of powers means that \nthe chief executive is elected separately from the legislature, and \ncabinet officials such as the Attorney General serve at the pleasure of \nthe President.\n  Under the Constitution, the Senate's consent was required for the \nAttorney General's appointment, but our confidence is not required for \nthe Attorney General's continued service. The Attorney General serves \nat the pleasure of the President, not at the confidence of the Senate.\n  The separation of powers has been a casualty throughout the \ncontroversy concerning the removal of U.S. Attorneys that gave rise to \nthis misguided resolution. As with the Attorney General--and with very \nfew exceptions--U.S. attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President.\n  The U.S. attorney statute says that they are subject to removal by \nthe President. Neither the Constitution nor this statute say anything \nabout the confidence of the Senate for the continued service of \nofficials the President has authority to appoint.\n  The separation of powers, a principle fundamental to our \nconstitutional system itself, is becoming a casualty of partisan \npolitics.\n  The brand new Congressional Research Service report I mentioned \nearlier could not identify a single resolution like this one even being \noffered in the past and this should not be the first. No matter what \nits substance, a joint resolution is inappropriate for expressing the \nsense of the Senate about his issue. No matter what its form, a \nresolution expressing a lack of confidence in an executive branch \nofficial is inappropriate in our system of government.\n  Let me now address two points regarding the substance of this \ninappropriate joint resolution. The first point is about the real \npurpose behind its words. Even though expressing a lack of confidence \nin an executive branch official is irrelevant in our system of \ngovernment, we all know that the real purpose behind this resolution is \nto pressure the Attorney General to resign.\n  On the one hand, if its sponsors want to call for the Attorney \nGeneral's resignation, they should be honest and do so. On the other \nhand, Senators certainly do not need a resolution--especially one as \nfundamentally flawed and inappropriate as this one--to call for the \nAttorney General's resignation. As a number of this resolution's \nsponsors have already done, with the rapt attention and constant \nrepetition of a compliant media, Senators can demand the Attorney \nGeneral's resignation any time they choose.\n  My second point about the substance of this misguided joint \nresolution concerns its actual content, the words themselves.\n  This joint resolution does not condemn or criticize the Attorney \nGeneral for anything he has done or said. It does not call for his \ncensure. And, just to repeat, this joint resolution does not call for \nthe Attorney General's resignation.\n  In the past, the Senate has considered resolutions doing each of \nthese, albeit through regular Senate resolutions properly suited to the \ntask. But this joint resolution before us does not even contain a \nsingle ``whereas,'' clause offering any indication of the basis or any \nreason for what it says. Rather, this joint resolution speaks vaguely \nof ``holding confidence,'' as if this were an all-or-nothing \nproposition, as if this were some kind of a pass-fail test.\n  Even when parliaments take no-confidence votes, those votes are at \nleast limited to the confidence of parliament itself. This joint \nresolution purports to speak about all the confidence of all the \nAmerican people. But what could a ``yes'' or ``roll vote on such a \nresolution possibly mean? Would a ``no'' vote\n\n[[Page S7422]]\n\nmean that no American has any confidence in the Attorney General about \nanything?\n  Would a ``yes'' vote mean that every American has complete confidence \nin the Attorney General about everything?\n  Because neither one of those can possibly be true, a resolution \nworded this way is either seriously misguided or nothing but a \npublicity stunt. It is not focused on his job performance, or his \nleadership of the Justice Department, but is focused on the Attorney \nGeneral himself.\n  A resolution asking for a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote on something as \nvague and misdirected as confidence in a person attempts to reduce the \nmultifaceted and complex to the unilateral and simplistic. In doing so, \nthis misleading joint resolution turns a bit of political theater into \na theater of the absurd.\n  The Senate should not even consider such a resolution evoking the \nimage of Caesar listening for the chants of the crowd before giving a \nthumbs-up or a thumbs-down. Rather than purporting to speak for the \nAmerican people, I think we should let the American people speak for \nthemselves.\n  I found 16 opinion polls by nationally recognized polling outfits \nduring March and April asking Americans whether the Attorney General \nshould resign. These polls did not ask a vague, squishy question such \nas: Do you have confidence in the Attorney General? No these polls \nasked the real question behind the joint resolution before us today: Do \nyou think the Attorney General should resign? An average of 39 percent \nof Americans said ``yes.'' Only one poll showed bare majority \nresponding in the affirmative and, considering its margin of error, \neven that one might not show majority support for this result at all.\n  Frankly, I am a little surprised that the percentage of Americans who \nsay the Attorney General should resign is not higher. My Democratic \ncolleagues and many of their media allies, after all, have been working \nvery hard week after week after week to persuade our fellow citizens \nthat the Attorney General should go.\n  Daily front-page news coverage, Senate and House hearings, protests \nand lobbying by activists, blogs, columns, editorials--the Attorney \nGeneral's critics have been pulling out all the stops for 6 months now. \nAnd while the joint resolution before us suggests that this aggressive, \ncoordinated effort has deprived the Attorney General of everyone's \nconfidence about everything, only a little over a third of Americans \nthink he should resign. The Pew Research Center examined news coverage \nduring the week in March when the Attorney General gave a much-\ncriticized press conference. They found that the story about dismissed \nU.S. attorneys was the most reported story in the national media, with \ncoverage jumping eight fold from the previous week. In spite of that \nHerculean media effort, however, only about 8 percent of Americans said \nthis is the story they followed most closely.\n  These national polls are far better suited to measure what the \nAmerican people think than the joint resolution before us, and my \nDemocratic colleagues might want to consider another nugget of public \nopinion.\n  A USA Today/Gallup poll showed that while 38 percent of Americans \nbelieve that the Attorney General should resign, 40 percent of \nAmericans believe that Democrats in Congress are spending too much time \non this issue. Let me repeat that. More Americans say Democrats spend \ntoo much time on this issue than believe the Attorney General should \nresign. One reason might be that there is so little to show for the \neffort.\n  Just a few weeks ago, one of my distinguished Democratic colleagues \nsaid during a press conference that Democrats just know that U.S. \nattorneys were fired last year for improper reasons. How do Democrats \nknow this? Because they have any evidence for that conclusion?\n  No. My Democratic colleague had to admit that ``we don't have a \nsmoking gun.'' That is Washington political code for ``just take our \nword for it because we can't prove it.''\n  Just a couple of weeks before that, another distinguished Democratic \ncolleague told a gaggle of reporters after a Judiciary Committee \nhearing that he ``just knows'' someone in the White House ordered that \nthose U.S. attorneys be removed. Now, how does he know this? Because he \nhas any evidence for this conclusion? No. He too had to admit that ``of \ncourse we don't know that''\n  It is truly ironic that this controversy involves prosecutors. \nProsecutors must have some evidence to bring charges. Prosecutors must \nhave some evidence for a conviction. I just wish that some of my Senate \ncolleagues felt such an obligation either to prove their allegations or \nmove on to more important matters.\n  We have been investigating and probing the removal of those U.S. \nattorneys for 6 months. Dozens of staff in the Senate, the House, and \nthe Justice Department have done little else since the 110th Congress \nbegan. We have seen hearing after hearing, interview after interview, \nthousands of pages of documents, and even hundreds of thousands of \ntaxpayer dollars to hire outside law firms as reinforcements.\n  Democrats continue to authorize subpoenas not only for people who \nhave not refused to testify, but for people who have agreed to testify, \nand even for people who have already testified. And after all that, my \nDemocratic colleagues have to admit that they have no smoking gun, they \ncannot prove the accusations they continue to repeat. There are plenty \nof innuendos, caricatures, and characterizations. But repeating talking \npoints, sound bites and cliches is no substitute for evidence.\n\n  This summer, Americans will see sequels of several movies in the \ntheaters. Here in the Senate's political theater, we have already seen \nseveral sequels of the same movie. Last week's Judiciary Committee \nhearing, for example, was part five on the hiring and firing of U.S. \nattorneys. Every one of those same sequels has the same ending. It is \nno wonder more Americans believe that enough is enough than believe the \nAttorney General should resign.\n  Before I close, let me say a few words about the controversy that was \nthe impetus for this misguided joint resolution. As I said earlier, \nU.S. attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President. With very few \nexceptions, he may remove them for whatever reason he chooses. The \nPresident has the authority to remove a U.S. attorney to allow someone \nelse to serve in that position or because that U.S. attorney's \nperformance is, in some general or specific way, inadequate. Each of \nthe U.S. attorneys removed last year had served his or her 4-year term \nand had no right to serve longer if the President didn't want them to. \nThat means the real issue is whether these U.S. attorneys were removed \nfor genuinely improper reasons, such as interfering with an ongoing \ncase. After all this time, all this effort, and all this taxpayer \nmoney, there is no evidence for that conclusion.\n  I must candidly say, at the same time, that the process by which this \nadministration set out to evaluate U.S. attorneys and replace some of \nthem was bungled from the start. Proper respect for the office of the \nFederal prosecutor and for the individuals who occupy it would, it \nseems to me, require a more rigorous, disciplined, organized process \nthan apparently was used here. The Attorney General has said as much \nand said he should have been more involved. I also think the \nindividuals who were asked to resign deserve better, more respectful \ntreatment. But there is a high burden of proof for those who say that a \nbadly executed and explained process, even a poorly conceived and \nmismanaged process, was instead a nefarious, partisan, political scheme \nto subvert the justice system. Continuing to make such claims without \ncoming close to meeting that burden appears to many designed, instead, \nto serve partisan political goals.\n  As I close, I ask my colleagues to consider one more set of polls. \nDuring the same 2 months, March and April, as they were asking about \nthe Attorney General's resignation, national polling outfits also asked \nAmericans if they approve of the way Congress is doing its job. While \nan average of 39 percent of Americans believe the Attorney General \nshould resign, an average of 56 percent of Americans disapprove of how \nwe are doing our job. Should we all resign? I think there are some \npeople who probably would say yes. Far more Americans disapprove of \nCongress than believe the Attorney General should resign. I wonder \nwhether spending so\n\n[[Page S7423]]\n\nmuch time on fishing expeditions that yield no fish and wasting time on \ninappropriate, misleading resolutions such as the one before us today \nonly add to Americans' disapproval of our job performance.\n  In a statement last Friday, the main sponsor of this joint resolution \nsaid the vote on this resolution is about loyalty. I suppose he meant \nloyalty to the President, as if that were the only reason to oppose \nusing the wrong vehicle for a misleading statement that has no \nrelevance to our system of government. In a way, I agree this is about \nloyalty, but I think it is about loyalty to the Constitution, to the \nintegrity of the legislative process, to this body as an institution, \nand to a fair and honest debate about these issues. If my colleagues \nare loyal to those, they will see that this bit of absurd political \ntheater serves no real purpose and will only add to most Americans' \nalready negative view of how we are doing our job.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject this cloture motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to ask what the time allocation \nis because I wish to speak on the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The remaining 20 minutes is under the control \nof the majority.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, similarly reserving the right to object, \nI have been waiting. I wonder if we might have a unanimous consent \nagreement that I be permitted to speak for 10 minutes, unless the \nSenator from California wants to go first?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I might respond to that. Of course \nI want to cooperate, but I wish to use the 20 minutes of Democratic \ntime. I would be prepared to extend the time for morning business if \nthe Senators would agree to that.\n  Perhaps there could be a unanimous consent agreement that Senator \nSpecter is allowed 10 minutes, and I would be allowed the 20 minutes of \nDemocratic time, requiring an extension of 10 minutes of morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 18\\1/2\\ minutes and the \nRepublican time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the majority has 18\\1/2\\ minutes, and the \nminority has how much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, Mr. President, through the Chair to the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, say my \nsuggestion is we extend the time of morning business to accommodate the \nSenator's 10 minutes and my 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak about \nthe resolution of no confidence on Attorney General Gonzales. This \nresolution poses many currents and crosscurrents and many overlapping \ncurrents and crosscurrents. I have written down five of the currents \nwhich I believe are involved in the analysis of this issue.\n  First: Have I lost confidence in Attorney General Gonzales? Second: \nIs this resolution politically motivated? Third: Does Senator Schumer \nhave a conflict of interest? Fourth: Will this resolution likely lead \nto the departure of Attorney General Gonzales or give him more reason \nto stay on? And fifth: Is the principal reason for this resolution to \nhelp the Department of Justice or to embarrass Republicans? It is an \ninterrelationship and a wing of these various considerations which has \nled to my own conclusion on this resolution.\n  First of all, have I lost confidence in Attorney General Gonzales? \nAbsolutely yes. Attorney General Gonzales has made representations \nwhich are false. He said he was not involved in discussions. He was \ncontradicted by three of his top aides and by documentary evidence, e-\nmails. He said he was not involved in deliberations. Again, he was \ncontradicted by three top aides and documentary evidence, the e-mails. \nHe said he was not involved in the memoranda which were circulated on \nthis matter. Again, contradicted by three top aides and documentary \nevidence.\n  He said the terror surveillance program brought no objection within \nthe Department of Justice, and we find on examination there were \nserious dissents within the Department of Justice on the \nconstitutionality of the terrorist surveillance program. So much so \nthat Alberto Gonzales, when he served as White House counsel, was one \nof those who went to the hospital room of then-Attorney General John \nAshcroft to get Attorney General Ashcroft to certify that the program \nwas constitutional. So there is no doubt in my mind that there is no \nconfidence which is residing in Attorney General Gonzales.\n  This is much more than a personnel matter. This is a matter for the \nadministration of the Department of Justice, which is second only to \nthe Department of Defense on the welfare of the people of the United \nStates. The Department of Justice has the responsibility for \ninvestigating terrorism and antiterrorism, has the responsibility for \nenforcing our drug laws, has the responsibility for enforcing Federal \nlaws of violent crime and white-collar crime. The Attorney General has \nthe responsibility for supervising 93 U.S. attorneys from around the \ncountry who have very important positions, something that I know \nsomething about in some detail, since I was the district attorney of \nPhiladelphia for some 8 years. There is no doubt the Department at the \npresent time is in shambles.\n  The Attorney General called me before his hearing came up and asked \nfor my advice, and I said: Set out the reasons why you asked these \nindividuals to resign. Set out the reasons why. He did not do so. The \nday after a very tempestuous hearing in the Judiciary Committee, he \ncalled me again and asked for my advice as to what he ought to do. I \nsaid: Al, you still haven't responded as to why you asked these people \nto resign. I took the position at that time, and I take the position at \nthe present time, that I am not going to ask the President to fire \nAttorney General Gonzales. That is a matter for the President to \ndecide. I am not going to let the President tell me how to vote, and I \nam not going to say to him how he ought to run the executive branch on \ngrounds of separation of power. Similarly, with Attorney General \nGonzales, as to what he does, that is a personal decision for him to \nmake. But I have been very emphatic in the Judiciary Committee \nhearings, as we have investigated this matter, that I think the \nAttorney General has not done the job and that the Department of \nJustice would be much better off without him.\n  The second question I looked at is: Is this resolution politically \nmotivated? I think that it certainly is. This ties in to the \ncrosscurrent as to whether Senator Schumer has a conflict of interest. \nI believe he does. I said so to Senator Schumer eyeball to eyeball, \nconfronting him in the Judiciary Committee meeting. The day after New \nMexico's U.S. Attorney David Iglesias testified about a conversation \nthat Iglesias had with Senator Domenici, the Democratic Senatorial \nCampaign Committee posted on their Web site criticisms of Senator Pete \nDomenici. The following day, the Democratic fundraising apparatus, led \nby Senator Schumer, published a fundraising letter, and there is no \ndoubt about that conflict of interest. Senator Schumer has been \ndesignated to lead the investigation because he is the chairman of the \nrelevant subcommittee. So I think there is no doubt about the overtone \nof heavy politicization and the conflict of interest.\n  The third consideration I have is will this resolution likely lead to \nthe departure or give the Attorney General a reason to stay on? My \nhunch is the thrust of the resolution, if it seeks his ouster, is going \nto be a boomerang and is going to be counterproductive. My own sense is \nthere is no confidence in the Attorney General on this side of the \naisle but that the views will not be expressed in this format. Already, \nsome who have called for his resignation on the Republican side of the \naisle have said they will not vote for this resolution. Others who have \ndeclined to comment about his capacity have said that this is not the \nproper way to proceed, that our form of government does not have a no-\nconfidence vote.\n  Is the principal reason for this resolution to help the Department of \nJustice or to embarrass Republicans? I\n\n[[Page S7424]]\n\nthink clear cut, it is designed to embarrass Republicans. It is \ndesigned to embarrass Republicans if the Senate says the Senate has no \nconfidence in the Attorney General, and it is designed to embarrass \nRepublicans who vote against the motion for cloture because it will be \na ``gotcha'' 30-second commercial in later campaigns. It will be used \nto say that whoever votes against the motion to invoke cloture is \nsanctioning the conduct of Attorney General Gonzales, and anybody who \nvotes against the motion to invoke cloture is going to be the recipient \nof those 30-second ``gotcha'' commercials.\n  Now, there are many reasons to vote against the cloture motion. One \nreason--and a dominant reason--is that the Senate has a lot more \nimportant things to do than engage in this debate on this issue. \nThursday night, the majority leader took down the immigration bill. \nRegrettably, he had cause to because the Republican Senators who had \nobjected to the immigration bill wouldn't allow any amendments to come \nup. They wouldn't allow their amendments--they didn't step forward with \ntheir amendments, nor did they allow others to offer amendments. But we \nwere on the verge of getting a list. It was taking a little more time. \nThe majority leader took down the bill. But the national interest would \nbe a lot better served had we continued with the bill on Friday or \nperhaps on Saturday--we can work on Saturday--or return to the bill \ntoday--or still return to the bill today, instead of taking up this \nresolution.\n  Another reason why people could justifiably vote against cloture is \nbecause the investigation is not complete. That is still hanging fire, \nso why have the resolution before we finish our investigation?\n  But there is another reason: the Constitution arguably expresses a \nway to deal with Attorney General Gonzales, and that is by impeachment, \nas it is not in line to have a resolution of disapproval. That is the \nBritish system of no confidence. It is my sense that many on this side \nof the aisle, if not most, if not almost all--I ask unanimous consent \nfor 1 additional minute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is my sense that many on this side of the aisle--\nmost, if not almost all--will vote against cloture because there are \nample reasons to vote against cloture. But as I look at this matter, as \nto which is the more weighty, the more compelling, the more important, \ncandidly stating I have no confidence in Attorney General Gonzales or \nrejecting the outright political chicanery which is involved in this \nresolution offered by the Democrats, I come down on the side of the \ninterests of the country, and moving for improvements in the Department \nof Justice is to make a candid statement that I have no confidence in \nthe Attorney General, which I have said repeatedly. It is no surprise. \nI am going to deal with this resolution on the merits and vote to \ninvoke cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I don't often differ with the \ndistinguished ranking member. But I came to the floor as a member of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee now for 15 years and as one who takes no \nparticular pleasure in what I am about to say. I urge a ``yes'' vote on \ncloture. I want to say why.\n\n  The Department of Justice is one of the country's most important \ndepartments. It has a budget of $24 billion and over 100,000 employees. \nIt is charged with combating terrorism, fighting violent crime, \nstopping drug trafficking, upholding civil rights, and enforcing civil \nliberties. It houses key agencies, including the FBI, DEA, the Bureau \nof Prisons, the Marshals Service, and U.S. Attorney's Offices.\n  As a leader of the Department, the Attorney General is the chief law \nenforcement officer for the people of this Nation. He is the chief \nlawyer of the United States. He runs a big department. He must be a \nstrong manager who can direct the day-to-day operations and an \nindependent leader with an unyielding commitment to the law, who is \nwilling to stand up against, yes, even the President, if necessary. He \nmust lead by example, upholding the highest ethical standards.\n  I think President Lincoln's Attorney General put the challenge on the \nmap when he said this:\n\n       The office I hold is not properly political, but strictly \n     legal, and it is my duty above all other ministers of state \n     to uphold the law and to resist all encroachments from \n     whatever quarter.\n\n  That is the job of the U.S. Attorney General. The subject before us \ntoday is the fact that, for many of us, this Attorney General has not \nlived up to this standard, and he has lost our confidence. \nUnfortunately, the Attorney General has failed to meet the challenges \nduring his tenure.\n  The Department of Justice has become highly politicized in its hiring \nand firing--I hope to lay that out--and I believe in many of the legal \nopinions it issues as well. In many respects, it is today an extension \nof the White House, rather than the scrupulous, independent enforcer of \nFederal law as suggested by President Lincoln's Attorney General.\n  Through the investigation into the hiring and firing of at least 9 \nU.S. attorneys, we have heard Attorney General Gonzales give vague and \nunconvincing responses in critical areas about his Department's \nperformance.\n  The Attorney General testified that he does not know who selected the \nvarious U.S. attorneys to be fired; therefore, he does not know why \nthey were fired. Can you believe that? He testified that the firings \nwere based on a ``process of consulting with senior leadership in the \nDepartment.'' However, every single one of the Department of Justice's \nsenior officials who have testified has stated under oath that they did \nnot place a U.S. attorney on the termination list, with one exception--\nKevin Ryan of California. This includes Kyle Sampson, the Attorney \nGeneral's Chief of Staff; James Comey, former Deputy Attorney General; \nPaul McNulty, Deputy Attorney General; Mike Elston, Paul McNulty's \nChief of Staff; Monica Goodling, White House Liaison; Bill Mercer, \nAssociate Attorney General; Mike Battle, Director of the Executive \nOffice of the U.S. Attorneys; and David Margolis, Associate Deputy \nAttorney General. They have all said they did not add names to the list \nof those to be fired. To this day, we have been unable to find out who \nput in place the unprecedented targeted program to fire several U.S. \nattorneys midterm, at one time, and who made the decision to place \nthese attorneys on that firing list.\n  We also learned that an internal order, entitled ``Delegation of \nCertain Personnel Decisions to the Chief of Staff,'' that was issued \nMarch 1, 2006--in that order, the Attorney General designated his role \nin hiring and firing certain senior officials in the Department of \nJustice to his Chief of Staff, Kyle Sampson, and a young, 33-year-old \nformer researcher for the Republican National Committee, Monica \nGoodling. I must say that I find this a major abdication of the duty of \na leader. In fact, according to internal memos, the Attorney General \nwas going to completely abdicate his role, until the Office of Legal \nCounsel stepped in, saying he must at least be consulted in the \nprocess.\n  In a memo dated February 24, 2006, Paul Corts, Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Administration, wrote this:\n\n       The Office of Legal Counsel advises that permitting the \n     Attorney General's delegates to approve appointments (or \n     removals) of constitutionally ``inferior officers''. . . \n     would be inconsistent with the [Excepting Clause in the \n     Constitution]. The Office of Legal Counsel recommends that \n     the delegates exercising the authority of this delegation \n     submit appointments or removals to the Attorney General.\n\n  Taken together, the most favorable interpretation of these various \nactions is that the Attorney General has clearly sought to avoid these \nkey responsibilities.\n  Unfortunately, information has come to light that demonstrates that \nthe problems are not limited to poor management. Rather, the \nDepartment's reputation, independence, and credibility have been put in \nserious question.\n  Mr. Gonzales has stated that he believes the Attorney General wears \n``two hats''--one as a member of the President's staff and another as \nthe Nation's top law enforcement officer. How does this compare with \nwhat I just read from Abraham Lincoln's Attorney General? Answer: It \ndoes not.\n  It is this perspective which I believe has led the Attorney General \nto treat\n\n[[Page S7425]]\n\nthe Department of Justice as a political arm of the White House rather \nthan as the independent law enforcement agency it should be. For \nexample, the committee's investigation has shown that seven of the nine \nU.S. attorneys who were fired were not fired for so-called \n``performance reasons'' at all, as stated. In fact, when reviewing the \nsix evaluation and review staff reports, which are called the EARS \nreports, of the fired U.S. attorneys, all were given strong, positive \nperformance evaluations. Here are some examples:\n  Bud Cummins:\n\n       United States Attorney Cummins was very competent and \n     highly regarded by the Federal judiciary, law enforcement, \n     and the civil client agencies.\n\n  Despite this review, Mr. Cummins was fired in June of 2006.\n  Carol Lam:\n\n       U.S. Attorney Carol Lam was an effective manager and a \n     respected leader in the District . . . The United States \n     Attorney committed significant prosecutorial resources to the \n     felony immigration and border crime cases.\n\n  Despite this review, Mrs. Lam was fired on December 7, 2006, \nostensibly for the very reason that the EARS report found she had done \na good job.\n  David Iglesias:\n\n       This U.S. Attorney had well-conceived strategic plans that \n     complied with Department priorities and reflected the needs \n     of the District overall. The U.S. Attorney effectively \n     managed complaints, detention decisions, and pretrial \n     practices.\n\n  Despite this review, Mr. Iglesias was fired on December 7, 2006.\n  Dan Bogden:\n\n       U.S. Attorney Bogden was actively involved in the day-to-\n     day management of the U.S. Attorney's office, had established \n     an excellent management team, and had established appropriate \n     priority programs that support Department initiatives.\n\n  Despite this review, Mr. Bogden was fired on December 7, 2006.\n  Paul Charlton:\n\n       U.S. Attorney Charlton also made his goals and expectations \n     clear to his staff. . . .The U.S. Attorney's office \n     prosecuted more immigration violations than any other \n     district.\n\n  Despite this review, Mr. Charlton was fired December 7, 2006.\n\n  John McKay:\n\n       McKay is an effective, well-regarded, and capable leader of \n     the [U.S. Attorney's office] and the District's law \n     enforcement community.\n\n  Despite this review, Mr. McKay was fired on December 7, 2006.\n  The Department did not turn over the EARS reports for the two U.S. \nattorneys who were said to have performance concerns and who were not \nidentified until late in the process--Margaret Chiara and Kevin Ryan.\n  Since the initial cause for the firing, performance was clearly \ndebunked by these reports. It now appears that these 6 U.S. attorneys \nwere fired because they upset the political arm of the White House.\n  For example, David Iglesias, by all accounts a rising star, was only \nplaced on the list to be fired after the President and Karl Rove called \nthe Attorney General to pass along complaints.\n  Specifically, Kyle Sampson, former Chief of Staff to the Attorney \nGeneral, testified on March 29, 2007, that:\n\n       I do remember learning, I believe, from the Attorney \n     General that he had received a complaint from Karl Rove about \n     U.S. Attorneys in three jurisdictions, including New Mexico, \n     and the substance of the complaint was that those U.S. \n     Attorneys weren't pursuing voter fraud cases aggressively \n     enough.\n\n  Mr. Sampson went on to testify that he also remembered that:\n\n       Just a week before I left the Department in March, I \n     remember the Attorney General telling me that he had had a \n     meeting with the President in October sometime. . . . I \n     remember the Attorney General saying, ``You know, I remember \n     the President in that meeting we had in October telling me \n     that [there were] concerns about Iglesias.''\n\n  In addition, the committee's investigation has shown that many of the \nU.S. attorneys who were fired, or put on a list to be fired, were \nhandling contentious election-related cases, including Todd Graves, \nformer U.S. attorney in Missouri, who recently revealed that he, too, \nwas forced to resign after he had refused to support a case against the \nDemocratic secretary of state in Missouri, alleging that Missouri was \nviolating Federal law for failing to purge voter rolls--that is despite \nthe rules of the Department urging that no case involving election \npractices be brought prior to an election; John McKay, former U.S. \nattorney in Washington, fired, it appears, because he refused to bring \na case during the hotly contested gubernatorial race against \nessentially the Democratic candidate; David Iglesias, former U.S. \nattorney in New Mexico, who, it appears, was fired because he refused \nto bring a case alleging voter fraud prior to the election; Tom \nHefflefinger, former U.S. attorney in Minnesota, who was put on a list \nto be fired when he was pushing for an investigation into voter \ndiscrimination against Native Americans; Steve Buskupic, U.S. attorney \nin Wisconsin, who was put on a list to be fired, and his district was \nthe focus of a document sent over from the White House for \ninvestigation that provided information on Milwaukee voting trends.\n  These are just examples of U.S. attorneys who were fired or \nconsidered to be fired because of their involvement in election fraud \ncases. Other U.S. attorneys who were fired were involved with sensitive \npublic corruption cases.\n  The congressional investigation has also uncovered that political \nconsiderations were being taken into account with regard to hiring and \nfiring decisions for career employees at the Department and the \nprestigious Honors Program. Now, that is a no-no.\n  Monica Goodling, a young, inexperienced lawyer, 33 years old, was \nnamed White House Liaison at the Department of Justice, and in that \nrole she was given the authority to hire and fire personnel for many \ncritical positions at the Department.\n  On May 23, 2007, Ms. Goodling testified that ``I may have gone too \nfar in asking political questions of applicants for career positions, \nand I may have taken inappropriate political considerations into \naccount on some occasions.''\n  This is a 33-year-old making these decisions. Where was the Attorney \nGeneral?\n  The Congress has also discovered that political appointees directed \nchanges to be made to the performance evaluations of career staff and \noverrode career attorneys' recommendations regarding which cases to \npursue or not pursue.\n  For example, in testimony before the House, Joe Rich, who worked at \nDOJ's Civil Rights Division for 37 years, testified that he was \n``ordered to change the standard performance evaluations of attorneys \nunder my supervision to include critical comments of those who had made \nrecommendations that were counter to the political will of the front \noffice and to improve evaluations of those who were politically \nfavored.''\n  What does this do to the credibility of the Department of Justice of \nthe United States?\n  In the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing last week, Brad Schlozman \ntestified that ``on a number of occasions, I believe I did order [Joe \nRich to change performance evaluations.]''\n  There you have it, the politicization of the Department of Justice.\n  Sharon Eubanks, lead attorney for the Department of Justice on the \ntobacco cases, has stated that in June 2005, she was pressured to ask \nfor lesser penalties against the tobacco companies. She said:\n\n       At first, the administration officials attempted to get the \n     litigation team and me and my staff to agree to lower the \n     amount, but there was no basis for doing that, and we \n     refused. And finally, after a number of very heated \n     discussions, I said, ``You write it and I'll say it.''\n\n  What a terrible comment about some of the biggest cases ever made in \nthe history of the United States.\n  Each of these facts on its own is disconcerting, but taken together, \nthey show a department being run based on politics and not on law.\n  I also believe the Attorney General has compromised important legal \nprinciples by taking positions and espousing opinions that are outside \nthe mainstream of legal thought. For example, the Attorney General \ntestified on January 18, 2007, that habeas corpus, the right to \nchallenge one's imprisonment, is not protected by the Constitution. \nHere is what the Attorney General said:\n\n       There is no express grant of habeas in the Constitution. \n     There is a prohibition against taking it away . . . I meant \n     by that comment, the Constitution doesn't say ``Every \n     individual in the United States or every citizen is hereby \n     granted or assured the right to habeas.''\n\n  He has also pushed to narrow the definition of torture and changed to \nwhom the Geneva Convention applies. In the January 2002 memo he wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S7426]]\n\n\n       In my judgment, this new paradigm renders obsolete Geneva's \n     strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and \n     renders quaint some of its provisions.\n\n  And when it comes to Guantanamo, Attorney General Gonzales has \nexpressed strong objections to closing the detention facility and \nmoving detainees to the United States.\n  The New York Times reported of March 22 of this year that Mr. Gates \nargued to close Guantanamo. But according to administration officials--\nthis is the newspaper only:\n\n       Mr. Gates's arguments were rejected after Attorney General \n     Gonzales and some other Government lawyers expressed strong \n     objections to moving detainees to the United States, a stance \n     that was backed by the Office of the Vice President.\n\n  And despite the fact that the U.S. Code states ``the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act shall be the exclusive means'' by which \nelectronic surveillance may be conducted, the Attorney General has \nargued that the language used in the authorization for use of military \nforce implicitly authorized the President to exercise powers, \n``including the collection of enemy intelligence.''\n  In his prepared testimony from January 2006, he stated:\n\n       The Supreme Court confirmed that the expansive language of \n     the resolution--``all necessary and appropriate force''--\n     ensures that the congressional authorization extends to \n     traditional incidents of waging war . . . [and] the use of \n     communications intelligence to prevent enemy attacks is a \n     fundamental and well-accepted incident of military force.\n\n  He is thereby saying that Guantanamo is a creature of this and, \ntherefore, legal. I don't agree with that assessment.\n  I believe each of these legal opinions has had dramatic negative \nconsequences, including negatively impacting America's relationship \nwith most countries abroad.\n  Finally, and perhaps most disturbing, the Senate has heard testimony \nfrom Deputy Attorney General James Comey that calls into question the \nAttorney General's character and integrity.\n  Mr. Comey testified about the conversation in the intensive care unit \nof George Washington University Hospital where he witnessed then-White \nHouse Counsel Gonzales ``trying to take advantage of a very sick man'' \nto reverse a judgment that the Terrorist Surveillance Program was \nillegal.\n  The testimony--his testimony, Comey's testimony--raised questions \nabout actions that are contrary to the ethical standards lawyers are \nrequired to uphold.\n  Mr. Comey's testimony stands in sharp contrast to the statements made \nby Mr. Gonzales to the Senate about this incident.\n  In response to Senators' questions on February 6, 2006, the Attorney \nGeneral left the impression that any reports of disagreement within the \nadministration about the surveillance program were either inaccurate or \nin reference to some other program or issue.\n  He said:\n\n       There has not been any serious disagreement [about the \n     program] . . . The point I want to make is that, to my \n     knowledge, none of the reservations dealt with the program \n     that we are talking about today.\n\n  That was under oath, Mr. President, before us. He didn't tell us \nabout this. He didn't tell us that he went, as White House Counsel, to \na critically ill man's intensive care unit bed and tried to reverse a \ndecision that the Acting Attorney General was making. It wasn't until \nMr. Comey came forward and told us about it did we know.\n\n  What do I conclude? Each of these issues is serious on its own and \neach would raise serious questions about the qualifications and service \nof this Attorney General. The Department of Justice is charged with \nenforcing the law and protecting all Americans' rights and security. \nThe Attorney General must enforce the law without fear or favor to its \npolitical ramifications. He must act independently and pursue justice \nwherever it may lead, and without compromise. He must uphold the \nhighest ethical standards.\n  Let me quote again from President Lincoln's Attorney General:\n\n       [t]he office I hold is not properly political, but strictly \n     legal; and it is my duty, above all other ministers of State, \n     to uphold the law and to resist all encroachments from \n     whatever quarter. . . .\n\n  This is what the Attorney General should be. That is why I am going \nto support the motion to close off debate and support the resolution.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7426-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the hour of 3:30 \np.m. having passed, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion \nto proceed to H.R. 6, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6) to reduce our Nation's dependency on \n     foreign oil by investing in clean, renewable, and alternative \n     energy resources, promoting new emerging energy technologies, \n     developing greater efficiency, and creating a Strategic \n     Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve to invest in \n     alternative energy, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 4:30 \np.m. shall be equally divided and controlled between the chairman and \nranking member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be \nallowed to equally divide a full hour, which was our plan this \nafternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Some of that time may be yielded back, but I didn't \nwant to cut off anyone who wishes to speak on this issue before we go \nto a vote.\n  Mr. President, today we begin consideration of energy legislation in \nthe Senate. Later today, we will be voting to take up legislation that \nwill make a meaningful and bipartisan contribution to charting a new \ndirection for America's energy policy.\n  There is a growing consensus among Federal, State, and local \npolicymakers across the ideological spectrum, also from corporate \nleaders and the American public in general, that our Nation needs to \nmove faster and needs to go farther to secure its energy future.\n  America's family farmers and businesses look no further than the \nprices that are posted at the corner gas station to see the vivid and \ndaily indicators of the economic perils inherent in maintaining the \nstatus quo. In fact, they have watched as gas prices have stayed at \nmore than $3 per gallon for well over a month.\n  Our national security experts cite the geopolitical implications and \nthe foreign policy challenges presented by the rise of State-owned \nenergy companies and by our own growing dependence on oil imports. In \n2005, the United States imported roughly 60 percent of the petroleum \nthat we consumed. Without decisive action, that figure is expected to \napproach 70 percent over the next two decades, with more than 35 \npercent of that increase expected to come from member nations of OPEC \nor the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n  Meanwhile, economists take note of our energy policy's fiscal \nimplications as well related to America's global competitiveness. In \n2005 and 2006, our dependence on petroleum imports combined with rising \nprices to add an estimated $120 billion to our Nation's trade deficit.\n  There is no doubt there is a compelling case for action, but there is \nalso something more fundamental that is embedded in the American \nconsciousness that is animating the national call for a new direction \nin our energy policy.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt once observed:\n\n       The creed of our democracy is that liberty is acquired and \n     kept by men and women who are strong and self- reliant.\n\n  Perhaps it is this American principle of self-reliance that is \ndriving national debate forward when it comes to energy policy.\n  After all, by tapping America's limitless capacity for innovation, \nour most abundant renewable resource, the United States can become more \nenergy self-sufficient. Americans believe we can and should lead the \nworld when it comes to developing the new technologies that will \nproduce clean alternative energy and help us to address the threat of \nglobal warming. Inherent in this grand challenge is enormous \nopportunity--opportunity to build a\n\n[[Page S7427]]\n\nstronger economy, to create the high-paying jobs of the 21st century, \nand the opportunity, of course, to lower our energy costs.\n  No single political party has a monopoly on these ideas. Rather, \nthese ideas are broadly shared by Members of the Senate on both sides \nof the political aisle. The shared will to make progress in securing \nAmerica's energy future is what has brought us to this point today. \nLater this afternoon, we will vote on a motion to proceed to \nlegislation that represents the bipartisan efforts of four committees \nin the Senate--the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, the Commerce Committee, and the \nForeign Relations Committee. If we are successful in bringing the \nmeasure before the Senate, I believe by the time the debate is \nconcluded, we will also have the recommendations of a fifth committee, \nthe Senate Finance Committee, to add to this legislation.\n  Suffice it to say there has been a tremendous amount of bipartisan \nlegislative effort on display in bringing this measure forward. Since \nthe outset of the 110th Congress, the Senate has held more than 50 \nhearings on energy and climate-related issues. That is at least one \nhearing held every other day that we have been in session. As it \nrelates to what we have been able to accomplish in the Senate Energy \nCommittee, let me at the outset thank Senator Domenici, the ranking \nmember on the committee, for the goodwill and the diligence he has \ndemonstrated at every step in this effort.\n  On the second day of the 110th Congress, we jointly announced an all-\nday conference related to biofuels policy. This conference drew \nsubmissions and suggestions from more than 100 stakeholders. During \nthat all-day session, attended by nearly every member of our committee, \nwe heard from about 30 experts, who gave us suggestions that formed the \nintellectual basis for the committee's work in the important area of \nrenewable fuels. After that, we held more than 15 energy policy-related \nhearings, including 8 oversight and legislative sessions, specifically \ntailored to take testimony on the issues at the core of our \nlegislation. Those issues, in addition to biofuels, were energy \nefficiency and, second, carbon capture and storage.\n  As a result of this process, Senator Domenici and I were able to \ncirculate a bipartisan proposal to the committee for markup. After a \nsession at which we adopted almost 30 amendments from members on both \nsides of the dais, the Energy Committee reported legislation with a \nsubstantial bipartisan margin of 20 to 3. On the whole, I think what we \nwere able to accomplish in a relatively short period of time is \nsomething all members of our committee can be proud of.\n  As I mentioned, the legislation touches on three key topics related \nto our energy future. First, it boosts domestic renewable fuel \nsupplies. It does so in a manner that will reduce life cycle greenhouse \ngas emissions and spur regional diversity of biofuels production and \ninfrastructure.\n  The second thing the bill that came out of the Energy Committee does \nis it proposes to enhance economywide energy efficiency in a way that \nwill reduce our Nation's imports of foreign oil and provide significant \nsavings to consumers.\n  The third item we addressed is that we will invest in the carbon \ncapture and storage technologies that will help us to cut back on the \ngreenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming.\n  I think it would be helpful to describe for my colleagues some of \nthese issues in a little more detail.\n  First, on the topic of biofuels, there is no question that in recent \nyears many factors have sharpened public focus on the search for viable \nalternatives to conventional petroleum-based fuels. I have already \ndescribed many of those factors, including increased world oil prices, \nconcerns regarding import dependence, and the environmental effects of \nvehicle emissions.\n  Biofuels, which is a term that includes both ethanol and biodiesel, \ncan be derived from an array of crops and other biological materials \nthat are available throughout our Nation. Since the 1970s, all cars and \nlight trucks with gasoline engines built for the U.S. market have been \nable to run on ethanol blends of up to 10 percent. That is E10. A \nsmaller yet increasing number of vehicles that is now estimated at \nabout 6 million on American roads today can run on fuel comprised of 85 \npercent ethanol or E85. Meanwhile, existing diesel engines can run on \nbiodiesel in any concentration. Due to concerns about quality \nstandards, however, manufacturers may not honor warranties for engines \nrunning on biodiesel blends in excess of 5 percent, that is B5, or 20 \npercent, which is B20.\n  There is little question that passage of the Energy Policy Act of \n2005 was a watershed event for the Nation's biofuels industry. \nEstablishing the first Federal renewable fuel standard, the RFS, \ncreated an escalating requirement for the amount of biofuels blended in \nU.S. gasoline, starting with 4 billion gallons in 2006, and \naccelerating to 7.5 billion gallons in 2012.\n  However, less than 2 years after that Energy Policy Act was signed by \nPresident Bush, increased use of biofuels is already surpassing the \noriginal RFS targets, with 5 billion gallons added to U.S. gasoline in \n2006. Another 6 billion gallons of production capacity is expected to \ngo into operation by 2009, bringing total domestic production capacity \nto approximately 11.7 billion gallons. According to the Energy \nInformation Administration's 2007 Annual Energy Outlook:\n\n       the market potential for biofuel blends--that is B10, B5, \n     and B20--remains significantly larger than the current \n     production levels and will continue to absorb the biofuel \n     supply for the foreseeable future.\n\n  Yet as the Energy Committee began developing its legislation, it was \nobvious significant challenges remained if biofuels are to become a \ncornerstone of U.S. efforts to improve our energy self-sufficiency. \nToday, approximately 98 percent of domestic ethanol production is \nderived from cornstarch, and that creates upward pressure on commodity \nprices, restricting production to regions of the country where corn is \ngrown, and posing challenges to efficient distribution of the fuel.\n  Diversifying feedstocks to include a broader array of renewable \nbiomass can promote regional diversity in biofuels production and \ndistribution, spreading economic benefits to rural communities across \nthe country and relieving pressure on corn commodity prices. In \naddition, it can lead to greater efficiency in the fuel production \nprocess and help save on fossil fuel emissions.\n\n  Another issue key to making biofuels a significant factor in \ndisplacing domestic petroleum use relates to existing infrastructure \nchallenges. Of the nearly 170,000 vehicle fueling stations in the \nUnited States, only 1 percent carried E85 or biodiesel in 2006. \nConsumers must have access to these fuels if they are to become a \nviable alternative.\n  To address these various challenges, the Energy Committee's \nlegislation increases and extends the existing RFS to 36 billion \ngallons in 2022, with specific incentives for the production of \nbiofuels from new sources of renewable biomass. Taken together, these \nprovisions will help provide market certainty to both the existing \nethanol industry and to the next generation of advanced biofuels \nproducers.\n  In addition, our legislation provides resources to help break down \ninfrastructure barriers to renewable fuel distribution, and it invests \nin research into the basic scientific challenges associated with the \nuse of promising new feedstocks.\n  Altogether, the Energy Information Administration has estimated the \nlegislation's biofuels provisions can help reduce America's petroleum \nimports by a million barrels per day, an important contribution to \nimproving our Nation's energy security.\n  The second major topic of the Energy Committee's reported legislation \nis energy efficiency. The obvious goal of these provisions is to use \nexisting resources more efficiently, which promises to further enhance \nU.S. self-sufficiency and provide environmental benefits and, of \ncourse, save consumers money.\n  Improving efficiency in transportation remains one of the most \nimportant and vexing energy challenges facing this Nation. Consumption \nof liquid fuels is currently projected to grow by more than 6 million \nbarrels per day,\n\n[[Page S7428]]\n\nfrom 2005 to 2030, with 5.8 million barrels per day attributable to \ntransportation. So as fuel consumption increases, so too do U.S. \nimports, a key concern for both the economy and our national security.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee has reported legislation that will \nincrease corporate average fuel economy standards for the first time in \nmany years, and this legislation is also included in the bill we will \nvote on later this afternoon. The Commerce Committee's chairman and \nvice chairman are to be congratulated on finding a way forward on this \nvery difficult issue.\n  As such, I am pleased to say the provisions reported by the Energy \nCommittee also support the goal of reducing the transportation sector's \nconsumption of liquid fuels in general, and gasoline in particular. Our \nprovisions establish an escalating goal for reducing U.S. gasoline \nconsumption, starting with 20 percent in 2017. That is enough to reduce \nworld oil prices more than $2.50 per barrel under current EIA \nassumptions.\n  This national goal ramps up to 45 percent in 2030, which is the \nequivalent of 5.6 million barrels of oil per day. That is more than \ntwice the amount of oil the United States imported from the Persian \nGulf in 2005.\n  To complement these initiatives, the legislation also makes \ninvestments in advanced vehicle technology development, basic science \nrelated to energy storage, and public education about how consumers can \nhelp reduce their own petroleum consumption.\n  In addition to the transportation sector, efficiency is a resource we \ncan better deploy in end uses throughout the U.S. economy. For example, \nlighting and common household appliances can account for as much as \ntwo-thirds of an average American family's electricity bills. By \nimproving a number of appliance efficiency standards and streamlining \nand strengthening the Department of Energy's existing program, \nconsumers stand to collect $12 billion in benefits as a result of \nprovisions included in this underlying bill.\n  In fact, altogether, the bill's appliance efficiency provisions will \nsave at least 50 billion kilowatt hours per year, or enough to power \nroughly 4.8 million typical U.S. households. It will save 17 trillion \nBtus of natural gas per year, or enough to heat about a quarter million \ntypical U.S. homes, and it will conserve at least 560 million gallons \nof water per day, or 1.3 percent of daily potable water usage around \nthis Nation. These savings result from provisions which establish the \nfirst ever Federal water conservation standards for clothes washers and \ndishwashers.\n  Finally, on the topic of efficiency: The legislation recognizes the \nFederal Government itself represents the Nation's largest energy \nconsumer and can play a key role in bringing new technologies to \nmarket. The Federal Government has an obligation to lead by example, \nand in doing so we can save taxpayers money.\n  For example, even as the Government has reduced its energy \nconsumption, saving 2.5 percent from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year \n2005, Federal energy costs nevertheless increased 24.1 percent or $14.5 \nbillion. Clearly, rising energy prices have an impact on the Federal \nbudget, just as they have an impact on the budgets for families and on \nthe budgets for businesses across America.\n  To capture additional savings, this legislation strengthens Federal \nenergy requirements from lighting procurement, to petroleum \ndisplacement, to energy management strategies across Federal \nbuildings. As a result, leading efficiency groups have estimated that \nthe legislation's provisions in this area can save 60 trillion Btu's of \nenergy, 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, and almost $4 billion \nof taxpayer money between now and 2015.\n\n  A final issue touched on by the NRC committee's reported legislation \nrelates to carbon capture and storage or carbon sequestration. While \nscientific and technological challenges remain, carbon sequestration \nholds particular promise related to the potentially large amounts of \ncarbon dioxide emitted from the use of fossil fuels. Electric \ngenerating plants may be the most likely initial candidates for \nimplementing carbon sequestration.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 directed the Secretary of Energy to \ncarry out research and development on technologies designed to capture \ncarbon dioxide, specifically with respect to combustion-based energy \nsystems. However, given the critical nature of these efforts, the need \nto demonstrate emerging methodologies, and the potential to apply them \nto a wider variety of energy technologies, our legislation strengthens \nand further expands this research.\n  In summary, I believe the Energy Committee has produced legislation \nthat will help us move forward expeditiously with groundbreaking \nresearch on carbon sequestration that is key to addressing global \nwarming, will help spur diverse domestic renewable fuels production, \nand it will promote energy efficiency throughout our economy.\n  These efforts, of course, by our committee, have been further \ncomplemented by good bipartisan work of the other Senate committees I \nmentioned. Taken together, these bipartisan measures form the backbone \nof a national strategy that meet at least three complementary goals: \nboosting U.S. energy self-sufficiency, driving American leadership in \nclean alternative energy, and putting us on a trajectory to address the \nthreat of global warming.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the motion to proceed to \nenergy legislation which we will have later this afternoon.\n  I know my colleague, Senator Domenici, wishes to speak, giving his \nviews on the pending legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry before my friend yields: How much \ntime do we have on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining \non the Democratic side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was hoping to get 5 minutes to speak.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. As soon as Senator Domenici has concluded his \nstatement, I am glad to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor. I will be \nglad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, would it be possible to have my \ncolleagues yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes, following Senator Boxer's statement on \nour side?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am glad to yield the remaining 3\\1/2\\ minutes on this \nside to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator from California, \nwould she like to speak now and then I will speak after her? I have all \nmy time. I would just as well accommodate you. You are going to speak 5 \nminutes, and the Senator, would you like to speak 3\\1/2\\, then, and \nthen I will use mine at the end?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. That would be fine with me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask it be ordered that that time be \nallotted now and the time for the Senator from New Mexico follows that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The time allocation will be as stated.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to the Senator from California.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am here to say this is a very important \nmoment in the Senate. We are moving toward a change in our Nation's \nenergy policy. Clearly, this day has taken a long time to come.\n  Obviously, the bills included in the leader's package, Senator Reid's \npackage, are not the be-all and end-all of everything we have to do. \nBut it is a significant step forward. As I said the day I was fortunate \nenough to gain the gavel of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee--and the Senator who is presiding knows this--as soon as we \nhad the votes we would move forward with good legislation.\n  I think Senator Bingaman has certainly had that same attitude, to \nbegin moving and getting bills to the floor. I was very pleased when \nSenator Reid agreed that we could have a group of bills put together \nwhich would be a real confidence builder so the people know we are \nworking.\n  As Senator Bingaman said, we have three committees represented in \nthis\n\n[[Page S7429]]\n\nparticular piece of legislation. The committees that participated in \nthis, as Senator Bingaman said, are the Energy Committee, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, and the Commerce Committee. How \nfortunate am I to sit on two of the three committees. I wish I sat on \nall three--this is such an important issue--but I am so pleased to be \nable to sit on both the Environment Committee, of which I am the Chair, \nand the Commerce Committee.\n  We all know global warming is a looming problem for us. We all should \nknow at this point. The Environment Committee has held at least 12 \nhearings on the subject, at which the Presiding Officer was present--I \nthink at almost all of them. We know the Federal Government is lagging \nbehind on global warming; that is, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \nWe are lagging behind Europe. We are lagging behind the mayors of this \ncountry and many States, including my State of California, where there \nhas been a bipartisan move forward on reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n\n  The contribution the Environment Committee has made to this bill is \nto do that, it is to essentially make the Federal Government a model of \nenergy efficiency and of lessening the carbon footprint we are making.\n  I am very proud of that. Every single one of the bills that is in \nthis package passed the Environment committee with overwhelming \nsupport. Only one had a few against it at the end, but almost all of \nthem were virtually unanimous.\n  We started off taking a look at Federal Government buildings, and we \nrealized we are way behind the times in terms of the way we use energy. \nSince our committee has jurisdiction over these buildings, we decided \nto say that from now on, we are going to make sure we can save money \nfor taxpayers by reducing the energy costs in Federal Government \nbuildings. Not only that, but we set up a very important grant program \nwhich will give matching grants to local governments so for their \nbuildings they can have help making them energy efficient.\n  I do not know if my colleagues are aware of this, but in America 39 \npercent of global warming emissions are attributed to buildings. If the \nFederal Government takes the lead and we help all governments make \ntheir buildings energy efficient, we are moving forward.\n  We also passed a very good compromise bill by Senators Lautenberg and \nWarner on new buildings, the green buildings legislation. We also \npassed a bill on a Capitol powerplant, kind of a model project to see \nwhat we can do from the carbon coming out of that coal-fired plant. We \nare excited about that. We passed a bill that would make the energy \nbuilding, the Department of Energy building, a solar building.\n  Wrapping it up I see my time is up. We are very happy to partake in \nthis bill. We think we are finally moving forward on global warming in \na small but deliberative way to set the stage, by making the Federal \nGovernment the leader, in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n  I thank Senator Bingaman for the time and I believe Senator Salazar \nis next.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, let me, first of all, congratulate \nSenator Bingaman and Senator Domenici, the chairman and ranking member \nof the Energy Committee, for their great work and their leadership. I \nthink the legislation they have brought to the floor today, along with \nthe legislation from the other jurisdictions in the Senate, exemplifies \nthe working relationship we have seen from the Energy Committee over \nthe last 2 years. The 2005 Energy Policy Act could not have been passed \nwithout the bipartisan leadership exhibited by Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Domenici. For that, I am grateful to be a part of their \ncommittee.\n  Let me say to all our colleagues, we should definitely vote yes on \nthe motion to proceed, as we embark on this journey of looking at \nenergy independence for our Nation. The drivers for energy \nindependence, in my mind, are stark and clear. It is fundamentally one \nof the very most important issues that face our Nation today. First and \nforemost, the driver of national security compels us to get rid of the \naddiction we currently have to foreign oil. When one looks at what is \nhappening in Lebanon and the funding of the Hezbollah organization that \ncontinues to create havoc in that part of the world, it is a stark \nreminder to us that for too long, America has slept while our enemies \nhave fueled themselves with the dollars that come from the very high \nprice of oil from places such as Iraq. Our country today is dependent \non us being able to grasp that concept of national security.\n  That is why in this Senate Chamber you will see it is not only \nDemocrats who are going to be working on this energy legislation but it \nis Republicans working on this legislation, because the issue of energy \nindependence is not a Democratic agenda or Republican agenda, it is an \nagenda that is essential to the future security of America.\n  I am hopeful, as we move forward with this legislation, we will grasp \nthe fact that we are taking some significant steps forward. First, the \nbiofuels increased by moving forward with a renewable fuel standard \nwill mean we will be quintupling the amount of energy we expect we can \nproduce from biofuels. Second, the major initiative with respect to \nenergy efficiency is something we ought to embrace. That is low-hanging \nfruit for all of us in America as we deal with energy independence. \nThird, we take major steps with carbon sequestration and move forward \non the debate on global warming, which is essential to our country; and \nfinally, looking at other issues, such as CAFE standards, will help us \nget down the road. I urge all my colleagues to join us in this historic \nendeavor as we march forward toward energy independence in our Nation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I first say to Senator Bingaman, I \nenjoyed his remarks and summary of where we are and where we have been. \nMost of that trip has been together; part of it with you on the \nmajority and part of it me on the majority. In combination, there is \nsome pretty good legislation. People may still say they want more, but \nwhen you have a system such as we have in America, you have to have two \nbodies, the Senate and House, agree. We have debate, they have a Rules \nCommittee. Then you go to conference and, think of it, how those two, \nthe House and Senate, naturally disagree. Right? We have to get all \nthat in agreement before we have a bill that goes to the President. \nThen he has to sign it.\n  We are lucky. The very first one we did, the big bill, probably the \nbest piece of legislation in modern times to cause America to produce \nmore energy, what energy we could, and to do it in a manner that was \nfrugal, with reference to environmental damage, was the first one and \nthe President did us a great favor. He came to our State to sign it, as \nyou recall. It was the first major piece of legislation. I think that \nwas great on his part, a very good gesture, because the two Senators \nwere from New Mexico and it was the first big bill and it was one he \nsigned with relish--which means, even as to the executive branch, it \nwas not too far off the mark.\n  Before I get to my statement, I am going to say there is one thing \nthat did not go right. In your remarks, Senator, you mentioned a couple \nof times how we in the first bill had promoted technology because it \nwas obvious to everyone that, so long as America lived in a world with \ncheap oil, the power of those who would invent and would use new \ntechnology in the field of energy was minimized when gasoline was 50 \ncents at the pump, because there was no broad incentive to do something \nabout it.\n\n  But about the time we got to our major bill, it was quite clear that \nwe no longer were even major players on the international oil scene. \nThey could almost do with us what they wanted because we were way too \ndependent. They grew more and more, and that made those who do not like \nAmerica less and less concerned about the economics of them having a \nmonopoly, so to speak. Toying around with the country that is an open \neconomic society is a big difference. They can really wreak havoc.\n  But when we did our bill, we put in a provision, a kind of catch-all. \nI remember working on it, and I remember you\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\nquestioning it. Then after a while we agreed, and it was the section \nthat provided for loan guarantees and other incentives for the \ntechnologies we mentioned in this bill as being most important for \nAmerica's future.\n  You and I remember one of those that happened was nuclear. We even \nhad to work hard on a different kind of incentive for nuclear, and we \ngot it in. It was a new kind of insurance for the first few who built \ntheirs, that they get an insurance policy from the Federal Government \nso as to permit them to expedite the building of that very complicated, \nenergy-producing nuclear powerplant.\n  But the administration, because somebody in high places does not like \nloan guarantees--there are all kinds of loan guarantees in government \nand in this world. But somehow somebody said: You know, we don't like \nthem. And the Department of Energy does not do them, if you can \nimagine.\n  So the Department of Energy has not been doing loan guarantees. Who \ncares. There are loan guarantees all over the Government. The \nDepartment of Agriculture has billions of dollars in loan guarantees. I \ndon't think we are going broke. They are paid back. It is just that the \nguarantees are given in a manner that permits those who use them to get \nmoney where they otherwise would not.\n  Well, we did not do that yet in that first bill. I think we still--\nyou and I--owe the citizens of our country another push, and maybe we \nought to check into it and give one more push to the administration to \nsee how we can enhance the promotion of loan guarantees by the \nadministration because there should be, for all kinds of products that \nneed a lot of money for experimentation, and for many other \ntechnologies, there should be a very big pot of loan guarantees. Not \n$300, $400 million, there ought to be more, a few billion, so that they \ncan do the work, draw their money on new ideas, and get on with helping \nus make that step from a society that was almost totally roped in by \noil and gas and nothing else, into a society with a great divergence of \nenergies.\n  That is the way we are going in the legislation. The bill before us \ncontinues that momentum. So I speak today as we prepare to consider \nenergy legislation on the floor of the Senate to provide the proper \ncontext of this bill. I think it would be instructive to reflect, as I \nhave just done, upon the recent accomplishments of Congress.\n  I have already indicated to you about 2 years ago the President \nsigned the Energy Policy Act of 2004. Senator Bingaman from my home \nState, this sweeping law was the most comprehensive energy policy \nenacted in decades.\n  I have watched with pride--and this has not been mentioned enough \nbecause it is hard to do. But I have watched with pride that in just 2 \nyears, this long-term policy has already begun to show great positive \nimpact in the short term. The Energy Policy Act is brightening our \nNation's nuclear renaissance. Already over 30 nuclear powerplants are \nin the works. Imagine that. We went more than two decades without a \nsingle one applying, and we have now over 30, with a number of them way \nup near the top of the clearance scale where we will be seeing them \ncleared for the beginning of construction soon.\n  I am sure many of us will go to that and say it is high time, and we \nwere pleased to be part of it. Now, if operational, these plants will \nprovide enough electricity for nearly 30 million American homes, while \ndisplacing about 270 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year.\n  Just think of that. Think of how much we would have to do to displace \nthat much carbon dioxide if it was produced, and we had to get rid of \nit after it was produced, in a coal-burning powerplant or some other \nplant in the process of ignition-produced CO2.\n  This is safe, clean, affordable, and reliable large-scale energy for \nour Nation. That is why earlier this year the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission approved two early site permits for new reactors in Illinois \nand Mississippi.\n  As we try to reduce our dependence on foreign energy and address the \nissue of the global climate change, it becomes imperative for our \nenergy and environmental security that we keep the momentum going on \nnuclear energy in this country.\n  On coal technologies, clean coal technologies, the policies set forth \nin the Energy bill of 2005 have resulted in bringing 159 new coal-based \nfacilities to various planning stages. Over the next 5 years, the \nUnited States will add an estimated 60,000 miners to the American \nworkforce. Just think of that, Mr. President. Everybody has been \nwondering if we are going to have enough jobs, enough jobs for our \npeople, because they are looking at the economy of yesteryear, not of \ntomorrow.\n  Coal miners, instead of being out of work, we will be looking for \npeople to join the corps of coal miners in this country as we produce \nmore coal because we are going to learn how to use it clean in our \ncountry as we seek to avoid this total dependance upon crude oil and \nnatural gas.\n  This past week, the Departments of Treasury and Energy together \nannounced new instructions for applying tax credits for advanced coal \nand gasification projects. In total, three Energy bill tax credits will \nprovide over $1.5 billion to help advance energy projects and capture \nand sequester carbon dioxide. These are already being done and the \ncredits have been given under the laws which were written in this \nthoughtful process of developing legislation over the past 2 years.\n  This bill also put in place mechanisms to ensure a secure, reliable \nelectricity grid for our Nation, and helped transform our agricultural \nbill into an Energy bill--we already know that--providing rural America \nliterally thousands of jobs and billions in new capital investment \ndollars to help bring clean fuel to our Nation's gas tanks.\n  In the area of biofuels, the 2005 bill created a solid foundation for \nthese significant policies set forth in the bill, as we will consider \nthis shortly on the Senate floor. As a result of the Energy bill of \n2005, we revitalized a renewable fuel industry in America through the \nfirst ever renewable fuel standard and production tax credit. We all \nwondered when that would come. It is done.\n\n  There are now 114 biorefineries nationwide, with the capacity to \nproduce 5.5 billion gallons of ethanol a year. That is all because of \nthe act that we passed in 2005 that we keep referring to that we worked \nhere in this body, on a bipartisan basis, and then went to the House \nthe same way, and then had the President join us with great joy in \nsigning it in our State.\n  Additionally, ethanol refinery construction and expansion currently \nin the works has enough combined capacity to have an additional 6 \nbillion gallons of ethanol. The biofuels policy included in the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005 has helped create approximately 10,000 American jobs \nacross many sectors of our Nation's economy. I think sometimes we \nwonder why the economy did so well. Maybe we should look around and say \nmaybe the money spent on energy facilities across this land, because of \nthis act, had something to do with keeping the employment up and \nkeeping the growth up. I am not sure of that, but I just throw it out.\n  Indeed, that act of 2005 could have been called a jobs act, could \nhave been called a jobs-producing act, a diversification act, providing \njobs that were never there before. Ethanol production and demand are \nsetting records in America as we seek renewable fuel to power our cars \nthat we drive.\n  The bill reported out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nthis year, with a strong bipartisan vote, we responded to that call for \nsustainability and to provide a path for the emergence of cellulosic \nethanol. That is what we are here to work on today.\n  That will mean we will be able to produce much more cellulosic \nethanol, which will do the same thing as ethanol except it will make us \nable to produce far more since we can add the cellulosic to the ethanol \nthat comes from corn, and what a machine we will have to produce \ngasoline for our cars.\n  In the 2005 Energy bill, we addressed almost every conceivable area \nof energy policy--from coal to nuclear to electricity transmission, to \noil and gas, hydrogen to biofuels. We did this with a majority of both \nparties in the Senate, embracing this forward-thinking policy for \nAmerica.\n  This wasn't even a close vote. In each case it was substantially more \nthan 60 votes, a bipartisan vote, almost equal from each side on each \nof the important bills. There have been two already. This one will be \nthe third.\n\n[[Page S7431]]\n\n  Simply put, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 has already helped to \nstrengthen our energy security and to grow our Nation's economy. More \nimportantly, if implemented effectively, the larger impacts of this \ngreat bipartisan legislation will be felt for decades in this country.\n  As we prepare to debate on the floor of the Senate today, we are \ngoing to consider a bill smaller in scope and less bold in its version. \nNevertheless, this bill represents bipartisan work spanning four \ncommittees of the Senate. There are a lot of good policies in this \nbill. However, I believe there must be a full and fair debate on this \nbill and a complete amendment process to ensure that the work we will \ndo in the Senate and for the American people on energy policy will be \ncomplete. Anything short of that will be a departure from the example \nof the 2005 act.\n  The bill we expect to soon consider provides for a biofuels mandate \nwith the potential to displace 20 percent of the growth in gasoline \nthat we use in this country by 2020. This addition of 36 billion \ngallons of biofuels a year will see the majority of its content come \nfrom cellulosic ethanol, a sharp and important move away from corn-\nbased ethanol in our fuel mix.\n  We consider this an energy-efficient measure that if properly \nimplemented has the potential to provide important efficiencies in \nvehicles, buildings, homes, and businesses to save the American \nconsumer more than $12 billion annually. This is one part of our energy \npolicy that goes unnoticed, the one I have just described, important \nefficiencies. And I do say to our majority, who was my minority member \nwhen we started, that he has led the effort in this part of the changes \nin the energy policy, those that would make us more efficient.\n  He described today in his speech how much efficiency will come just \nfrom washing machines and dishwashers. I am not ashamed to talk on the \nfloor about dishwashers. Some people say we shouldn't talk about \ndishwashers. Why shouldn't we, when it saves a huge amount of energy? I \nremember when I got a dishwasher. I got a laundry board as a gift from \na constituent because I had helped with REA that went up the mountain \nand took electricity up there. So she came down to me at the foot of \nthe mountain and said: Here is your washboard. I don't need it anymore; \nI got electricity. I just bought a washing machine. I am thanking you \nby giving you the washboard. She didn't have efficiency; that was all \nbrawn, right?\n  Anyway, this bill will save us a lot of energy on those two items \nthat we need and use to make our lives better.\n  On fuel economy, the Senate stands poised to address vehicle fuel \nefficiency. One way to help reduce our dependency is by reforming our \nCAFE standards for the vehicles we drive. Everybody should know the \nCommerce Committee did that and, by act of our leader and the floor \nprocedures, that is on this bill. So if people want to do something \nabout CAFE, it is pending. Once this bill is made pending, it is the \nsubject matter before the Senate, the CAFE standards, which will compel \nautomobile companies to do better than they have in terms of miles per \ngallon. We have never gone as far as the Commerce Committee did, so it \nought to make for a few hot speeches here on the floor. I don't know \nwhen they will come, but sooner or later they will because the CAFE \nstandards for vehicles we drive will be changed.\n  I have only one page remaining. I don't need to use all my time, \nespecially when some Senators have had to wait. I will close by saying \nto Senators who are not paying attention and to staffs watching for \ntheir Senators, we are not going to be on this bill very much longer \ntoday. If you want to come down and speak, I have a little bit of time. \nI can give you some. But I think we are going to start yielding to \nother Senators, I assume, and move on. I haven't talked to Senator \nBingaman on that.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reserve that time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue the call of the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back the remainder of my time. I say to the \nSenator from New York, I was just trying to find out if there were more \npeople on my side.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in the coming weeks the Senate will debate \nour national energy policy. An important part of that debate will \ninvolve tax and other incentives to encourage development of our \nabundant domestic energy resources. This debate will affect the lives \nof every American.\n  During that debate we must find a way to encourage greater use of \nrenewable energy sources, advanced clean coal technologies in the \ngeneration of electricity, and accelerate efforts to move that clean \nenergy to markets by building large transmission projects. Furthermore, \nwe need to find alternative ways to produce energy, such as through \nfuel cells and other distributed generation.\n  For too many years, Congress has sent mixed messages about the \nimportance of energy independence, security, diversity, and \nreliability, especially in the area of renewable and distributed energy \nand the opportunity for using advanced clean coal technology. The \nCongress has lacked the commitment, or perhaps understanding, about the \nmajor role that renewable energy and clean coal can play in helping our \nNation meet its future electricity demands without seriously impacting \nthe environment.\n  This is despite the fact that policymakers have been told repeatedly \nby energy developers that certainty about the availability of \nincentives is absolutely essential before they can commit the capital \nneeded to move forward on a major energy project. Yet Congress has \npassed energy incentives that, in many cases, are available for as a \nlittle as one year or two.\n  In my judgment, the hood ornament for this start-and-stop, boom-and-\nbust energy policy is the tax credit for facilities that produce \nelectricity from wind and other renewable resources. This credit has \nbeen extended for short periods five times, and shamefully has been \nallowed to expire three times, since it was enacted in 1992. The Tax \nCode is replete with other energy tax incentives that Congress made \navailable for just a year or two, and that will expire before their \nfull benefit can be realized.\n  It is imperative that we provide a clear signal to the marketplace \nthat we are committed to the development of renewable sources of energy \nand advanced clean coal technologies. That is why I introduced the \nClean Energy Production Tax Incentives Act to make these incentives \navailable for 10 years.\n  The vast majority of energy facilities and infrastructure are owned, \ndeveloped, and operated by the private sector. We must work closely \nwith industry and other stakeholders to provide incentives so that \nthese steps can be taken. For example, I am very supportive of a whole \nrange of clean energy technologies and resources. North Dakota \nepitomizes that with its coal, oil, gas, wind and other renewable \nresources. We can and must utilize them now and into the future. If we \nwant secure, clean, and reliable energy resources in the future, we \nmust work with the private sector to help achieve our goals. This bill \nhas the support of National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, the \nNorth Dakota Association of Rural Electric Cooperatives, Xcel Energy, \nBasin Electric Power Cooperative, the American Wind Energy Association, \nand Otter Tail Power Company.\n  I also believe we must advance our energy interests in a fiscally \nresponsible manner. The costs of the clean energy tax incentive \ninvestments in this legislation would be offset by closing\n\n[[Page S7432]]\n\ndown tax loopholes that allow profitable U.S. multinational companies \nto avoid paying their fair share.\n  Over the years, I have heard a few clear messages from the investment \ncommunity, Federal and State regulators, energy industry, and \nenvironmental and local community interests. It must be clean so that \nwe are incentivizing an environmentally sustainable energy option. We \nneed to send the right market signals with duration, with a sustained \ncommitment, and with certainty so that the best investment decisions \nare made.\n  I believe this legislation is an important step in that direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7432-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7432-S7442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL ALBERTO \n   GONZALES NO LONGER HOLDS THE CONFIDENCE OF THE SENATE AND OF THE \n                   AMERICAN PEOPLE--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume debate on the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 14, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to the consideration of S.J. Res. 14, \n     expressing the sense of the Senate that Attorney General \n     Alberto Gonzales no longer holds the confidence of the Senate \n     and of the American people.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nRepublican leader shall control the time from 5 to 5:20, and the \nmajority leader shall control the time from 5:20 to 5:30.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: The Republican \nleader controls the time from 5:10 to 5:20, as I understand?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, it is \nfrom 5 to 5:20.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that those of us in favor of \nthis resolution be given a half hour to debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I understand there is a misunderstanding. \nThey weren't supposed to start until 5:10, but the order says 5 \no'clock, which would only give us 10 minutes to debate this motion.\n  Let me begin and not waste any further time. I rise in support of the \nmotion to proceed to a vote of no confidence on Attorney General \nAlberto Gonzales. It is a fair measure. I know it is one with few \nprecedents, but it is called for today because the dire situation at \nthe Department of Justice is also without precedent. The level of \ndisarray and dysfunction, the crisis of credibility, and the failure of \nleadership are all without precedent. It is a simple measure we have \nbefore us. Let me read it.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Attorney General Alberto \n     Gonzales no longer holds the confidence of the Senate and of \n     the American people.\n\n  Are there any Members here who don't agree with that sentiment? If \nso, I haven't heard them. Senators are not a shy lot. Their silence on \nthis point is deafening. So if Senators cast their votes with their \nconscience, they would speak with near unanimity that there is no \nconfidence in the Attorney General. Their united voice would \nundoubtedly dislodge the Attorney General from a post he should no \nlonger hold. But we may not have a unanimous vote here today, I am \ntold. That is a puzzle because no matter what standard one applies, no \nmatter what criteria one uses, the Attorney General cannot enjoy the \nconfidence of the Senate. He certainly doesn't of the American people.\n  The bill of particulars against the Attorney General is staggering. \nOn the question of the Attorney General's credibility, the record \nspeaks for itself. Repeatedly, the Attorney General has misled the \nCongress, misled the American people, and given incredible explanations \nfor the U.S. attorney firings. The Attorney General's comments have \nbeen a series of shifting reactions and restatements. Is this \nconfidence-inspiring conduct from the Nation's chief law enforcement \nofficer?\n  We learned that Attorney General Gonzales was personally involved in \nthe firing plan after being told he wasn't. We learned that the White \nHouse was involved after being told it wasn't. We learned that Karl \nRove was involved after being told he wasn't. We learned that political \nconsiderations were paramount after being told they weren't. Then, when \nthe Attorney General finally had the opportunity to set the record \nstraight on April 19, 2007, what did he do? More than 70 times he \nanswered ``I don't know'' when asked the most basic questions about how \nhe came to fire 10 percent of the Nation's U.S. attorneys. The Attorney \nGeneral admitted he didn't know the reasons why several U.S. attorneys \nwere fired but insisted in the very next breath that he knew they were \nnot fired for improper reasons. Does that inspire confidence? One of \nour most mild-mannered Members, Senator Pryor, believes he was lied to \ndirectly by the Attorney General, and he has good reason to think so.\n  Time after time, the Attorney General has shown he doesn't have the \ncredibility to lead the Department. This is not a liberal or \nconservative assessment. This is not a Democratic or Republican \nassessment. It is a universal one. Listen to the words of the \nconservative National Review magazine, which wrote on March 28:\n\n       What little credibility Gonzales had is gone . . . Alberto \n     Gonzales should resign. The Justice Department needs a fresh \n     start.\n\n  That is on credibility.\n  On the Attorney General's lack of commitment to independence and the \nrule of law, the record is also disturbingly clear. The Attorney \nGeneral has long shown that he misperceives his role. He forgets that \nhe is the people's lawyer, not just the President's. If one needs a \nsingle image to symbolize the Attorney General's contempt for the rule \nof law, it is that of Alberto Gonzales bending over John Ashcroft's \nsickbed on the night of March 10, 2004. It is the picture of then-White \nHouse Counsel Gonzales trying to take advantage of a very ill man who \ndidn't even have the powers of the Attorney General to approve a \nprogram that the Department of Justice could not certify was legal.\n  That example, unfortunately, has plenty of company. Consider the \nimage of Attorney General Gonzales in March of this year making Mrs. \nGoodling feel ``uncomfortable''--her word--by going through the \nsequence of events related to the U.S. attorney firings. How often do \npeople comfort someone by reviewing their recollection of events that \nare subject to congressional investigation? Add to those examples the \ndocumented violations with respect to national security letters and \nother admitted abuses in connection with the PATRIOT Act. How can such \nleadership inspire confidence?\n  Rule of law in the Gonzales regime, sadly, has apparently been an \nafterthought rather than a bedrock principle. Again, there is no \nliberal or conservative or Democratic or Republican position on the \nAttorney General's lack of independence and commitment to rule of law; \nit is virtually unanimous. Consider the words of the conservative group \nthe American Freedom Agenda:\n\n       Attorney General Gonzales has proven an unsuitable steward \n     of the law and should resign for the good of the country.\n  On the question of whether the Department has been improperly \npoliticized, the record is again clear.\n  Attorney General Gonzales has presided over perhaps the most \npoliticized Department in history. We have learned that under Alberto \nGonzales, being a ``loyal Bushie'' was more important than being a \nconsummate professional. We have learned that U.S. attorneys who were \nperforming their duties admirably were apparently dismissed because of \nunfounded allegations by political figures, allegations that were never \ninvestigated or never proven. We have learned that an unprecedented \nvoter fraud case was brought in Missouri on the eve of an election in \nclear violation of the Department's own policy. We have learned that \ndeep suspicions about improper politicizing even at the entry level of \nthe professional ranks were correct. We have learned from the Attorney \nGeneral's own former senior counselor Monica Goodling that she\n\n[[Page S7433]]\n\n``crossed the line'' in considering partisan affiliation in filling \ncareer positions at the Justice Department--career positions, not \npolitical positions.\n  The Office of Professional Responsibility and the Office of Inspector \nGeneral have now opened investigations relating to the hiring of \nimmigration judges, civil rights lawyers, and Honors Program attorneys. \nAll of this, of course, occurred under the Attorney General's watch. \nEither the Attorney General knew about these potentially illegal \nactivities and did nothing or he was oblivious to what was going on \nbeneath his own nose. Either way, Mr. Gonzales is responsible for a \ndeeply political culture at the Department, unprecedented in modern \ntimes. As former Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey has said, these \nkinds of blows to the reputation of the Department will be hard to \novercome. Does that kind of leadership inspire confidence?\n  Finally, given all of this, on the basic question of competence and \neffectiveness, the Attorney General has proven himself to lack the \nleadership ability needed to right the Department. By every account, \nthe Attorney General's handling of the U.S. attorney firings has been \ncatastrophic. Morale at the Department is at an alltime low. How can we \nhave confidence in an Attorney General who can't get his story \nstraight? How can we have confidence in an Attorney General who still \ncan't tell us why 10 percent of the Nation's U.S. attorneys were fired? \nHow can we have confidence in an Attorney General who would allow his \ntop staff to take the fall for his own failings? How can we have \nconfidence in an Attorney General who allowed improper and possibly \nillegal political hiring to take place?\n  Given the crisis of confidence and credibility, given the abysmal \nrecord of trampling the rule of law and longtime standards of \nnonpolitical hiring, the vote today should be an easy one. Some will \nclaim they are opposing the motion because they say this vote was \ncalled for political reasons. This vote is not about politics. If this \nwere all about politics, it would be easy to sit back, let the Attorney \nGeneral remain, cast aspersions on him for the next 18 months, and reap \nthe political benefits. But the Department of Justice is too important, \nand we have an obligation to do everything we can in a bipartisan way \nto demand new leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, we have had some timing difficulties. \nWe have only had about 10 minutes to debate this resolution.\n  Might I ask the minority leader a question? What is his pleasure? I \nhad been told he was coming at 5:10, but the agreement says 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, my understanding is I am to speak at \n5. I have a leadership meeting at 5:15. I have a time problem. I do not \nseek to get in front of the Senator from New York, but I really need to \nspeak at 5 o'clock, at the time I was anticipating speaking.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nminority leader be given his 15 minutes now, that then I be given \nanother 10 minutes to finish my remarks, and the Senator from Rhode \nIsland be given 10 minutes to speak, and that we vote immediately \nthereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, the \nSenator from Mississippi and I are going to--I guess the Senators from \nTexas and Mississippi and I are going to divide the 15 minutes. Madam \nPresident, provided that Senator Lott and I could divide the 15 \nminutes, and Senator Hutchison could get an additional 4 minutes, then \nI would be agreeable to the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would \nadd to the request--Senator Reid wishes 10 minutes at the conclusion of \nthe debate. So adding the 15 minutes for the minority leader, divided \nwith the minority whip from Mississippi, and 4 minutes for the Senator \nfrom Texas, 10 minutes for myself, 10 minutes for the Senator from \nRhode Island, and 10 minutes for the Senator from Nevada, I ask that we \nhave that time and then we vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, when \nwill the vote commence?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will commence at 5:49.\n  Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, there are four ways to become a \nSenator: by appointment, by special election, by winning an open seat, \nor by defeating an incumbent.\n  My good friend from New York, who has been speaking, and I came to \nthe Senate the same way: by defeating an incumbent. That way is often \nthe hardest, so I am sure the Senator remembers his 1998 Senate race \nagainst our former colleague, Senator Al D'Amato.\n  It was quite a race. The Senator from New York surely remembers one \nof his criticisms of Senator D'Amato: that Senator D'Amato had, in \nessence, abused his office.\n  My friend from New York said it was improper for Senator D'Amato to \nuse his official Senate position to investigate the former first lady \nwhile Senator D'Amato was also chairman of his party's Senate campaign \ncommittee, the NRSC. My friend from New York said, in referring to \nSenator D'Amato:\n\n       Do you know what he did right after he got elected? He \n     became chairman of the national Senate Republican Campaign \n     Committee, the most blatantly political position you can \n     hold. Then . . . he embarked on his partisan and political \n     inquisition of the First Family.\n\n  According to the New York Times, the thing about Senator D'Amato's \nactivities that my friend from New York appeared to find particularly \ngalling was that his behavior was motivated by reelection concerns.\n  Given the two hats my friend from New York currently wears, you can \nsee why I obviously found the standard he set out in 1998 to be quite \nintriguing.\n  We all talk to the media--some of us more than others--and we may \nmake offhand comments we later regret, especially in the heat of a \ncampaign. But the Senator from New York thought his conflict of \ninterest charge was so important that he ran a television ad about it. \nThe Buffalo News reported:\n\n       Among the blizzard of attack ads running this weekend is \n     one in which Schumer charged that D'Amato used the Banking \n     Committee . . . to mount a 'vicious' partisan attack on first \n     lady Hillary Rodham Clinton three years ago.\n\n  Now, New York is certainly an expensive media market. Yet because my \ngood friend from New York was so concerned with Senator D'Amato's \nchairing the NRSC while he was investigating the First Lady, he spent a \nlot of money urging New Yorkers to remove Senator D'Amato from office. \nSo he must have really thought it was a serious conflict for someone to \nlead his party's campaign committee while also leading an investigation \ninto an administration of the opposite party.\n  How times change, Madam President. Now my good friend is leading his \nparty's principal campaign committee for the Senate, the DSCC. At the \nsame time, he is leading an official Senate investigation into the \nJustice Department.\n  He chairs the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and \nthe Courts.\n  The media widely reports that he has been tapped by the majority \nleader to lead this investigation. The piece in the National Journal \ncalls him the Democratic ``point man'' on this particular subject--our \ngood friend from New York.\n  He usually has chaired one of the numerous hearings the committee has \nalready held on this subject. To borrow from the National Journal, you \ncould say he is ubiquitous when it comes to this subject.\n  The campaign committee he chairs has repeatedly used material derived \nfrom his investigation for partisan campaign purposes.\n  He held a press conference before the ink was barely dry on the \nSchumer resolution. There, he predicted, amazingly, that we would go to \nthis resolution immediately after immigration. And it looks as if the \nmajority leader filed cloture on immigration to make sure we kept the \nschedule of my good friend from New York.\n  Last, but not least, he is the author of the resolution we will be \nvoting on in a little while.\n\n[[Page S7434]]\n\n  So I find myself perplexed about the application in these \ncircumstances of the standard the Senator from New York set out in \n1998. We could call it the Schumer standard.\n  It seems to me that Senator D'Amato's position in 1998 is like the \ncurrent position of my friend from New York in all material respects.\n  So given that the Senator from New York has said it is a serious \nconflict of interest for someone to lead his party's campaign committee \nwhile he uses his official position to lead an investigation of the \nadministration of the opposite party, I cannot understand why it is not \na conflict of interest for my friend from New York to lead his current \ninvestigation of the Justice Department.\n  And given that the Senator from New York wanted Senator D'Amato \nremoved from office under similar circumstances, I also cannot \nunderstand why my good friend should not at least recuse himself--\nrecuse himself--from the official investigation of the Justice \nDepartment that he himself has been leading.\n  In conclusion, I hope it is not the case that our friend from New \nYork wrote this resolution and pushed the Senate to spend its valuable \ntime on this particular resolution for partisan political purposes. And \nif he did not do that, then I trust we will not see the campaign \ncommittee he is chairing using the Senate's vote on this resolution--\nhis own resolution--for campaign purposes.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time do I \nhave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have 9\\1/2\\ minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I had some passing remarks to make last week about believing we \nshould find a way to move forward the immigration reform effort--to \nimprove it, to change it, but to try to get it done--because it is an \nissue we should not just push aside.\n  We ran into some difficulties, and there is no use in trying to \nrecount how that happened. I think the important thing is we try to \nfind a way to resurrect it, get it properly considered, amended, voted \non, and concluded, if at all possible. But that goes to the heart of \nwhat I want to say today.\n  Is this what the business of the Senate is really all about, a \nnonbinding, irrelevant resolution? Proving what? Nothing. If this \nshould go forward, we would have hours, days--who knows, a week--\ndebating on whether to express our confidence or lack thereof in the \nAttorney General--to no effect.\n  Now, I have been in Congress 35 years. I have been in the Senate \nsince 1989. I do not recall anything of this nature having been \nproposed before. Maybe we should be considering a vote of no confidence \nin the Senate or in the Congress for malfunction, for an inability to \nproduce anything. Yet this resolution would bring up this issue and \nhave us spend time debating it.\n  This is not the British Parliament, and I hope it never will become \nthe British Parliament. Are we going to bring the President here and \nhave a questioning period like the Prime Minister has in Great Britain?\n  So I am very much concerned about this. A vote of no confidence of \nany Cabinet official would have no effect. The President makes that \ndecision. And I suspect the ability of a Cabinet official to perform or \nnot perform is in the eye of the beholder.\n  But the main point is, that is not our job. We do not have authority \nto make that determination. So what are we going to accomplish today? \nThis is all about partisan politics. Nobody is fooled by this. This is \nabout trying to get a vote to try to put some people on the hot spot. \nThat is what it is really all about.\n  Now, by the way, you have not seen me running around making a big \nscene of expressing my confidence one way or the other in this Attorney \nGeneral, or any other Attorney General, or the Justice Department, for \nthat matter, regardless of who is the President of the United States.\n  We are supposed to be here to pass laws, to get things done. When was \nthe last time we did something like that? Not this year. Frankly, not \nover the last 3 years because of gymnastics like this--exercising to no \neffect. No. What should we be doing for the American people? We should \nbe trying to find a way to have strong immigration reform for illegal \nand legal immigrants. We made a 2-week effort. Some people said: Oh, \nthat is long enough. I can remember us spending weeks on a bill--I \nthink 6 weeks on No Child Left Behind. I remember one time we spent a \nmonth on a tobacco bill, which we eventually had to pull down and move \non.\n  To spend in the Senate weeks on a very important issue, so Senators \ncan express their views and offer amendments, and they can be voted on, \nis quite normal. But, no, we are not doing immigration reform. We hope \nto be able to get to Defense authorization.\n  Oh, and by the way, what happened to the appropriations bills? The \nmajority leaders do know, I think, that if you do not begin the \nappropriations process in late May or early June, you are not going to \nmake it. The majority leader has, appropriately, said we are going to \npass all the appropriations bills in regular order. How does he intend \nto do that? We are not going to do a single one in June, and we will be \nlucky if we do four in July. It is not going to happen.\n  We are going to wind up with a train wreck at the end of the fiscal \nyear. We are going to have all these appropriations bills, once again. \nI cannot just blame Democrats. We have done the same thing: an omnibus \nappropriations bill with all kinds of shenanigans being involved in \nthat, trying to lump all these bills together--put the Defense \nappropriations bill in there and irrelevant language and say: Here. \nTake the whole wad, Mr. President.\n  Oh, yes, we did it to Clinton, and we have done it to President Bush, \nbut it is not the way to do business. Can we do something about health \ncare? Can we get this Energy bill done? Remember now, if you start \nthese different cloture votes, being able to find a way to get an \nEnergy bill done--not to mention other things we would like to do after \nthat--they are going to be delayed or derailed completely. So this is a \nvery disappointing spectacle here today.\n  Now, the sponsor of the resolution--the fact is, he is chairman of \nthe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. He is in that position, \nand then he is taking these attack positions. So I do not think anybody \nhas to be drawn a further picture to understand what is going on with \nthis effort.\n  So I urge my colleagues: Look, he has made his point, made his \nspeech. We are going to have a vote in a few minutes. We ought to \nsummarily punt this out into the end zone where it belongs. This is \nbeneath the dignity of the Senate. How low will the Senate go? If we \nget into this for hours or days, pity how much it is going to debase \nthis institution even further.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe motion to proceed, and let's move on to the business of the Senate \nand the business of the American people. The American people may not \nhave particular confidence one way or the other in this Attorney \nGeneral, but this is not an election of the Attorney General.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture on the motion to proceed \nand let's get on with the business of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to speak against this motion \nas well. I agree totally with the Senator from Mississippi in saying: \nWhat are we doing spending this whole day talking about a resolution \nwhich everyone knows will have no effect whatsoever, except probably on \nthe nightly news, which I assume was the purpose of introducing it in \nthe first place.\n  We have talked about the judgment of the Attorney General in handling \nthe U.S. attorney personnel issues. There is clearly a division. There \nhas been a lot of discussion. A number of people have said what they \nthink of the handling of that situation. But stating your opinion is \nvery different from having the Senate address this matter. The \nPresident relieved almost all of his Cabinet when he changed into his \nsecond term. Why wouldn't he be able to\n\n[[Page S7435]]\n\nreplace U.S. attorneys who also serve at his pleasure in the same way \nhe decided to change leadership in the Cabinet? That is the right of \nthe President. The Senate has the right to confirm Cabinet officers and \nU.S. attorneys, and we have exercised that right. What the Senate \nshould not be doing is passing meaningless resolutions that could only \nserve a political purpose.\n  With the issues we have facing this country, how could we be spending \na whole day, and possibly more if cloture is invoked, on a resolution \nthat will have no impact? Why wouldn't we be talking about immigration, \nwhich we discussed last week and the week before that when we were in \nsession? We were making headway. Immigration is a very important issue \nfor our country.\n  The Energy bill which is before us is a very legitimate, major issue \nfor our country. We all want to bring gasoline prices down. But all of \na sudden, thrust in the middle of the energy debate is a meaningless \nresolution of no confidence in the Attorney General. There has been no \nallegation that he has done something criminal or illegal, just that \npeople disagree with his judgment.\n  There were people who disagreed with the Attorney General serving in \nthe previous administration--Janet Reno--when the Branch Davidian \ncomplex in Waco, TX was charged and people died. Many felt the Attorney \nGeneral jumped the gun and took too drastic an action, when talking \nwould have been better. Or the Elian Gonzalez issue. There was much \ndisagreement about the handling of that issue. I didn't see Republicans \nrunning to the floor of the Senate seeking a resolution of no \nconfidence in the Attorney General. I think, frankly, the majority is \njumping the gun in doing something such as that here. I hope we will \nput this away by not invoking cloture on the motion to proceed. \nFrankly, I hope we will restore the reputation of this body by taking \nup the issues that affect our country, debating them, and having votes.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, in regard to my good friend from \nTexas, I think there is a little bit too much protestation here. We \nhave spent less than 2 hours on this issue--just 2 hours--and now we \nare being told we don't have enough time to debate whether one of the \nmost important Cabinet officers is up to the job. That doesn't hold \nwater. They are not upset we are taking 2 hours away from debate. They \nhave spent much more time on many more things that are of less \nconsequence to this country.\n  But let me say this: The minority leader and the minority whip have \nmade my case better than I ever could. They failed to utter the words: \nWe have faith in Attorney General Gonzales. They failed to state: We \nhave confidence in Attorney General Gonzales. In fact, in the entire \nspeech of both the minority leader and the minority whip, there was not \na single word uttered in defense of the Attorney General. No wonder the \nother side doesn't want this resolution brought up. They know the \nAttorney General has failed miserably in his job. They know the \nPresident has clung stubbornly to keeping a man who virtually no one in \nAmerica thinks is up to the job, who overwhelmingly has lost his \ncredibility in his answers and nonanswers and ``don't knows.'' They \ncan't defend him. So they do what somebody does when they don't have \nmuch of an argument--they seek diversions. We will not be diverted. The \nrule of law is too important. The rule of law is too sacred.\n  Is it unusual to have a no-confidence resolution? Yes. But it is just \nas unusual--more unusual--to have an Attorney General not in charge of \nhis department on a major issue facing his department--the firing of \nU.S. attorneys--to say he didn't know what was happening 70 times; to \nhave an Attorney General contradict himself time after time after time. \nFor me, it is unusual in whatever airport I go to around this country \nto have people come up to me--it has happened five or six times now--\nand say: I work in the Justice Department. I am a civil service \nemployee. Keep it up, Senator. Our Department is demeaned--one of them \nused the word ``disgraced''--by the fact that Alberto Gonzales is still \nAttorney General.\n  So, yes, a no-confidence resolution is unusual, but this is not \nsimply a policy disagreement. Oh, no. This is a major scandal. This is \na series of inappropriate behaviors by a Cabinet officer. I don't have \na single bit of doubt that if the shoe were on the other foot, my \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle would be complaining more \nloudly, more quickly than we have.\n  What do you do when there is someone in an office who we all know \ndoesn't deserve to be in that office, and not a word--except for \nSenator Hatch--not a word of confidence has been spoken by the other \nside? We heard 19 minutes of speeches a minute ago. We don't hear the \nwords: We support the Attorney General; we have confidence in the \nAttorney General; the Attorney General should be able to stay. It is \nbecause his record is indefensible.\n  So, yes, this no-confidence resolution is unusual, but it rises to \nthe highest calling of the Senate, to seek rule of law over politics, \nto seek rationality and fairness over stubbornness and political games. \nThis is what we are supposed to do. We have a function of oversight. \nThere is no question Attorney General Gonzales has failed on \ncredibility, on competence, on upholding the rule of law.\n\n  The Nation has been shocked by what he has done. He urged an ill John \nAshcroft, on John Ashcroft's sickbed, to sign a statement that the \nJustice Department itself thought was not justified by the law in terms \nof wiretaps, and he is still Attorney General. John Ashcroft, who is \nhardly a liberal, hardly a Democrat, threatened to resign because of \nwhat then Counsel Gonzales attempted to do, and he is still in office.\n  The bottom line is very simple. We have a sacred, noble obligation in \nthis country to defend the rule of law. There was an article in the New \nYork Times the other day about how some people are using elections to \ntry to justify themselves staying in office in some less developed \ncountries. But the public wasn't falling for it, because without rule \nof law, without democracy, without law being applied without fear of \nfavor, there is no freedom. Our job is to be vigilant in protecting \nthat freedom.\n  Some of my friends tossed off charges of ``political''--to vote \n``no'' when one, in fact, agrees with the sentiment in the resolution \nis to cast a vote for the worst political reasons. A ``no'' vote \nratifies the President's support for the Attorney General. A ``no'' \nvote condones the conduct of the Attorney General. A ``no'' vote \ncondemns the Department to a prolonged vacuum in leadership and a \ncrisis of morale.\n  It is politics simply to cover for the President when you know on \nthis issue he is wrong. It is politics to put blind loyalty to a \npolitical leader over the sacred century after century tradition of \nrule of law. It is politics to voice opposition to the Attorney General \nand then refuse to back one's conviction with one's vote. It is \npolitics to know that Alberto Gonzales should not, must not, remain as \nAttorney General and then quietly, meekly cast your vote to keep him.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized as \npart of the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for yielding a couple of minutes.\n  There have been a couple of times in my career when I have walked \ninto a room and have been humbled. Obviously, the day I walked in this \nplace, I was humbled beyond words. But when I first walked into a \ncriminal courtroom as an assistant prosecutor as a very young lawyer, I \nwas also humbled by the responsibility that had been placed upon me by \nour system of justice. I remember talking to one of the older \nprosecutors in the office about what I should worry about. He said: \nJust remember, remember that woman with the scales of justice, Claire. \nRemember she has a blindfold on.\n  That blindfold is what this is about today. Frankly, it doesn't \nmatter whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, whether you were for \nGeorge Bush or not for George Bush. What matters today is how those \nprosecutors\n\n[[Page S7436]]\n\nout there in this country feel right now, and what this incident did to \nthe way they feel about their jobs. Because there are thousands of \nprofessional prosecutors--some of them have been appointed, some of \nthem have been hired, some have been elected--what they all have in \ncommon is they understand their job is not about politics, it is about \nthe rule of law.\n  When this whole incident unfurled in front of the American public, to \nall of those prosecutors it felt as though they were being cheapened, \nthat somehow Gonzales and the rest of them were saying they were being \njudged on their politics and not on their professionalism.\n  So I come here just for a moment to try to give a voice to those \nthousands of prosecutors out there. I know them. I have worked with \nthem shoulder to shoulder for years. They care deeply about their work, \nthey care deeply about the rule of law, and they care deeply about \nfundamental justice.\n  On their behalf, I rise today for a moment to say this Chamber should \nvote unanimously a vote of no confidence against the Attorney General \nof the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Missouri \nfor her remarks. Like her, I have been appointed and elected as a U.S. \nattorney and as an attorney general. I ask all of my colleagues who are \nlistening to take her at her word. Prosecutors across the country are \nhorrified about what has happened. I applaud Senator Schumer for what \nhe has done to push this forward.\n  The Senate has an important oversight role. We have advice and \nconsent responsibilities, and we have a Judiciary Committee on which \nSenator Schumer and I serve. I tell you, the U.S. Department of Justice \nis a precious institution in our democracy. It is under siege from \nwithin, and we need to take some action.\n  This resolution is not about partisanship. It is not about scoring \npolitical points. It is about two very important things--one, letting \nthe people of America know we care about an honest, independent, and \ntruthful Department of Justice. That is not meaningless. It is also \nabout letting the career people within the Department of Justice know \nthat we hear them, we care about them, we know what has been done to \nthis Department is shameful; that this ordeal for them will one day be \nover, and we will work hard as people who care about this country and \nabout the Department of Justice to make that day come soon, so that \nonce again truth and justice can be the stars that guide the Department \nof Justice. That, too, is not meaningless.\n  Madam President, the bill of particulars against Attorney General \nGonzales is long. First is the fact that he does not respect the \ninstitution he leads. Time-honored traditions and practices of the \nDepartment, vital to the impartial administration of justice, have been \ngravely damaged or destroyed on his watch.\n  One, U.S. attorneys used to come from their home districts, where \nthey were accountable to local people, where they knew the judges and \nthe law enforcement officers. Not under this Attorney General. Now they \nfly them in from Washington where they will do President Bush's \nbidding.\n  Two, U.S. attorneys were always put up for advice and consent. Not \nunder this Attorney General. He presided over the statutory \ncircumvention of our Senate confirmation process.\n  Three, the list of people at the White House and the DOJ who used to \nbe able to talk about cases with each other recently included only four \npeople at the White House and only three at the DOJ. Not under this \nAttorney General, where 417 White House officials, including Karl Rove, \ncan now have these formerly illicit conversations with the Department \nof Justice.\n  Four, career attorneys were kept free of partisan interference. Not \nunder this Attorney General. There are politics in the Honors Program, \npolitics in career official appointments, politics in personnel \nevaluations, and politics in the appointment of immigration judges.\n  Five, U.S. attorneys were almost always left in place to do their \njobs once they were appointed, knowing that they had a higher calling \nthan their political appointment. Not under this Attorney General. \nSimply put, a man who doesn't care about those institutions of the \nDepartment of Justice is the wrong person to lead it back out of the \nmess he has put it in.\n  He has politicized this Department to a degree not seen since the \nNixon administration--U.S. attorneys fired for political reasons, with \nWhite House fingerprints all over the place, and Karl Rove and others \npassing on information to the Department of Justice about voter fraud \nto pump up interest in cases. DOJ policy is ignored, with no \njustification; written policy was ignored to bring indictments on the \neve of a critical election in the State of Missouri; the White House \nCounsel chastising a U.S. attorney over mishandling a case. How does \nthe White House Counsel know whether a DOJ attorney mishandled the \ncase? Who is telling him what is going on in the DOJ? The DOJ even \ninvented the position of White House Liaison--first time ever--who, by \nher own admission, screened applicants based on inappropriate and \nprobably illegal political factors.\n  Third, the Attorney General has set the bar for his office far too \nlow. His stated definition of what is improper for him and his staff, \nbelieve it or not, tracks the legal standard for criminal obstruction \nof justice. Is that the kind of Attorney General we want? Is that the \nkind of accountability to himself we want? The Attorney General should \ndo a lot better than that.\n  There has been an almost unbelievable series of half-truths and \nobfuscations coming out of the Attorney General and his circle. They \ntold us that the firings of U.S. attorneys were performance related. \nNot true. They told us the Attorney General was not involved and didn't \ndiscuss the plan to fire U.S. attorneys. Not true. They told us the \nWhite House was not involved. Not true. They told us these EARS \nperformance evaluations were not relevant. Not true. They told us the \nAttorney General didn't discuss the substance of the testimony with \nother witnesses during the investigation. Not true. They told us the \nChief of Staff of the Deputy Attorney General never made threatening \ncalls to U.S. attorneys who were going to publicly discuss the matter. \nAgain, not true.\n\n  How many times can the Department of Justice say things that are not \ntrue?\n  Fifth, the hypocrisy is almost unbelievable. The Attorney General's \nown incompetence and misjudgments fail the very test he claimed he set \nfor the fired U.S. attorneys. As one of my colleagues said to Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales at his hearing, ``Why should you not be judged by the \nsame standards at which you judged these dismissed U.S. Attorneys?''\n  Madam President, our Attorney General would fail that standard. How \ncan he oversee our Federal Bureau of Investigation when the FBI \nDirector had to warn FBI agents guarding the Attorney General not to \nobey his instructions, when he was White House Counsel scurrying over \nto the ailing Attorney General's hospital room to try to get his \nsignature on a document?\n  You can say this is just a partisan exercise, but it may take a \ndecade to repair the damage Attorney General Gonzales has caused. Every \nday that passes without his resignation is one more day before the \nrepair has begun. From the perspective of the Bush administration, I \ncan see how a wounded, grateful Attorney General on a very short leash \nmay be just as they want as they try to exit Washington without further \nindictments. But that is not the Attorney General America needs to \nmaintain the best traditions of the Department of Justice through \nadministration and administration and administration, through \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, and to ensure the fair administration \nof justice in our country.\n  As a former U.S. attorney who has profound respect for the Department \nof Justice and its thousands of career employees, I believe America \ndeserves an Attorney General who will lead by example, who will set the \nvery highest standard for himself and his staff, who will do his best \nto keep politics out of the justice system and will restore the \ncountry's faith and confidence in one of its most important \ninstitutions.\n  Please set aside politics and let us stand up for the Department of \nJustice. Let us restore a vital institution in American life. Please \nlet us vote for\n\n[[Page S7437]]\n\ncloture and proceed to do what our duty calls for us to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of cloture on the \nmotion to proceed. After months of troubling and even shocking \ndisclosures about the U.S. Attorney firings and the politicization of \nthe Department of Justice, it is important for the Senate to go on \nrecord on the question of whether the Attorney General should continue \nin his post. This vote may end up being our only vote on this matter, \nbut since the resolution itself is nonbinding, this vote, though \nprocedural in nature, is sufficient to inform the Nation exactly what \nthe Senate's position is. Those who vote against cloture plainly are \ncomfortable with the Attorney General remaining right where he is. \nThose of us who vote for cloture are not.\n  In January 2005, I voted against Alberto Gonzales to be the Attorney \nGeneral because I was not convinced he would put the rule of law, and \nthe interests of the country, above those of the President and the \nadministration. Unfortunately, those concerns have been realized over \nand over. It is not just the U.S. Attorneys scandal. In recent months, \nthe Department's Inspector General issued a very troubling report on \nNational Security Letters. The Attorney General, of course, had assured \nus that the Department could be trusted to respect civil liberties in \nits exercise of the unprecedented powers it was given in the Patriot \nAct.\n  Perhaps the Attorney General's biggest failure concerns the \nwarrantless wiretapping program. When he came before the Judiciary \nCommittee for his confirmation hearing, he gave very misleading \ntestimony to a question I asked concerning whether the position the \nadministration had taken with respect to torture might also allow it to \nauthorize warrantless wiretaps. He called my question ``hypothetical.'' \nJust less than a year later, we found out that the administration had \nin fact taken precisely that position for years.\n  His appearance before the Judiciary Committee last year to discuss \nthe legal justification of the wiretapping program was one of the \nweakest and least convincing I have ever seen. And the recent testimony \nof former Deputy Attorney General James Comey concerning Mr. Gonzales's \nbedside visit to former Attorney General John Ashcroft raises serious \nquestions about his veracity at that hearing. It also raises questions \nabout his ethics, and, once again, his respect for the rule of law.\n  But it is not just his commitment to the rule of law and his \nwillingness to tell the truth to Congress that troubles me about this \nAttorney General's tenure. At his most recent appearance before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee to discuss the U.S. Attorney firings, I \nquestioned him about whether he did some of the most basic things that \nyou would expect a manager to do if he delegated to his staff a major \nproject like deciding which of 93 presidential appointees to top law \nenforcement positions to fire. He could not recall doing any of them. \nWe know that the Attorney General was involved in this process and made \nthe final decisions on the firing plan, but he can't seem to remember \nmuch beyond that, even though it was only a few months ago that this \nall took place. He has failed in a very significant way. He should \nresign.\n  With the snowballing problems at the Justice Department, it could \nhardly be more plain that the Attorney General has lost the confidence \nof Congress and the public. As Mr. Comey said in response to my written \nquestion: ``This entire affair has harmed the Department and its \nreputation.'' The Department of Justice should always be above \nreproach. The AG should step down for the good of the country. Since he \nwill not, the Senate should express its judgment, on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as a former U.S. Attorney for 12 years \nand as an assistant U.S. attorney for over 2 years, I am well aware \nthat U.S. attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President and that \nthey are appointed through a political process that involves home State \nsenators conferring with the President of the United States before the \nnomination is made, and which involves confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\n  As I have observed previously, the matter involving Attorney General \nGonzales concerning the appointment and removal of certain U.S. \nattorneys arose because at some point there was interest in a \nsubstantial change in the persons holding the offices of U.S. attorneys \nthroughout the country. Apparently, some wanted a large number of \nchanges and others did not. To them, it may have seemed like an easy \nthing to do. The President would simply just remove them and appoint \nothers.\n  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales had no previous experience in the \nDepartment of Justice at any time in his career and seemed to have very \nlittle interest in who were serving as U.S. attorneys. This was an \nerror on his part. Attorney General Gonzales simply did not understand \nthat the removal of a U.S. attorney is always a delicate and difficult \nprocess. First, U.S. attorneys have Senatorial support. Their \nappointment was initially cleared by the U.S. Senator for that State \nand often the Congressman from that district. Secondly, they have local \nsupport among their friends and constituents and they often have built \nup strong support among local, State, and Federal law enforcement \nagencies. Those bonds are often strong and the removal of a U.S. \nattorney often causes concern among those law enforcement agencies and \ngroups. They have also often gained support in the local community with \nchildrens' advocacy groups, crime prevention groups, and victims' \nrights groups.\n  Finally, almost every U.S. attorney will have one, sometimes more, \nsensitive cases that are ongoing at any given time. Anyone familiar \nwith the process will know that removing a U.S. attorney who is in the \nprocess of handling some high profile criminal case will often result \nin quite a bit of political pushback, even if the U.S. attorney has \nvery little hands-on involvement with the case.\n  One of the problems that the Attorney General had was that he did not \nfully understand these dangers in removing U.S. attorneys because he \nhad never been involved in it as a member of the Department of Justice. \nHe simply did not comprehend the seriousness of the issue with which he \nwas dealing. If he had, he would have spent a great deal more time on \nit than he did. He would not have delegated it to his assistants--many \nof them young and also not experienced--in the reality of this process \neither.\n  As a result, there occurred an unseemly series of events that \nreflected poorly on Attorney General Gonzales and other members of the \nDepartment of Justice, and which has damaged the reputation of the \nDepartment of Justice. This was not a small matter but a very important \nmatter. I think now he realizes the importance of this process and is \nsincerely apologetic for allowing it to develop the way it did. He is \nalso apologetic for the way that he responded to the inquiries made \nabout the proposed U.S. attorney changes.\n  Let me insert, parenthetically, that much of the criticism leveled \nagainst the Attorney General, the President and his aides has been \nexaggerated and sometimes quite inaccurate. But, if it comes from a \nmember of Congress or a Senator, that means you never have to say you \nare sorry. However, if the Attorney General, in responding to attacks, \nmakes explanations that are in any way less than fully accurate one can \nexpect that he will be attacked vociferously as attempting to mislead \nor worse. Unfortunately, there is a double standard and it often \nresults in unfairness and this is one of those cases. Many of the \ncomplaints against Attorney General Gonzales have been very unfair and \nunfortunate.\n  After this spasm developed, I was worried about the Attorney \nGeneral's capacity to lead the Department of Justice effectively and \nexpressed concern as to whether or not he would be able to assemble an \nable staff to complete his term and whether or not it would be, in sum, \nbetter for the Department of Justice that he step aside. I publicly \nsuggested that he and the President meet together and discuss this \nissue with frankness. I quoted the Attorney General himself as saying \nthat the matter was not about the Attorney General, but was really \nabout what was best for the Department of Justice.\n  It now appears that the Attorney General and the President have \nconcluded that the Attorney General committed no offense, committed no \ncrime\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\nfor which he should be impeached, and has not made any error sufficient \nthat he should no longer remain as Attorney General. The Attorney \nGeneral's lack of experience in certain aspects of the Department of \nJustice were well known before he was confirmed by the Senate. In my \npersonal view, there is no Cabinet member that requires more personal \nexperience and detailed knowledge of the agency they will lead than the \nAttorney General. It is a very, very tough job and the Attorney General \nmust be able to personally handle a large portfolio of issues and at \nthe same time have a comprehensive grasp of complex legal issues and \nlegal precedents involving the Department of Justice. For example, \nAttorney General Janet Reno was constantly struggling in the office. \nBefore becoming the Attorney General, she had simply been a county \ndistrict attorney and had never been involved in the kinds of issues \nshe faced as Attorney General. In the future, I expect to be far more \nassertive in the confirmation process as I will insist that any \nAttorney General nominee have significant relevant experience.\n  In conclusion, I conclude that there is not cause for any censure of \nAttorney General Gonzales and I conclude that there is no basis \nwhatsoever for him to be impeached.\n  It has been 120 years since a no-confidence vote has been had on any \nCabinet member. That is something they do in Europe. It is not \nsomething we do in the United States. This no-confidence resolution is \nnot necessary, it is harmful to our system, and should not be a \nprecedent in the future. Frankly, it is driven by politics and not by \nwhat is best for the Department of Justice because this process will \ngreatly magnify any errors that he has made and create a false \nimpression. Attorney General Gonzales is a good man who sincerely wants \nto meet the highest standards of the Department of Justice.\n  The process in our government is that the President nominates for the \nposition of Attorney General, and the Senate votes to confirm them or \nnot. After that confirmation, unless he is subject to impeachment, it \nis not good policy for the Senate to rush in and express formal \nopinions about the Cabinet officer and his or her performance. \nTherefore, I have, after considerable thought, concluded this \nresolution is bad policy and precedent, and is unfairly damaging to the \nDepartment of Justice. It is a political overreach and should not be \npassed. Therefore, I oppose the resolution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, when Alberto Gonzales came before the \nSenate as the President's nominee for Attorney General, many of us were \nconcerned that he would not be able to distinguish between his past \nrole as White House Counsel and his new role as Attorney General. \nDuring his service as counsel to the President, he had assisted the \nPresident in promulgating a series of disastrous policies that ran \nroughshod over the rule of law and damaged the United States in the \neyes of the world. He refused to give detainees the protections of the \nGeneva Conventions, calling them ``quaint.'' He facilitated the \nestablishment of Guantanamo and denied other basic legal protections to \ndetainees. He approved an interpretation of the law that was \ninconsistent with international agreements. He authorized the use of \ntorture, a step that led to the horrors of Abu Ghraib. At every turn, \nhe promoted an extreme view of the President's authority. Yet, when he \ncame before the committee seeking confirmation, he assured us: ``With \nthe consent of the Senate, I will no longer represent only the White \nHouse; I will represent the United States of America and its people. I \nunderstand the differences between the two roles.''\n  That assurance has proven hollow. On issue after issue, Mr. Gonzales \nhas singlemindedly served the President's agenda, without any respect \nfor the broader responsibilities of the Attorney General. He has \ncontinued to promote an extreme view of the President's power as \nCommander in Chief to authorize warrantless eavesdropping in violation \nof the law, secret detentions, abuse of detainees, and violations of \nthe Geneva Conventions. He believes that the President can issue \nsigning statements that nullify duly enacted statutes whenever they \nmight limit the President's discretion. As Attorney General, he has \nused the enormous power of his office to promote the agenda of the \nWhite House.\n  The current U.S. attorney scandal has revealed the devastating legacy \nof Mr. Gonzales's tenure as Attorney General. We now have a Department \nof Justice that is wide open to partisan influence and has abandoned \nmany of the basic principles that kept the Department independent and \nassured the American people that its decisions were based on the rule \nof law.\n  As a result, the Department of Justice is now embroiled in a scandal \ninvolving the firing of U.S. attorneys, under a process controlled by \ninexperienced, partisan staffers in consultation with the White House. \nU.S. attorneys were targeted for firing because they failed to serve \nthe White House agenda. Karl Rove and the President passed along to the \nAttorney General complaints that U.S. attorneys failed to pursue voter \nfraud. Over the past 5 years, the Department of Justice has actually \npushed hard to prosecute voter fraud, but among the hundreds of \nmillions of votes cast in that period, it has managed to convict only \n86 people nationwide. The pursuit of virtually nonexistent voter fraud \nat the ballot box is part of a Republican effort to suppress the \nlegitimate votes of minority, elderly, and disabled voters. Other \nmeasures taken in this cynical scheme include photo ID laws and purges \nof voter rolls.\n  The conclusion is inescapable that the firings of U.S. attorneys were \npart of an effort to put partisans in charge of U.S. attorney offices \nin key States. New Mexico, Washington, Arkansas and Nevada are all \nclosely contested States. Add those States to which the Attorney \nGeneral sent interim appointees from Washington in the past 2 years--\nFlorida, Missouri, Iowa and Minnesota--and the pattern is clear. \nAttorney General Gonzales, more than any other Attorney General in \nmemory, has tried to turn the Department of Justice into an arm of a \npolitical party.\n  In addition, under his leadership, the Department's hiring procedures \nhave been corrupted by partisan officials who rejected longstanding \nmerit-based hiring procedures and placed political party loyalty ahead \nof legal merit in hiring career attorneys. His Department of Justice \nhas tried to obliterate the distinction between political appointees \nand career civil servants.\n  In his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Gonzales has \nrepeatedly made false statements. He told us the warrantless \neavesdropping program could not be conducted within the limits of The \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Then, on the eve of an \nappearance before the committee, he told us that the program now fits \nwithin FISA. He told us that there had not been significant \ndisagreement over that program, but we now know that as many as 30 \nmembers of the Justice Department were prepared to resign if an earlier \nversion of the program proceeded unchanged. He stated that he had not \nseen memoranda or been involved in discussions about the U.S. attorney \nfirings, but it was later revealed that he did both. He told us that \nonly eight U.S. attorneys had been targeted for firing, but it turns \nout the list was longer. He has said scores of times that he does not \nrecall key meetings and events. With each misstatement and memory \nlapse, the Attorney General's credibility has faded until there is \nnothing left.\n  In the years I have served in this body, I have had the privilege to \nwork with many Attorneys General. The defining quality of the \noutstanding occupants of that office--both Democrats and Republicans--\nhas been an understanding that the law and the evidence trump loyalty \nto a political party or a president. Respect for the rule of law lies \nat the heart of our democracy. If our machinery of justice becomes just \nanother means to preserve and promote the power of the party in office, \nwe have corrupted our democracy. If the American people believe that \npartisanship is driving law enforcement, our system of justice cannot \nsurvive.\n  We need a strong and credible Attorney General who believes deeply in \nour system of justice as we undertake the difficult and essential job \nof restoring the credibility of the Department of Justice. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution of no-confidence as a first step \nin rebuilding the faith of the American people in the Department of \nJustice.\n\n[[Page S7439]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 28 months ago, on February 3, 2005, I voted \nagainst the confirmation of Alberto Gonzales to be the Attorney General \nof the United States. Hallelujah, Amen! Eight days before that, I was \none of 13 Senators who voted against the nomination of Condoleezza Rice \nto be the U.S. Secretary of State. And, if the Senate had been \npermitted to vote on the nomination of Paul Wolfowitz to head the World \nBank, I would have voted against that nomination, too.\n  I am proud of my votes against confirmation of these failed \narchitects of the unconstitutional war in Iraq. Their flawed policies \nhave cost our Nation dearly. I shudder to contemplate the billions and \neven trillions of dollars and the decades of effort that it will take \nto correct their extraordinary errors in judgment. These are the same \nadministration officials, led by Alberto Gonzales here at home, who \nhave done everything they can to abolish our Nation's carefully \ncalibrated separation of powers and to undermine Americans' civil \nliberties. Based on ongoing errors in judgment and mistakes made on his \nwatch, I remain convinced that my vote against Alberto Gonzales was in \nthe best interests of this country.\n  It is, therefore, not surprising that I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of S.J. Res. 14. This resolution expresses the sense of the \nSenate that Attorney General Gonzales no longer holds the confidence of \nthe Senate and of the American people. Frankly, he never held my \nconfidence. Not from day one, and I will tell you why that is so.\n  When President Bush nominated Alberto Gonzales to be the U.S. \nAttorney General, the President stated that Mr. Gonzales, as White \nHouse counsel, had a ``sharp intellect,'' and that it was White House \ncounsel's ``sound judgment'' that had, in the President's words, \n``helped shape our policies in the war on terror.''\n  Sharp intellect and sound judgment? I have heard of damning with \nfaint praise, but applying those words to someone who has had a major \nrole in the reckless and incompetent way in which this administration \nhas waged its so-called war on terror is hardly a compliment.\n  But don't expect Alberto Gonzales to take responsibility for what \nhappened on his watch. Throughout his time in this administration, \nwhenever Mr. Gonzales has been questioned about what he knows about \nimproper conduct, his standard and repetitive response, in the words of \nthe fictional Sergeant Schultz is simply: ``I know nothing.'' When \nquestioned about who made the decision to fire U.S. attorneys for what \nappear to be purely political reasons, he implausibly states that while \nhe signed off on the decision, he was not really responsible because he \nwas out of the loop.\n  At a press conference on March 13, Attorney General Gonzales stated \nthat he knew nothing of the scandal surrounding the U.S. attorneys, \nbecause he was, in his words, ``not involved in seeing any memos, was \nnot involved in any discussions about what was going on,'' and, he \nsaid, ``that's basically what I knew as the Attorney General.'' Mr. \nPresident, that is not an impressive response. Even the Attorney \nGeneral now says his comment was ``too broad'' and that he \n``misspoke.'' He now admits that he did have some involvement. But he \nsaid this only after the Justice Department released e-mails and \nmemoranda which showed that he had, in fact, been involved in \ndiscussions about the firings.\n  He also claimed that he is not really responsible, because, in his \nwords, ``in an organization of 110,000 people,'' he said, ``I am not \naware of every bit of information that passes through the halls of \njustice, nor am I aware of all decisions.'' Now that seems an odd \nassertion, considering that he is, in fact--if you will allow me to use \nthe President's terminology--the top ``decider'' at the U.S. Department \nof Justice.\n  When the Attorney General testified before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on April 19, 2007, he continued to argue that he was simply \nout of touch--an assertion that has been disputed by the two employees \nhe had charged with filling the U.S. attorney positions with party \nloyalists, D. Kyle Sampson and Monica Goodling.\n  On May 15, 2007, speaking before the National Press Club, Mr. \nGonzales made yet another effort to shift the blame for any wrongdoing. \nBut this time he chose a new victim. He said, ``You have to remember, \nat the end of the day, the recommendations [to fire the U.S. Attorneys] \nreflected the views of the deputy attorney general,'' meaning Paul \nMcNulty. But the Associated Press reported immediately thereafter that \ndocuments released from the Justice Department showed that McNulty was \nnot closely involved in picking all of the U.S. attorneys who were put \non the list. Instead, it was a job mostly driven by the Attorney \nGeneral's own, two hand-picked subordinates, Sampson and Goodling.\n  I would invite those who believe that Alberto Gonzales did not know \nwhat was happening in his own Department to join me on a quick trip \ndown memory lane. Let me recount a section of the speech that I \ndelivered on the Senate floor just prior to voting against his \nconfirmation to be Attorney General. I reminded my colleagues at that \ntime that Judge Gonzales had admitted being physically present at \nmeetings in his office to determine which acts against enemy combatants \nshould be outlawed as torture.\n  But at his confirmation hearing, he disavowed having any role in the \nadministration's initial decision to define torture extremely narrowly. \nOn January 6, 2005, he was asked by a member of the Judiciary Committee \nwhether he had ever chaired a meeting in which he discussed with \nJustice Department attorneys the legitimacy of such interrogation \ntechniques. He was asked if, in the meetings he attended, there was \ndiscussion of strapping detainees to boards and holding them under \nwater as if to drown them. He testified that there were such meetings, \nand while he did remember having had some ``discussions'' with Justice \nDepartment attorneys, he simply could not recall what he told them in \nthose meetings. He stated that, as White House counsel, he might have \nattended those meetings, but it was not his role but that of the \nJustice Department to determine which interrogation techniques were \nlawful.\n\n  In other words, he was saying then, just as he is saying today: Don't \nhold me accountable! Don't blame me if mistakes were made! And, then, \njust like today, he didn't point the finger of blame at just one other \nvictim. He spread the blame around. While he admitted he'd made some \nmistakes as White House counsel, he attempted to further deflect \nresponsibility for his actions by saying that a number of what he \ncalled other ``operational agencies'' also took responsibility for \nmaking flawed decisions on prisoner interrogation techniques.\n  At his confirmation hearing, he said:\n\n       I have a recollection that we had some discussions in my \n     office, but let me be very clear with the Committee. It is \n     not my job to decide which types of methods of obtaining \n     information from terrorists would be the most effective. That \n     job responsibility falls to folks within the agencies. It is \n     also not my job to make the ultimate decision about whether \n     or not those methods would, in fact, meet the requirements of \n     the anti-torture statute. That would be the job for the \n     agencies . . . I viewed it as their responsibility to make a \n     decision as to whether or not a procedure or method would, in \n     fact, be lawful.\n  Whether on the issue of torture or of firing U.S. attorneys, when it \ncomes to Alberto Gonzales taking responsibility for his actions--as \nYogi Berra would say--it's deja vu all over again. One wishes that \nJudge Gonzales could tell us, just once, what his job is, rather than \nalways telling us only what it is not.\n  Article II, section 3 of the United States Constitution, as head of \nthe Executive Branch, the President has a legal duty to take care that \nthe laws be faithfully executed. The Constitution does not say that the \nPresident or his officers ``should'' or ``may'' undertake that \nresponsibility: it clearly states that the President ``shall take Care \nthat the Laws be faithfully executed.'' The President and his Chief Law \nEnforcement Officer at the Justice Department must be held accountable \nnot only when they fail to faithfully execute the law, but also when \nthey or their subordinates attempt to undermine, ignore, or gut the \nlaw.\n  The Attorney General has a credibility problem, and the American \npeople know it. Despite his assertions to the contrary, he continues to \ncontribute in large measure to the flawed policies and decision making \nthat have\n\n[[Page S7440]]\n\nflowed from this administration over the past seven years. For all of \nthese reasons, I urge my colleagues to support S.J. Res. 14.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 14, a \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate that Attorney General \nGonzales has lost the confidence of Congress and the American people. \nThis is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Now, Madam President, let me initially say that I was doing other \nthings and was unable to listen to the remarks of some of my Republican \ncolleagues. I apologize for that. I have had a briefing as to what they \nsaid. They have chosen to impugn the motives of the sponsor of this \nresolution, the senior Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer. I work very \nclosely with this man. I have worked in government most all of my adult \nlife. Rarely have I seen anybody--in fact, I have never seen anyone \nwith the intellectual capacity of Chuck Schumer from New York and his \nability to understand what is going on in the State of New York and in \nour country. Any suggestions that were made to impugn his integrity are \nunwarranted, out of line, and unfair.\n  Senator Schumer is a member of the Judiciary Committee. He is a \nlawyer. As a member of that Judiciary Committee and as a lawyer who \ncares deeply about the rule of law and the reputation of the Justice \nDepartment, he had an obligation to do what he did. There are others \nwho joined with him. Senator Feinstein was out front on this issue with \nSenator Schumer, as were others. The chairman of the committee, Senator \nLeahy, has been with them every step of the way.\n  In my opinion, his work in this investigation has been commendable.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the majority leader yield for a comment?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I tell the leader and the senior Senator \nfrom New York, I know he has worked hard on this. Nobody has had more \nroadblocks thrown in front of him than the Senator from New York. He \nhas asked legitimate questions. Many times, his legitimate questions \nwere not answered by the Department of Justice. They refused to answer. \nWe had to actually subpoena them to get answers that should have been \nsent to him by return courier. He has acted in the best sense of \noversight. He has done what one should do in oversight. He should not \nbe criticized for that.\n  Maybe those who do the criticizing should ask why they allowed a \nrubberstamp Senate under their watch to continue for 6 years, with \nconduct that certainly borders on the criminal and certainly reflects \nthe unethical goings-on at the Department of Justice, and they didn't \nsay one word about it.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate very much the Senator from \nVermont, the chairman of our committee, for standing up for what is \nright. That is what he is doing.\n  The Senate has a responsibility to express its displeasure with a \nCabinet officer who has grossly mismanaged his responsibilities and \nfailed the American people in the process. This is the one and only \nmechanism we have, short of impeachment, to address malfeasance of a \nhigh-ranking Federal official.\n  Along with the Department of Defense and State, the Department of \nJustice is the most important Cabinet agency we have. The Attorney \nGeneral is responsible for enforcing Federal law, protecting civil \nrights, and, most importantly, ensuring fidelity to the Constitution of \nthe United States.\n  Madam President, in my young days as a lawyer and public official in \nNevada, during the 1960s, I saw the critical role the Justice \nDepartment can play in what is going on in a State. In those days--the \nearly sixties--a person of color, a Black man or woman, could not work \nin a Strip hotel and could not work in downtown hotels. They weren't \nthere unless they were a porter, a janitor--someplace where they could \nnot be seen. Thousands of people, Black and White, protested that \ndiscrimination, but it didn't matter until the Justice Department \nstepped in. They stepped in and forced it. There was a consent decree \nentered into between the State of Nevada--I was there. I was Lieutenant \nGovernor, and I helped negotiate that along with Governor O'Callaghan \nand the attorney assigned to do that. We worked on that for weeks and \nweeks. But for the Justice Department, that integration of those large \nhotels in Nevada would have taken place much later. That is what the \nJustice Department is all about. Major civil rights battles in Las \nVegas over integrating the strip would never have been determined in \nfavor of the people of color but for the Justice Department.\n  You see, the Justice Department is color blind, and that is the way \nit is supposed to be. It wasn't a Democratic Department of Justice or \nRepublican Department of Justice. It was an American, a U.S. Department \nof Justice. Its lawyers were fighting for the most American ideal--the \nright of all Americans to participate in our democracy.\n  What a proud history this is. What a source of pride it is for our \ncountry what the Justice Department in decades past has done. But today \nunder this President, President Bush, and under this Attorney General, \nAlberto Gonzales, the Department of Justice has lost its way.\n  Now the Justice Department is just another arm of the Karl Rove \npolitical machine, where partisanship earns patronage and independence \nearns contempt.\n  Today's Justice Department is dysfunctional. I so appreciate the \nstatement made by the former attorney general of the State of Rhode \nIsland, Senator Whitehouse. He laid it out. He has a feeling of what \nthe Justice Department is all about. He spoke from his heart. The \nDepartment of Justice's credibility is shredded. Its morale is at an \nall-time low, and the blame for that tragic deterioration lies squarely \non the shoulders of two people: the President of the United States and \nthe Attorney General of the United States, Alberto Gonzales.\n  We are here today to discuss Alberto Gonzales. Over the past 6 \nmonths, congressional oversight has revealed the many ways the crass \npolitical calculations in that White House have pervaded the personnel \nand prosecutorial decisions of the Bush-Gonzales Justice Department. \nRemember, for 4 years, this was a big rubberstamp, this thing called \nCongress.\n  The careers of many fine men and women, lawyers, have been destroyed. \nOne of those is a man from Nevada by the name of Daniel Bogden, a \ncareer prosecutor. He worked his way up as a line prosecutor in Washoe \nCounty, Reno, NV, and became an assistant U.S. attorney. He--I have \nspoken with him--wanted to spend his life being a prosecutor, going \nafter people who violate the law. That is over with. Once you are \nremoved from being a U.S. attorney, you can no longer work as a deputy \nU.S. attorney.\n  He, I repeat, was a career prosecutor. When my Republican friend and \ncolleague, John Ensign, recommended him to be U.S. attorney for Nevada, \nhe reached what he thought was the pinnacle of his career. Oh, was he \nmistaken. He has been humiliated, embarrassed, denigrated by this \nJustice Department for no reason. He worked hard. No one questioned his \nwork ethic.\n  My son was a deputy U.S. attorney with Daniel Bogden. They worked \ntogether. A fine lawyer is Daniel Bogden. He worked hard as our U.S. \nattorney to protect Nevadans from crimes, drugs and white-collar crimes \nand earned a wide respect from law enforcement agencies throughout the \nState.\n  I repeat, he was fired. To this day, no satisfactory explanation has \nbeen provided to Dan Bogden and the people of Nevada.\n  In light of this evidence, we learned that other U.S. attorneys had \nbeen fired at the same time because they failed to pursue partisan \npolitical cases. So without any question, there is every reason to \nbelieve Dan Bogden suffered the same fate. He was fired for \nadministering justice in Nevada in an evenhanded, nonpolitical way, as \nhe thought as a prosecutor he was supposed to do.\n  I can remember as a young lawyer, I had a part-time job as a city \nattorney in Henderson, NV. It is now the second largest city in the \nState. It wasn't then. I prosecuted criminal cases. I came back to my \nlaw firm and I was bragging. That is the wrong word. I was saying: Man, \nthat case, I can't imagine why that judge did that. That wasn't a very \ngood case at all. One of the people\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\nI worked with said: Harry, that is not your responsibility.\n  I will use leader time now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, he said: Your job is not to convict \npeople. It is to do the right thing for the people of the State of \nNevada, the city of Henderson, NV.\n  That is a lesson somebody should have given Alberto Gonzales before \nhe took the job as Attorney General. Dan Bogden was fired for doing his \njob exactly the way it is supposed to be done.\n  When he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales couldn't even say why Bogden was included on the list \nto be fired. Think about that: A man's career ruined, and the man who \nfired him or had him fired didn't even know why he was fired.\n  His lack of memory was astounding. He couldn't recall basic facts, \neven meetings with the President. Writing in the New York Times, \nProfessor Frank Bowman, a former Federal prosecutor, said, talking \nabout Gonzales:\n\n       The truth is almost surely that Mr. Gonzales's \n     forgetfulness is feigned--a calculated ploy to block \n     legitimate congressional inquiry into questionable decisions \n     made by the Department of Justice, White House officials, \n     and, quite possibly, the President himself.\n\n  If Albert Gonzales was not truthful with the Congress, he deserves to \nbe fired--not Bogden but Gonzales.\n  On the other hand, if the Attorney General was not involved in the \ndecision to fire Bogden and others, he is guilty of gross negligence \nand deserves to be fired. He turned over the awesome power of his \noffice to a handful of young, inexperienced ideologues and allowed them \nto carry out a political campaign from the once-hallowed halls of the \nJustice Department.\n  But the Attorney General's misdeeds extend well beyond politically \ndriven personnel decisions. As White House counsel, he presided over \nthe development of antiterror tactics that have undermined the rule of \nlaw and made Americans less safe. We know now from former Deputy \nAttorney General Jim Comey the Attorney General tried to take advantage \nof John Ashcroft's serious illness--was sick in a hospital bed--to \nobtain Justice Department approval for an illegal surveillance program. \nHe took papers there for him to sign.\n  Time and time again, Alberto Gonzales has proven beyond a doubt his \nutter lack of judgment and independence is foremost in his mind. \nWhether it is tortured reasoning allowing torture or his support of \ndomestic surveillance, firing unfairly U.S. attorneys, hiring \nimmigration judges based on their political affiliation--there is a \nlong list. But let's talk about his being one of the masters of torture \nin our country.\n  I have a law review article from Columbia Law Journal, one of the \nfinest law schools in America, the name of which is ``Drop by Drop: \nForgetting the History of Water Torture in U.S. Courts.'' This is an \narticle written by Judge Evan Wallach, one of the foremost experts in \nthe world on the law of the war. I am only going to read the last \nparagraph of this article. He goes into some detail in the article, \ntalking about how this Attorney General's office, this White House \ncounsel, this administration has allowed torture to be part of what \nAmericans do with detainees and others.\n\n  Here is what Judge Wallach said:\n\n       If we remember what we said and did when our military \n     personnel were victims, if we remember our response when they \n     were perpetrators, how can our government possibly opine that \n     the use of water torture is within the bounds of law? To do \n     so is beneath contempt; it is beyond redemption; and it is a \n     repudiation of the rule of law that in our origins was the \n     core principle of governance which distinguished our nation \n     from the crowned dictatorships of the European continent.\n\n  That is the legacy of this administration and this Attorney General, \nthat law review articles are being written to talk about how awful this \nAttorney General is and what he has allowed to happen.\n\n       To do so is beneath contempt; it is beyond redemption; and \n     it is a repudiation of the rule of law that in our origins \n     was the core principle of governance which distinguished our \n     nation from the crowned dictatorships of the European \n     continent.\n\n  Alberto Gonzales is profoundly unworthy to hold one of the highest \nand most important offices of our great country. I urge my colleagues \nto support this resolution reflecting the facts before us. I urge \nAttorney General Gonzales to resign his office, to give the Department \nof Justice a chance it needs to recover from his catastrophic tenure. \nIf he does not, I urge President Bush to finally remove him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 14, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to the consideration of S.J. Res. 14, \n     expressing the sense of the Senate that Attorney General \n     Alberto Gonzales no longer holds the confidence of the Senate \n     and of the American people.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nRepublican leader shall control the time from 5 to 5:20, and the \nmajority leader shall control the time from 5:20 to 5:30.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: The Republican \nleader controls the time from 5:10 to 5:20, as I understand?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, it is \nfrom 5 to 5:20.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that those of us in favor of \nthis resolution be given a half hour to debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I understand there is a misunderstanding. \nThey weren't supposed to start until 5:10, but the order says 5 \no'clock, which would only give us 10 minutes to debate this motion.\n  Let me begin and not waste any further time. I rise in support of the \nmotion to proceed to a vote of no confidence on Attorney General \nAlberto Gonzales. It is a fair measure. I know it is one with few \nprecedents, but it is called for today because the dire situation at \nthe Department of Justice is also without precedent. The level of \ndisarray and dysfunction, the crisis of credibility, and the failure of \nleadership are all without precedent. It is a simple measure we have \nbefore us. Let me read it.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Attorney General Alberto \n     Gonzales no longer holds the confidence of the Senate and of \n     the American people.\n\n  Are there any Members here who don't agree with that sentiment? If \nso, I haven't heard them. Senators are not a shy lot. Their silence on \nthis point is deafening. So if Senators cast their votes with their \nconscience, they would speak with near unanimity that there is no \nconfidence in the Attorney General. Their united voice would \nundoubtedly dislodge the Attorney General from a post he should no \nlonger hold. But we may not have a unanimous vote here today, I am \ntold. That is a puzzle because no matter what standard one applies, no \nmatter what criteria one uses, the Attorney General cannot enjoy the \nconfidence of the Senate. He certainly doesn't of the American people.\n  The bill of particulars against the Attorney General is staggering. \nOn the question of the Attorney General's credibility, the record \nspeaks for itself. Repeatedly, the Attorney General has misled the \nCongress, misled the American people, and given incredible explanations \nfor the U.S. attorney firings. The Attorney General's comments have \nbeen a series of shifting reactions and restatements. Is this \nconfidence-inspiring conduct from the Nation's chief law enforcement \nofficer?\n  We learned that Attorney General Gonzales was personally involved in \nthe firing plan after being told he wasn't. We learned that the White \nHouse was involved after being told it wasn't. We learned that Karl \nRove was involved after being told he wasn't. We learned that political \nconsiderations were paramount after being told they weren't. Then, when \nthe Attorney General finally had the opportunity to set the record \nstraight on April 19, 2007, what did he do? More than 70 times he \nanswered ``I don't know'' when asked the most basic questions about how \nhe came to fire 10 percent of the Nation's U.S. attorneys. The Attorney \nGeneral admitted he didn't know the reasons why several U.S. attorneys \nwere fired but insisted in the very next breath that he knew they were \nnot fired for improper reasons. Does that inspire confidence? One of \nour most mild-mannered Members, Senator Pryor, believes he was lied to \ndirectly by the Attorney General, and he has good reason to think so.\n  Time after time, the Attorney General has shown he doesn't have the \ncredibility to lead the Department. This is not a liberal or \nconservative assessment. This is not a Democratic or Republican \nassessment. It is a universal one. Listen to the words of the \nconservative National Review magazine, which wrote on March 28:\n\n       What little credibility Gonzales had is gone . . . Alberto \n     Gonzales should resign. The Justice Department needs a fresh \n     start.\n\n  That is on credibility.\n  On the Attorney General's lack of commitment to independence and the \nrule of law, the record is also disturbingly clear. The Attorney \nGeneral has long shown that he misperceives his role. He forgets that \nhe is the people's lawyer, not just the President's. If one needs a \nsingle image to symbolize the Attorney General's contempt for the rule \nof law, it is that of Alberto Gonzales bending over John Ashcroft's \nsickbed on the night of March 10, 2004. It is the picture of then-White \nHouse Counsel Gonzales trying to take advantage of a very ill man who \ndidn't even have the powers of the Attorney General to approve a \nprogram that the Department of Justice could not certify was legal.\n  That example, unfortunately, has plenty of company. Consider the \nimage of Attorney General Gonzales in March of this year making Mrs. \nGoodling feel ``uncomfortable''--her word--by going through the \nsequence of events related to the U.S. attorney firings. How often do \npeople comfort someone by reviewing their recollection of events that \nare subject to congressional investigation? Add to those examples the \ndocumented violations with respect to national security letters and \nother admitted abuses in connection with the PATRIOT Act. How can such \nleadership inspire confidence?\n  Rule of law in the Gonzales regime, sadly, has apparently been an \nafterthought rather than a bedrock principle. Again, there is no \nliberal or conservative or Democratic or Republican position on the \nAttorney General's lack of independence and commitment to rule of law; \nit is virtually unanimous. Consider the words of the conservative group \nthe American Freedom Agenda:\n\n       Attorney General Gonzales has proven an unsuitable steward \n     of the law and should resign for the good of the country.\n  On the question of whether the Department has been improperly \npoliticized, the record is again clear.\n  Attorney General Gonzales has presided over perhaps the most \npoliticized Department in history. We have learned that under Alberto \nGonzales, being a ``loyal Bushie'' was more important than being a \nconsummate professional. We have learned that U.S. attorneys who were \nperforming their duties admirably were apparently dismissed because of \nunfounded allegations by political figures, allegations that were never \ninvestigated or never proven. We have learned that an unprecedented \nvoter fraud case was brought in Missouri on the eve of an election in \nclear violation of the Department's own policy. We have learned that \ndeep suspicions about improper politicizing even at the entry level of \nthe professional ranks were correct. We have learned from the Attorney \nGeneral's own former senior counselor Monica Goodling that she\n\n[[Page S7433]]\n\n``crossed the line'' in considering partisan affiliation in filling \ncareer positions at the Justice Department--career positions, not \npolitical positions.\n  The Office of Professional Responsibility and the Office of Inspector \nGeneral have now opened investigations relating to the hiring of \nimmigration judges, civil rights lawyers, and Honors Program attorneys. \nAll of this, of course, occurred under the Attorney General's watch. \nEither the Attorney General knew about these potentially illegal \nactivities and did nothing or he was oblivious to what was going on \nbeneath his own nose. Either way, Mr. Gonzales is responsible for a \ndeeply political culture at the Department, unprecedented in modern \ntimes. As former Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey has said, these \nkinds of blows to the reputation of the Department will be hard to \novercome. Does that kind of leadership inspire confidence?\n  Finally, given all of this, on the basic question of competence and \neffectiveness, the Attorney General has proven himself to lack the \nleadership ability needed to right the Department. By every account, \nthe Attorney General's handling of the U.S. attorney firings has been \ncatastrophic. Morale at the Department is at an alltime low. How can we \nhave confidence in an Attorney General who can't get his story \nstraight? How can we have confidence in an Attorney General who still \ncan't tell us why 10 percent of the Nation's U.S. attorneys were fired? \nHow can we have confidence in an Attorney General who would allow his \ntop staff to take the fall for his own failings? How can we have \nconfidence in an Attorney General who allowed improper and possibly \nillegal political hiring to take place?\n  Given the crisis of confidence and credibility, given the abysmal \nrecord of trampling the rule of law and longtime standards of \nnonpolitical hiring, the vote today should be an easy one. Some will \nclaim they are opposing the motion because they say this vote was \ncalled for political reasons. This vote is not about politics. If this \nwere all about politics, it would be easy to sit back, let the Attorney \nGeneral remain, cast aspersions on him for the next 18 months, and reap \nthe political benefits. But the Department of Justice is too important, \nand we have an obligation to do everything we can in a bipartisan way \nto demand new leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, we have had some timing difficulties. \nWe have only had about 10 minutes to debate this resolution.\n  Might I ask the minority leader a question? What is his pleasure? I \nhad been told he was coming at 5:10, but the agreement says 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, my understanding is I am to speak at \n5. I have a leadership meeting at 5:15. I have a time problem. I do not \nseek to get in front of the Senator from New York, but I really need to \nspeak at 5 o'clock, at the time I was anticipating speaking.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nminority leader be given his 15 minutes now, that then I be given \nanother 10 minutes to finish my remarks, and the Senator from Rhode \nIsland be given 10 minutes to speak, and that we vote immediately \nthereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, the \nSenator from Mississippi and I are going to--I guess the Senators from \nTexas and Mississippi and I are going to divide the 15 minutes. Madam \nPresident, provided that Senator Lott and I could divide the 15 \nminutes, and Senator Hutchison could get an additional 4 minutes, then \nI would be agreeable to the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would \nadd to the request--Senator Reid wishes 10 minutes at the conclusion of \nthe debate. So adding the 15 minutes for the minority leader, divided \nwith the minority whip from Mississippi, and 4 minutes for the Senator \nfrom Texas, 10 minutes for myself, 10 minutes for the Senator from \nRhode Island, and 10 minutes for the Senator from Nevada, I ask that we \nhave that time and then we vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, when \nwill the vote commence?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will commence at 5:49.\n  Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, there are four ways to become a \nSenator: by appointment, by special election, by winning an open seat, \nor by defeating an incumbent.\n  My good friend from New York, who has been speaking, and I came to \nthe Senate the same way: by defeating an incumbent. That way is often \nthe hardest, so I am sure the Senator remembers his 1998 Senate race \nagainst our former colleague, Senator Al D'Amato.\n  It was quite a race. The Senator from New York surely remembers one \nof his criticisms of Senator D'Amato: that Senator D'Amato had, in \nessence, abused his office.\n  My friend from New York said it was improper for Senator D'Amato to \nuse his official Senate position to investigate the former first lady \nwhile Senator D'Amato was also chairman of his party's Senate campaign \ncommittee, the NRSC. My friend from New York said, in referring to \nSenator D'Amato:\n\n       Do you know what he did right after he got elected? He \n     became chairman of the national Senate Republican Campaign \n     Committee, the most blatantly political position you can \n     hold. Then . . . he embarked on his partisan and political \n     inquisition of the First Family.\n\n  According to the New York Times, the thing about Senator D'Amato's \nactivities that my friend from New York appeared to find particularly \ngalling was that his behavior was motivated by reelection concerns.\n  Given the two hats my friend from New York currently wears, you can \nsee why I obviously found the standard he set out in 1998 to be quite \nintriguing.\n  We all talk to the media--some of us more than others--and we may \nmake offhand comments we later regret, especially in the heat of a \ncampaign. But the Senator from New York thought his conflict of \ninterest charge was so important that he ran a television ad about it. \nThe Buffalo News reported:\n\n       Among the blizzard of attack ads running this weekend is \n     one in which Schumer charged that D'Amato used the Banking \n     Committee . . . to mount a 'vicious' partisan attack on first \n     lady Hillary Rodham Clinton three years ago.\n\n  Now, New York is certainly an expensive media market. Yet because my \ngood friend from New York was so concerned with Senator D'Amato's \nchairing the NRSC while he was investigating the First Lady, he spent a \nlot of money urging New Yorkers to remove Senator D'Amato from office. \nSo he must have really thought it was a serious conflict for someone to \nlead his party's campaign committee while also leading an investigation \ninto an administration of the opposite party.\n  How times change, Madam President. Now my good friend is leading his \nparty's principal campaign committee for the Senate, the DSCC. At the \nsame time, he is leading an official Senate investigation into the \nJustice Department.\n  He chairs the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and \nthe Courts.\n  The media widely reports that he has been tapped by the majority \nleader to lead this investigation. The piece in the National Journal \ncalls him the Democratic ``point man'' on this particular subject--our \ngood friend from New York.\n  He usually has chaired one of the numerous hearings the committee has \nalready held on this subject. To borrow from the National Journal, you \ncould say he is ubiquitous when it comes to this subject.\n  The campaign committee he chairs has repeatedly used material derived \nfrom his investigation for partisan campaign purposes.\n  He held a press conference before the ink was barely dry on the \nSchumer resolution. There, he predicted, amazingly, that we would go to \nthis resolution immediately after immigration. And it looks as if the \nmajority leader filed cloture on immigration to make sure we kept the \nschedule of my good friend from New York.\n  Last, but not least, he is the author of the resolution we will be \nvoting on in a little while.\n\n[[Page S7434]]\n\n  So I find myself perplexed about the application in these \ncircumstances of the standard the Senator from New York set out in \n1998. We could call it the Schumer standard.\n  It seems to me that Senator D'Amato's position in 1998 is like the \ncurrent position of my friend from New York in all material respects.\n  So given that the Senator from New York has said it is a serious \nconflict of interest for someone to lead his party's campaign committee \nwhile he uses his official position to lead an investigation of the \nadministration of the opposite party, I cannot understand why it is not \na conflict of interest for my friend from New York to lead his current \ninvestigation of the Justice Department.\n  And given that the Senator from New York wanted Senator D'Amato \nremoved from office under similar circumstances, I also cannot \nunderstand why my good friend should not at least recuse himself--\nrecuse himself--from the official investigation of the Justice \nDepartment that he himself has been leading.\n  In conclusion, I hope it is not the case that our friend from New \nYork wrote this resolution and pushed the Senate to spend its valuable \ntime on this particular resolution for partisan political purposes. And \nif he did not do that, then I trust we will not see the campaign \ncommittee he is chairing using the Senate's vote on this resolution--\nhis own resolution--for campaign purposes.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time do I \nhave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have 9\\1/2\\ minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I had some passing remarks to make last week about believing we \nshould find a way to move forward the immigration reform effort--to \nimprove it, to change it, but to try to get it done--because it is an \nissue we should not just push aside.\n  We ran into some difficulties, and there is no use in trying to \nrecount how that happened. I think the important thing is we try to \nfind a way to resurrect it, get it properly considered, amended, voted \non, and concluded, if at all possible. But that goes to the heart of \nwhat I want to say today.\n  Is this what the business of the Senate is really all about, a \nnonbinding, irrelevant resolution? Proving what? Nothing. If this \nshould go forward, we would have hours, days--who knows, a week--\ndebating on whether to express our confidence or lack thereof in the \nAttorney General--to no effect.\n  Now, I have been in Congress 35 years. I have been in the Senate \nsince 1989. I do not recall anything of this nature having been \nproposed before. Maybe we should be considering a vote of no confidence \nin the Senate or in the Congress for malfunction, for an inability to \nproduce anything. Yet this resolution would bring up this issue and \nhave us spend time debating it.\n  This is not the British Parliament, and I hope it never will become \nthe British Parliament. Are we going to bring the President here and \nhave a questioning period like the Prime Minister has in Great Britain?\n  So I am very much concerned about this. A vote of no confidence of \nany Cabinet official would have no effect. The President makes that \ndecision. And I suspect the ability of a Cabinet official to perform or \nnot perform is in the eye of the beholder.\n  But the main point is, that is not our job. We do not have authority \nto make that determination. So what are we going to accomplish today? \nThis is all about partisan politics. Nobody is fooled by this. This is \nabout trying to get a vote to try to put some people on the hot spot. \nThat is what it is really all about.\n  Now, by the way, you have not seen me running around making a big \nscene of expressing my confidence one way or the other in this Attorney \nGeneral, or any other Attorney General, or the Justice Department, for \nthat matter, regardless of who is the President of the United States.\n  We are supposed to be here to pass laws, to get things done. When was \nthe last time we did something like that? Not this year. Frankly, not \nover the last 3 years because of gymnastics like this--exercising to no \neffect. No. What should we be doing for the American people? We should \nbe trying to find a way to have strong immigration reform for illegal \nand legal immigrants. We made a 2-week effort. Some people said: Oh, \nthat is long enough. I can remember us spending weeks on a bill--I \nthink 6 weeks on No Child Left Behind. I remember one time we spent a \nmonth on a tobacco bill, which we eventually had to pull down and move \non.\n  To spend in the Senate weeks on a very important issue, so Senators \ncan express their views and offer amendments, and they can be voted on, \nis quite normal. But, no, we are not doing immigration reform. We hope \nto be able to get to Defense authorization.\n  Oh, and by the way, what happened to the appropriations bills? The \nmajority leaders do know, I think, that if you do not begin the \nappropriations process in late May or early June, you are not going to \nmake it. The majority leader has, appropriately, said we are going to \npass all the appropriations bills in regular order. How does he intend \nto do that? We are not going to do a single one in June, and we will be \nlucky if we do four in July. It is not going to happen.\n  We are going to wind up with a train wreck at the end of the fiscal \nyear. We are going to have all these appropriations bills, once again. \nI cannot just blame Democrats. We have done the same thing: an omnibus \nappropriations bill with all kinds of shenanigans being involved in \nthat, trying to lump all these bills together--put the Defense \nappropriations bill in there and irrelevant language and say: Here. \nTake the whole wad, Mr. President.\n  Oh, yes, we did it to Clinton, and we have done it to President Bush, \nbut it is not the way to do business. Can we do something about health \ncare? Can we get this Energy bill done? Remember now, if you start \nthese different cloture votes, being able to find a way to get an \nEnergy bill done--not to mention other things we would like to do after \nthat--they are going to be delayed or derailed completely. So this is a \nvery disappointing spectacle here today.\n  Now, the sponsor of the resolution--the fact is, he is chairman of \nthe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. He is in that position, \nand then he is taking these attack positions. So I do not think anybody \nhas to be drawn a further picture to understand what is going on with \nthis effort.\n  So I urge my colleagues: Look, he has made his point, made his \nspeech. We are going to have a vote in a few minutes. We ought to \nsummarily punt this out into the end zone where it belongs. This is \nbeneath the dignity of the Senate. How low will the Senate go? If we \nget into this for hours or days, pity how much it is going to debase \nthis institution even further.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe motion to proceed, and let's move on to the business of the Senate \nand the business of the American people. The American people may not \nhave particular confidence one way or the other in this Attorney \nGeneral, but this is not an election of the Attorney General.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture on the motion to proceed \nand let's get on with the business of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to speak against this motion \nas well. I agree totally with the Senator from Mississippi in saying: \nWhat are we doing spending this whole day talking about a resolution \nwhich everyone knows will have no effect whatsoever, except probably on \nthe nightly news, which I assume was the purpose of introducing it in \nthe first place.\n  We have talked about the judgment of the Attorney General in handling \nthe U.S. attorney personnel issues. There is clearly a division. There \nhas been a lot of discussion. A number of people have said what they \nthink of the handling of that situation. But stating your opinion is \nvery different from having the Senate address this matter. The \nPresident relieved almost all of his Cabinet when he changed into his \nsecond term. Why wouldn't he be able to\n\n[[Page S7435]]\n\nreplace U.S. attorneys who also serve at his pleasure in the same way \nhe decided to change leadership in the Cabinet? That is the right of \nthe President. The Senate has the right to confirm Cabinet officers and \nU.S. attorneys, and we have exercised that right. What the Senate \nshould not be doing is passing meaningless resolutions that could only \nserve a political purpose.\n  With the issues we have facing this country, how could we be spending \na whole day, and possibly more if cloture is invoked, on a resolution \nthat will have no impact? Why wouldn't we be talking about immigration, \nwhich we discussed last week and the week before that when we were in \nsession? We were making headway. Immigration is a very important issue \nfor our country.\n  The Energy bill which is before us is a very legitimate, major issue \nfor our country. We all want to bring gasoline prices down. But all of \na sudden, thrust in the middle of the energy debate is a meaningless \nresolution of no confidence in the Attorney General. There has been no \nallegation that he has done something criminal or illegal, just that \npeople disagree with his judgment.\n  There were people who disagreed with the Attorney General serving in \nthe previous administration--Janet Reno--when the Branch Davidian \ncomplex in Waco, TX was charged and people died. Many felt the Attorney \nGeneral jumped the gun and took too drastic an action, when talking \nwould have been better. Or the Elian Gonzalez issue. There was much \ndisagreement about the handling of that issue. I didn't see Republicans \nrunning to the floor of the Senate seeking a resolution of no \nconfidence in the Attorney General. I think, frankly, the majority is \njumping the gun in doing something such as that here. I hope we will \nput this away by not invoking cloture on the motion to proceed. \nFrankly, I hope we will restore the reputation of this body by taking \nup the issues that affect our country, debating them, and having votes.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, in regard to my good friend from \nTexas, I think there is a little bit too much protestation here. We \nhave spent less than 2 hours on this issue--just 2 hours--and now we \nare being told we don't have enough time to debate whether one of the \nmost important Cabinet officers is up to the job. That doesn't hold \nwater. They are not upset we are taking 2 hours away from debate. They \nhave spent much more time on many more things that are of less \nconsequence to this country.\n  But let me say this: The minority leader and the minority whip have \nmade my case better than I ever could. They failed to utter the words: \nWe have faith in Attorney General Gonzales. They failed to state: We \nhave confidence in Attorney General Gonzales. In fact, in the entire \nspeech of both the minority leader and the minority whip, there was not \na single word uttered in defense of the Attorney General. No wonder the \nother side doesn't want this resolution brought up. They know the \nAttorney General has failed miserably in his job. They know the \nPresident has clung stubbornly to keeping a man who virtually no one in \nAmerica thinks is up to the job, who overwhelmingly has lost his \ncredibility in his answers and nonanswers and ``don't knows.'' They \ncan't defend him. So they do what somebody does when they don't have \nmuch of an argument--they seek diversions. We will not be diverted. The \nrule of law is too important. The rule of law is too sacred.\n  Is it unusual to have a no-confidence resolution? Yes. But it is just \nas unusual--more unusual--to have an Attorney General not in charge of \nhis department on a major issue facing his department--the firing of \nU.S. attorneys--to say he didn't know what was happening 70 times; to \nhave an Attorney General contradict himself time after time after time. \nFor me, it is unusual in whatever airport I go to around this country \nto have people come up to me--it has happened five or six times now--\nand say: I work in the Justice Department. I am a civil service \nemployee. Keep it up, Senator. Our Department is demeaned--one of them \nused the word ``disgraced''--by the fact that Alberto Gonzales is still \nAttorney General.\n  So, yes, a no-confidence resolution is unusual, but this is not \nsimply a policy disagreement. Oh, no. This is a major scandal. This is \na series of inappropriate behaviors by a Cabinet officer. I don't have \na single bit of doubt that if the shoe were on the other foot, my \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle would be complaining more \nloudly, more quickly than we have.\n  What do you do when there is someone in an office who we all know \ndoesn't deserve to be in that office, and not a word--except for \nSenator Hatch--not a word of confidence has been spoken by the other \nside? We heard 19 minutes of speeches a minute ago. We don't hear the \nwords: We support the Attorney General; we have confidence in the \nAttorney General; the Attorney General should be able to stay. It is \nbecause his record is indefensible.\n  So, yes, this no-confidence resolution is unusual, but it rises to \nthe highest calling of the Senate, to seek rule of law over politics, \nto seek rationality and fairness over stubbornness and political games. \nThis is what we are supposed to do. We have a function of oversight. \nThere is no question Attorney General Gonzales has failed on \ncredibility, on competence, on upholding the rule of law.\n\n  The Nation has been shocked by what he has done. He urged an ill John \nAshcroft, on John Ashcroft's sickbed, to sign a statement that the \nJustice Department itself thought was not justified by the law in terms \nof wiretaps, and he is still Attorney General. John Ashcroft, who is \nhardly a liberal, hardly a Democrat, threatened to resign because of \nwhat then Counsel Gonzales attempted to do, and he is still in office.\n  The bottom line is very simple. We have a sacred, noble obligation in \nthis country to defend the rule of law. There was an article in the New \nYork Times the other day about how some people are using elections to \ntry to justify themselves staying in office in some less developed \ncountries. But the public wasn't falling for it, because without rule \nof law, without democracy, without law being applied without fear of \nfavor, there is no freedom. Our job is to be vigilant in protecting \nthat freedom.\n  Some of my friends tossed off charges of ``political''--to vote \n``no'' when one, in fact, agrees with the sentiment in the resolution \nis to cast a vote for the worst political reasons. A ``no'' vote \nratifies the President's support for the Attorney General. A ``no'' \nvote condones the conduct of the Attorney General. A ``no'' vote \ncondemns the Department to a prolonged vacuum in leadership and a \ncrisis of morale.\n  It is politics simply to cover for the President when you know on \nthis issue he is wrong. It is politics to put blind loyalty to a \npolitical leader over the sacred century after century tradition of \nrule of law. It is politics to voice opposition to the Attorney General \nand then refuse to back one's conviction with one's vote. It is \npolitics to know that Alberto Gonzales should not, must not, remain as \nAttorney General and then quietly, meekly cast your vote to keep him.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized as \npart of the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for yielding a couple of minutes.\n  There have been a couple of times in my career when I have walked \ninto a room and have been humbled. Obviously, the day I walked in this \nplace, I was humbled beyond words. But when I first walked into a \ncriminal courtroom as an assistant prosecutor as a very young lawyer, I \nwas also humbled by the responsibility that had been placed upon me by \nour system of justice. I remember talking to one of the older \nprosecutors in the office about what I should worry about. He said: \nJust remember, remember that woman with the scales of justice, Claire. \nRemember she has a blindfold on.\n  That blindfold is what this is about today. Frankly, it doesn't \nmatter whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, whether you were for \nGeorge Bush or not for George Bush. What matters today is how those \nprosecutors\n\n[[Page S7436]]\n\nout there in this country feel right now, and what this incident did to \nthe way they feel about their jobs. Because there are thousands of \nprofessional prosecutors--some of them have been appointed, some of \nthem have been hired, some have been elected--what they all have in \ncommon is they understand their job is not about politics, it is about \nthe rule of law.\n  When this whole incident unfurled in front of the American public, to \nall of those prosecutors it felt as though they were being cheapened, \nthat somehow Gonzales and the rest of them were saying they were being \njudged on their politics and not on their professionalism.\n  So I come here just for a moment to try to give a voice to those \nthousands of prosecutors out there. I know them. I have worked with \nthem shoulder to shoulder for years. They care deeply about their work, \nthey care deeply about the rule of law, and they care deeply about \nfundamental justice.\n  On their behalf, I rise today for a moment to say this Chamber should \nvote unanimously a vote of no confidence against the Attorney General \nof the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Missouri \nfor her remarks. Like her, I have been appointed and elected as a U.S. \nattorney and as an attorney general. I ask all of my colleagues who are \nlistening to take her at her word. Prosecutors across the country are \nhorrified about what has happened. I applaud Senator Schumer for what \nhe has done to push this forward.\n  The Senate has an important oversight role. We have advice and \nconsent responsibilities, and we have a Judiciary Committee on which \nSenator Schumer and I serve. I tell you, the U.S. Department of Justice \nis a precious institution in our democracy. It is under siege from \nwithin, and we need to take some action.\n  This resolution is not about partisanship. It is not about scoring \npolitical points. It is about two very important things--one, letting \nthe people of America know we care about an honest, independent, and \ntruthful Department of Justice. That is not meaningless. It is also \nabout letting the career people within the Department of Justice know \nthat we hear them, we care about them, we know what has been done to \nthis Department is shameful; that this ordeal for them will one day be \nover, and we will work hard as people who care about this country and \nabout the Department of Justice to make that day come soon, so that \nonce again truth and justice can be the stars that guide the Department \nof Justice. That, too, is not meaningless.\n  Madam President, the bill of particulars against Attorney General \nGonzales is long. First is the fact that he does not respect the \ninstitution he leads. Time-honored traditions and practices of the \nDepartment, vital to the impartial administration of justice, have been \ngravely damaged or destroyed on his watch.\n  One, U.S. attorneys used to come from their home districts, where \nthey were accountable to local people, where they knew the judges and \nthe law enforcement officers. Not under this Attorney General. Now they \nfly them in from Washington where they will do President Bush's \nbidding.\n  Two, U.S. attorneys were always put up for advice and consent. Not \nunder this Attorney General. He presided over the statutory \ncircumvention of our Senate confirmation process.\n  Three, the list of people at the White House and the DOJ who used to \nbe able to talk about cases with each other recently included only four \npeople at the White House and only three at the DOJ. Not under this \nAttorney General, where 417 White House officials, including Karl Rove, \ncan now have these formerly illicit conversations with the Department \nof Justice.\n  Four, career attorneys were kept free of partisan interference. Not \nunder this Attorney General. There are politics in the Honors Program, \npolitics in career official appointments, politics in personnel \nevaluations, and politics in the appointment of immigration judges.\n  Five, U.S. attorneys were almost always left in place to do their \njobs once they were appointed, knowing that they had a higher calling \nthan their political appointment. Not under this Attorney General. \nSimply put, a man who doesn't care about those institutions of the \nDepartment of Justice is the wrong person to lead it back out of the \nmess he has put it in.\n  He has politicized this Department to a degree not seen since the \nNixon administration--U.S. attorneys fired for political reasons, with \nWhite House fingerprints all over the place, and Karl Rove and others \npassing on information to the Department of Justice about voter fraud \nto pump up interest in cases. DOJ policy is ignored, with no \njustification; written policy was ignored to bring indictments on the \neve of a critical election in the State of Missouri; the White House \nCounsel chastising a U.S. attorney over mishandling a case. How does \nthe White House Counsel know whether a DOJ attorney mishandled the \ncase? Who is telling him what is going on in the DOJ? The DOJ even \ninvented the position of White House Liaison--first time ever--who, by \nher own admission, screened applicants based on inappropriate and \nprobably illegal political factors.\n  Third, the Attorney General has set the bar for his office far too \nlow. His stated definition of what is improper for him and his staff, \nbelieve it or not, tracks the legal standard for criminal obstruction \nof justice. Is that the kind of Attorney General we want? Is that the \nkind of accountability to himself we want? The Attorney General should \ndo a lot better than that.\n  There has been an almost unbelievable series of half-truths and \nobfuscations coming out of the Attorney General and his circle. They \ntold us that the firings of U.S. attorneys were performance related. \nNot true. They told us the Attorney General was not involved and didn't \ndiscuss the plan to fire U.S. attorneys. Not true. They told us the \nWhite House was not involved. Not true. They told us these EARS \nperformance evaluations were not relevant. Not true. They told us the \nAttorney General didn't discuss the substance of the testimony with \nother witnesses during the investigation. Not true. They told us the \nChief of Staff of the Deputy Attorney General never made threatening \ncalls to U.S. attorneys who were going to publicly discuss the matter. \nAgain, not true.\n\n  How many times can the Department of Justice say things that are not \ntrue?\n  Fifth, the hypocrisy is almost unbelievable. The Attorney General's \nown incompetence and misjudgments fail the very test he claimed he set \nfor the fired U.S. attorneys. As one of my colleagues said to Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales at his hearing, ``Why should you not be judged by the \nsame standards at which you judged these dismissed U.S. Attorneys?''\n  Madam President, our Attorney General would fail that standard. How \ncan he oversee our Federal Bureau of Investigation when the FBI \nDirector had to warn FBI agents guarding the Attorney General not to \nobey his instructions, when he was White House Counsel scurrying over \nto the ailing Attorney General's hospital room to try to get his \nsignature on a document?\n  You can say this is just a partisan exercise, but it may take a \ndecade to repair the damage Attorney General Gonzales has caused. Every \nday that passes without his resignation is one more day before the \nrepair has begun. From the perspective of the Bush administration, I \ncan see how a wounded, grateful Attorney General on a very short leash \nmay be just as they want as they try to exit Washington without further \nindictments. But that is not the Attorney General America needs to \nmaintain the best traditions of the Department of Justice through \nadministration and administration and administration, through \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, and to ensure the fair administration \nof justice in our country.\n  As a former U.S. attorney who has profound respect for the Department \nof Justice and its thousands of career employees, I believe America \ndeserves an Attorney General who will lead by example, who will set the \nvery highest standard for himself and his staff, who will do his best \nto keep politics out of the justice system and will restore the \ncountry's faith and confidence in one of its most important \ninstitutions.\n  Please set aside politics and let us stand up for the Department of \nJustice. Let us restore a vital institution in American life. Please \nlet us vote for\n\n[[Page S7437]]\n\ncloture and proceed to do what our duty calls for us to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of cloture on the \nmotion to proceed. After months of troubling and even shocking \ndisclosures about the U.S. Attorney firings and the politicization of \nthe Department of Justice, it is important for the Senate to go on \nrecord on the question of whether the Attorney General should continue \nin his post. This vote may end up being our only vote on this matter, \nbut since the resolution itself is nonbinding, this vote, though \nprocedural in nature, is sufficient to inform the Nation exactly what \nthe Senate's position is. Those who vote against cloture plainly are \ncomfortable with the Attorney General remaining right where he is. \nThose of us who vote for cloture are not.\n  In January 2005, I voted against Alberto Gonzales to be the Attorney \nGeneral because I was not convinced he would put the rule of law, and \nthe interests of the country, above those of the President and the \nadministration. Unfortunately, those concerns have been realized over \nand over. It is not just the U.S. Attorneys scandal. In recent months, \nthe Department's Inspector General issued a very troubling report on \nNational Security Letters. The Attorney General, of course, had assured \nus that the Department could be trusted to respect civil liberties in \nits exercise of the unprecedented powers it was given in the Patriot \nAct.\n  Perhaps the Attorney General's biggest failure concerns the \nwarrantless wiretapping program. When he came before the Judiciary \nCommittee for his confirmation hearing, he gave very misleading \ntestimony to a question I asked concerning whether the position the \nadministration had taken with respect to torture might also allow it to \nauthorize warrantless wiretaps. He called my question ``hypothetical.'' \nJust less than a year later, we found out that the administration had \nin fact taken precisely that position for years.\n  His appearance before the Judiciary Committee last year to discuss \nthe legal justification of the wiretapping program was one of the \nweakest and least convincing I have ever seen. And the recent testimony \nof former Deputy Attorney General James Comey concerning Mr. Gonzales's \nbedside visit to former Attorney General John Ashcroft raises serious \nquestions about his veracity at that hearing. It also raises questions \nabout his ethics, and, once again, his respect for the rule of law.\n  But it is not just his commitment to the rule of law and his \nwillingness to tell the truth to Congress that troubles me about this \nAttorney General's tenure. At his most recent appearance before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee to discuss the U.S. Attorney firings, I \nquestioned him about whether he did some of the most basic things that \nyou would expect a manager to do if he delegated to his staff a major \nproject like deciding which of 93 presidential appointees to top law \nenforcement positions to fire. He could not recall doing any of them. \nWe know that the Attorney General was involved in this process and made \nthe final decisions on the firing plan, but he can't seem to remember \nmuch beyond that, even though it was only a few months ago that this \nall took place. He has failed in a very significant way. He should \nresign.\n  With the snowballing problems at the Justice Department, it could \nhardly be more plain that the Attorney General has lost the confidence \nof Congress and the public. As Mr. Comey said in response to my written \nquestion: ``This entire affair has harmed the Department and its \nreputation.'' The Department of Justice should always be above \nreproach. The AG should step down for the good of the country. Since he \nwill not, the Senate should express its judgment, on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as a former U.S. Attorney for 12 years \nand as an assistant U.S. attorney for over 2 years, I am well aware \nthat U.S. attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President and that \nthey are appointed through a political process that involves home State \nsenators conferring with the President of the United States before the \nnomination is made, and which involves confirmation by the U.S. Senate.\n  As I have observed previously, the matter involving Attorney General \nGonzales concerning the appointment and removal of certain U.S. \nattorneys arose because at some point there was interest in a \nsubstantial change in the persons holding the offices of U.S. attorneys \nthroughout the country. Apparently, some wanted a large number of \nchanges and others did not. To them, it may have seemed like an easy \nthing to do. The President would simply just remove them and appoint \nothers.\n  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales had no previous experience in the \nDepartment of Justice at any time in his career and seemed to have very \nlittle interest in who were serving as U.S. attorneys. This was an \nerror on his part. Attorney General Gonzales simply did not understand \nthat the removal of a U.S. attorney is always a delicate and difficult \nprocess. First, U.S. attorneys have Senatorial support. Their \nappointment was initially cleared by the U.S. Senator for that State \nand often the Congressman from that district. Secondly, they have local \nsupport among their friends and constituents and they often have built \nup strong support among local, State, and Federal law enforcement \nagencies. Those bonds are often strong and the removal of a U.S. \nattorney often causes concern among those law enforcement agencies and \ngroups. They have also often gained support in the local community with \nchildrens' advocacy groups, crime prevention groups, and victims' \nrights groups.\n  Finally, almost every U.S. attorney will have one, sometimes more, \nsensitive cases that are ongoing at any given time. Anyone familiar \nwith the process will know that removing a U.S. attorney who is in the \nprocess of handling some high profile criminal case will often result \nin quite a bit of political pushback, even if the U.S. attorney has \nvery little hands-on involvement with the case.\n  One of the problems that the Attorney General had was that he did not \nfully understand these dangers in removing U.S. attorneys because he \nhad never been involved in it as a member of the Department of Justice. \nHe simply did not comprehend the seriousness of the issue with which he \nwas dealing. If he had, he would have spent a great deal more time on \nit than he did. He would not have delegated it to his assistants--many \nof them young and also not experienced--in the reality of this process \neither.\n  As a result, there occurred an unseemly series of events that \nreflected poorly on Attorney General Gonzales and other members of the \nDepartment of Justice, and which has damaged the reputation of the \nDepartment of Justice. This was not a small matter but a very important \nmatter. I think now he realizes the importance of this process and is \nsincerely apologetic for allowing it to develop the way it did. He is \nalso apologetic for the way that he responded to the inquiries made \nabout the proposed U.S. attorney changes.\n  Let me insert, parenthetically, that much of the criticism leveled \nagainst the Attorney General, the President and his aides has been \nexaggerated and sometimes quite inaccurate. But, if it comes from a \nmember of Congress or a Senator, that means you never have to say you \nare sorry. However, if the Attorney General, in responding to attacks, \nmakes explanations that are in any way less than fully accurate one can \nexpect that he will be attacked vociferously as attempting to mislead \nor worse. Unfortunately, there is a double standard and it often \nresults in unfairness and this is one of those cases. Many of the \ncomplaints against Attorney General Gonzales have been very unfair and \nunfortunate.\n  After this spasm developed, I was worried about the Attorney \nGeneral's capacity to lead the Department of Justice effectively and \nexpressed concern as to whether or not he would be able to assemble an \nable staff to complete his term and whether or not it would be, in sum, \nbetter for the Department of Justice that he step aside. I publicly \nsuggested that he and the President meet together and discuss this \nissue with frankness. I quoted the Attorney General himself as saying \nthat the matter was not about the Attorney General, but was really \nabout what was best for the Department of Justice.\n  It now appears that the Attorney General and the President have \nconcluded that the Attorney General committed no offense, committed no \ncrime\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\nfor which he should be impeached, and has not made any error sufficient \nthat he should no longer remain as Attorney General. The Attorney \nGeneral's lack of experience in certain aspects of the Department of \nJustice were well known before he was confirmed by the Senate. In my \npersonal view, there is no Cabinet member that requires more personal \nexperience and detailed knowledge of the agency they will lead than the \nAttorney General. It is a very, very tough job and the Attorney General \nmust be able to personally handle a large portfolio of issues and at \nthe same time have a comprehensive grasp of complex legal issues and \nlegal precedents involving the Department of Justice. For example, \nAttorney General Janet Reno was constantly struggling in the office. \nBefore becoming the Attorney General, she had simply been a county \ndistrict attorney and had never been involved in the kinds of issues \nshe faced as Attorney General. In the future, I expect to be far more \nassertive in the confirmation process as I will insist that any \nAttorney General nominee have significant relevant experience.\n  In conclusion, I conclude that there is not cause for any censure of \nAttorney General Gonzales and I conclude that there is no basis \nwhatsoever for him to be impeached.\n  It has been 120 years since a no-confidence vote has been had on any \nCabinet member. That is something they do in Europe. It is not \nsomething we do in the United States. This no-confidence resolution is \nnot necessary, it is harmful to our system, and should not be a \nprecedent in the future. Frankly, it is driven by politics and not by \nwhat is best for the Department of Justice because this process will \ngreatly magnify any errors that he has made and create a false \nimpression. Attorney General Gonzales is a good man who sincerely wants \nto meet the highest standards of the Department of Justice.\n  The process in our government is that the President nominates for the \nposition of Attorney General, and the Senate votes to confirm them or \nnot. After that confirmation, unless he is subject to impeachment, it \nis not good policy for the Senate to rush in and express formal \nopinions about the Cabinet officer and his or her performance. \nTherefore, I have, after considerable thought, concluded this \nresolution is bad policy and precedent, and is unfairly damaging to the \nDepartment of Justice. It is a political overreach and should not be \npassed. Therefore, I oppose the resolution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, when Alberto Gonzales came before the \nSenate as the President's nominee for Attorney General, many of us were \nconcerned that he would not be able to distinguish between his past \nrole as White House Counsel and his new role as Attorney General. \nDuring his service as counsel to the President, he had assisted the \nPresident in promulgating a series of disastrous policies that ran \nroughshod over the rule of law and damaged the United States in the \neyes of the world. He refused to give detainees the protections of the \nGeneva Conventions, calling them ``quaint.'' He facilitated the \nestablishment of Guantanamo and denied other basic legal protections to \ndetainees. He approved an interpretation of the law that was \ninconsistent with international agreements. He authorized the use of \ntorture, a step that led to the horrors of Abu Ghraib. At every turn, \nhe promoted an extreme view of the President's authority. Yet, when he \ncame before the committee seeking confirmation, he assured us: ``With \nthe consent of the Senate, I will no longer represent only the White \nHouse; I will represent the United States of America and its people. I \nunderstand the differences between the two roles.''\n  That assurance has proven hollow. On issue after issue, Mr. Gonzales \nhas singlemindedly served the President's agenda, without any respect \nfor the broader responsibilities of the Attorney General. He has \ncontinued to promote an extreme view of the President's power as \nCommander in Chief to authorize warrantless eavesdropping in violation \nof the law, secret detentions, abuse of detainees, and violations of \nthe Geneva Conventions. He believes that the President can issue \nsigning statements that nullify duly enacted statutes whenever they \nmight limit the President's discretion. As Attorney General, he has \nused the enormous power of his office to promote the agenda of the \nWhite House.\n  The current U.S. attorney scandal has revealed the devastating legacy \nof Mr. Gonzales's tenure as Attorney General. We now have a Department \nof Justice that is wide open to partisan influence and has abandoned \nmany of the basic principles that kept the Department independent and \nassured the American people that its decisions were based on the rule \nof law.\n  As a result, the Department of Justice is now embroiled in a scandal \ninvolving the firing of U.S. attorneys, under a process controlled by \ninexperienced, partisan staffers in consultation with the White House. \nU.S. attorneys were targeted for firing because they failed to serve \nthe White House agenda. Karl Rove and the President passed along to the \nAttorney General complaints that U.S. attorneys failed to pursue voter \nfraud. Over the past 5 years, the Department of Justice has actually \npushed hard to prosecute voter fraud, but among the hundreds of \nmillions of votes cast in that period, it has managed to convict only \n86 people nationwide. The pursuit of virtually nonexistent voter fraud \nat the ballot box is part of a Republican effort to suppress the \nlegitimate votes of minority, elderly, and disabled voters. Other \nmeasures taken in this cynical scheme include photo ID laws and purges \nof voter rolls.\n  The conclusion is inescapable that the firings of U.S. attorneys were \npart of an effort to put partisans in charge of U.S. attorney offices \nin key States. New Mexico, Washington, Arkansas and Nevada are all \nclosely contested States. Add those States to which the Attorney \nGeneral sent interim appointees from Washington in the past 2 years--\nFlorida, Missouri, Iowa and Minnesota--and the pattern is clear. \nAttorney General Gonzales, more than any other Attorney General in \nmemory, has tried to turn the Department of Justice into an arm of a \npolitical party.\n  In addition, under his leadership, the Department's hiring procedures \nhave been corrupted by partisan officials who rejected longstanding \nmerit-based hiring procedures and placed political party loyalty ahead \nof legal merit in hiring career attorneys. His Department of Justice \nhas tried to obliterate the distinction between political appointees \nand career civil servants.\n  In his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Gonzales has \nrepeatedly made false statements. He told us the warrantless \neavesdropping program could not be conducted within the limits of The \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Then, on the eve of an \nappearance before the committee, he told us that the program now fits \nwithin FISA. He told us that there had not been significant \ndisagreement over that program, but we now know that as many as 30 \nmembers of the Justice Department were prepared to resign if an earlier \nversion of the program proceeded unchanged. He stated that he had not \nseen memoranda or been involved in discussions about the U.S. attorney \nfirings, but it was later revealed that he did both. He told us that \nonly eight U.S. attorneys had been targeted for firing, but it turns \nout the list was longer. He has said scores of times that he does not \nrecall key meetings and events. With each misstatement and memory \nlapse, the Attorney General's credibility has faded until there is \nnothing left.\n  In the years I have served in this body, I have had the privilege to \nwork with many Attorneys General. The defining quality of the \noutstanding occupants of that office--both Democrats and Republicans--\nhas been an understanding that the law and the evidence trump loyalty \nto a political party or a president. Respect for the rule of law lies \nat the heart of our democracy. If our machinery of justice becomes just \nanother means to preserve and promote the power of the party in office, \nwe have corrupted our democracy. If the American people believe that \npartisanship is driving law enforcement, our system of justice cannot \nsurvive.\n  We need a strong and credible Attorney General who believes deeply in \nour system of justice as we undertake the difficult and essential job \nof restoring the credibility of the Department of Justice. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution of no-confidence as a first step \nin rebuilding the faith of the American people in the Department of \nJustice.\n\n[[Page S7439]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 28 months ago, on February 3, 2005, I voted \nagainst the confirmation of Alberto Gonzales to be the Attorney General \nof the United States. Hallelujah, Amen! Eight days before that, I was \none of 13 Senators who voted against the nomination of Condoleezza Rice \nto be the U.S. Secretary of State. And, if the Senate had been \npermitted to vote on the nomination of Paul Wolfowitz to head the World \nBank, I would have voted against that nomination, too.\n  I am proud of my votes against confirmation of these failed \narchitects of the unconstitutional war in Iraq. Their flawed policies \nhave cost our Nation dearly. I shudder to contemplate the billions and \neven trillions of dollars and the decades of effort that it will take \nto correct their extraordinary errors in judgment. These are the same \nadministration officials, led by Alberto Gonzales here at home, who \nhave done everything they can to abolish our Nation's carefully \ncalibrated separation of powers and to undermine Americans' civil \nliberties. Based on ongoing errors in judgment and mistakes made on his \nwatch, I remain convinced that my vote against Alberto Gonzales was in \nthe best interests of this country.\n  It is, therefore, not surprising that I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of S.J. Res. 14. This resolution expresses the sense of the \nSenate that Attorney General Gonzales no longer holds the confidence of \nthe Senate and of the American people. Frankly, he never held my \nconfidence. Not from day one, and I will tell you why that is so.\n  When President Bush nominated Alberto Gonzales to be the U.S. \nAttorney General, the President stated that Mr. Gonzales, as White \nHouse counsel, had a ``sharp intellect,'' and that it was White House \ncounsel's ``sound judgment'' that had, in the President's words, \n``helped shape our policies in the war on terror.''\n  Sharp intellect and sound judgment? I have heard of damning with \nfaint praise, but applying those words to someone who has had a major \nrole in the reckless and incompetent way in which this administration \nhas waged its so-called war on terror is hardly a compliment.\n  But don't expect Alberto Gonzales to take responsibility for what \nhappened on his watch. Throughout his time in this administration, \nwhenever Mr. Gonzales has been questioned about what he knows about \nimproper conduct, his standard and repetitive response, in the words of \nthe fictional Sergeant Schultz is simply: ``I know nothing.'' When \nquestioned about who made the decision to fire U.S. attorneys for what \nappear to be purely political reasons, he implausibly states that while \nhe signed off on the decision, he was not really responsible because he \nwas out of the loop.\n  At a press conference on March 13, Attorney General Gonzales stated \nthat he knew nothing of the scandal surrounding the U.S. attorneys, \nbecause he was, in his words, ``not involved in seeing any memos, was \nnot involved in any discussions about what was going on,'' and, he \nsaid, ``that's basically what I knew as the Attorney General.'' Mr. \nPresident, that is not an impressive response. Even the Attorney \nGeneral now says his comment was ``too broad'' and that he \n``misspoke.'' He now admits that he did have some involvement. But he \nsaid this only after the Justice Department released e-mails and \nmemoranda which showed that he had, in fact, been involved in \ndiscussions about the firings.\n  He also claimed that he is not really responsible, because, in his \nwords, ``in an organization of 110,000 people,'' he said, ``I am not \naware of every bit of information that passes through the halls of \njustice, nor am I aware of all decisions.'' Now that seems an odd \nassertion, considering that he is, in fact--if you will allow me to use \nthe President's terminology--the top ``decider'' at the U.S. Department \nof Justice.\n  When the Attorney General testified before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on April 19, 2007, he continued to argue that he was simply \nout of touch--an assertion that has been disputed by the two employees \nhe had charged with filling the U.S. attorney positions with party \nloyalists, D. Kyle Sampson and Monica Goodling.\n  On May 15, 2007, speaking before the National Press Club, Mr. \nGonzales made yet another effort to shift the blame for any wrongdoing. \nBut this time he chose a new victim. He said, ``You have to remember, \nat the end of the day, the recommendations [to fire the U.S. Attorneys] \nreflected the views of the deputy attorney general,'' meaning Paul \nMcNulty. But the Associated Press reported immediately thereafter that \ndocuments released from the Justice Department showed that McNulty was \nnot closely involved in picking all of the U.S. attorneys who were put \non the list. Instead, it was a job mostly driven by the Attorney \nGeneral's own, two hand-picked subordinates, Sampson and Goodling.\n  I would invite those who believe that Alberto Gonzales did not know \nwhat was happening in his own Department to join me on a quick trip \ndown memory lane. Let me recount a section of the speech that I \ndelivered on the Senate floor just prior to voting against his \nconfirmation to be Attorney General. I reminded my colleagues at that \ntime that Judge Gonzales had admitted being physically present at \nmeetings in his office to determine which acts against enemy combatants \nshould be outlawed as torture.\n  But at his confirmation hearing, he disavowed having any role in the \nadministration's initial decision to define torture extremely narrowly. \nOn January 6, 2005, he was asked by a member of the Judiciary Committee \nwhether he had ever chaired a meeting in which he discussed with \nJustice Department attorneys the legitimacy of such interrogation \ntechniques. He was asked if, in the meetings he attended, there was \ndiscussion of strapping detainees to boards and holding them under \nwater as if to drown them. He testified that there were such meetings, \nand while he did remember having had some ``discussions'' with Justice \nDepartment attorneys, he simply could not recall what he told them in \nthose meetings. He stated that, as White House counsel, he might have \nattended those meetings, but it was not his role but that of the \nJustice Department to determine which interrogation techniques were \nlawful.\n\n  In other words, he was saying then, just as he is saying today: Don't \nhold me accountable! Don't blame me if mistakes were made! And, then, \njust like today, he didn't point the finger of blame at just one other \nvictim. He spread the blame around. While he admitted he'd made some \nmistakes as White House counsel, he attempted to further deflect \nresponsibility for his actions by saying that a number of what he \ncalled other ``operational agencies'' also took responsibility for \nmaking flawed decisions on prisoner interrogation techniques.\n  At his confirmation hearing, he said:\n\n       I have a recollection that we had some discussions in my \n     office, but let me be very clear with the Committee. It is \n     not my job to decide which types of methods of obtaining \n     information from terrorists would be the most effective. That \n     job responsibility falls to folks within the agencies. It is \n     also not my job to make the ultimate decision about whether \n     or not those methods would, in fact, meet the requirements of \n     the anti-torture statute. That would be the job for the \n     agencies . . . I viewed it as their responsibility to make a \n     decision as to whether or not a procedure or method would, in \n     fact, be lawful.\n  Whether on the issue of torture or of firing U.S. attorneys, when it \ncomes to Alberto Gonzales taking responsibility for his actions--as \nYogi Berra would say--it's deja vu all over again. One wishes that \nJudge Gonzales could tell us, just once, what his job is, rather than \nalways telling us only what it is not.\n  Article II, section 3 of the United States Constitution, as head of \nthe Executive Branch, the President has a legal duty to take care that \nthe laws be faithfully executed. The Constitution does not say that the \nPresident or his officers ``should'' or ``may'' undertake that \nresponsibility: it clearly states that the President ``shall take Care \nthat the Laws be faithfully executed.'' The President and his Chief Law \nEnforcement Officer at the Justice Department must be held accountable \nnot only when they fail to faithfully execute the law, but also when \nthey or their subordinates attempt to undermine, ignore, or gut the \nlaw.\n  The Attorney General has a credibility problem, and the American \npeople know it. Despite his assertions to the contrary, he continues to \ncontribute in large measure to the flawed policies and decision making \nthat have\n\n[[Page S7440]]\n\nflowed from this administration over the past seven years. For all of \nthese reasons, I urge my colleagues to support S.J. Res. 14.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 14, a \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate that Attorney General \nGonzales has lost the confidence of Congress and the American people. \nThis is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Now, Madam President, let me initially say that I was doing other \nthings and was unable to listen to the remarks of some of my Republican \ncolleagues. I apologize for that. I have had a briefing as to what they \nsaid. They have chosen to impugn the motives of the sponsor of this \nresolution, the senior Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer. I work very \nclosely with this man. I have worked in government most all of my adult \nlife. Rarely have I seen anybody--in fact, I have never seen anyone \nwith the intellectual capacity of Chuck Schumer from New York and his \nability to understand what is going on in the State of New York and in \nour country. Any suggestions that were made to impugn his integrity are \nunwarranted, out of line, and unfair.\n  Senator Schumer is a member of the Judiciary Committee. He is a \nlawyer. As a member of that Judiciary Committee and as a lawyer who \ncares deeply about the rule of law and the reputation of the Justice \nDepartment, he had an obligation to do what he did. There are others \nwho joined with him. Senator Feinstein was out front on this issue with \nSenator Schumer, as were others. The chairman of the committee, Senator \nLeahy, has been with them every step of the way.\n  In my opinion, his work in this investigation has been commendable.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the majority leader yield for a comment?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I tell the leader and the senior Senator \nfrom New York, I know he has worked hard on this. Nobody has had more \nroadblocks thrown in front of him than the Senator from New York. He \nhas asked legitimate questions. Many times, his legitimate questions \nwere not answered by the Department of Justice. They refused to answer. \nWe had to actually subpoena them to get answers that should have been \nsent to him by return courier. He has acted in the best sense of \noversight. He has done what one should do in oversight. He should not \nbe criticized for that.\n  Maybe those who do the criticizing should ask why they allowed a \nrubberstamp Senate under their watch to continue for 6 years, with \nconduct that certainly borders on the criminal and certainly reflects \nthe unethical goings-on at the Department of Justice, and they didn't \nsay one word about it.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate very much the Senator from \nVermont, the chairman of our committee, for standing up for what is \nright. That is what he is doing.\n  The Senate has a responsibility to express its displeasure with a \nCabinet officer who has grossly mismanaged his responsibilities and \nfailed the American people in the process. This is the one and only \nmechanism we have, short of impeachment, to address malfeasance of a \nhigh-ranking Federal official.\n  Along with the Department of Defense and State, the Department of \nJustice is the most important Cabinet agency we have. The Attorney \nGeneral is responsible for enforcing Federal law, protecting civil \nrights, and, most importantly, ensuring fidelity to the Constitution of \nthe United States.\n  Madam President, in my young days as a lawyer and public official in \nNevada, during the 1960s, I saw the critical role the Justice \nDepartment can play in what is going on in a State. In those days--the \nearly sixties--a person of color, a Black man or woman, could not work \nin a Strip hotel and could not work in downtown hotels. They weren't \nthere unless they were a porter, a janitor--someplace where they could \nnot be seen. Thousands of people, Black and White, protested that \ndiscrimination, but it didn't matter until the Justice Department \nstepped in. They stepped in and forced it. There was a consent decree \nentered into between the State of Nevada--I was there. I was Lieutenant \nGovernor, and I helped negotiate that along with Governor O'Callaghan \nand the attorney assigned to do that. We worked on that for weeks and \nweeks. But for the Justice Department, that integration of those large \nhotels in Nevada would have taken place much later. That is what the \nJustice Department is all about. Major civil rights battles in Las \nVegas over integrating the strip would never have been determined in \nfavor of the people of color but for the Justice Department.\n  You see, the Justice Department is color blind, and that is the way \nit is supposed to be. It wasn't a Democratic Department of Justice or \nRepublican Department of Justice. It was an American, a U.S. Department \nof Justice. Its lawyers were fighting for the most American ideal--the \nright of all Americans to participate in our democracy.\n  What a proud history this is. What a source of pride it is for our \ncountry what the Justice Department in decades past has done. But today \nunder this President, President Bush, and under this Attorney General, \nAlberto Gonzales, the Department of Justice has lost its way.\n  Now the Justice Department is just another arm of the Karl Rove \npolitical machine, where partisanship earns patronage and independence \nearns contempt.\n  Today's Justice Department is dysfunctional. I so appreciate the \nstatement made by the former attorney general of the State of Rhode \nIsland, Senator Whitehouse. He laid it out. He has a feeling of what \nthe Justice Department is all about. He spoke from his heart. The \nDepartment of Justice's credibility is shredded. Its morale is at an \nall-time low, and the blame for that tragic deterioration lies squarely \non the shoulders of two people: the President of the United States and \nthe Attorney General of the United States, Alberto Gonzales.\n  We are here today to discuss Alberto Gonzales. Over the past 6 \nmonths, congressional oversight has revealed the many ways the crass \npolitical calculations in that White House have pervaded the personnel \nand prosecutorial decisions of the Bush-Gonzales Justice Department. \nRemember, for 4 years, this was a big rubberstamp, this thing called \nCongress.\n  The careers of many fine men and women, lawyers, have been destroyed. \nOne of those is a man from Nevada by the name of Daniel Bogden, a \ncareer prosecutor. He worked his way up as a line prosecutor in Washoe \nCounty, Reno, NV, and became an assistant U.S. attorney. He--I have \nspoken with him--wanted to spend his life being a prosecutor, going \nafter people who violate the law. That is over with. Once you are \nremoved from being a U.S. attorney, you can no longer work as a deputy \nU.S. attorney.\n  He, I repeat, was a career prosecutor. When my Republican friend and \ncolleague, John Ensign, recommended him to be U.S. attorney for Nevada, \nhe reached what he thought was the pinnacle of his career. Oh, was he \nmistaken. He has been humiliated, embarrassed, denigrated by this \nJustice Department for no reason. He worked hard. No one questioned his \nwork ethic.\n  My son was a deputy U.S. attorney with Daniel Bogden. They worked \ntogether. A fine lawyer is Daniel Bogden. He worked hard as our U.S. \nattorney to protect Nevadans from crimes, drugs and white-collar crimes \nand earned a wide respect from law enforcement agencies throughout the \nState.\n  I repeat, he was fired. To this day, no satisfactory explanation has \nbeen provided to Dan Bogden and the people of Nevada.\n  In light of this evidence, we learned that other U.S. attorneys had \nbeen fired at the same time because they failed to pursue partisan \npolitical cases. So without any question, there is every reason to \nbelieve Dan Bogden suffered the same fate. He was fired for \nadministering justice in Nevada in an evenhanded, nonpolitical way, as \nhe thought as a prosecutor he was supposed to do.\n  I can remember as a young lawyer, I had a part-time job as a city \nattorney in Henderson, NV. It is now the second largest city in the \nState. It wasn't then. I prosecuted criminal cases. I came back to my \nlaw firm and I was bragging. That is the wrong word. I was saying: Man, \nthat case, I can't imagine why that judge did that. That wasn't a very \ngood case at all. One of the people\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\nI worked with said: Harry, that is not your responsibility.\n  I will use leader time now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, he said: Your job is not to convict \npeople. It is to do the right thing for the people of the State of \nNevada, the city of Henderson, NV.\n  That is a lesson somebody should have given Alberto Gonzales before \nhe took the job as Attorney General. Dan Bogden was fired for doing his \njob exactly the way it is supposed to be done.\n  When he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales couldn't even say why Bogden was included on the list \nto be fired. Think about that: A man's career ruined, and the man who \nfired him or had him fired didn't even know why he was fired.\n  His lack of memory was astounding. He couldn't recall basic facts, \neven meetings with the President. Writing in the New York Times, \nProfessor Frank Bowman, a former Federal prosecutor, said, talking \nabout Gonzales:\n\n       The truth is almost surely that Mr. Gonzales's \n     forgetfulness is feigned--a calculated ploy to block \n     legitimate congressional inquiry into questionable decisions \n     made by the Department of Justice, White House officials, \n     and, quite possibly, the President himself.\n\n  If Albert Gonzales was not truthful with the Congress, he deserves to \nbe fired--not Bogden but Gonzales.\n  On the other hand, if the Attorney General was not involved in the \ndecision to fire Bogden and others, he is guilty of gross negligence \nand deserves to be fired. He turned over the awesome power of his \noffice to a handful of young, inexperienced ideologues and allowed them \nto carry out a political campaign from the once-hallowed halls of the \nJustice Department.\n  But the Attorney General's misdeeds extend well beyond politically \ndriven personnel decisions. As White House counsel, he presided over \nthe development of antiterror tactics that have undermined the rule of \nlaw and made Americans less safe. We know now from former Deputy \nAttorney General Jim Comey the Attorney General tried to take advantage \nof John Ashcroft's serious illness--was sick in a hospital bed--to \nobtain Justice Department approval for an illegal surveillance program. \nHe took papers there for him to sign.\n  Time and time again, Alberto Gonzales has proven beyond a doubt his \nutter lack of judgment and independence is foremost in his mind. \nWhether it is tortured reasoning allowing torture or his support of \ndomestic surveillance, firing unfairly U.S. attorneys, hiring \nimmigration judges based on their political affiliation--there is a \nlong list. But let's talk about his being one of the masters of torture \nin our country.\n  I have a law review article from Columbia Law Journal, one of the \nfinest law schools in America, the name of which is ``Drop by Drop: \nForgetting the History of Water Torture in U.S. Courts.'' This is an \narticle written by Judge Evan Wallach, one of the foremost experts in \nthe world on the law of the war. I am only going to read the last \nparagraph of this article. He goes into some detail in the article, \ntalking about how this Attorney General's office, this White House \ncounsel, this administration has allowed torture to be part of what \nAmericans do with detainees and others.\n\n  Here is what Judge Wallach said:\n\n       If we remember what we said and did when our military \n     personnel were victims, if we remember our response when they \n     were perpetrators, how can our government possibly opine that \n     the use of water torture is within the bounds of law? To do \n     so is beneath contempt; it is beyond redemption; and it is a \n     repudiation of the rule of law that in our origins was the \n     core principle of governance which distinguished our nation \n     from the crowned dictatorships of the European continent.\n\n  That is the legacy of this administration and this Attorney General, \nthat law review articles are being written to talk about how awful this \nAttorney General is and what he has allowed to happen.\n\n       To do so is beneath contempt; it is beyond redemption; and \n     it is a repudiation of the rule of law that in our origins \n     was the core principle of governance which distinguished our \n     nation from the crowned dictatorships of the European \n     continent.\n\n  Alberto Gonzales is profoundly unworthy to hold one of the highest \nand most important offices of our great country. I urge my colleagues \nto support this resolution reflecting the facts before us. I urge \nAttorney General Gonzales to resign his office, to give the Department \nof Justice a chance it needs to recover from his catastrophic tenure. \nIf he does not, I urge President Bush to finally remove him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Nothing \nmy colleagues and I say can fill the emptiness that his passing has \nleft or lessen the pain that so many feel.\n  I feel compelled to speak of Senator Thomas not for the effect of my \nwords. Instead, I speak to recognize the effect of his words, his \nactions, and his service.\n  His were words, actions, and service that have improved the lives and \nfutures of Americans. His words and actions will leave a legacy long \nafter our sadness passes.\n  Senator Thomas represented Wyoming effectively and with dignity. I \nwas proud to work with him.\n  We both loved the open beautiful spaces of our home States, and we \nworked to keep them clean, safe, and sustainable. We collaborated to \nimprove the Endangered Species Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  We also worked to safeguard our constituents' livelihoods--\nestablishing the wool trust fund, keeping open global beef markets, and \nmaking sure that our trading partners played by the rules.\n  We worked together to safeguard our natural resources, improve rural \nenergy infrastructure, and plan for a sustainable energy future with \nclean coal technologies.\n  These and many other accomplishments will be Senator Thomas's legacy. \nIt is a legacy for which he deserves recognition, remembrance, and \nhonor. It is a legacy for which our Nation is grateful.\n  But many will remember Senator Thomas more for who he was than for \nwhat he did. They will remember someone with a quick wit, an easy \nsmile, and a generous helping hand.\n  I will remember Senator Thomas as I met him when he first joined the \nSenate in 1989. Back then, I recognized in him something very familiar. \nSenator Thomas was a man of the American West. He embodied the values \nand the character of the people whom he represented.\n  You always knew where Senator Thomas stood. Like many in the West, \nSenator Thomas was quiet, unassuming, and unpretentious--but he was \nnever intimidated.\n  He was gentle and decent. When he gave you his word, he kept it. And \nas we all saw in these final months of his life, when he had to, he \ncould fight like hell.\n  That is the man I will miss and it is the man I wish to recognize \ntoday--an honorable Senator and a great man of the American West.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this last Saturday, I traveled with my \nwife Nancy and many of our colleagues in the Senate to Casper, WY, for \nthe funeral service of my friend Senator Craig Thomas.\n  During the service I was particularly impressed by the words of \nMinority Leader McConnell and I would like to thank him for so \neloquently eulogizing Senator Thomas. So appropriately did his words \nhonor Senator Thomas that I hope all our colleges in the Senate will \ntake the time to read them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this transcript of Senator McConnell's \ncomments be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Service in Honor of Craig Thomas, June 9, 2007\n\n       Reverend [Moore], Susan, Lexie, Patrick, Greg, Peter; \n     distinguished guests, colleagues and friends of Craig Lyle \n     Thomas.\n       There are people that we can't ever imagine dying because \n     they're so alive, and there are people we can't imagine dying \n     because they seem so healthy and so strong. Craig Thomas's \n     death is doubly hard because he was both of these people. But \n     death has done its work, and so we come back to the place \n     that he was always so eager to return to, to accompany him on \n     one last trip back.\n       It was here that he first heard his calling to serve in \n     public life, and here that he first\n\n[[Page S7443]]\n\n     tasted the bitterness of loss. But Susan always told him, \n     ``If you sign up to be a cowboy, you can't complain when you \n     draw a raw, bucking bronco.'' He couldn't have imagined in \n     those early years that one day he'd be known to America as \n     the Senior Senator from Wyoming. But he was never one to \n     dwell on his achievements. So it falls to us, his friends, to \n     speak well of this good man.\n       One of the great things about this country is that so many \n     of its leaders come from such surprising places: a candle \n     shop in Boston, a cabin in Kentucky--and a one room-school \n     house in Wapiti, Wyoming. Senator Enzi tells me that The \n     Wapiti School is still standing, but that it's surrounded now \n     by 10-foot fences and a ring of barbed wire--not to keep the \n     kids in, but to keep the grizzlies out. That fence wasn't \n     there when Craig was in school. They were tougher then.\n       Craig Thomas was always the tough guy--not tough to deal \n     with, not tough on others, just tough. When his family moved \n     to Cody, he signed up for two sports: wrestling and football. \n     One of his teammates on the football team, Al Simpson, was \n     also his neighbor. It may be the only time in American \n     history that two U.S. senators grew up a block and half from \n     each other.\n       There was a time when it was normal for tough guys to be \n     studious too. And if you went back to Cody in the 1940s, \n     you'd find the son of Craig and Marjorie Thomas as attentive \n     to his football plays as he was to Mrs. Thompson's English \n     lessons. He'd remember and benefit from both many years later \n     during hundreds of legislative battles or on countless nights \n     by the campfire along the North Laramie River, reciting the \n     ``Cremation of Sam McGee.''\n       As a young man, Craig would have heard about the days when \n     an unwritten code of honesty, bravery, and chivalry governed \n     daily life in Cody. And he was inspired by stories of another \n     code of bravery that guided young Americans of his own day in \n     exotic places like Guadalcanal, Bougainville, Tarawa, and \n     Guam. World War II cost the Marines nearly 87,000 dead and \n     wounded. But as a young man fresh out of college with his \n     whole life ahead of him, Craig Thomas wanted in. Fifty years \n     later, he still proudly wore the anchor and the globe on his \n     lapel.\n       He was happiest when he was here, but 18 years ago history \n     called him to Washington and he responded dutifully. It was \n     anything but inevitable. His opponent in the campaign to \n     replace an outgoing congressman who's done pretty well \n     himself over the last 18 years had about 99 percent name \n     recognition and had just lost an election for U.S. Senate by \n     about 1,200 votes. The lowest point in the race was the \n     early polling, which suggested that Craig didn't have a \n     chance. But over the next 40 days, the Marine and his \n     staff pulled it off. Craig set the tone, he led the way, \n     and he let others take the credit. That was his way.\n       Four days after the election, Craig and Susan packed their \n     bags, headed east, and two days after that Craig was sworn in \n     as a member of the U.S Congress. It wasn't the easiest \n     transition. As soon as Craig got to Washington, he froze with \n     a sudden realization--he didn't have any suits. So he did \n     what anybody from Wyoming would do. He called Al Simpson, who \n     told him where to find one.\n       A few months later, he had a similar predicament. He and \n     Susan got an invite to the White House and Craig didn't have \n     a tuxedo. So he told one of his staffers to go to a dry \n     cleaning store up the street and rent one--but not to worry \n     about the shirt. When the staffer came back, she found Craig \n     in his office with a buck knife. He was cutting holes into \n     his cuffs for where the cufflinks would go. Craig just \n     laughed that big laugh of his, that full body laugh, and then \n     went to the White House with a tuxedo shirt of his own \n     making.\n       The Gentleman from Wyoming took an office on the top floor \n     of the Longworth Office Building, but he didn't get too \n     comfortable. Some members of the Senate boast about visiting \n     every county in their state over the course of a year. Craig \n     visited all 23 counties in Wyoming--the ninth largest state \n     in America in just two weeks during that first August recess. \n     He enjoyed every minute of it: driving west from Casper, \n     looking out at the Wind River Range, and thinking about what \n     an honor it was to serve this big, beautiful place he loved.\n       This was his home, and he loved it. He loved the land, he \n     loved the people. But anyone who knew him knew what his \n     greatest love was.\n       Craig met Susan in 1978. She was working on a statewide \n     campaign, he was working for the state Republican Party, and \n     she invited him over to talk about the race. When she looked \n     out the window and saw a man riding toward her office on his \n     bicycle, she turned to the woman next to her and said, ``Now \n     who would that be?'' She soon found out, and thanks to her \n     loving support, so did the rest of the country. Everything \n     they did, they did together. She was with him for every race \n     he won. Craig always said Susan was the one who liked \n     campaigning.\n       They were like children, but they were deadly serious about \n     their work. Craig viewed politics as a high calling, and he \n     viewed Susan's work the same way. He admired her deeply. He \n     never failed to mention her. I remember my wife Elaine \n     telling me after giving the commencement speech one year at \n     Susan's high school, how devoted to her the students there \n     were.\n       We honor Susan today for her devotion to Craig. We'll miss \n     seeing her outside the Senate chamber waiting for him to \n     finish up his votes. The Senate's a lonelier, less joyful \n     place without Craig. It's already a lonelier, less joyful \n     place without her too.\n       The people of Wyoming sent Craig to the Senate in 1994, and \n     those of us who've served with him there are grateful they \n     did. It was the first time since 1906 that every statewide \n     office in Wyoming was held by a Republican, and the credit, \n     of course, goes to Craig. He led the ticket, and he worked \n     tirelessly to bring everyone else along with him.\n       But again, he didn't take the credit. And the victory and \n     the higher office did nothing to change the man. If there was \n     any chance of that, Susan made sure to nip it in the bud. She \n     made him hang a photo of himself falling off a horse. She \n     knew the Scripture that ``pride cometh before a fail'' But \n     Craig knew it too, and he wouldn't disappoint. He was a \n     simple, humble son of Wyoming and he remained one to the end.\n       He was always eager to get home. So eager, in fact, that \n     one time when his Mustang broke down on the way to the \n     airport, he left it on the side of the highway and hitchhiked \n     the rest of the way. They let him on the plane to Cheyenne \n     without a ticket or anything. He called his staff from the \n     airport to see if someone could get the car. When they found \n     it, the keys were still in the ignition. They sent his \n     clothes on the next plane.\n       We'll never forget his toughness, his goodness, his humor, \n     his steady reassuring hand. Nor his kindness, which he always \n     showed toward everyone--from presidents to doormen. He was \n     straightforward and honest. In a phrase that Craig might have \n     recalled from Mrs. Thompson's Shakespeare lessons, he was not \n     a man ``to double business bound.'' His only business was his \n     duty--to God, country, family, and friends. And he fulfilled \n     them beautifully.\n       He was strong, humble, and full of faith. And here is why. \n     As a boy Craig Thomas looked out at the majesty of the \n     canyons and the falls of Yellowstone and knew there is a God. \n     As a teenager he saw the hard work and dedication of his \n     parents and learned that giving is more admirable than \n     taking. And as a man he could hear the rumble of the herd \n     even from his desk in Washington, and know that the movements \n     of men were nothing compared to the power of the wild.\n       I am not a cowboy. But I've come to know and admire a few \n     of them in my 22 years in the Senate. And I've come to know a \n     little bit about their pastimes. I've heard that holding down \n     a steer takes two kinds of ropers--a header and a heeler, and \n     that there's an old saying that the header may be the \n     quarterback, but that the heeler makes the money. The idea is \n     that there may be more glory in roping the head, but that the \n     heeler has the harder, more important, and less glamorous \n     job. No one who knew Craig Thomas is surprised to know that \n     he preferred to be a heeler.\n       The most impressive thing in Washington is also the rarest: \n     and that's a man whose position and power has no effect on \n     the person he was when he got there. I've never met a man who \n     was changed less by what the world calls riches or power than \n     Craig Lyle Thomas.\n       Now this great American life has come to an end. Yet we \n     know it continues: This husband, father, lawmaker, mentor, \n     and friend goes to the Father's house. We take comfort \n     entrusting him to the Lord of Mercy, who tells us that in the \n     life to come, every question will be answered, every tear \n     wiped away. And we are confident in the hope that he will \n     ride again, healthy and strong, along a wider, more majestic \n     plain in a land that's everlasting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7443-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7443-S7444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   TECHNICAL SERGEANT RYAN A. BALMER\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave airman from Mishawaka. \nRyan Balmer, 33 years old, was killed on June 5 while deployed near \nKirkuk, Iraq, when an improvised explosive device struck his vehicle. \nWith an optimistic future before him, Ryan risked everything to fight \nfor the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway \naround the world.\n  Ryan has served in the Air Force since enlisting shortly after \ngraduating Mishawaka High School in 1993. He was extremely proud of his \nmilitary service and was nearing the end of his 6-month tour in Iraq \nwhen he was killed by the improvised explosive device. In addition to \nhis military service, Ryan, the youngest of nine children, was the \ndevoted husband of Danielle Balmer and the father of two sons and one \ndaughter.\n  Ryan was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nHe was assigned to Detachment 113, 1st Field Investigations Region, \nstationed at Hill Air Force Base, UT. A good high school friend of \nRyan's, Dave Falkenau, told local media that, ``[Ryan] would go out of \nhis way for anyone; I wouldn't be surprised if he died trying to save \nsomeone else from dying.''\n  Today, I join Ryan's family and friends in mourning his death. While\n\n[[Page S7444]]\n\nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Ryan, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Ryan was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Ryan will be remembered by family members, \nfriends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Ryan's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Ryan's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Ryan A. Balmer in the official \nrecord of the Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nRyan's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Ryan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7444-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7444-S7445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, over the last few weeks, the Senate has \nconsidered an issue that inspires strong feelings all around--the need \nfor immigration reform. While the bill we were considering has many \nflaws, I am disappointed that some Members of this body decided to talk \nit to death. I voted to move this bill forward because Congress should \nact on this issue, and because I am hopeful that the bill's flaws can \nbe cured during the next stages of the legislative process.\n  Despite our differences in approach, all of us in this Chamber agree \non three core principles that form the bedrock of any comprehensive \nimmigration reform. First, we must do something about the estimated 12 \nmillion undocumented immigrants who live and work in the shadows. The \nstatus quo is simply unacceptable. It harms citizens and noncitizens \nalike and makes us less safe as a nation. Second, we must take the \nnecessary steps to prevent illegal immigration in the future so that we \ndo not find ourselves back here in the same position 20 years from now. \nAnd, third, we must establish a system that allows people who can make \nvaluable contributions to our society--by, for example, strengthening \nfamilies or performing jobs that cannot be filled by Americans--to \nenter the country legally. These goals must be accomplished in a way \nthat is consistent with our values as a nation. The fundamental problem \nwith this bill, as it now stands, is that it fails to accomplish these \nobjectives; in fact, it contains several provisions that go directly \nagainst these objectives.\n  With respect to the 12 million undocumented immigrants, the bill held \ngenuine promise when it came to the floor. As both the President and \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security have said, mass deportation is not a \nviable option, nor is amnesty for those who have broken the law. As \nintroduced on the Senate floor, this legislation would have required \nthose who are here illegally to come forward, pay hefty fines, pay \ntaxes, learn English and civics, work, and wait in the back of the \nline--before earning the privilege of permanent resident status. That \nwould have been a workable solution.\n  Unfortunately, this linchpin of the bill was undercut by the Senate's \nadoption of an amendment offered by Senator Cornyn. The amendment \nremoved critical confidentiality provisions that would have protected \napplicants for legalization from being deported if their applications \nwere denied. The problem with this approach is that few undocumented \nimmigrants will even apply for legalization without this protection. \nThey will stay in the shadows, and we will be exactly where we are now. \nIf this bill ultimately moves forward, it is vitally important that \nthese confidentiality provisions be included in the House bill and \nretained in conference; otherwise, the bill will defeat its own main \npurpose.\n  I also hope to see progress on other provisions that threaten to \nundermine the very purpose of the earned legalization program. I am \nparticularly concerned about requiring undocumented immigrants to leave \nthe United States in order to apply for permanent residence. Although \nthe bill guarantees their reentry, this ``touch-back'' requirement \ncreates a major practical obstacle for many immigrants, especially \nthose who come from far-flung regions of the globe. Moreover, many \nundocumented immigrants--who may be receiving their information about \nthe legislation from unreliable sources, or who may face language \nbarriers in understanding its provisions--will be unwilling to leave \nthe U.S. for fear that they will not be allowed to return. Again, a \nbill that creates a legalization program but discourages immigrants \nfrom applying for legalization gets us nowhere.\n  Another vital component of comprehensive immigration reform is a \nsystem that allows employers to turn to foreign labor as a last resort \nwhen they genuinely cannot find American workers to do the job. \nPermitting these workers to enter the country legally furthers the \nsecond core principle of comprehensive reform: avoiding a future flow \nof undocumented workers who would otherwise create a new underground \neconomy. Unlike the bill we passed last year, however, the bill the \nSenate considered this year has no meaningful path to permanent \nresidence for immigrants in the temporary worker program. It requires \nworkers in that program to interrupt their employment every 2 years and \nleave the U.S. for a period of 1 year, and it prohibits most of these \nworkers from bringing their families to the U.S. Taken together, these \nprovisions are a recipe for a massive new flow of illegal immigration--\nonce again defeating the very purpose the program was meant to serve.\n  I am also concerned that the temporary worker program contains \ninsufficient protections for U.S. and foreign workers. I was pleased at \nthe success of the Durbin-Grassley amendment, which strengthened the \nbill's requirement that employers recruit and hire U.S. workers before \nhiring temporary foreign workers. But that protection is simply not \nsufficient. The single best mechanism for enforcement of labor \nprotections is a path to permanent residence. Knowing that foreign \nworkers cannot simply be used up and thrown away prevents employers \nfrom exploiting them. That, in turn, takes away the incentive to hire \nforeign workers over U.S. citizens and ensures that working conditions \nfor all workers don't sink to a lowest common denominator. It is a \ncritical protection that is lacking from this bill.\n  Because I believe the temporary worker program as currently drafted \nwill foster illegal immigration and will not sufficiently protect U.S. \nand foreign workers, I voted for Senator Bingaman's amendment to limit \nthe scope of the program and Senator Dorgan's amendment to sunset the \nprogram in 5 years. Unless and until the structural problems with the \nprogram are fixed--and I hope they will be--we should not be putting in \nplace a permanent program of the magnitude contemplated by the original \nbill.\n  Another serious flaw in the bill is its inclusion of multiple \n``triggers''--enforcement requirements that must be fulfilled before \nother critical reforms could begin. While these provisions are designed \nto further the second core goal of immigration reform--preventing a \nfuture flow of illegal immigration--they will have exactly the opposite \neffect. History tells us that an ``enforcement-only'' approach simply \ndoesn't work: the probability of catching an illegal immigrant has \nfallen over the past two decades from 33 percent to 5 percent, despite \nthe fact that\n\n[[Page S7445]]\n\nwe have tripled the number of border agents and increased the \nenforcement budget tenfold. True border security requires both \nincreased enforcement measures and the creation of adequate legal \nchannels for immigration, including programs to bring needed foreign \nworkers into the U.S. and to allow undocumented immigrants who pass \nbackground checks to earn legal status. These measures allow us to \nseparate those who are here to work and contribute to our communities \nfrom terrorists and others who pose a serious threat to this Nation, so \nthat our immigration enforcement agents can focus their efforts in the \nright place. Postponing these measures--as this bill does--makes us \nless safe, not more.\n  The bill's solution to the third challenge of immigration reform--\nshaping the contours of legal immigration--is a radical shift away from \nfamily reunification. That solution is not consistent with the core \nvalues of this Nation. In the past, our immigration laws have \nacknowledged that our country and our communities are stronger when \nfamilies are united. But under this bill, it will be much harder for \nU.S. citizens and legal immigrants to be reunited with parents, \nsiblings, and adult children. Some of my colleagues argued that this \nshift in policy is a necessary step toward embracing a ``merit-based'' \nsystem of immigration. But I believe there is a great deal of merit in \nkeeping families together. And I don't believe that bringing people \nwith useful skills to this country can only be accomplished at the \nexpense of family unity.\n  We had the opportunity to do something about the bill's antifamily \nprovisions. Along with Senators Menendez and Obama, I cosponsored two \namendments: one that would sunset the so-called ``merit-based'' system \nin 5 years, and one that would reallocate points within the merit-based \nsystem to place more value on family ties. The first amendment failed, \nwhile the Senate has not yet had the opportunity to vote on the second. \nOther amendments would have improved this aspect of the bill, but they \nfell victim to points of order, and we were prevented from voting on \nthem. So we are left with a system that values 3 years of U.S. \nemployment more than the relationship between a brother and sister.\n  Beyond these much debated aspects of the bill, I am also deeply \nconcerned by a little-discussed provision that would allow the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to detain several different categories \nof immigrants indefinitely. These immigrants may effectively be given a \nlifetime jail sentence, even though they have committed no crime for \nwhich such a sentence could be imposed by judge or jury. There is \nalready a provision in our existing immigrations laws under which the \nGovernment may indefinitely detain any immigrant who is suspected of \nterrorism or whose release would threaten national security. The bill \ngoes far beyond that, even allowing the Government to detain--forever--\nimmigrants who have never been suspected, let alone convicted, of any \ncrime. That does nothing to make us safer, and it goes against \neverything this country stands for.\n  A similar challenge to our core values was presented by an amendment \noffered by Senator Cornyn. The amendment would have allowed the \nGovernment to deny citizenship to legal immigrants based on secret \nevidence and without any opportunity for review. It would have required \nthe mandatory deportation of several new categories of immigrants \nwithout any individualized determination of whether such deportation \nwas appropriate. And it would have doomed the earned legalization \nprogram with provisions that would make most applicants ineligible. In \nshort, the amendment put forward a scattershot approach that would have \npenalized immigrants who pose no threat to us and stripped them of \ncrucial due process rights. Fortunately, Senator Kennedy offered us an \nalternative that responsibly and effectively targets the small \nproportion of immigrants who threaten the safety of our communities. \nHis amendment will ensure that immigrants who have committed serious \ncrimes not fully covered by existing immigration laws, including \nfirearms offenses, domestic violence, child abuse, or felony drunk \ndriving, cannot come to this country. I joined the majority of the \nSenate in voting for this more sensible and effective approach and \nagainst Senator Cornyn's amendment.\n  Despite my concerns about the bill, it contains several provisions \nthat are important and worthy. For example, this bill contains the \nDREAM Act, which provides higher education opportunities for children \nwho are long-term U.S. residents and came to this country illegally \nthrough no fault of their own. It also contains AgJOBS, a bill long in \nthe making that will provide much needed assistance to agricultural \nworkers. And it contains the Secure and Safe Detention and Asylum Act, \nto ensure that asylum seekers and other vulnerable populations have a \nmeaningful opportunity to exercise their rights under law, and to \nprovide for humane detention conditions in accordance with the \nrecommendations of the U.S. Commission on International Religious \nFreedom.\n  I am pleased the Senate approved the addition to the bill of the \nWartime Treatment Study Act, legislation Senator Grassley and I have \nbeen trying to enact for years to examine the treatment of German \nAmericans, Italian Americans, and other European Americans during World \nWar II, as well as Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany. While there \nhas been study of the internment and relocation of Japanese Americans \nduring World War II, few people know about our Government's failure to \nprotect the basic rights of German and Italian Americans. We also must \nunderstand why, as the United States heroically battled fascism, our \nGovernment turned away thousands of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi \nGermany, delivering many of them to their deaths at the hands of the \nNazi regime. I first introduced this legislation in 2001 after hearing \nfrom a group of German Americans in Wisconsin who were concerned that \nthis sad chapter in our Nation's history had gone unnoticed for too \nlong. It is only appropriate for a country that prides itself on \nequality and justice to acknowledge and learn from its mistakes. It is \nlong past time to enact the Wartime Treatment Study Act, and I will \ncontinue to push for it to become law.\n  I hope the Senate will still have the chance to address the need for \ncomprehensive immigration reform. Congress needs to act on this issue, \nwhich is why I voted to move forward with this bill despite the serious \nflaws I have discussed. I will work with my colleagues to try to make \nsure this happens and to make sure that we end up with a bill that \nrepresents true immigration reform--one that encourages the 12 million \nundocumented immigrants in this country to come forward out of the \nshadows, takes a comprehensive approach to preventing illegal \nimmigration in the future, and strengthens our society by welcoming \nimmigrants who can make valuable contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7445-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7445-S7446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 VERMONT HOUSING AND CONSERVATION BOARD\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to bring to the \nattention of the Senate the important work the members and staff of the \nVermont Housing and Conservation Board have accomplished during their \nfirst 20 years of service to protect Vermont's working landscape and to \nhelp ensure that Vermonters have safe and affordable places to call \nhome.\n  Since 1987, VHCB, its board members and staff have invested in 427 \nfarms, resulting in the conservation of 118,500 acres of farmland; \nprotected 250,000 acres of recreational and natural areas; and \nconstructed or rehabilitated 8500 units of affordable housing. This has \nbeen a conscious investment of $200 million in our Green Mountains, \nleveraging an additional $750 million from public and private sources. \nFew organizations can boast the stimulus of $1 billion in two short \ndecades.\n  For centuries, Vermonters have made their livings working the land. \nAs land use patterns drastically change across the country, including \nin the valleys of Vermont, VHCB has helped many farmers and communities \nconserve the rural working landscape that has come to define Vermont \nand the way of life in our State's communities. VHCB has become a \nnational leader in farmland protection practices--educating family \nfarmers how they can make money protecting working farmland and rural \nlandscape for generations to come. The\n\n[[Page S7446]]\n\nprotections VHCB has been able to offer Vermont's farmers have resulted \nin hundreds of farms remaining active and contributing members of their \ncommunities, allowing them to remain Vermont's ultimate environmental \nstewards. VHCB's expertise also allowed me to work with them to \nimplement a farm preservation pilot program in Vermont that has since \nbecome known as the Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program, a national \nfarmland protection program. Today, this program has protected nearly a \nhalf million acres of farmland in 42 States nationwide.\n  For centuries, the very same farmers who have lived off the land have \nbecome well known for their love of fishing, hunting, hiking and \nsnowmobiling across Vermont's forests and open spaces. With encroaching \nurban sprawl and changing demographics, these lands, too, have been \ndwindling. VHCB has made it a priority to preserve these natural lands \nand access to these lands, conserving a quarter of a million acres of \nthese green spaces.\n  As a dual mission organization, VHCB has also led the country in \ndeveloping and administering steady private, State and Federal funding \nsources for the preservation, development and rehabilitation of quality \naffordable housing in all corners of Vermont. These homes, like the \ngreat pieces of granite my grandfather once cut out of the \nmountainsides of Vermont, are the foundations for the future of \nVermont. Additionally, many of these homes are designated perpetually \naffordable, ensuring that generations of Vermonters will have places to \ncall home. Recently the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment named Vermont's federally funded HOME program, administered \nby VHCB, as the most effective program among 51 participating \njurisdictions in the country for the fourth quarter in a row.\n  Like so many Vermonters, I live in a rather old house in the Green \nMountains. At least half of Vermont's housing stock is estimated to be \nmore than 50 years old, and many are more than a century old. With this \nYankee character comes a great danger that VHCB has identified and \ntackled with great skill: lead poisoning. The most common cause of lead \npoisoning is exposure to dust from deteriorated lead-based paint in a \nchild's home or daycare. The Vermont Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction \nProgram, administered by VHCB, has provided technical and financial \nassistance to eligible landlords and homeowners to reduce the risk of \nlead poisoning in Vermont's buildings and homes.\n  Since the very beginning, my good friend Gus Seelig has steered this \norganization through both calm and stormy weather. Like any good \nleader, I am certain that Gus would say this organization owes a great \ndeal of its success to its many past and present board members and \nstaff. On behalf of the people of Vermont, I thank and applaud everyone \nwho has worked to make the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board a \nsuccess. Congratulations on 20 great years preserving the character and \naffordability of Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7446-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOMMISSION OF THE USS ``MICHIGAN''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommemorate the recommission of the USS Michigan, SSGN-727. A formal \nreturn to service ceremony will be held on Tuesday, June 12 at 1 p.m. \nto honor the USS Michigan and her officers and crew, which includes \ncaptain of the boat CDR Terry Takats and chief of the boat CMDCM Wayne \nLassiter.\n  The USS Michigan will return to active duty as the second Ohio-class \nnuclear-powered Trident missile submarine in the U.S. Navy to be \nrefitted from a ballistic missile submarine, SSBN, into a guided \nmissile submarine, SSGN. This conversion has enhanced and transformed \nthe capabilities of the USS Michigan, making it a more valuable asset \nand serving as an example of the Navy's ongoing transformation to face \ncurrent and future threats around the world.\n  The USS Michigan has had a proud tradition of service, and SSGN-727 \nwill be the third naval vessel to bear the name of our great State. The \nfirst ship to carry this name was launched by the Navy in 1843 as its \nfirst iron-hulled warship. She operated throughout the Great Lakes for \nher entire period of service, gaining notoriety when she helped to \nsuccessfully end the Fenian invasion of Canada by intercepting supplies \nbetween Buffalo and Fort Erie, Ontario along the Niagara River.\n  U.S. Naval vessels bearing the Michigan name have courageously seen \naction against Mexico, served as convoy escorts during WWI, and most \nrecently completed more than 33 strategic deterrent patrols throughout \nthe world. The newly converted USS Michigan SSGN-727 will return to \nservice with a new mission and enhanced capabilities.\n  The new guided missile submarine conversion program was developed by \nthe Navy to create a more efficient and effective dual-use submarine \nforce. The USS Michigan's successful transformation has maintained all \nthe benefits of its predecessor, while creating a ship that will act as \na force multiplier for the Navy. It has an increased payload capacity \nof 154 cruise missiles and the capability to more effectively house, \nsustain, and deploy a variety of special operations forces, allowing \nfor a support role, as well as stealth insertion and extraction of \noperatives. The flexibility of this new submarine will allow it to \nefficiently function in a variety of multimission scenarios.\n  The USS Michigan is a shining example of the U.S. Navy's \ntransformation, and I know my colleagues will join me in commemorating \nits return to active service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7446-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7446-S7447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            MONTANA HISTORY\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the history of Butte, Anaconda, and \nWalkerville is as bright and intricate as the people who live there. \nStories of greed, danger, and power intermingle with values like hard \nwork and loyalty, to weave a tapestry as rich as any city in America. \nAs the Montana Historical Society has so richly shown, the history of \nButte is the history of our country.\n  As America began to slowly mature from a budding nation to an \ninternational superpower, the growing pains became evident. Settlers, \npacking what little belongings they could fit into the legendary \nprairie schooners, began to gaze at the horizon and seek fame and \nfortune on the Western frontier. As the trails became longer, and the \ndistance grew greater, the limits of one nation were pressed. Yet the \npowers of American ingenuity and our Nation's legendary can-do spirit \nkicked in. Samuel Morse learned how to communicate through code, and \nAlexander Graham Bell discovered how to talk through wires.\n  While these men showed great genius, without the sweat of working men \nand women these inventions would be nothing more than a footnote in \nhistory. But as miners extracted mountains of copper from the Earth's \nbelly, telegraph and telephone wires began to crisscross our country. \nSuddenly, a letter that used to take days would now take minutes. \nCitizens on the eastern seaboard would know what was happening on the \nplains, and at last we truly were one Nation.\n  And at the heart of this was Butte, Anaconda, and Walkerville. Here, \nthe gallow frames and the towering Anaconda Company smokestacks pierce \nthe skyline as a monument to the men and women whose toil became the \nbedrock of our great Nation. Though faced with danger, and even death, \nthese workers strapped on their boots every morning and from daybreak \ntill night provided the fuel for a growing nation.\n  Faced with dire circumstance and physical harm, these workers \ndeveloped a bond that none outside the mines could understand. They \nstood together through thick and thin, and truly were a family.\n  This bond took form in two of the Nation's most radical unions, the \nWestern Federation of Miners, and the Industrial Workers of the World. \nLocated in ``the Gibraltar of Unionism'', Butte and Walkerville, these \nunions waged a class warfare the likes of which is still the fodder for \nlegends. The class war soon came to a raging boil after the Butte \nGranite/Speculator Mine fire, the worst hard-rock mining disaster in \nthe Nation's history. Unions were busted, agitators dealt with, and the \ncrushing hand of the ``company'' dealt a crippling blow to the workers.\n\n[[Page S7447]]\n\n  Yet with the New Deal came new life for the unions. As the Federal \nGovernment guaranteed the right of workers to unionize, the strength of \nthe men and women who worked the mines began to shine. In 1934, a 4-\nmonth strike, lead to the birth of the CIO, an organization that has \nbecome synonymous with unions, and workers' rights.\n  Now, as Butte, Walkerville, and Anaconda usher in the 21st century, \nthese cities' special past will be immortalized forever. In 2006, the \nNational Park Service recognized that this trio of cities' history of \nmining and labor should be remembered for generations and declared the \ndistrict a National Historic Landmark. I was proud to work with many \npeople from the area, and showing the determination of their ancestors, \nwas able to make this landmark a reality. The district will be the \nlargest National Historic Landmark in the West, covering the period \nfrom 1876 to 1934 and encompassing nearly 10,000 acres with over 6,000 \ncontributing resources. And one woman, whose heart and soul was poured \ninto this district, is Ellen Crain, Director of the Butte Public \nArchives. With the undeterred tenacity of the miners before her, Ellen \nworked for 14 long years to make this possible. Because of her hard \nwork, the citizens in the district will also be able to reflect with \npride on their past, as they work to uphold the cities' great tradition \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7447-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF NOONAN, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I recognize a community in \nNorth Dakota that will be celebrating its 100th anniversary. On June \n29-July 1, the residents of Noonan will gather to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Noonan is a thriving rural community in northwest North Dakota that \nshares a border with the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Noonan \nholds an important place in North Dakota's history. Like many of the \nrural communities in North Dakota, Noonan began its history as a \ncommunity with the arrival of the Great Northern Railroad. Noonan \nreceived its name from Patrick Noonan, the first mayor of Noonan. The \nfirst businesses in Noonan included the Golden Rule General Store, an \nimplement store, and a hotel. Noonan officially became a city on \nSeptember 14, 1928.\n  Today, the community of Noonan is largely based on agriculture and is \nhome to some of the best waterfowl and upland game hunting in northwest \nNorth Dakota. There is also a volunteer fire department and EMT \nservice, two taverns, and many other businesses in this close-knit \ncommunity where everyone knows everyone. The nearby Noonan trout pond \noffers camping and fishing. Noonan is also home to a prominent Lions \nClub chapter, which is the oldest service organization in Noonan and \nwhose main goal is to help the blind.\n  The community of Noonan is a wonderful place for its residents to \nlive, work, and raise future generations. The people of Noonan take \npride in their community and all the opportunities it has to offer. The \ntown has an exciting centennial weekend planned that includes dances, a \nparade, variety show, a Sunday brunch, and much more.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Noonan, ND, and its \nresidents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well through the \nnext century. By honoring Noonan and all other historic small towns of \nNorth Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for \nfuture generations. It is places such as Noonan that have helped to \nshape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine \ncommunity is deserving of our recognition.\n  Noonan has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7447-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF GRANVILLE, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 100th \nanniversary. On June 29-July 1, the residents of Granville will gather \nto celebrate their community's history and founding.\n  Granville is a friendly rural community located in northern North \nDakota. William Christianson, along with his wife Minnie, were the \nfirst non-native people to settle the soon-to-be prairie town of \nGranville in 1895. William was an employee of the Great Northern \nRailway, and the town of Granville was named after Granville M. Dodge, \na civil engineer for the railway. Established in 1901, the Granville \nState bank was one of the first businesses established. Granville was \nofficially declared a city in 1907.\n  Today, like so many smaller rural communities in North Dakota, \nGranville is a tight-knit town where everyone knows their neighbor. \nGranville is known for its welcoming hospitality and conversation and \nit is easy to witness this local atmosphere at Granville's Memorial \nDiner. A beautiful city park offers a chance for parents and their \nchildren to have fun and play together.\n  The community of Granville is a wonderful place for its citizens to \nlive and experience life together. The people of Granville take great \npride in their community and all it has to offer. To celebrate their \ncentennial anniversary, the town will be holding a barbeque, wagon \ntrain, parade, and fireworks.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Granville, ND and its \nresidents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well through the \nnext century.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to honor a \ncommunity in North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On \nJuly 5-8, the residents of Cooperstown will celebrate their community's \nhistory and founding.\n  Cooperstown is a vibrant community located in east-central North \nDakota. The town was founded in 1882 by Rollin and Thomas Cooper, who \nhad previously been miners in Colorado. As with many communities in \nNorth Dakota, the arrival of the railroad in 1883 contributed greatly \nto Cooperstown's growth. The town's post office was established on \nDecember 28, 1882. The town continued to grow, becoming incorporated as \na village in 1892 and as a city in 1906.\n  Today, Cooperstown plays host to manufacturers, agricultural \nbusinesses, and many other local companies. Cooperstown is also proud \nto boast a strong community, with chapters of 4-H, the American Legion, \nand the Boy and Girl Scouts of America, in addition to several local \ncommunity organizations.\n  Tourism opportunities abound in Cooperstown. Sportsmen seek out \nhunting and fishing near Lake Ashtabula and the Red River Lake. The \nCooper Theater hosts local plays, and the Griggs County Museum provides \na window on Cooperstown's past.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Cooperstown, ND, and \nits residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the \nfuture. By honoring Cooperstown and all the other historic small towns \nof North Dakota, we keep the great tradition of the pioneering frontier \nspirit alive for future generations.

Mr. President, 50 years ago on June 8, 1957, \nClovis Air Force Base was renamed Cannon Air Force Base. On this \nanniversary, I would like to like to pay tribute to the men and women \nwho have and continue to serve at Cannon.\n  Cannon was named after GEN John Kenneth Cannon who commanded Army Air \nCorps forces in the Mediterranean and later was commanding general of \nall Army Air Corps forces in Europe during the Second World War. After \nthe war, General Cannon served\n\n[[Page S7448]]\n\nas commander in chief of U.S. Air Forces Europe and commanding general \nof Tactical Air Command. During his service, General Cannon earned four \nDistinguished Service Medals, a Legion of Merit, a Bronze Star, and the \nAir Medal. He also received decorations from Great Britain, France, \nItaly, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Morocco.\n  For the last 50 years the service men and women who called Cannon \nhome have been deployed numerous times around the world to ensure the \nnational security of our country. They have performed their duty \nfaithfully and in a manner that I am sure would make General Cannon \nproud.\n  This year we will see major changes at Cannon as the 27th Fighter \nWing is deactivated in preparation for the impending arrival of the \n16th Special Operations Wing in October. While we are excited for the \narrival of the 16th Special Operations Wing, we are sad to see the men \nand women of the 27th Fighter Wing go.\n  In the coming years I am sure the 16th Special Operations Wing will \ncontinue the 27th Fighter Wing's long tradition of excellence at \nCannon. Again, I would like to thank the men and women, past and \npresent, who have made Cannon a source of national pride.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7448-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF JEFFREY S. MERRIFIELD\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Honorable Jeffrey S. Merrifield \nwill be leaving the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, on June \n30, 2007. Originally from Antrim, NH, Jeff Merrifield has served as a \nmember of the Commission since October 23, 1998. First appointed by \nPresident Clinton, Jeff was reappointed by President Bush and was sworn \nin for a second term on August 5, 2002. After a distinguished \ngovernment career at the NRC and on Capitol Hill, Jeff Merrifield has \nchosen to pursue endeavors in the private sector.\n  Throughout his tenure at the NRC, Jeff Merrifield has invested \nconsiderable time in familiarizing himself with the operations of NRC \nlicensees, visiting all 104 operating power reactors in the United \nStates, as well as numerous nuclear materials facilities and sites \nundergoing decommissioning. Jeff actively supported initiatives to \nimprove the transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness of NRC \nregulatory programs. He headed an NRC Communications Task Force charged \nwith initiating and implementing many recommendations to improve agency \ninternal and external communications. Jeff also led an interagency task \nforce of fifteen departments and agencies to identify gaps in the \ncontrol and use of radiation source materials as required by the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005. Recommendations of this task force were detailed in \na report to the President and Congress.\n  Jeff Merrifield has advocated a vision of excellence in regulating \nthe safe and secure uses of nuclear material for the public good. A \nparticipant in the development of NRC's Strategic Plan, he championed a \nnumber of significant regulatory improvements, including efforts to \nrisk-inform regulations, provide discipline in staff review of \napplications for license renewal, and prepare the agency for potential \nnew power reactor applications. Recently Jeff chaired a Combined \nLicense Review Task Force which made a number of recommendations to \nimprove the efficiency and effectiveness of the review of new reactor \napplications. He was the leading advocate for the use of the alternate \ndispute resolution process in agency enforcement actions and has taken \na special interest in improving the management of decommissioning \nfunding.\n  As an NRC Commissioner, Jeff Merrifield was actively involved in the \nagency's post September 11, 2001, response activities. These actions \nresulted in a significant improvement in security at NRC licensed \nfacilities. Both before and since the terrible events of 9/11, NRC \nlicensed power reactors are some of the best protected facilities in \nthe civilian community.\n  Recognizing the NRC's influence in the international regulatory \ncommunity, Jeff has traveled abroad to discuss policy issues with \nnuclear regulators and foreign dignitaries in more than 35 countries \nand has toured more than 140 nuclear reactors overseas. In 2005, he led \nan NRC delegation to India for the fifth bilateral exchange between the \nIndian Atomic Energy Regulatory Board and the NRC. This was the first \nvisit to India by a member of the Commission following President Bush's \ninitiative ``Next Steps in the Strategic Partnership'' with India. Jeff \nwas also the major advocate for the establishment of a three-nation \nagreement with Canada and Mexico on nuclear materials and waste issues \nthrough periodic trilateral meetings.\n  Mr. President, please join me in thanking Jeff Merrifield for his \ndedicated service to the American people and in wishing him and his \nfamily all the best in their future pursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7448-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7448-S7449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROBERT B.

Mehnert, who is retiring after 48 years of dedicated service \nto the Government and people of the United States of America.\n  Mr. Mehnert began his public service in 1958 with the U.S. Army, \ncontinuing in uniform until 1962. In 1963 he reentered Federal service, \nthis time as a management intern with the then-Department of Health, \nEducation and Welfare. He rose quickly through the ranks and, in 1971, \nMr. Mehnert became Chief of the Office of Public Information at the \nNational Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health. \nSince 1998 he has directed the Office of Communications and Public \nLiaison at the library. For more than a quarter century, Mr. Mehnert's \nkeen editorial and literary talents have helped library's director, \nDonald A.B. Lindberg, M.D., and his predecessor, Martin M. Cummings, \nM.D., to communicate the most current and reliable medical and consumer \nhealth information to medical professionals, researchers, patients, \nfamilies, and the public.\n  During his tenure at the National Library of Medicine, Mr. Mehnert \nhas been in the vanguard of a revolution in health information. The \nintroduction of the Internet and the Web environment vastly increased \nthe number and extent of NLM services and audiences. In 1997, after \nmore than a century of serving the library and medical communities \nexclusively, the National Library of Medicine launched Medline freely \non the Web and declared that it would seek to serve the general public \nas well. With Mr. Mehnert's help, other NLM services for the consumer \npublic quickly followed. In 1998, MedlinePlus.gov, a source of \nauthoritative full-text health information written for the consumer was \nunveiled. In 2000, ClinicalTrials.gov--an NLM Web site that provides \nconsumers with information on medical research studies that are \nrecruiting patients--was launched. Other NLM consumer-oriented \ndatabases were introduced in the last decade as bandwidth and the power \nof personal computers increased. They have included \nNIHSeniorHealth.gov, a talking Web site with topics and formats \ntailored to the needs of older persons; Genetics Home Reference, a Web \nsite that makes genetics and its relationship to disease more \nunderstandable to the public; the Household Products database that \nprovides easy-to-understand information on the potential health effects \nof ingredients contained in common household products; and many others.\n  One of Mr. Mehnert's most tangible legacies has been his recent \nservice on the editorial team responsible for producing a new quarterly \nNIH magazine, NIHMedlinePlus, which is sent to doctors' offices \nnationwide for their patients to read. The production of this consumer-\noriented magazine fulfills Congress's call to publicize the fruits of \nNIH-sponsored research to patients, their families, and the public at \nlarge.\n  Mr. Mehnert has been recognized by the National Library of Medicine \nand the National Institutes of Health for his exceptional leadership \nand achievements. Aside from numerous merit awards, his honors have \nalso included being the recipient of both the NLM Director's Award and \nthe NIH Director's Award on several occasions.\n  As someone who has worked for many years to support medical research, \nI am especially grateful to people who have dedicated their lives to \nthis crucial public health mission. Bob Mehnert has done that and is a \ngreat testament to what public service is all about. Bob and his wife, \nHelene, have three daughters, seven grandchildren,\n\n[[Page S7449]]\n\nand 1.5 great grandchildren--that is, one is on the way. I thank Bob \nfor his distinguished career in service to the American people, and I \nwish him many well-deserved years of happiness in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7449-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE BARABOO NATIONAL BANK\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to take the time to \nrecognize and honor Baraboo National Bank located in Baraboo, WI. This \nyear, the bank celebrates 150 years as Baraboo's first and oldest bank.\n  On July 15, 1857, Simeon Mills joined with Terrell Thomas to open \nSauk County Bank, Wisconsin's 15th chartered bank, in a building just \ndown the street from its present location. They began with $50,000 in \noperating capital and by the end of that year were well on their way to \nestablishing a successful institution. By the early 1860s, the Sauk \nCounty Bank had grown their operating capital to break the $100,000 \nmark. A fire in their first location caused the bank to move into \ntemporary quarters on the back of a lot purchased on the corner of Oak \nand Third Avenue. The new building would soon be built on this corner \nand stand until today.\n  In 1873 the charter for Sauk County Bank changed and the bank renamed \nas First National Bank of Baraboo. For a 7-year period after the bank \nchanged its name, banks in Wisconsin were financially stressed and many \nwere closing across the State. However, through the actions taken by \nthe principle officers and stockholders, the bank was able to avoid \ndisaster. Otto Ringling came to the First National Bank of Baraboo and \ndeposited a large sum of money to show his support for the bank. To \nshow their appreciation, the bank would often send the Ringlings money \nwhen they needed help.\n  The 1880s brought more prosperity to Sauk County and the bank grew \nwell beyond its neighboring competitors to over $400,000 in assets. By \nthis time the bank decided it was time for a name change. In doing so, \nwas now called The Bank of Baraboo, which would remain for about 58 \nyears. Baraboo was now the 25th largest city in the State. Industry and \nsmall businesses all over the county were helped by the bank to get \ntheir start.\n  This included the Circus Industry. The Bank of Baraboo was a strong \nsupporter of the Ringling and Gollmar Brother's Circus. When the \nRingling brothers needed money to expand their circus in the 1900s, \nthey turned to The Bank of Baraboo for help. Through the 1920s this \nbond grew to the point that a few of the Ringlings were appointed \ndirectors and became stock holders who were very loyal customers.\n  In 1938 a final national bank charter changed the name from The Bank \nof Baraboo to The Baraboo National Bank. As banking products expanded, \nthe bank was now able to provide more services to the community. They \neven had a minibank at the local Badger Army Ammunition Plan. The \nBaraboo National Bank continued to expand the building on the corner, \ntaking in space to the south and to the west.\n  In 1975, Merlin E. Zitzner became the eleventh president and CEO of \nThe Baraboo National Bank. Zitzner, a Viroqua native, graduated from UW \nWhitewater and a graduate degree from UW Madison. Under this leadership \nThe Baraboo Bancorporation Inc. was formed as the holding company of \nThe Baraboo National Bank and later the State Bank of Viroqua and Green \nLake State Bank.\n  The Baraboo National Bank continued to grow by adding the Downtown \nDrive-up Bank branch, West Baraboo branch, East Baraboo branch, \nSouthwest branch and opening the Lake Delton National Bank branch. \nLater would follow the acquisition of the Rock Springs and Bank of \nWonewoc branches. Most recently the Reedsburg National Bank and the \nPortage National Bank where built as well as the acquisition of the two \nlocations of the Northwoods National Bank in Rhinelander and Elcho.\n  Today with assets nearing the $800,000,000 mark and a market share in \nBaraboo averaging 66 percent, The Baraboo National Bank has a lot to be \nthankful for. Customer loyalty going back for several generations and \nlocal businesses enjoying growth are what the bank is really all \nabout.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7449-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF DANIEL BERNSTINE\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to one \nof Oregon's and indeed our Nation's finest higher education leaders, \nDr. Daniel O. Bernstine, president of Portland State University. \nPortland State University is our state's largest university, and is \nfoundational to Oregon's well-earned reputation for educational and \ntechnological innovation. Earlier this year, President Bernstine \nannounced he would leave PSU at the end of the academic year and become \nthe President and Chief Executive Officer of the Law School Admissions \nCouncil in Pennsylvania.\n  Pennsylvania's gain is truly Oregon's loss. As president of Portland \nState, Dan and his team have truly transformed Oregon's only urban \nuniversity. Under his leadership the enrollment has grown \nsubstantially; research funding has increased from $17 million to more \nthan $40 million; the University completed its first ever comprehensive \ncampaign; and the campus has added a new Urban Center, the University \nPlace hotel, the Native American Student and Community Center, the \nSimon Benson House, Epler Hall, the Broadway Housing complex, the Peter \nStott recreational field, the Northwest Center for Engineering, \nScience, and Technology, and the Portland Streetcar.\n  Dan has forged community partnerships that truly reflect the \nuniversity's motto: Let Knowledge Serve the City. These include many of \nthe nonprofit organizations in the Portland Metropolitan community, the \nurban and suburban school districts, and the area's community colleges.\n  I want to highlight a development at Portland State that is \nespecially important to me and to the work I have pursued in the \nSenate. Shortly after his arrival, Dan said that investment in science, \ntechnology, and engineering would be a priority. One area that has \nemerged as a national research center is in nanometrology. Attracting \nDr. Jun Jiao to Portland State set the initiative in motion and today \nPSU has one of the premier centers for Electron Microscopy and \nNanofabrication. This is evidence that President Bernstine understands \nthe importance of nanotechnology and is committed to having PSU make a \nmajor contribution in this area.\n  Under President Bernstine's leadership, Portland State University has \nreceived national recognition for its faculty, community and service-\nlearning programs and is listed in the Princeton Review book, Colleges \nwith a Conscience: 81 Great Schools with Outstanding Community \nInvolvement. For its work to revitalize its community, its work in \nurban development, and support for the local economy, Portland State \nUniversity is listed on the first President's Higher Education \nCommunity Service Honor Roll and was recognized by The New England \nBoard of Higher Education as one of 25 universities considered \n``Saviors of Our Cities.'' The Association of American Colleges and \nUniversities also recognized PSU in its report, ``College Learning for \nthe New Global Century,'' as a leader in the area of fostering civic, \nintercultural, and ethical learning. And for the past 5 years, Portland \nState University has ranked among the Nation's best colleges in five \ncategories that lead to student success, according to U.S. News & World \nReport in its America's Best Colleges 2007 edition.\n  For these reasons and more, I consider President Bernstine's decision \nto take on this new responsibility to be a loss to Portland State \nUniversity and to Oregon. I am pleased that he will remain active in \nthe higher education community and I wish him well in his new position \nin Pennsylvania. Mr. President, Daniel O. Bernstine is an Oregon \ntreasure and has made a positive difference in the lives of students \nand to our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7449-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7449-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7449-S7450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages\n\n[[Page S7450]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations \nand a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7450-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-2215.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Hawaii urging Congress to \n     create a replacement for the outdated Fast Track Trade \n     Authority system so United States trade agreements are \n     developed and implemented using a more democratic, inclusive \n     mechanism that enshrines the principles of federalism and \n     state sovereignty; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 63\n\n       Whereas, in general, democratic accountable governance in \n     the states, and specifically, the authority granted to the \n     legislative branch by the Constitution of the State of \n     Hawaii, is being undermined by international commercial and \n     trade rules enforced by the World Trade Organization and \n     established by the North American Free Trade Agreement, and \n     is further threatened by similar provisions in an array of \n     pending trade agreements; and\n       Whereas, today's trade agreements have effects that extend \n     significantly beyond the bounds of traditional trade matters \n     such as tariffs and quotas; and\n\n[[Page S7451]]\n\n       Whereas, the North American Free Trade Agreement and other \n     United States free trade agreements grant foreign firms new \n     rights and privileges regarding acquisition of land and \n     facilities and operating within a state that exceed those \n     granted to American businesses under state and federal laws; \n     and\n       Whereas, the North American Free Trade Agreement already \n     has generated ``regulatory takings'' cases against state and \n     local land use decisions, state environmental and public \n     health policies, adverse state court rulings, and state and \n     local contracts that would not have been possible in United \n     States courts; and\n       Whereas, when states are bound to comply with government \n     procurement provisions contained in trade agreements, common \n     economic development and environmental policies such as buy-\n     local laws, prevailing wage laws, policies to prevent \n     offshoring of state jobs, as well as recycled content laws \n     could be subject to challenge as violating the obligations in \n     the trade agreements; and\n       Whereas, recent trade agreements curtail state regulatory \n     authority by placing constraints on future policy options; \n     and\n       Whereas, the World Trade Organization General Agreement on \n     Trade in Services could undermine state efforts to expand \n     health care coverage and rein in health care costs and places \n     constraints on state and local land use planning and gambling \n     policy; and\n       Whereas, new General Agreement on Trade in Services \n     negotiations could impose additional constraints on state \n     regulation of energy, higher education, professional \n     licensing, and other issues; and\n       Whereas, despite the indisputable fact that international \n     trade agreements have a far-reaching impact on state and \n     local laws, federal government trade negotiators have failed \n     to respect states' rights to prior informed consent before \n     binding states to conform state law and authority to trade \n     agreement requirements and have refused even to send copies \n     of key correspondence to state legislatures; and\n       Whereas, the current encroachment on state regulatory \n     authority by international commercial and trade agreements \n     has occurred due in no small part to the fact that United \n     States trade policy is being formulated and implemented under \n     the Fast Track Trade Authority procedure; and\n       Whereas, Fast Track Trade Authority eliminates vital checks \n     and balances established in the United States Constitution by \n     broadly delegating Congress' exclusive Constitutional \n     authority to set the terms of trade to the Executive Branch \n     such that the Executive Branch is empowered to negotiate \n     broad-ranging trade agreements and to sign them before \n     Congress votes on the agreements; and\n       Whereas, the ability of the Executive Branch to sign trade \n     agreements prior to Congress' vote of approval means \n     Executive Branch negotiators are able to ignore congressional \n     negotiating objectives or states' demands, and neither \n     Congress nor the states have any means to enforce any \n     decision regarding what provisions must be contained in every \n     United States trade agreement and what provisions may not \n     be included in any United States trade agreement; and\n       Whereas, federal trade negotiators have ignored and \n     disrespected states' demands regarding whether states agree \n     to be bound to certain nontariff trade agreement provisions; \n     and\n       Whereas, Fast Track Trade Authority also circumvents normal \n     Congressional review and amendment committee procedures, \n     limits debate to twenty hours total, and forbids any floor \n     amendments to the implementing legislation that is presented \n     to Congress to conform hundreds of United States laws to \n     trade agreement obligations and to incorporate the actual \n     trade agreement itself into United States federal law, which \n     preempts state law; and\n       Whereas, Fast Track Trade Authority is not necessary for \n     negotiating trade agreements, as demonstrated by the \n     existence of scores of trade agreements, including major \n     pacts such as the agreements administered by the World Trade \n     Organization implemented in the past thirty years without use \n     of Fast Track Trade Authority; and\n       Whereas, Fast Track Trade Authority, which was established \n     in 1974 by President Richard Nixon when trade agreements were \n     limited to traditional matters such as tariffs and quotas, is \n     now woefully outdated and inappropriate given the diverse \n     range of nontrade issues now included in ``trade'' agreements \n     that broadly affect federal and state nontrade regulatory \n     authority; and\n       Whereas, the current grant of Fast Track Trade Authority \n     expires in July 2007: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     fourth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2007, That the United States Congress is respectfully \n     requested to create a replacement for the outdated Fast Track \n     Trade Authority system so that United States trade agreements \n     are developed and implemented using a more democratic, \n     inclusive mechanism that enshrines the principles of \n     federalism and state sovereignty; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Congress is requested to include in this \n     new process for developing and implementing trade agreements \n     an explicit mechanism for ensuring the prior informed consent \n     of state legislatures before states are bound to the \n     nontariff terms of any trade agreement that affect state \n     regulatory authority so as to ensure that the United States \n     Trade Representative respects the decisions made by states; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, Ambassador \n     Susan Schwab, United States Trade Representative, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7451-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LIEBERMAN, from the Committee on Homeland Security \n     and Governmental Affairs, without amendment:\n       S. 457.

A bill to designate the Department of Veterans Affairs \nOutpatient Clinic in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as the ``Ernest Childers \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic''; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and on the behalf \nof my colleague, Dr. Coburn, to reintroduce a bill to honor the memory \nof an American hero and proud son from our great State of Oklahoma. \nErnest Childers was the first Native American to receive the \nCongressional Medal of Honor. This is our Nation's highest military \naward and it was awarded to him by Congress ``for conspicuous gallantry \nand intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty in \naction.''\n  Ernest Childers was born in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, on February 1, \n1918 as the third of five children. His father died when he was young \nand he grew up mostly on a farm. His hunting skills in his youth \nprovided much of the food for his family and formed the basis of a \ngreat military career.\n  Ernest Childers enlisted in the Oklahoma National Guard in 1937 while \nattending the Chilocco Indian School in north-central Oklahoma. He then \nwent to Fort Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma, for basic training before being \ndeployed to Africa in World War II. On September 22, 1943, despite a \nbroken instep that forced him to crawl, Second Lieutenant Childers \nadvanced against enemy machine gun nests in Oliveto, Italy, killing two \nsnipers and capturing an enemy mortar observer in the process. His \nactions were instrumental in helping the Americans win the Battle of \nOliveto and won him the Congressional Medal of Honor. He continued his \ncareer in the Army earning several other military awards including the \nCombat Infantry Badge, Europe and Africa Campaign Medals, The Purple \nHeart, The Bronze Star, and the Oklahoma Distinguished Service Cross. \nHe retired from the Army in August of 1965 as a lieutenant colonel in \nOklahoma's 45th Infantry Division.\n  Ernest Childers passed away on March 17, 2005, and was Oklahoma's \nlast Congressional Medal of Honor winner still living in the State. He \nwas an honored guest of many Presidential inaugurations and as a Creek \nIndian, was named Oklahoma's Most Outstanding Indian by the Tulsa \nChapter of the Council of American Indians in 1966. He once said ``The \nAmerican Indian has only one country to defend, and when you're picked \non, the American Indian never turns his back.'' I am proud and believe \nit is only appropriate to introduce once again this year a bill to \nrename the Department of Veterans Affairs' Outpatient Clinic in Tulsa, \nOklahoma, the Ernest Childers Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient \nClinic to honor the enduring legacy of a true hero and fine soldier. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1585\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF ERNEST CHILDERS DEPARTMENT OF \n                   VETERANS AFFAIRS OUTPATIENT CLINIC.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Outpatient Clinic in Tulsa, Oklahoma, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``Ernest Childers Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Outpatient Clinic''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map, \n     document, record, or other paper of the United States to the \n     outpatient clinic referred to in subsection (a) shall be \n     considered to be a reference to the ``Ernest Childers \n     Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Salazar, \n        Mr. Whitehouse, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 1589. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nreduce the costs of prescription drugs for enrollees of Medicaid \nmanaged care organizations by extending the discounts offered under \nfee-for-service Medicaid to such organizations; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to with Senators Kerry, \nAkaka, Salazar and Whitehouse to introduce the Drug Rebate Equalization \nAct of 2007.\n  As you know, the Medicaid drug rebate ensures that State Medicaid \nprograms receive the best price for prescription drugs for their \nbeneficiaries. Unfortunately, health plans that serve over 10 million \nMedicaid beneficiaries cannot access the same discounts\n\n[[Page S7455]]\n\nthrough the Federal drug rebate program. Plans typically get no rebate \non generic drugs and about a third of the rebate on brand drugs as \nStates receive. Therefore, States are paying more for the acquisition \nof prescription drugs for these health plan enrollees than for \nbeneficiaries in fee-for-service Medicaid, raising costs for Federal \nand State governments.\n  Even with this price disadvantage, the total cost of prescription \ndrugs for health plans is less on a per member per month basis because \nof health plans' greater use of generics and case management. \nUnfortunately, many States are considering carving prescription drugs \nout from health plans for the sole purpose of obtaining the rebate, \nthereby undermining plans' ability to maintain a comprehensive care and \ndisease management program that includes prescription drugs. Not only \nwill this legislation save money, it will eliminate this incentive and \nensure that health plans can maintain a comprehensive care coordination \nsystem for their patients.\n  This policy change was passed by the Senate during last year's debate \nover the Deficit Reduction Act. This year's version of the bill \nimproves on last year's bill in several important ways. First, the bill \nensures that health plans can continue their good work by using their \nown integrated care coordination and disease management protocols. \nSecond, the bill will maintain the fee-for-service prohibition against \nhealth plans ``double dipping'' into the Medicaid drug rebate and the \n340b discount drug pricing program. Finally, it will ensure that plans \ncan use so-called positive formularies while simultaneously ensuring \nthat enrollees will have access to off-formulary drugs through the \nregulated prior authorization process. These changes significantly \nimprove the bill and will help improve its chances of passage.\n  This policy enjoys widespread support. Extending the Medicaid drug \nrebate to enrollees in health plans is supported by the National \nGovernors Association, the National Association of State Medicaid \nDirectors, the National Medicaid Commission, the National Association \nof Community Health Centers, the Partnership for Medicaid, the \nAssociation for Community Affiliated Plans, and the Medicaid Health \nPlans of America. I am entering into the record copies of letters \nprovided by these organizations over the last few years memorializing \ntheir support for this concept.\n  Last year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the \nBingaman amendment would have saved Federal taxpayers $1.7 billion over \n5 years. Likewise, the CMS Office of the Actuary estimated that \nextending the drug rebate to health plans would save Federal taxpayers \n$2.2 billion over 5 years. I think that we can say that this policy \nwill provide significant savings to Americans, whatever the number.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1589\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Drug Rebate Equalization Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Between 2000 and 2003, spending on drugs increased by \n     17 percent per year, faster than any other major type of \n     Medicaid service. In 1998, less than 8 percent of Medicaid \n     expenditures were for drugs--by 2003 drugs claimed over 13 \n     percent. After 2006 drugs for Medicare beneficiaries will be \n     paid for by Medicare. These recipients currently account for \n     about half of all Medicaid drug spending. State Medicaid \n     programs will still be responsible for the drug costs of \n     children and families and other non-Medicare eligibles.\n       Drugs are paid for by Medicaid through 3 separate \n     mechanisms. First, the state pays the pharmacists for the \n     ingredient costs of the drug. Previously, most states paid \n     pharmacists based on the average wholesale price (AWP) less \n     some percentage. AWP is the average list price that a \n     manufacturer suggests wholesalers charge pharmacies. Federal \n     reimbursements to states for state spending on certain \n     outpatient prescription drugs are subject to ceilings called \n     federal upper limits (FULs), also known as the maximum \n     allowable cost (MAC). The effect of the FUL is to provide a \n     financial incentive to pharmacies to substitute lower-cost \n     ``generic'' equivalents for brand-name drugs. The Deficit \n     Reduction Act (DRA) expanded the impact of FULs by applying \n     them to multiple source drugs for which the FDA has rated at \n     least 1 other drug (instead of the previous 2) to be \n     therapeutically and pharmaceutically equivalent. The DRA also \n     changed the FUL formula from a percentage of the AWP to a \n     percentage of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP), which is \n     the average price paid to a manufacturer by wholesalers. For \n     those drugs, the FUL would be equal to 250 percent of the \n     AMP. The result of the AWP-to-AMP change is to make Medicaid \n     pharmaceutical payments closer to actual cost. The DRA also \n     expanded the required reporting of AMP and best price data, \n     allowing states to have access to reported AMP data for the \n     first time, and requiring HHS to make AMP data available to \n     the public.\n       Second, the states pay the pharmacists a dispensing fee \n     which typically ranges from $3 to $5 per prescription. This \n     fee is expected to cover a wide range of services associated \n     with dispensing drugs to Medicaid patients. The need to \n     adequately reimburse pharmacists for these services was \n     recognized by Congress under the Medicare Modernization Act \n     of 2003, which included a provision requiring Medicare Part D \n     drug plans to reimburse pharmacists for ``medication therapy \n     management services'' administered to patients with multiple \n     chronic conditions.\n       Third, states receive a rebate directly from the \n     manufacturers based on their utilization. The brand name \n     rebate is the greater of a flat rebate amount of 15.1 percent \n     of average manufacturers price (AMP) or the difference \n     between AMP and the best price offered to any nongovernmental \n     buyer. Manufacturers\n\n[[Page S7456]]\n\n     have to pay an additional rebate if their drug prices have \n     risen faster than the rate of general inflation. The DRA also \n     made limited changes to the Medicaid drug rebate program. In \n     addition, some states have entered into supplemental rebate \n     agreements with manufacturers in return for putting their \n     drugs on a preferred drug list. CBO estimates that the \n     average rebate received by the states equaled 31.4 percent of \n     AMP with the average basic rebate of 19.6 percent and the \n     inflation adjustment rebate equal to 11.7 percent. States \n     also receive a rebate on generic drugs of 11 percent of AMP. \n     In return for the rebates, states must provide access to all \n     FDA-approved drugs, although they may and do have extensive \n     prior authorization programs, step therapy, limited \n     prescriptions per month and co-payments.\n       Medicaid managed care plans do not receive the statutory \n     rebate levels, and instead must negotiate rebates on their \n     own.\n\n\n                           Issues to Consider\n\n       Administration of the rebate program is inadequate. The \n     Government Accountability Office has found significant \n     shortcomings in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services' (CMS) administration of the Medicaid drug rebate \n     program, including lack of clear guidance to manufacturers \n     for determining AMP, poor reporting of certain group purchase \n     prices in setting ``best price'' levels, and limited audits \n     of manufacturer price setting methods. Moreover, the Health \n     and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General \n     (OIG) recently found that CMS's failure to add qualified new \n     drugs to the Federal upper limit list had resulted in state \n     Medicaid programs paying more than they otherwise would have \n     for these drugs. Changes to the rebate program in the DRA are \n     minimal and are not expected to have a major effect on it.\n       Reimbursement is not reflective of the true costs of drugs \n     and pharmacy services. The DRA-driven changes in \n     pharmaceutical acquisition prices, by moving to an AMP-based \n     system, may result in some system savings, though how much is \n     not clear. However, the dispensing fee is also considered by \n     many to be inadequate for reimbursing pharmacists for the \n     range of services they provide. These services may include \n     managing inventory, counseling patients on proper medication \n     use, and complying with federal and state regulations in \n     addition to storing, warehousing, and dispensing the drug. \n     Without an adequate dispensing fee, some pharmacies may elect \n     not to participate in Medicaid rather than assume financial \n     loss.\n       Exemption for managed care plans inefficient. Over 10 \n     million Medicaid beneficiaries receive their drugs through \n     Medicaid managed care plans which do not have access to the \n     Medicaid drug rebate. Under the drug rebate, States receive \n     between 18 and 20 percent discounts on brand name drug prices \n     and between 10 and 11 percent for generic drug prices. \n     According to a recent study, Medicaid-focused managed care \n     organizations (MCOs) typically only receive about a 6 \n     percent discount on brand name drugs and no discount on \n     generics. Because many MCOs (particularly smaller \n     Medicaid-focused MCOs) do not have the capacity to \n     negotiate deeper discounts with drug companies, Medicaid \n     is overpaying for prescription drugs for enrollees in \n     Medicaid health plans. The Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) recently estimated that this change would save $2 \n     billion over 5 years.\n\n\n                          Potential Solutions\n\n       Tighten administration of the rebate program. Inconsistent \n     and inaccurate calculations of AMP, best price, and other \n     components of the rebate formula have cost Medicaid millions \n     of dollars. By improving CMS oversight over the program and \n     increasing manufacturer accountability over proper \n     calculation of rebates, Medicaid would reap the full benefits \n     of the Medicaid drug rebate program.\n       Increase the basic level of rebate. CBO has estimated that \n     setting the basic rebate level at 23 percent would result in \n     savings of $3.2 billion over 5 years. Available information \n     supports setting the rebate at a higher level than it is at \n     today.\n       Payment for pharmacist services should be realigned to \n     reflect true costs, including medication therapy management \n     services. With the Congress having addressed the issue of \n     pharmaceutical acquisition prices, now is the appropriate \n     time to adjust reimbursement for pharmacists' services to \n     reflect their increased role in managing medication-based \n     therapies, counseling patients, and providing other critical \n     pharmacy services to Medicaid patients.\n       Encourage evidence-based formularies where appropriate. \n     Development of formularies should provide access to necessary \n     treatments, and encourage and support benefit management best \n     practices that are proven in widespread use today. \n     Effectiveness, not cost, should be the main objective when \n     developing formularies. The goal is for plans to provide \n     high-quality, cost-effective drug benefits by using effective \n     drug utilization management techniques. Although \n     effectiveness data do not exist for all classes of \n     medications, and are not appropriate for certain populations, \n     well-designed evidence-based formularies that take into \n     account comparative effectiveness data have the potential to \n     provide access to high quality, cost-effective medications.\n       Allow Medicaid managed care plans to have access to the \n     drug rebate for non-340B drugs. All Medicaid beneficiaries \n     should have their drug costs reduced to the maximum extent \n     possible, either by the Medicaid rebate or by the 340B \n     program. While recognizing that managed care plans should \n     have access to the Medicaid drug rebate, it is also important \n     to be mindful of the need to protect 340B-covered entities \n     from the risk of creating a ``duplicate discount'' due to the \n     overlap of the rebate and the 340B program.\n       Extend the 340B drug discount to Inpatient Pharmaceuticals. \n     The Safety Net Inpatient Drug Affordability Act (S. l840/H.R. \n     3547) would require that 340B hospitals and Critical Access \n     Hospitals rebate Medicaid a significant portion of their 340B \n     savings on inpatient drugs administered to Medicaid patients. \n     In addition, to the extent that any Critical Access Hospitals \n     operate outpatient pharmacies, they would be required to pass \n     through to Medicaid their 340B savings for Medicaid patients. \n     These savings to Medicaid also accrue to taxpayers by \n     reducing costs for federal, state and local governments. The \n     proposal allows health care providers to stretch limited \n     resources as they care for America's neediest populations. \n     The Public Hospital Pharmacy Coalition (PHPC) estimates that \n     the Safety Net Inpatient Drug Affordability Act (S. 1840/H.R. \n     3547) would provide significant savings to the Medicaid \n     program and lower costs for taxpayer-supported safety net \n     institutions that care for low-income and uninsured patients. \n     PHPC estimates that this legislation would reduce Medicaid \n     costs by over $100 million per year.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  American Public Human Services Association, National Association of \n                        State Medicaid Directors\n\n\n  policy statement: mco access to the medicaid pharmacy rebate program\n\n     Background\n       The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90) \n     established a Medicaid drug rebate program that requires \n     pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide a rebate to \n     participating state Medicaid agencies. In return, states must \n     cover all prescription drugs manufactured by a company that \n     participates in the rebate program. At the time of this \n     legislation, only a small percentage of Medicaid \n     beneficiaries were enrolled in capitated managed care plans \n     and were primarily served by plans that also had commercial \n     lines of business. These plans requested to be excluded from \n     the drug rebate program as it was assumed that they would be \n     able to secure a better rebate on their own. Though \n     regulations have not yet been promulgated, federal \n     interpretation to date has excluded Medicaid managed care \n     organizations from participating in the federal rebate \n     program.\n       Today, the situation is quite different. 58% of all \n     Medicaid beneficiaries are enrolled in some type of managed \n     care delivery system, many in capitated health plans. Some \n     managed care plans, especially Medicaid-dominated plans that \n     make up a growing percentage of the Medicaid marketplace, are \n     looking at the feasibility of gaining access to the Medicaid \n     pharmacy rebate. However, a number of commercial plans remain \n     content to negotiate their own pharmacy rates and are not \n     interested in pursuing the Medicaid rebate.\n     Policy Statement\n       The National Association of State Medicaid Directors is \n     supportive of Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs), in \n     their capacity as an agent of the state, being able to \n     participate fully in the federal Medicaid rebate program. To \n     do so, the MCO must adhere to all of the federal rebate rules \n     set forth in OBRA '90 and follow essentially the same \n     ingredient cost payment methodology used by the state. The \n     state will have the ability to make a downward adjustment in \n     the MCO's capitation rate based on the assumption that the \n     MCO will collect the full rebate instead of the state. \n     Finally, if a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) is under \n     contract with an MCO to administer the Medicaid pharmacy \n     benefit for them, then the same principal shall apply, but in \n     no way should both the MCO and the PBM be allowed to claim \n     the rebate.--Approved by NASMD June 24, 2002\n       We oppose the Senate provision that provides for mandatory \n     dispensing fee guidelines.

The National Association of Community \n     Health Centers (NACHC), the national trade organization \n     representing America's 1,100 federally qualified health \n     centers, has reviewed your proposed initiative to provide \n     Medicaid managed care organizations with access to the \n     Medicaid drug rebate found in Section 1927 of the Social \n     Security Act.\n       ACAP and NACHC share a very special relationship. Many of \n     ACAP's member plans are owned and governed by community \n     health center representatives. This unique relationship often \n     creates a mutual policy interest and this proposal is an \n     example of such an intersection.\n       Your proposal to allow Medicaid managed care organizations \n     access to the Medicaid drug rebate makes sense given the \n     migration of Medicaid beneficiaries from fee-for-service to \n     managed care since 1990. Increasingly, states have not been \n     able to take advantage of the drug rebate for those enrollees \n     in managed care, thus driving up federal and state Medicaid \n     costs. The savings estimated in the Lewin Group study are \n     significant and may help to mitigate the needs for other cuts \n     in the program. In addition, it demonstrates a proactive \n     effort to offer solutions to improving the Medicaid program. \n     We applaud this effort.\n       While we are deeply concerned that Congress may engage in \n     budget-driven, rather than policy-driven, efforts to restrain \n     or reduce Medicaid spending, we also recognize that--as \n     providers to a substantial portion of the Medicaid-enrolled \n     population--we have a responsibility to put forth viable, \n     realistic alternatives that can help slow the growth on \n     Medicaid spending without throwing people off the rolls, or \n     cutting benefits or payment rates, Your proposal offers just \n     such a common-sense solution, one that we would be pleased to \n     support in the event that the Congress acts to constrain \n     costs without undermining the fundamental goals of the \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                       Daniel R.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the Association of \n     Community Affiliated Plans (ACAP), our 32 member health \n     plans, and over four million Americans they serve, I am \n     writing to express our gratitude and support for your \n     legislation to extend the benefits of the Medicaid drug \n     rebate to the Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid \n     health plans.\n       Created by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of \n     1990, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires a drug \n     manufacturer to have a rebate agreement with the Secretary of \n     the Department of Health and Human Services for States to \n     receive federal funding for outpatient drugs dispensed to \n     Medicaid patients. At the time the law was enacted, managed \n     care organizations were excluded from access to the drug \n     rebate program. In 1990, only 2.8 million people were \n     enrolled in Medicaid managed care and so the savings lost by \n     the exemption were relatively small. Today, 18 million people \n     are enrolled in capitated managed care plans. Pharmacy costs \n     in Medicaid Fee-for-Service settings are 18 percent higher on \n     a per-member-per-month basis than in the managed care setting \n     even though plans are at a disadvantage with respect to the \n     federal rebate. With the federal rebate as an additional \n     tool, plans could save the Medicaid program even more.\n       Extending the Medicaid drug rebate to Medicaid health plans \n     has been championed by ACAP for several years as a common \n     sense approach to reforming the Medicaid program, while \n     ensuring that all Medicaid beneficiaries receive the care \n     they need. The proposal to extend the drug rebate has been \n     endorsed by the National Governors Association, the National \n     Association of State Medicaid Directors, the National \n     Medicaid Commission, the Medicaid Health Plans of America, \n     the Partnership for Medicaid, and the National Association of \n     Community Health Centers. The Congressional Budget Office and \n     the CMS Actuary have said that this policy will save between \n     $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion in Federal tax dollars over 5 \n     years.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership to help modernize the \n     Medicaid program in a commonsense manner by extending the \n     savings of the drug rebate to Medicaid health plans. Please \n     do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of any further \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Margaret A.

We \n     support this effort and urge Congress to enact this common \n     sense provision.\n       Medicaid Health Plans of America, formed in 1993 and \n     incorporated in 1995, is a trade association representing \n     health plans and other entities participating in Medicaid \n     managed care throughout the country. It's primary focus is to \n     provide research, advocacy, analysis, and organized forums \n     that support the development of effective policy solutions to \n     promote and enhance the delivery of quality healthcare. The \n     Association initially coalesced around the issue of national \n     health care reform, and as the policy debate changed from \n     national health care reform to national managed care reform, \n     the areas of focus shifted to the changes in Medicaid managed \n     care.\n       Your proposal to allow Medicaid managed care organizations \n     access to the Medicaid drug rebate makes sense given the \n     migration of Medicaid beneficiaries from fee-for-service to \n     managed care since 1990.

Additionally, reforms should be implemented to ensure \n     that manufacturers are appropriately reporting data. Such \n     improvements should include reforms to ensure: (1) clear \n     guidance from CMS on manufacturer price determination methods \n     and the definition of AMP; (2) manufacturer-reported prices \n     are easily auditable so that systematic oversight of the \n     price determination can be done by HHS; (3) manufacturer-\n     reported prices and rebates are provided to states monthly \n     rather than the current quarterly reporting; and (4) new \n     penalties are implemented to discourage manufacturers from \n     reporting inaccurate pricing information.\n     Estimated savings\n       $4.3 Billion over 5 years (CMS Office of the Actuary)\n\n\n Extension of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to Medicaid Managed Care\n\n     Current law\n       Section 1927 of the Social Security Act, effective January \n     1, 1991 sets forth the requirements of the Medicaid Drug \n     Rebate Program. In order for Federal Medicaid matching funds \n     to be available to States for covered outpatient drugs of a \n     manufacturer, the manufacturer must enter into and have in \n     effect a rebate agreement with the Federal government. \n     Without an agreement in place, States cannot generally \n     receive Federal funding for outpatient drugs dispensed to \n     Medicaid recipients. Rebate amounts received by states are \n     considered a reduction\n\n[[Page S7458]]\n\n     in the amount expended by States for medical assistance for \n     purposes of Federal matching funds under the Medicaid \n     program.\n       The basic rebate for brand name drugs is the greater of \n     15.1 percent of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) or AMP \n     minus Best Price (BP). Best Price is the lowest price at \n     which the manufacturer sells the covered outpatient drug to \n     any purchaser, with certain statutory exceptions, in the \n     United States in any pricing structure, in the same quarter \n     for which the AMP is computed.\n       The rebate for generic drugs is 11 percent of AMP.\n       Under current law Medicaid states cannot collect rebates \n     from managed care organizations in the Medicaid Drug Rebate \n     Program.\n     Proposal\n       The Commission recommends providing Medicaid managed care \n     health plans access to the existing pharmaceutical \n     manufacturer rebate program currently available to other \n     Medicaid health plans. States should have the option of \n     collecting these rebates directly or allowing plans to access \n     them in exchange for lower capitation payments.\n     Estimated savings\n       $2 Billion over 5 years (CMS Office of the Actuary)\n\n\nChange the Start Date of Penalty Period for Persons Transferring Assets \n                        for Medicaid Eligibility\n\n     Current law\n       States determine financial eligibility for Medicaid \n     coverage of nursing home care using a combination of state \n     and federal statutes and regulations. Personal income and \n     assets must be below specified levels before eligibility can \n     be established. Personal resources are sorted into two \n     categories: those considered countable (those that must be \n     spent down before eligibility criteria is met) and those \n     considered non-countable (those that applicants can keep and \n     still meet the eligibility criteria such as real estate that \n     is the beneficiary's primary residence). Some assets held in \n     trust, annuities, and promissory notes are also not counted. \n     If it is determined that the applicant has excess countable \n     assets, these must spent before they can become eligible. \n     Personal income is applied to the cost of care after a \n     personal needs allowance and a community spouse allowance is \n     deducted.\n       Federal law requires states to review the assets of \n     Medicaid applicants for a period of 36 months prior to \n     application or 60 months if a trust is involved. This period \n     is known as the ``look back period.'' Financial eligibility \n     screeners look for transfers from personal assets made during \n     the look back period that appear to have been made for the \n     purpose of obtaining Medicaid eligibility. Transfers made \n     before the look back period are not reviewed.\n       Applicants are prohibited from transferring resources \n     during the look back period for less than fair market value. \n     Some transfers of resources are allowed, such as transfers \n     between spouses. If a state eligibility screener finds a non-\n     allowed transfer, current law (OBRA 1993) requires the state \n     to impose a ``penalty period'' during which Medicaid will not \n     pay for long-term care. The length of the penalty period is \n     calculated by dividing the amount transferred by the monthly \n     private pay rate of nursing homes in the state. The penalty \n     period starts from the date of the transfer. Using the date \n     of the transfer as the start date provides an opportunity for \n     applicants to preserve assets because some or all of the \n     penalty period may occur while the applicant was not paying \n     privately for long-term care.\n       We oppose the Senate provision that provides for mandatory \n     dispensing fee guidelines. States welcome more research in \n     dispensing fees throughout the U.S. health care system. \n     Currently, there is very little information for states to use \n     when considering appropriate dispensing fees.

For example, Texas \n     estimates the provisions federal impact from its state would \n     be a cost of $50 million over 5-years and California alone \n     estimates $250 million cost to the federal government over \n     the 5-year budget window.\n     Tiered Co-pays for prescription drugs\n       NGA supports House provision with modification\n       The House provision that would allow states to use tiered \n     co-pays to encourage use of more affordable drugs should be \n     maintained in the final package; however, the provision that \n     limits this flexibility and otherwise links Medicaid program \n     administration to TRICARE-approved formularies should be \n     dropped.\n     Rebates\n       NGA supports some Senate provisions, one with modification\n       The Senate provision that would increase minimum rebates on \n     brand name drugs should be maintained in the final bill.\n       The Senate provision that extends rebates to managed care \n     organizations that care for Medicaid beneficiaries should be \n     maintained in the final bill.\n       Regarding the requirement in both the House and Senate bill \n     for states to collect rebates on physician administered \n     drugs, the provision in the House bill that provides for a \n     hardship waiver for those states that require additional time \n     to implement the reporting system required to collect these \n     rebates should be maintained in the final bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BYRD (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1590. A bill to provide for the reintatement of a license for a \ncertain Federal Energy Regulatory Commission project; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my colleague from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, and I have joined together today to introduce legislation \nthat would allow for the construction of a hydroelectric facility near \nthe the City of Grafton, located in north central West Virginia. A \ncompanion measure is being introduced in the U.S.I House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Alan Mollohan. The proposed hydro \nfacility, to be constructed on an existing dam, would supply power to \nGrafton and surrounding area while also providing a significant \neconomic benefit to the city.\n  Our legislation, which was passed by the Senate late last year but \ndid not clear the House of Representatives before the end of the \nsession, would reinstate a license from the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, FERC, for a new hydroelectric facility on the Tygart Valley \nRiver. The City of Grafton has been considering the hydroelectric \nfacility for many years, and first received a license for the project \nin 1989. However, that license lapsed in 1999 without the city making \nprogress on the effort. The Byrd-Rockefeller-Mollohan measure would \nreinstate the license and allow Grafton to move ahead with the 20-\nmegawatt hydroelectric facility.\n  The City of Grafton is working with a private contractor to develop \nthe hydro project. With a new FERC license, the contractor believes \nthat the project could be in operation as early as 2008. It is expected \nthat the new hydroelectric facility would generate about $300,000 in \nannual revenues for Grafton, while creating 200 construction jobs in \nthe process.\n  In 1938, the Tygart dam became the first flood control project to be \ncompleted in the Pittsburgh District of the Army Corps of Engineers \nunder the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1935. It remains one of the most \nexpensive and extensive construction projects in the history of West \nVirginia. I recognize that the hydroelectric project has been delayed \nnumerous times, but the Congressional Budget Office found that \nimplementing the project will pose zero negative impact to the Federal \nbudget. In fact, it will generate roughly $200,000 in annual licensing \nfees for the U.S. Treasury. Approval of our legislation will yield a \nreturn on this previous significant investment by the American taxpayer \nby leveraging new value out of old infrastructure.\n  Clean, hydroelectric power generation from an expensive dam \npreviously used only for flood control, at no cost to the Federal \nGovernment, is the type of cost-effective, progressive action that we \nshould facilitate and applaud at every chance. It is the right thing to \ndo for the communities and public utilities in the rural Appalachian \ncounties where the existing dam and lake are located. It is the right \nthing to do for the West Virginians all along the Tygart and \nMonongahela Rivers. And it is the right thing to do for the taxpaying \ncitizens of this Nation. I respectfully request that my colleagues \nsupport our\n\n[[Page S7459]]\n\nlegislation, the bill that makes these positive results possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/11/senate-section/article/S7459-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 230--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF JULY 2007, AS \n                  ``NATIONAL TEEN SAFE DRIVER MONTH''\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Energy Diplomacy and \n     Security Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 702. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Major energy producer.--The term ``major energy \n     producer'' means a country that--\n       (A) had crude oil, oil sands, or natural gas to liquids \n     production of 1,000,000 barrels per day or greater average in \n     the previous year;\n       (B) has crude oil, shale oil, or oil sands reserves of \n     6,000,000,000 barrels or greater, as recognized by the \n     Department of Energy;\n       (C) had natural gas production of 30,000,000,000 cubic \n     meters or greater in the previous year;\n       (D) has natural gas reserves of 1,250,000,000,000 cubic \n     meters or greater, as recognized by the Department of Energy; \n     or\n       (E) is a direct supplier of natural gas or liquefied \n     natural gas to the United States.\n       (2) Major energy consumer.--The term ``major energy \n     consumer'' means a country that--\n       (A) had an oil consumption average of 1,000,000 barrels per \n     day or greater in the previous year;\n       (B) had an oil consumption growth rate of 8 percent or \n     greater in the previous year;\n       (C) had a natural gas consumption of 30,000,000,000 cubic \n     meters or greater in the previous year; or\n       (D) had a natural gas consumption growth rate of 15 percent \n     or greater in the previous year.\n\n     SEC. 703. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ENERGY DIPLOMACY AND SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is imperative to the national security and \n     prosperity of the United States to have reliable, affordable, \n     clean, sufficient, and sustainable sources of energy.\n       (2) United States dependence on oil imports causes \n     tremendous costs to the United States national security, \n     economy, foreign policy, military, and environmental \n     sustainability.\n       (3) Energy security is a priority for the governments of \n     many foreign countries and increasingly plays a central role \n     in the relations of the United States Government with foreign \n     governments. Global reserves of oil and natural gas are \n     concentrated in a small number of countries. Access to these \n     oil and natural gas supplies depends on the political will of \n     these producing states. Competition\n\n[[Page S7491]]\n\n     between governments for access to oil and natural gas \n     reserves can lead to economic, political, and armed conflict. \n     Oil exporting states have received dramatically increased \n     revenues due to high global prices, enhancing the ability of \n     some of these states to act in a manner threatening to global \n     stability.\n       (4) Efforts to combat poverty and protect the environment \n     are hindered by the continued predominance of oil and natural \n     gas in meeting global energy needs. Development of renewable \n     energy through sustainable practices will help lead to a \n     reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and enhance \n     international development.\n       (5) Cooperation on energy issues between the United States \n     Government and the governments of foreign countries is \n     critical for securing the strategic and economic interests of \n     the United States and of partner governments. In the current \n     global energy situation, the energy policies and activities \n     of the governments of foreign countries can have dramatic \n     impacts on United States energy security.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States national security requires that the \n     United States Government have an energy policy that pursues \n     the strategic goal of achieving energy security through \n     access to clean, affordable, sufficient, reliable, and \n     sustainable sources of energy;\n       (2) achieving energy security is a priority for United \n     States foreign policy and requires continued and enhanced \n     engagement with foreign governments and entities in a variety \n     of areas, including activities relating to the promotion of \n     alternative and renewable fuels, trade and investment in oil, \n     coal, and natural gas, energy efficiency, climate and \n     environmental protection, data transparency, advanced \n     scientific research, public-private partnerships, and energy \n     activities in international development;\n       (3) the President should ensure that the international \n     energy activities of the United States Government are given \n     clear focus to support the national security needs of the \n     United States, and to this end, there should be established a \n     mechanism to coordinate the implementation of United States \n     international energy policy among the Federal agencies \n     engaged in relevant agreements and activities; and\n       (4) the Secretary of State should ensure that energy \n     security is integrated into the core mission of the \n     Department of State, and to this end, there should be \n     established within the Office of the Secretary of State a \n     Coordinator for International Energy Affairs with \n     responsibility for--\n       (A) developing United States international energy policy in \n     coordination with the Department of Energy and other relevant \n     Federal agencies;\n       (B) working with appropriate United States Government \n     officials to develop and update analyses of the national \n     security implications of global energy developments;\n       (C) incorporating energy security priorities into the \n     activities of the Department;\n       (D) coordinating activities with relevant Federal agencies; \n     and\n       (E) coordinating energy security and other relevant \n     functions currently undertaken by offices within the Bureau \n     of Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs, the Bureau \n     of Democracy and Global Affairs, and other offices within the \n     Department of State.\n\n     SEC. 704. STRATEGIC ENERGY PARTNERSHIPS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) United States Government partnership with foreign \n     governments and entities, including partnership with the \n     private sector, for securing reliable and sustainable energy \n     is imperative to ensuring United States security and economic \n     interests, promoting international peace and security, \n     expanding international development, supporting democratic \n     reform, fostering economic growth, and safeguarding the \n     environment.\n       (2) Democracy and freedom should be promoted globally by \n     partnership with foreign governments, including in particular \n     governments of emerging democracies such as those of Ukraine \n     and Georgia, in their efforts to reduce their dependency on \n     oil and natural gas imports.\n       (3) The United States Government and the governments of \n     foreign countries have common needs for adequate, reliable, \n     affordable, clean, and sustainable energy in order to ensure \n     national security, economic growth, and high standards of \n     living in their countries. Cooperation by the United States \n     Government with foreign governments on meeting energy \n     security needs is mutually beneficial. United States \n     Government partnership with foreign governments should \n     include cooperation with major energy consuming countries, \n     major energy producing countries, and other governments \n     seeking to advance global energy security through reliable \n     and sustainable means.\n       (4) The United States Government participates in hundreds \n     of bilateral and multilateral energy agreements and \n     activities with foreign governments and entities. These \n     agreements and activities should reflect the strategic need \n     for energy security.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United \n     States--\n       (1) to advance global energy security through cooperation \n     with foreign governments and entities;\n       (2) to promote reliable, diverse, and sustainable sources \n     of all types of energy;\n       (3) to increase global availability of renewable and clean \n     sources of energy;\n       (4) to decrease global dependence on oil and natural gas \n     energy sources; and\n       (5) to engage in energy cooperation to strengthen strategic \n     partnerships that advance peace, security, and democratic \n     prosperity.\n       (c) Authority.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Energy, should immediately seek to \n     establish and expand strategic energy partnerships with the \n     governments of major energy producers and major energy \n     consumers, and with governments of other countries (but \n     excluding any countries that are ineligible to receive United \n     States economic or military assistance).\n       (d) Purposes.--The purposes of the strategic energy \n     partnerships established pursuant to subsection (c) are--\n       (1) to strengthen global relationships to promote \n     international peace and security through fostering \n     cooperation in the energy sector on a mutually beneficial \n     basis in accordance with respective national energy policies;\n       (2) to promote the policy set forth in subsection (b), \n     including activities to advance--\n       (A) the mutual understanding of each country's energy \n     needs, priorities, and policies, including interparliamentary \n     understanding;\n       (B) measures to respond to acute energy supply disruptions, \n     particularly in regard to petroleum and natural gas \n     resources;\n       (C) long-term reliability and sustainability in energy \n     supply;\n       (D) the safeguarding and safe handling of nuclear fuel;\n       (E) human and environmental protection;\n       (F) renewable energy production;\n       (G) access to reliable and affordable energy for \n     underdeveloped areas, in particular energy access for the \n     poor;\n       (H) appropriate commercial cooperation;\n       (I) information reliability and transparency; and\n       (J) research and training collaboration;\n       (3) to advance the national security priority of developing \n     sustainable and clean energy sources, including through \n     research and development related to, and deployment of--\n       (A) renewable electrical energy sources, including biomass, \n     wind, and solar;\n       (B) renewable transportation fuels, including biofuels;\n       (C) clean coal technologies;\n       (D) carbon sequestration, including in conjunction with \n     power generation, agriculture, and forestry; and\n       (E) energy and fuel efficiency, including hybrids and plug-\n     in hybrids, flexible fuel, advanced composites, hydrogen, and \n     other transportation technologies; and\n       (4) to provide strategic focus for current and future \n     United States Government activities in energy cooperation to \n     meet the global need for energy security.\n       (e) Determination of Agendas.--In general, the specific \n     agenda with respect to a particular strategic energy \n     partnership, and the Federal agencies designated to implement \n     related activities, shall be determined by the Secretary of \n     State and the Secretary of Energy.\n       (f) Use of Current Agreements To Establish Partnerships.--\n     Some or all of the purposes of the strategic energy \n     partnerships established under subsection (c) may be pursued \n     through existing bilateral or multilateral agreements and \n     activities. Such agreements and activities shall be subject \n     to the reporting requirements in subsection (g).\n       (g) Reports Required.--\n       (1) Initial progress report.--Not later than 180 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State \n     shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a \n     report on progress made in developing the strategic energy \n     partnerships authorized under this section.\n       (2) Annual progress reports.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than one year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for 20 \n     years, the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees an annual report on agreements \n     entered into and activities undertaken pursuant to this \n     section, including international environment activities.\n       (B) Content.--Each report submitted under this paragraph \n     shall include details on--\n       (i) agreements and activities pursued by the United States \n     Government with foreign governments and entities, the \n     implementation plans for such agreements and progress \n     measurement benchmarks, United States Government resources \n     used in pursuit of such agreements and activities, and \n     legislative changes recommended for improved partnership; and\n       (ii) polices and actions in the energy sector of \n     partnership countries pertinent to United States economic, \n     security, and environmental interests.\n\n     SEC. 705. INTERNATIONAL ENERGY CRISIS RESPONSE MECHANISMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Cooperation between the United States Government and \n     governments of other countries during energy crises promotes \n     the national security of the United States.\n       (2) The participation of the United States in the \n     International Energy Program established under the Agreement \n     on an International Energy Program, done at Paris November \n     18, 1974 (27 UST 1685), including in\n\n[[Page S7492]]\n\n     the coordination of national strategic petroleum reserves, is \n     a national security asset that--\n       (A) protects the consumers and the economy of the United \n     States in the event of a major disruption in petroleum \n     supply;\n       (B) maximizes the effectiveness of the United States \n     strategic petroleum reserve through cooperation in accessing \n     global reserves of various petroleum products;\n       (C) provides market reassurance in countries that are \n     members of the International Energy Program; and\n       (D) strengthens United States Government relationships with \n     members of the International Energy Program.\n       (3) The International Energy Agency projects that the \n     largest growth in demand for petroleum products, other than \n     demand from the United States, will come from China and \n     India, which are not members of the International Energy \n     Program. The Governments of China and India vigorously pursue \n     access to global oil reserves and are attempting to develop \n     national petroleum reserves. Participation of the Governments \n     of China and India in an international petroleum reserve \n     mechanism would promote global energy security, but such \n     participation should be conditional on the Governments of \n     China and India abiding by customary petroleum reserve \n     management practices.\n       (4) In the Western Hemisphere, only the United States and \n     Canada are members of the International Energy Program. The \n     vulnerability of most Western Hemisphere countries to supply \n     disruptions from political, natural, or terrorism causes may \n     introduce instability in the hemisphere and can be a source \n     of conflict, despite the existence of major oil reserves in \n     the hemisphere.\n       (5) Countries that are not members of the International \n     Energy Program and are unable to maintain their own national \n     strategic reserves are vulnerable to petroleum supply \n     disruption. Disruption in petroleum supply and spikes in \n     petroleum costs could devastate the economies of developing \n     countries and could cause internal or interstate conflict.\n       (6) The involvement of the United States Government in the \n     extension of international mechanisms to coordinate strategic \n     petroleum reserves and the extension of other emergency \n     preparedness measures should strengthen the current \n     International Energy Program.\n       (b) Energy Crisis Response Mechanisms With India and \n     China.--\n       (1) Authority.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Energy, should immediately seek to \n     establish a petroleum crisis response mechanism or mechanisms \n     with the Governments of China and India.\n       (2) Scope.--The mechanism or mechanisms established under \n     paragraph (1) should include--\n       (A) technical assistance in the development and management \n     of national strategic petroleum reserves;\n       (B) agreements for coordinating drawdowns of strategic \n     petroleum reserves with the United States, conditional upon \n     reserve holdings and management conditions established by the \n     Secretary of Energy;\n       (C) emergency demand restraint measures;\n       (D) fuel switching preparedness and alternative fuel \n     production capacity; and\n       (E) ongoing demand intensity reduction programs.\n       (3) Use of existing agreements to establish mechanism.--The \n     Secretary may, after consultation with Congress and in \n     accordance with existing international agreements, including \n     the International Energy Program, include China and India in \n     a petroleum crisis response mechanism through existing or new \n     agreements.\n       (c) Energy Crisis Response Mechanism for the Western \n     Hemisphere.--\n       (1) Authority.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Energy, should immediately seek to \n     establish a Western Hemisphere energy crisis response \n     mechanism.\n       (2) Scope.--The mechanism established under paragraph (1) \n     should include--\n       (A) an information sharing and coordinating mechanism in \n     case of energy supply emergencies;\n       (B) technical assistance in the development and management \n     of national strategic petroleum reserves within countries of \n     the Western Hemisphere;\n       (C) technical assistance in developing national programs to \n     meet the requirements of membership in a future international \n     energy application procedure as described in subsection (d);\n       (D) emergency demand restraint measures;\n       (E) energy switching preparedness and alternative energy \n     production capacity; and\n       (F) ongoing demand intensity reduction programs.\n       (3) Membership.--The Secretary should seek to include in \n     the Western Hemisphere energy crisis response mechanism \n     membership for each major energy producer and major energy \n     consumer in the Western Hemisphere and other members of the \n     Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum authorized under section \n     706.\n       (d) International Energy Program Application Procedure.--\n       (1) Authority.--The President should place on the agenda \n     for discussion at the Governing Board of the International \n     Energy Agency, as soon as practicable, the merits of \n     establishing an international energy program application \n     procedure.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of such procedure is to allow \n     countries that are not members of the International Energy \n     Program to apply to the Governing Board of the International \n     Energy Agency for allocation of petroleum reserve stocks in \n     times of emergency on a grant or loan basis. Such countries \n     should also receive technical assistance for, and be subject \n     to, conditions requiring development and management of \n     national programs for energy emergency preparedness, \n     including demand restraint, fuel switching preparedness, and \n     development of alternative fuels production capacity.\n       (e) Reports Required.--\n       (1) Petroleum reserves.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy \n     shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a \n     report that evaluates the options for adapting the United \n     States national strategic petroleum reserve and the \n     international petroleum reserve coordinating mechanism in \n     order to carry out this section.\n       (2) Crisis response mechanisms.--Not later than 180 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     State, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, shall \n     submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     on the status of the establishment of the international \n     petroleum crisis response mechanisms described in subsections \n     (b) and (c). The report shall include recommendations of the \n     Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy for any \n     legislation necessary to establish or carry out such \n     mechanisms.\n       (3) Emergency application procedure.--Not later than 60 \n     days after a discussion by the Governing Board of the \n     International Energy Agency of the application procedure \n     described under subsection (d), the President should submit \n     to Congress a report that describes--\n       (A) the actions the United States Government has taken \n     pursuant to such subsection; and\n       (B) a summary of the debate on the matter before the \n     Governing Board of the International Energy Agency, including \n     any decision that has been reached by the Governing Board \n     with respect to the matter.\n\n     SEC. 706. HEMISPHERE ENERGY COOPERATION FORUM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The engagement of the United States Government with \n     governments of countries in the Western Hemisphere is a \n     strategic priority for reducing the potential for tension \n     over energy resources, maintaining and expanding reliable \n     energy supplies, expanding use of renewable energy, and \n     reducing the detrimental effects of energy import dependence \n     within the hemisphere. Current energy dialogues should be \n     expanded and refocused as needed to meet this challenge.\n       (2) Countries of the Western Hemisphere can most \n     effectively meet their common needs for energy security and \n     sustainability through partnership and cooperation. \n     Cooperation between governments on energy issues will enhance \n     bilateral relationships among countries of the hemisphere. \n     The Western Hemisphere is rich in natural resources, \n     including biomass, oil, natural gas, coal, and has \n     significant opportunity for production of renewable hydro, \n     solar, wind, and other energies. Countries of the Western \n     Hemisphere can provide convenient and reliable markets for \n     trade in energy goods and services.\n       (3) Development of sustainable energy alternatives in the \n     countries of the Western Hemisphere can improve energy \n     security, balance of trade, and environmental quality and \n     provide markets for energy technology and agricultural \n     products. Brazil and the United States have led the world in \n     the production of ethanol, and deeper cooperation on biofuels \n     with other countries of the hemisphere would extend economic \n     and security benefits.\n       (4) Private sector partnership and investment in all \n     sources of energy is critical to providing energy security in \n     the Western Hemisphere.\n       (b) Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum.--\n       (1) Establishment.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Energy, should immediately seek to \n     establish a regional-based ministerial forum to be known as \n     the Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum.\n       (2) Purposes.--The Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum \n     should seek--\n       (A) to strengthen relationships between the United States \n     and other countries of the Western Hemisphere through \n     cooperation on energy issues;\n       (B) to enhance cooperation between major energy producers \n     and major energy consumers in the Western Hemisphere, \n     particularly among the governments of Brazil, Canada, Mexico, \n     the United States, and Venezuela;\n       (C) to ensure that energy contributes to the economic, \n     social, and environmental enhancement of the countries of the \n     Western Hemisphere;\n       (D) to provide an opportunity for open dialogue and joint \n     commitments between member governments and with private \n     industry; and\n       (E) to provide participating countries the flexibility \n     necessary to cooperatively address broad challenges posed to \n     the energy supply of the Western Hemisphere that are\n\n[[Page S7493]]\n\n     practical in policy terms and politically acceptable.\n       (3) Activities.--The Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum \n     should implement the following activities:\n       (A) An Energy Crisis Initiative that will establish \n     measures to respond to temporary energy supply disruptions, \n     including through--\n       (i) strengthening sea-lane and infrastructure security;\n       (ii) implementing a real-time emergency information sharing \n     system;\n       (iii) encouraging members to have emergency mechanisms and \n     contingency plans in place;
