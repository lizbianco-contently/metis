Mr. President, following the remarks of myself and Senator \nMcConnell, we are going to move to continue on the consideration of \nH.R. 2095, the rail safety-Amtrak legislation. Cloture was invoked on \nthe motion to concur in the House amendment yesterday, so we will \ncontinue to debate this today during the 30 hours. There will be no \nrollcall votes today in view of the Rosh Hashanah holiday, but we will \nhave votes tomorrow evening after sundown. We are still working on an \nagreement to consider the United States-India nuclear agreement. I am \nquite certain we will finalize that so there can be a vote on that \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, on the financial crisis facing our country, the blame \ngame needs to end and we need to move forward on doing what is right \nfor our country. Yesterday's drop on Wall Street amounted to a loss of \nmore than a trillion dollars--about $1.2 trillion, to be exact. Most of \nthat money doesn't come from Wall Street titans but from the pensions \nof people who have retired and who have worked for city government, \ncounty government, State government, or in some business they worked at \nfor many years, or people who have frugally worked during their \nlifetime to save a few dollars and put it into a retirement account. \nThese people are rightfully worried that the security of their golden \nyears will be compromised by what has happened with the \nirresponsibility in the financial sector. So the most important job we \nhave as Members of Congress is to safeguard the physical and fiscal \nsecurity of the American people. Despite yesterday's setback in the \nHouse of Representatives, this continues to be our No. 1 goal.\n   Last night, I spoke with the President's Chief of Staff, Josh \nBolten. I talked to him again this morning and spent quite a long time \nwith him on the telephone. I spoke to Senator Obama this morning, who \nhad just completed a conversation with President Bush. I mention that \nnot to be a name-dropper but to indicate that we are working together \nto try to resolve this important issue.\n  Senators Bennett, Corker, and Gregg on the Republican side, as well \nas Senators Dodd, Baucus, Conrad, Durbin, Schumer, and Jack Reed on\n\n[[Page S10116]]\n\nthe Democratic side, have done an exceptionally good bipartisan job to \nmove the rescue legislation forward here in the Senate. Their work \ncontinues as we speak. I will also continue to work closely with the \nminority leader, Senator McConnell, as well as our counterparts in the \nHouse of Representatives. We are all committed to keeping the progress \non this rescue package moving forward. So in the coming days, I will \ncontinue doing everything possible to see that this dire and avoidable \nfinancial crisis moves to the best possible outcome and toward a future \nof stability and growth for our country. I am going to have a meeting \nwithin an hour with the Senators I have just spoken about on the \nDemocratic side. They have extremely good contacts on the Republican \nside.\n  I wish to say, Mr. President, that I thought the statement made \nyesterday by Judd Gregg was an extremely good statement. Judd Gregg is \nthe past chairman of the Budget Committee and someone both sides \nrespect for his knowledge of finances. So I commend and applaud Senator \nGregg for his statement.\n  I am hopeful and I am confident that all sides, House and Senate and \nWhite House, will work together to achieve a goal that will be good for \nthe American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/30/senate-section/article/S10116-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Those also are the words of \nSenator McCain, with whom I spoke yesterday, who is in exactly the same \nplace as all of us are on a bipartisan basis.\n  So we will get the job done, we will get it done this week, and I \nthink, hopefully, that will reassure the American people that Congress \ncan rise to the occasion--act like grownups, if you will--and get the \njob done for all of our people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a lot of people think they know Senator Pete \nDomenici. They know him as a man who has been a leader in the Senate \nfor decades on energy issues, and he was the chairman of that \ncommittee, and on budget issues, and he has been the chairman of that \ncommittee. He is a man who has been a leader on the Appropriations \nCommittee. I have known Senator Domenici in that regard, as have the \nAmerican people, but what I think is so interesting about Pete Domenici \nis a side that a lot of people don't know about him. Here is a man who \ncan talk about Wall Street, he can talk about financial markets, he can \ntalk about the budgetary problems facing this country, but in a \npersonal, private conversation, he can talk about baseball.\n  Here is a man who was a star athlete. He was a great baseball player. \nAs a young man, he played American Legion Baseball. I played American \nLegion Baseball, but Pete's team was good. Mine wasn't so good. Pete \nled his team to the regional championship.\n  American Legion Baseball used to be the baseball for young men.\n  They did not have all the State tournaments they had in high schools, \nso in the summer, the best athletes would get together, the best \nbaseball players would get together and play American Legion ball, and \nthe winter regional championship was significant.\n  Senator Domenici went on to letter all 4 years, of course, in high \nschool. He was a standout pitcher for the University of New Mexico, and \nhe was All Conference. His final year he had a record of 14 and 3. That \nis quite a record. In those days, when Senator Domenici was in high \nschool and college, they would play a lot of games, as they do now. A \nrecord of 14 and 3 is a very significant record.\n  But that was not the end of his career. He went on to play \nprofessional baseball. After college he played for the hometown crowd \nas a left-handed pitcher for the Albuquerque Dukes. I know he must have \nhad a great fastball and a great curveball to accomplish what he did in \nbaseball. But in the Senate, Pete Domenici does not throw curveballs, \nit is the high hard one all the time. He is a person who tells people \nhow he feels.\n  With my long-time relationship with Senator Domenici, I only had one \nproblem my entire career with Pete Domenici. That was a time when--I, \nfrankly, do not remember whether I was the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee or the chairman of the subcommittee because we went back \nand forth often. That was the Energy and Water Subcommittee of \nAppropriations.\n  As a relatively young Senator, I had a position of power, and I \nthought what I would do is go and talk to members of that conference \nand get the votes. I did it very quietly. I did not say a word to \nSenator Domenici. I surprised everybody. I called for a vote \nunexpectedly and I won. Senator Domenici did not say a word to me there \npublicly. Well, when that was over, we had a little heart-to-heart \ntalk. He said: We have to work together. If we are going to work \ntogether on this subcommittee, I want to tell you something about how \nwe do things in the Senate. We do not surprise each other. If you had a \nproblem with that issue, talk to me. If you have the votes, you do not \nneed to try to embarrass me publicly, you go ahead and do what you need \nto do.\n  I learned a great lesson there. I learned a lesson that can only come \nby someone teaching you, such as when I practiced law. It is not \npleasant to talk about, but you learn from your mistakes in the \npractice of law. When you make a mistake, you never do that again. As a \nresult of the teaching moment I had with Senator Domenici, I never, \never did that again. So I appreciate, if for no other reason than that, \nthat one experience with Pete Domenici. It made me a better Senator and \na better person.\n  It was very clear that when Senator Domenici realized he would not be \nplaying for the New York Yankees, even though he was a good athlete, he \ndecided he would become a teacher. Then he went to law school, and \nafter graduating, Pete Domenici entered politics. First, he was elected \nto the city commission in Albuquerque. Then he climbed up that ladder \nof local politics and became mayor of Albuquerque and was elected in \n1972 as a young man to the Senate.\n  My relationship with Senator Domenici began, my first experience \ncoming to the Senate, in 1986. I was very fortunate that year. I was a \nbrand-new Senator. I got on the Appropriations Committee. As we now \nknow, Senators wait a long time to get on that committee. I was so \nfortunate that Barbara Mikulski and Harry Reid, two brand-new Senators, \nwere placed on that committee. From that day, I got to know Pete \nDomenici.\n  My experience on the Appropriations Committee goes back to the day \nthat John Stennis, the Senator from Mississippi, was chairman of that \ncommittee. By the time I got to the Senate, he was in very frail \nhealth. He had been shot in a robbery, he had lost a leg, he had \ncancer. So he was very weak.\n  His chief of staff was a man by the name of John Sullivan. He had \nbeen chief of staff of the Judiciary Committee, Armed Services \nCommittee, now the Appropriations Committee. And he called me. After I \nmet Senator Stennis, he called me in his office and said to me: Senator \nReid, you got on the best committee in the entire Senate. He said: You \ncan do a lot of good things for your State, but do not be greedy.\n  That was a real good lesson for me. I have always tried to follow \nthat. Senator Domenici has been someone I have worked with on that \ncommittee. I did not immediately get on the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee. It takes a while to get on that. That is one of the most\n\n[[Page S10117]]\n\nsought-after committees you can get on in the Appropriations process.\n  I worked with Pete Domenici since the first day I have been in the \nSenate but on a very close basis from the time I got on that \nsubcommittee. So we worked together on that Energy and Water \nSubcommittee for 22 years. Some of these years Pete was the chairman, \nas I indicated, or I was the ranking member, and other years it was the \nreverse.\n  But, frankly, for the two of us, it did not matter which party \ncontrolled the Chamber. We continued to work for the people of Nevada \nand New Mexico and the country on a bipartisan basis. We have traveled \nthe country. We have gone to some of the labs that are so necessary for \nour country's science--Livermore--and the great facilities we have in \nNew Mexico--Sandia. I can remember going there so clearly. It was a \nwonderful experience. The two labs in New Mexico are among the best. We \nalso traveled to a facility we fund in Missouri.\n  Anyway, we have done a lot of things together over the years. In \naddition to that, because of the relationship of the spouses, his \nwonderful wife Nancy and my wife Landra, have become very good friends. \nThey are very small people physically but big people in other ways. \nThey are both generous, thoughtful, kind wives, mothers and good \npeople. They have done a great job of raising our children, and they \nhave many conversations about the good and the bad, as all families \nhave in raising their children.\n  Pete Domenici is now the longest serving U.S. Senator in the history \nof his State, New Mexico. But longevity does not tell the story of \nDomenici's legacy. He has established himself as one of America's \npremier leaders on energy policy, national security, scientific \nresearch. While I talk about national security, one of the things I am \nvery satisfied--I do not want to use the word ``proud''--satisfied that \nPete Domenici and I worked together on was the safety and security of \nour nuclear arsenal.\n  Now, you cannot put these nuclear weapons we have in some storage \nfacility and leave them alone. There must be a way of making sure they \nare safe and reliable. We worked for years to accomplish that goal, and \nwe have been successful.\n  Pete Domenici has been one of the leaders on scientific research \nbecause of his work on the national labs and fighting nuclear \nproliferation. He has been to the Nevada test site, 90 miles outside \nLas Vegas, on a number of occasions. He has worked hard to ensure the \ncompetitiveness of American workers in the global marketplace.\n  We hope within the next--before this year ends, that we can pass the \nlegislation--we have done it here, it has not made it through the \nHouse--that we can pass the legislation he and Senator Wellstone \nstarted working on more than 10 years ago. It is no secret that these \ntwo great individuals, wonderful Senators, did it because they had \nexperience in their own families, problems with mental illness.\n  As a result of that, they became the experts, the leading advocates \nto do something about mental health parity in our country. If we \neliminate the work he has done on scientific research, national \nsecurity proliferation, competitiveness, eliminate all that, if he had \nnot done that and all he had done is lead us on the road to mental \nhealth parity, that would have been enough to have a very successful \ncareer.\n  But for the millions of Americans who suffer from mental illness, \nPete Domenici is the hero. He has joined Senator Kennedy, as I have \nindicated, the late Senator Wellstone, as national champions on issues \nrelated to mental health.\n  So I would hope that one of the last things we do during the year, \nthat will be the end of his great Senate career, is figure out a way to \nmake sure we get this legislation passed. Senator Domenici made his \nfarewell remarks this past Saturday. He described himself as nearly \nincapable of sitting still in a crisis. With these years of service to \nNew Mexico and our country, that description fits him perfectly.\n\n  Pete and Nancy have eight wonderful children.\n  Now, how can I describe in my words how I feel about Pete Domenici \nleaving? I guess we should, as Dr. Seuss said: ``. . . not cry before \nit's over, smile because it happened.''\n  That certainly applies to our relationship: Don't cry before it is \nover, even though there are times when you would like to shed a tear, \nsmile because it happened.\n  No distance or place or lapse of time can lessen the friendship of \nthose who are thoroughly persuaded of his work. I am persuaded of the \nwork of my friend, Pete Domenici.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to say thank you to the \ndistinguished majority leader for his kind words about my service in \nthe Senate with him and my service in the Senate generally. I wish to \nsay you have been far too generous in your words. I accept them and \nappreciate them abundantly.\n  I also wish to correct one slight error, I was a right-hander, not a \nleft-hander. But that is all right. Everything else you said was \ncorrect.\n  Mr. REID. I have described him as left-handed all the time I have \nknown him because I did not think we had two right-handed pitchers. I \nthought Bunning was the only right-hander.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My pitch was a very gifted one. I was right handed, but \nthe ball broke automatically as if I was pitching left handed. So you \nwere close. When you have a right-handed pitcher who throws a certain \nkind of fastball that breaks into the right-handed batter, that is the \nscrewball. You go to a lot of trouble throwing a screwball; but mine, I \ndid not have to go to a lot of trouble, it did it anyway. I wish there \nwere things around here that worked that way, that you did not have to \nwork so hard to make something happen. But you have to work here.\n  It has been my pleasure to work on many measures, so people will know \nit is not just talk when you say you work in a bipartisan manner--on \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee, on Energy and Water, a strange-\nsounding title. We have had the task of maintaining the safety of the \nnuclear arsenal. We were given a brandnew approach, this Senator and I, \nto saving and securing our arsenal without testing for the first time.\n  So we inherited a job of seeing that nuclear weapons were safe, and \nwe were no longer going to test them as we had from their inception. We \nwere given a concept called science-based stockpile stewardship. \nRemember those words, Leader? For a long time we had trouble saying \nthem, science-based stockpile stewardship.\n  That meant we were going to use a scientific manner of assessing what \nwas going on inside a nuclear weapon as it matured. We had put together \na plan, paid for it, and it took a long time. Every national laboratory \nhad to have something, as you recall, some piece of this project. We \nare not yet finished with the biggest piece, which is in California, at \nthe laboratory there, a gigantic laser facility, multilaser facility \nthat will look inside nuclear weapons and see that they are safe.\n  But I give you this one example: Two Senators did that. No audiences. \nNo television. They were all welcome. It was open. But we went about \nour business. As we moved along, nobody could tell who was chairman and \nwho was ranking member. It was a pleasure. I could count on you and you \ncould count on me. I do not think we ever once deceived each other.\n  Your story about my getting perturbed at you was slightly different \nthan it was. You were ranking member and you went to the Republican \nside and got a proxy. What I told you was to never do that again. When \nyou get a proxy from a Republican on my side, you have to tell me. And \nyou were very apologetic and found out that I was telling you right. We \nnever had another word. We never had another situation where proxies \ngot mixed up. Republican proxies were sought after by the Republican \nperson. If you couldn't get them, you would go somewhere else. But we \nhad to have an open hand there and tell each other what was going on. \nThat is the way we did it. We told each other the truth. With the truth \ncame great things from that subcommittee on which we were totally \nbipartisan.\n  We had kept the nuclear arsenal safe enough where those who ran the \nthree Laboratories could tell the President every year that the United \nStates nuclear arsenal was safe and sound. They\n\n[[Page S10118]]\n\nmust do that as a matter of law, you recall.\n  I say thank you. I close and say I, too, am sorry about leaving. You \nindicated something about sadness, but I am hopeful things will be all \nright with me, and certainly the Senate will have to continue to be a \ngreat place.\n  As we close, we had this one dialog this morning, and I have the \nchance, before my distinguished Republicans waiting to speak, just to \nsay I hope with all the strength of my being that we can put together a \npackage that will gather the votes in the House and Senate to put this \nplan, this recovery plan, in place so we are not going to suffer \nirreparable harm for the people by the financial markets falling apart.\n  I am so sorry we got started with this concept of calling it a \nbailout. There is nothing to bail out. We are buying assets that are \nstopping up the system. I don't know how that got to be a bailout. You \nbuy them and you own something and you sell it later. If you don't buy \nit, the entire system behind those bad assets, which were stuffed into \nthe system over a number of years because we sold mortgages that were \nnot good mortgages--I wish the people could understand that we are not \nbailing out Wall Street. We are not bailing out anything. We are trying \nto make sure the American financial markets in your own backyard--your \nbank, your savings and loan, all the other things, your payroll \nchecks--are going to function under this very fabulous American \nfinancial system which has some very big kinks in it now. It won't \nwork. We have to make it work.\n  Again, I thank the majority leader for his comments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, while both the majority leader and Senator \nDomenici are here, I want to say I appreciate the opening remarks of \nthe majority leader today. It is precisely that tone of necessity and \nbipartisanship that will enable us to achieve the result to which \nSenator Domenici referred. I hope to continue in that same vein with \nsome comments I will make in a moment.\n  If I could turn to Senator Domenici, the majority leader pointed out \nseveral of the things that have been commented upon before regarding \nSenator Domenici's leadership. I want to focus on two other things \nbriefly. The majority leader spoke to his leadership on matters \nrelating to the preservation of our great National Laboratory assets, \ntwo of which are located in New Mexico. He referred to Senator \nDomenici's leadership on mental health reform, on nuclear power; that \nis to say, our production of electricity on which Senator Domenici has \nworked so hard. I don't recall if he mentioned all of the budget reform \nthat Senator Domenici put in when he was chairman of the committee, but \nwe are certainly all aware of that.\n  I would like to briefly mention two others, to express appreciation \nto Senator Domenici for his help in achieving one of the landmark \nIndian water settlements in the history of the country related to \nArizona a couple of years ago. Without his help, that wouldn't have \nbeen possible. And I want to indicate something that probably not a lot \nof folks are aware of, but people in New Mexico will become aware of, \nthat Senator Domenici has worked hard to lay the foundation for an \nequally historic water settlement for New Mexico. Unfortunately, that \nwill not be completed before the end of Senator Domenici's service, but \nit will not be completed without the foundation he helped to lay.\n  Finally, something that has happened recently that only his \nRepublican colleagues would be familiar with, but in these last several \nweeks in which we have confronted this financial crisis, several \nleaders have risen to accept the challenge of leadership. Senator \nDomenici is one of those. Perhaps because he had been here a long time, \nhad the respect of his colleagues, always spoke thoughtfully on these \nissues, it would be expected that he would perhaps rise to that \nleadership role. I know in our Republican conference during the \nmeetings we have had to discuss this, and others, it was frequently the \ncase that Senator Domenici stood and thoughtfully and quietly expressed \nthe words that only very respected leaders can speak. He did that on \none occasion to bridge a gap between two groups of Republicans, to \ncompliment one group and to demonstrate how we all could work together \nto restore confidence to our markets. He has done that subsequently in \na thoughtful and, I even suggest, profound way.\n  I have heard Senator Domenici speak eloquently before, but I have \nnever heard him speak more eloquently than when he has been addressing \nthis crisis. It allows us to return to the proposition that as this \ngreat Senator nears the end of his service in the Senate for the people \nof New Mexico and the people of America, he is joining together in a \nbipartisan way to work on a problem of great significance to the \npeople. He has done everything he can.\n  I know when he leaves, he will be able to say he did everything he \ncould do--and he did it well. I appreciate his service. I have \nappreciated the personal relationship we have had, the friendship we \nhave had, his assistance to me. I know that will continue even though \nhe and Nancy will not be here in the Senate. But we will be close, \nsince we are neighbors in the great Southwest. I join the remarks of \nthe distinguished majority leader and compliment my friend for his \nyears of service to the people of this country.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I once again thank my friend from \nArizona. He has given me far too much credit, but I appreciate it. I \nhave tried to understand the significance of this agreement. I only \nwish that every Member had the luxury of understanding it because I \ndon't think they do. I don't think some do. I wish far more that the \nmillions of Americans who are writing their Congressmen saying this \nbailout should fail, it is no good, it doesn't help me, I wish they \nwould understand the way I have been privileged to understand. I want \nthem to know it didn't come easy.\n  The first couple of days I didn't understand, maybe the first 3 days. \nIt looked to me like it was all crazy and wild and it would never work \nand what were we trying to fix. It turns out I finally got it.\n  Once I did, there was no citizen who could write to me and say I \nshouldn't vote for this because it is bad because I would have to call \nthem and tell them they didn't understand. That is why I am talking to \nyou. I hope some additional citizens hear us.\n  If they say: Why should he be telling us we don't understand, I am \ntelling you, citizens, you don't understand if you are against this on \nthe basis that it bails out Wall Street. There is no bail out. If it \nbails out nothing, how can it bailout Wall Street? It buys something. \nWe will agree to that, right, it will buy something. But the something \nit is buying is an asset that is clogging up the financial rivers of \nAmerica because they are toxic. They are not good mortgages. If you \ndon't buy them up, they will continue to clog it up.\n\n  So, citizens, turn some of your Members loose whom you are holding \nhostage by telegram and phone call to allegations that are not correct, \nthat are untrue. If we continue to have our citizens believe them and \nthus lead our Members into not permitting this vote to occur with a \nmajority vote, we are going to do irreparable harm to a system that \nbrings us the luxury of America, the luxuries of everyday life, the \nluxuries of buying so many things which come from a financial system, \nthe luxury of buying cars that come from a financial system. Nothing is \npaid for in cash today.\n  I don't want to offend the few people who do pay in cash. Some people \npay in cash, but 99.9 percent of every transaction has some credit in \nit. If it has some credit in it, it is not going to work a couple of \nweeks from now because it has fallen apart.\n  I wish when we started it off we would have huddled and said: How do \nwe talk about this? They are still using the phraseology ``bailout'' \nthis morning. In fact, some are saying ``the bailout,'' but then they \nsay: But it isn't a bailout. But they started by saying it is a \nbailout. So we have citizens all over the place telling House Members \nwho are running for office--and I don't blame them--don't vote for the \nbailout.\n  I have taken these few minutes. I probably won't come back to the \nfloor this morning. I hope not. I have burdened the Senate enough. I \nhave bothered you enough. You just came down\n\n[[Page S10119]]\n\nto say a few words. Here I got up and said it all over again. What I \ndidn't do, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, I didn't use the \nmetaphor about a superhighway.\n  Mr. KYL. I will use that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I dreamt it up with my staff, and it is pretty darn \ngood. That is one where what you are going to say, if the American \npeople are telling their Congressmen that this is a bailout, if they \nlisten to you, they will find out there is no bailout. They will find \nout there are some broken down cars in the middle of the road, and they \nhave to be moved.\n  In any event, let me say one other thing about your mentioning my \nactivities and just say to you, a number of things I have done lately I \ncould not have done without your help and your leadership. I want to \ntell you one of them because it is a good one--I will be gone, and you \nneed to stand up for it; if you have to filibuster, you have to--that \nis opening all of the offshore of America for drilling for natural gas \nand crude oil.\n  If the new President or the majority tries to reinstate those \nmoratoria, I am saying thanks for helping me who started that thing. I \ngot it started with a little bill because my staff and I said: What is \nthe biggest thing we need. And we needed that so we put it in. Then, \nthanks to this leader, we made the bill grow. Then it grew, and then \nthe people bought it. That is how it happened. The people said: Drill, \ndrill, drill.\n  Don't let it go away when I am gone. I am just asking you. You are a \ngood filibusterer, so do it. The first time they want to close up some \nof that, and the first one will be California, you tell them to get an \nestimate of how many billions California will get if they start that. \nThen you ask that Governor: How would you like to have a gift for your \npeople over the next 10 years, 15 years of, say, for California, maybe \n$12 billion. They may fall over out of a chair if you told them that, \nand that might be the case. I don't know the number. I am just telling \nyou it is big.\n  With that, I say thanks. It is nice being here again with you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/30/senate-section/article/S10119-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                             Not A Bailout\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to continue the conversation \nSenator Domenici and I were engaged in. I assure him that Senator \nAlexander and I came to the floor this morning to try to do exactly \nwhat he suggested; that is, to tell the stories of real Americans who \nare confronting the challenges of the market that need to be fixed. \nSenator Alexander and I will do that for a few minutes to demonstrate \nthat this is not a problem that requires a bailout of Wall Street. It \nis unfortunate that the media has spoken in those terms. We understand \nthe media likes to use shorthand to describe problems, but it can do \ngreat damage. It is wrong to call this a bailout of Wall Street.\n  About 3 weeks ago, the Federal Reserve Board and the Department of \nTreasury did bail out some businesses and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \nThose were bailouts. They acquired assets, took them over, and they \nrestricted the compensation of the people running the companies and did \nall the rest.\n  This is something different. It addresses the problem that Senator \nDomenici has described akin to a big automobile accident in the middle \nof the freeway.\n  One of those great freeways in the State of the Acting President pro \ntempore can flow very nicely until there is an accident. Then when \nthere is an accident, particularly involving four or five cars, it \nstops traffic for a long time, and unless somebody comes and unclogs \nit, it is stopped dead. That is the analogy he has used to describe the \nproblem in our economy today.\n  I am going to indulge my colleagues for just a moment and go back in \ntime. When my grandmother, who was an immigrant from Holland, was \nrunning their household with my grandfather, they never bought anything \non credit. Everything was cash. They paid for their modest house when \nthey had the cash to buy it and lived in it the entire time in a small \ncommunity in Nebraska until they passed away. When they would buy a \ncar, they would not buy it until they had the cash. That was the way a \nlot of people who lived through the Great Depression had to work \nbecause there was no credit during the Great Depression.\n  It is not a bad lesson for all of us to try to have a little more \ncash on hand when we enter into big financial transactions because \nAmerica has gotten into a bit of a bad habit. It is the habit of \nleveraging everything, buying everything on credit and, in effect, \ncreating a situation where you have so many loans, so many credit card \ndebts. You bought your home on credit absolutely to the hilt. You have \nmortgaged it. Your car is on credit. And, by the way, the day after you \ndrive your new car off the lot, it is worth less than the car loan you \nhave to repay. That is now the situation with a lot of homes because \nhome values have declined to the point that some of the mortgages \nexceed the real value of the homes.\n  So we found that in our society generally we have far too much debt. \nIt is true, as Senator Domenici said, our country runs on debt. So what \nhappens if all of a sudden the credit that is required to fuel this \nsystem dries up--nobody can get a loan anymore, there is not any credit \navailable. Well, it is like the freeway accident that he describes. You \nhave five or six cars in the middle of the freeway, and every car \nbehind them is backed up and is going nowhere.\n  Now, in one car you have a doctor who has to get to the hospital or a \nnurse or a teacher who needs to get to the school to teach kids or a \nmom who needs to pick up her kids from school and they are waiting and \nshe cannot get to them. You can just imagine all the other reasons \npeople are in their car trying to get someplace. It is serious \nbusiness. They need to get going, and they cannot. If they cannot, \npeople are hurt.\n  Likewise, if you view those cars as the loans in our system, they \nwere a nice shiny car until they got into the accident, and now they \nare not worth as much. They have been wrecked. Somebody has to come and \nhaul those cars away and get rid of them.\n  Well, what if there was not anybody to haul them away? What if nobody \ncould be paid to come to haul them away? Then nobody is going to come \nand clear the freeway. That is the analogy to our financial system \ntoday. People say: Well, we would love to come and haul them away, but \nwe don't know--if we bought those cars, if we took them--that we could \nresell them for anything. They look kind of damaged to us. Nobody wants \nto buy this used car, so it is somebody else's problem.\n  None of us like Government involvement in our free market. We want to \nkeep it to as low a level as possible. But in times of crisis, \nsometimes it is up to the Government to step in and lead the way so the \nprivate market can get unclogged and begin to work again. Just as with \nthe freeway, we do call the public ambulance and the public highway \npatrol, and so on. This is a case where the public, represented by the \nMembers of Congress and by the administration, need to come up with \nsomething to get that freeway cleared.\n  Secretary Paulson and President Bush and the administration, as well \nas the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Ben Bernanke, came to us \na week ago and said: We have a huge\n\n[[Page S10120]]\n\nwreck in the freeway. It is not going to be cleared up by the private \nsector. The Government has to get involved and clear it or credit in \nthis country will absolutely come to a halt and, as we said, since the \ncountry runs to a large extent on credit, everybody will gradually come \nto a grinding halt in their personal lives and in their businesses in \nterms of being able to function fiscally.\n  So the plan was to clear the freeway by having the Government come in \nand buy those cars that are clogging the freeway, buy the assets that \ndo not have full value. We do not know what they are worth, so nobody \nin the private sector wants to buy them. But the Government could buy \nthem with up to $700 billion in cash, in money to buy them, and we will \ntry to buy them at a price the owner of that car or the owner of this \nmortgaged-backed security--maybe it is not as much as he would have \nliked to have gotten for it, but he is willing to take it in order to \nget some cash out of it and have cash to continue to operate--but at a \nvalue that is not so high that when the Government decides to then fix \nup that car that was in the accident or take this mortgage-backed \nsecurity--these loans we are talking about--to take them back to the \nmarket and sell them, that the Government will not have paid such a \nhigh price that it is not getting the money back for the taxpayers.\n  So that is what Secretary Paulson proposed. We will buy those assets \nat a reduced price, and then we will sell them, hopefully getting our \nmoney back, so the American taxpayer will have all the return on that \n$700 billion. They talk about a $700 billion bailout as if that money \nis all gone. Well, the idea, if it works, is to get all that money \nback.\n  One of the good things about the legislation that was drafted is that \nit all goes to reduce the Federal debt. That is great for the \ntaxpayers.\n  So the legislation was drafted. Everybody realizes now that the House \nof Representatives failed to pass it yesterday. One of the things \nSenator Alexander and Senator McConnell and I and Senator Gregg from \nNew Hampshire, who was so involved in the drafting of this plan, spoke \nto yesterday was the fact that this cannot fail. We have to put Humpty \nDumpty back together again and get it passed in the House and the \nSenate. There seems to be a great deal of goodwill on both sides of the \naisle and in both the House and the Senate to get this done and get it \ndone before the end of the week.\n  People are talking about the specific ways in which that might be \ndone. They do not do any damage to the basic idea the Congress and \nSecretary Paulson worked on and, in fact, I think improve it a little \nbit.\n  But now, what Senator Alexander and I want to do is talk about a few \nexamples of why this is not about some bank on Wall Street. This is \nabout folks back home. Let me give three examples of correspondence I \nhave gotten in the last few days from people who wrote about their \nreal-life problems. And we could repeat this story over and over with \nphone calls we have gotten. I have talked to so many people in Arizona \nwho said: You have to do something about this because it is affecting \nme, it is affecting my family, and we are not going to be able to \noperate our business, or we are not going to be able to send our child \nto school or whatever the situation might have been. But let me recount \nthree specific situations.\n  I am going to quote from the correspondence I received. One is from a \nsmall businessperson in Arizona, and I am not going to put the names \nin, but you will get the gist. He said, Senator:\n\n       I wanted to write to you to provide a real life example of \n     the impact this issue has caused to my business and personal \n     life. We need to be assured you are remembering and \n     representing the foundation of America, the small business \n     owner.\n       We opened our first store in March 2006 and now have 8 \n     stores operating, four in AZ two in TX and two in FL. Two of \n     these stores are corporate stores and 6 are franchise \n     locations. Collectively the operations generate over $3.5M in \n     annual sales and employs 40 people.\n\n  It is a typical small business in America. He goes on:\n\n       I hear politicians talking about what could happen if the \n     bailout is not finalized, I want to tell you it has already \n     had significant, negative impact to our business and only \n     getting worst.\n       Let me provide you with a real life example of the issue I \n     am discussing.\n       As with many small businesses we used equity in our home to \n     provide lines of business credit. We conservatively used the \n     credit to address cash flow issues or make investments in \n     goods or capital to expand the business.\n       We were notified about two weeks ago that our credit line \n     has been closed due to the drop in house prices. This has \n     created some manageable challenges but the after effects were \n     more severe.\n       With the credit line capped to our current balance, our \n     debt to available credit percentages went from 30% to 100%. \n     This in turn reduced our credit score from 750 to 680. This \n     has put us under the 720 requirements for prime loans and has \n     disqualified us from certain loans options as a business and \n     on a personal level.\n       We have not missed a payment, our business has not changed, \n     but due to this action we have had a significant drop in our \n     credit score. In fact the business is very healthily as we \n     have realized a 40% increase over last year.\n       We want to expand, hire more employees and create jobs. \n     Without the flow of capital the people that can actually help \n     the economy recover are being left out while the banks use \n     our money to shore up their business. We are told just wait \n     in line, when we are solid we will see if we can help you.\n\n  Just to interject, that is the message a lot of banks are sending to \npeople, and I do not blame them because they need to hold their cash \nbecause of the requirements the law requires. So he concludes:\n\n       As individual businesses we are nothing in the grand \n     scheme--\n\n  By the way, I would choose to disagree. These are the backbone of \nwhat makes our country work. But he goes on:\n\n     but, as a group, we are the most rapid and viable solution to \n     job creation and economic recovery. We want to expand, we \n     want to create jobs and do our part. Help us help you.\n\n  Well, that is an eloquent statement from an Arizona businessman who \nappreciates how this crisis can affect everybody else and tells us how \nit is affecting him.\n  Let me cite one other businessperson in Arizona. I am quoting again:\n\n       My wife and I live in Arizona, and I want to let you know I \n     support the emergency bailout now in review. I would like to \n     bring one thing to your attention though. Something I have \n     not heard mentioned at all in the media, and I believe is \n     being played out across the Nation.\n       My wife owns a small business in Tucson. Her business is \n     actually up 5 percent from last year. She was unable to get a \n     loan for opening the store 3 years ago and thus we put a Home \n     Equity Line of Credit on our house, and she opened several \n     credit cards who claimed they specialized in small \n     businesses.\n       She has not been late with payments, has not been over \n     limit on the cards, nothing. A decent model of paying your \n     bills on time in line with the card's terms. Yet both the \n     cards have raised her interest rate to 36 percent merely \n     because she is a small business. This in effect doubles her \n     minimum payment, and pushes her business from being able to \n     maintain economic health, to stressed. With the additional \n     stress from the unjustly raised interest rates, she has had \n     to let employees go from the store, adding to the \n     unemployment problem in Arizona today.\n\n  Now, the third and last example I want to cite is the State of \nArizona itself and its municipal and other political subdivisions \nbecause governments are hurt by this just as the private sector. The \nArizona State treasurer invests the State's and most of the individual \nlocalities of the State's day-to-day operating funds in commercial \npaper. A lot of these are called overnight funds. They get cash in \nduring the day, and they have to have a place to put it overnight \nbefore they then use it the next day to disburse it or do whatever they \nneed. They can make a fraction of a percent by putting it in Government \ncommercial paper. Sometimes they put it with a brokerage house or an \ninvestment bank, and in Arizona's case some of this fund was put with \nLehman Brothers, the entity that collapsed a couple weeks ago.\n  The State, as a result, is going to need to sell as much as $250 \nmillion in funds at a loss. This directly affects taxpayers. Here is \none of the excerpts from what the State treasurer said:\n\n       However, with the current headline risk and market \n     uncertainty, they [local governments] will likely flock to \n     insured accounts if they are available. Without the same \n     insurance, state backed investment pools may face a multi-\n     billion dollar run on the bank. Both State and local \n     governments will realize losses.\n       A run on the bank would force assets and holdings to be \n     sold at below par in order to meet redemptions as local \n     governments transfer their investments from state-operated \n     pools . . .\n\n[[Page S10121]]\n\n       The result is taxpayers at all levels would then be liable \n     for losses on investments that are subject to force selling \n     due to redemptions by investors transferring their funds, and \n     losses on yields gained on their local investment dollars \n     since private sector funds generally charge more for managing \n     those investments than state-operated pools on top of the \n     losses incurred at the federal level in the guarantee \n     program.\n\n  But in regular English, it means they are going to have to sell at a \nloss. The State will take a loss, these local governments will take a \nloss, and that will replicate itself throughout both the public sector \nand the private sector the more this goes on.\n  These are just three examples of why it is important to do something \nnow. It is up to leaders, people such as Senator Domenici, who was \nspeaking earlier, to explain that it is not a bailout; that the \nlegislation that has been put together has numerous taxpayer \nprotections in it; that we would hope to be able to get the taxpayer \ninvestment back; that in those situations where there is direct \ninvolvement by the Federal Government in the business, they will \ntotally control executive compensation and everything else relating to \nthe executives; that even when they buy assets, if there are \nsignificant assets, those corporate executives' salaries will be \nsubject to taxation rules, which will, in effect, remove both their \nability and their corporation's ability to deduct these salaries from \ntaxes.\n\n  The bottom line is, all of the things our constituents have been \nasking us to do, through painstaking, bipartisan negotiations, have \nbeen put into this legislation. What I hope is that whatever modest \nchange, if any, is needed to cause the support for this legislation to \nbe manifested in a positive vote in the House and in the Senate will \noccur quickly; that we can reassure both the markets, which, as \neveryone knows, lost over $1 trillion yesterday, and our constituents \nso that before the end of this week we can pass the legislation through \nboth Houses of Congress and get it to the President.\n  I don't blame anyone in the House of Representatives who voted the \nother way. The time for blame is gone. We need to fix the problem, not \nthe blame, as the Senator from Tennessee has said. For those who \nbelieve there are one or two changes that would cause them to support \nthe legislation, I welcome that, if that is what it takes to get this \ndone.\n  When we talk about over $1 trillion lost in the market yesterday, \nthat is really not the right way to put it. Our constituents--the \nperson who is retired and has money in the stock market, you and me, \nall of us; over 50 percent of Americans own stock--all of us lost a lot \nof money yesterday. It is on paper, but, after all, that is where the \nvalue is. Thousands and thousands of dollars. Everyone in the gallery \nwho has an investment lost money. All of us here. All of our staff who \nare participants in the Federal retirement program lost money. This is \nreal money for people in America. We can stop it if we provide the \nassurance that we are going to address the problem in a sensible way to \nrestore the confidence in the market and the confidence of the American \npeople. If we do not do this, then the warnings of these people from \nArizona whom I quoted will surely come to pass. Small businesses will \nfail, families will be hurt, and America will be on a downturn that \ncould be very difficult to stop at that point.\n  So I wish to thank my colleagues who have worked on this problem in a \nbipartisan way. They have spent a lot of time and effort. The time to \npoint blame fingers is over. We have proven we can get together and \nwork together as House and Senate Democrats and Republicans and work \nwith an administration that is desperately trying to work on the \nproblem as well. We can get this done before the end of the week. I \nurge my colleagues to continue their efforts so that we can do our job \nin representing the people of America who, after all, are counting on \nus to do what they cannot do but what we are in a position to do.\n  I will close with a comment I am fond of quoting from Theodore \nRoosevelt, who, as everyone knows, liked to get in and solve problems. \nI can't think of a more apropos time to cite this quotation where he \nsaid that he appreciated the opportunity to work on work worth doing. \nWell, if this isn't work worth doing, I don't know what is. It is worth \nit for America, it is worth it for our constituents, and it is worth it \nfor our children and grandchildren for the future. I appreciate the \nopportunity to be here working on that work, and I compliment all of my \ncolleagues who have done the same.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wish to congratulate the Senator from Arizona on his \nusual clear exposition on what is happening here and to thank the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, and Senator McConnell, the Republican \nleader, and the assistant Republican leader, Senator Kyl, all for \nmaking it clear that the Senate has not finished its work on the \neconomic recovery plan and we plan to continue our work and discuss it \ntoday and tomorrow and to complete our work on that by the end of the \nweek. That is our intention. We believe that will happen. We are united \nin that purpose in a bipartisan way. We have been for the last week. We \nare disappointed by what happened yesterday in the House of \nRepresentatives. However, photographs of legislation are best taken \nsometimes at the beginning and at the end but not in the middle, and we \nare in the middle right now.\n  Senator Kyl and I have been giving Senator Domenici credit for an \nidea he had about how to explain what we are about in trying to deal \nwith the financial crisis. He uses the analogy of a wreck on a highway.\n  The Presiding Officer is a good Scotch Irishman from Virginia. He may \nhave heard Roy Acuff's song ``Wreck on the Highway,'' which was a big \nsong back in the 1940s and the 1950s and the 1960s. That is what we \nhave here. We have had someone who should have known better empty a big \npile of cars--or bad mortgage loans, based on the securities on these \nloans--right in the middle of the interstate, and it slowed down all \nthe economic traffic. One lane might be your auto loan, the other lane \nmight be your mortgage loan, another lane might be a student loan, in \nanother one might be the trucks carrying your paycheck, or another lane \nmight be the money for your farm credit loan, and you can't get \nanywhere because there is this pile of junk in the middle of the road. \nIt happens to be an eight-lane road, so the cars and the vehicles--the \neconomic traffic--are backed up for 20 or 30 or 40 miles.\n  I was thinking as we were talking about this of another aspect of \nAmerican life that all of us are familiar with--not just the backups on \nthe interstate highways caused by wrecks, but what do we do when there \nis a wreck and we are nearby? We have to go look at the wreck. So \neverybody stops what they are doing and starts arguing about the wreck, \nand that slows everything down even more.\n  That seems to be what we are doing in the Congress. It is the \nequivalent of somebody saying, well, they needed a stop light; or, he \nshould have made a left turn; or, she was driving too fast. The crowd \nmight get bigger around the wreck and say, well, it is a stolen car; \nor, he didn't have insurance; or, one was driving too close to the \nother. Someone might have noticed that the wreck happened because this \nperson was on the cell phone or this one wasn't wearing a seatbelt. \nSomeone might say, we need to get some legislators in here and build a \nwider road or another exit ramp. Someone else might say, let's have a \npiece of legislation that would lower the speed limit or increase the \nspeed limit. A lawyer might show up and say, well, let's sue the \nmanufacturer and start interviewing witnesses. So we would all be \nstanding around just looking at the wreck. That is kind of what we are \ndoing today in the Congress. We are just standing around looking at the \nwreck when somebody ought to be moving the wreck off the highway so the \neconomic traffic can proceed. There is going to be plenty of time to \ntalk about who caused the wreck and where the blame lies. There will be \nplenty of time to do that. But today we should fix the problem. Next \nweek or the next week we should fix the blame.\n  There is a lot of blame we need to talk about, apparently. The New \nYork Times reported yesterday--well, we\n\n[[Page S10122]]\n\nknow this, to begin with: The Federal Government's compassion got way \nout ahead of its common sense, going all the way back to the 1970s, by \nencouraging some people to buy homes who couldn't afford to pay for the \nhomes. Then clever financiers created exotic instruments, and these \nwere based on some of the loans that turned out not to be so good, and \nsome of these exotic instruments turned out to be worth less than the \nloans. Then, people who should have known better, who should have known \nwhat was going on in their own financial institutions or in their own \ncompanies, didn't understand what was going on, or they misled people, \nor they turned a blind eye to it. We need to find out about that.\n\n  As the New York Times described it 2 days ago in an article, what \napparently has happened is that mortgage foreclosures set off questions \nabout the quality of debts across the entire credit spectrum. These \nquestions set off a spiral of claims against insufficient insurance, as \nin the case of AIG, and of insufficient capital in the case of banks. \nSo we end up with this massive wreck in the middle of the highway, and \nall of the vehicles carrying our auto loans, our student loans, and our \npaychecks are stopped while we in Congress stand around looking at the \nwreck instead of trying to get somebody to get it off the road.\n  So we will have to turn to the Secretary of the Treasury. We could \nmaybe find some other people to get it off the road as well. Senator \nDomenici, who first suggested that we think of this metaphor of the \nwreck on the highway, and Senator Kyl, who talked about it a little \nbit, pointed out that the citizens aren't going to go get the wreck off \nthe highway. They are either going to go call the sheriff or the \nwrecker or somebody else to come get it. In Tennessee, we call the guy \nwith the salvage company who has a wrecker, and he comes to get it. In \nour case, I guess what we have to do is call the Secretary of the \nTreasury. We have to give him enough money, enough authority to be able \nto buy all the junk in the middle of the highway, get it off the road, \nand hope he is able to sell it for about what he paid for it--or at \nleast to minimize our losses.\n  That is why it is wrong to call it a $700 billion bailout, because he \nmay need up to $700 billion to buy all of this stuff in the middle of \nthe highway. But he is going to buy it, and then he is going to sell \nit. We put in some taxpayer protections to try to make sure that we \nhave clear oversight, and that people don't get golden parachutes as a \nresult of this, and that the Congress is involved, and that there is a \nboard of directors to whom the Secretary must report--all of these are \ntaxpayer protections. We want to make sure this Secretary, whose job it \nis to get everything out of the middle of the road, keeps us informed \nabout what is happening. We don't want to be guilty of having turned \nour backs and not paying attention to dealing with taxpayers' money on \nthis.\n  I think the conclusion we have to come to by the end of the week is \nthat we are not just going to sit around and look at the wreck. We are \ngoing to get it off the road. We are going to get it off the highway. \nWe have to find the right way to do it. I believe most of the American \npeople will understand that, agree with that, and be glad we did it. \nMost of my calls are like most of the other telephone calls that are \ncoming in. People don't like this. They are angry about it. If you have \na wreck, you are mad about that as well. Somebody might have run into \nyou, or you took your eye off the road. Of course we are mad about it. \nI am angry about it. But I am not just going to sit there and look at \nthe wreck; I am going to try to solve the problem and then fix the \nblame next week.\n  The good news is that is the attitude of Senator Reid, the Democratic \nmajority leader. That is the attitude of Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican leader. As I hear the House speaking, the Speaker of the \nHouse, a Democrat, the Republican leader, they say we are going to go \nback to work and see what we can do to fix this problem. We understand \nit is a big problem.\n  Well, the stock market yesterday went way down, 777 points. That used \nto be something that people could say: Oh, that is a few rich tycoons \non Wall Street, but we know better than that today. It was already \ndown, and more than 50 percent of Americans own stocks. So as the \nSenator from Arizona said, that affects our pension funds, and that \naffects our IRAs and retirement accounts all across America. And that \naffects our individual accounts--so that is real money. That is $1.2 \ntrillion yesterday.\n  We are talking about an economic recovery plan that would have the \nauthority to spend up to $700 billion, but our hope would be that it \nwouldn't spend very much in the end because we are going to buy and \nsell assets.\n  Now, the stock market--and this is good news--is back up some today, \na couple hundred points up. It was down yesterday, it went 777 points \ndown, and is back up a little bit today. The focus is on the stock \nmarket, but where the focus ought to be is not on the stock market, but \non the credit market. Some things we take for granted: that the Sun \nwill come up, that our breathing will be automatic, and that we will be \nable to get an auto loan or a student loan or a mortgage loan or farm \ncredit loan, or that when we take our paycheck in and give it to the \nbank, that represents money. But what if that didn't happen? That is \nwhat we are talking about.\n  In the case of offshore drilling, we had to wait until the price of \ngasoline got up to $4 before we could get rid of the ban on offshore \ndrilling so we could produce more American energy. That was legitimate \ndebate here in the Senate. I hope we don't have to wait for dozens and \ndozens of banks to fail, for payroll checks to bounce, and for auto \nloans to dry up before the Congress decides we need to act.\n  What we are trying to do is prevent a more serious problem by taking \na measured response, which will cost the taxpayers the least amount of \nmoney and clear up the economic traffic so we can start moving again, \nand so housing can gradually begin to come back. When housing gradually \nbegins to come back, the economy will begin to come back.\n  This is still a great big economy. Even in this slowdown, we will \nproduce about a third of all the money in the world this year, just for \nthe 5 percent of us who live here. So we are perfectly capable, with \nour great universities, with our energy laboratories, with our great \ncorporations, with our terrific workforce, and with our system of \neducation, of coming back--and we will come back--and we will lead the \nworld in a great many areas. But we don't want to cause unnecessary \ntrouble for ourselves by leaving a big wreck sitting in the middle of \nthe economic highway while standing around gawking about it and arguing \nabout whether to change the size of the exit ramp when we can have all \nthose debates next week. Fix the problem this week; fix the blame next \nweek.\n  ``Credit markets'' is a short word, but a big-sounding word. The Wall \nStreet Journal reported this morning people are so cautious about their \nmoney that yields--the amount of money you make in the credit market--\nhad sunk so far that most investors will accept almost no return on \ntheir money as long as they believe their money is safe. In other \nwords, bury it in a hole or put it under a mattress. You don't make any \ninterest on it, but at least you think it is safe.\n  I think in a country such as ours, if everybody puts their money \nunder the mattress or invests it somewhere where money is safe but \nproduces almost no return, what that will mean is that many of the big \nboys and the big girls will be all right. A lot of the big corporations \nhave a lot of cash. They don't need to borrow very much money. What it \nwill mean, though, is they will not be expanding. If they are a \nrestaurant company, they will not be building new restaurants and \nhiring more people. They may even close a few restaurants. But the \nsmall business owners, the State and local governments that represent \ntaxpayers, as we do, the one Senator Kyl of Arizona talked about, they \nare going to be hurt.\n  The State of Tennessee is in the same shape as the State of Arizona. \nThe State of Tennessee has a triple A bond rating and very little debt. \nBut it has to go on the market every now and then to borrow some money. \nIts short-term borrowing was twice as much last week. It cost twice as \nmuch as it did the week before. That cost is passed directly on to the \ntaxpayers of the State of Tennessee.\n\n[[Page S10123]]\n\n  Half our college students in America have a Federal grant or a loan \nto help pay for college. I used to be president of the University of \nTennessee. I know how important that is.\n  We made some unwise decisions in Congress earlier this year, in my \nopinion, that limits the amount of student loans that are available to \nstudents. But if banks are not lending to each other at night because \nthey are hoarding their money, and if you and I with cash are investing \nin Treasury bills instead of money markets or other investments that \nthen, in turn, can be loaned to other people, there is not going to be \nany money for student loans. And lots of people of all ages are going \nto have a harder time going to college. Or if there is money, they are \ngoing to have to pay a much higher interest rate because there is a \nshortage of money to lend. We know how that works. If there is a small \nsupply, the price goes up. If there is a small supply of money for \ncredit, then your student loan is going to cost more. If you go to the \nUniversity of Tennessee, Virginia, Notre Dame--wherever you go--you are \ngoing to pay a lot more and you are paying a lot today.\n  I was at the Volkswagen headquarters' opening in Virginia two weeks \nago. The head of Volkswagen Credit told me Volkswagen--which is the \nlargest European car maker and is also opening a new car plant in \nChattanooga, which we are very excited about--goes to the market every \nmonth to get about $300 million. Where do they get that money? They get \nthat probably from people who put money into banks, into money markets. \nIt is our money, upon which they pay some interest. What do they do? \nThey turn around and loan it to you and me so we can buy a Volkswagen.\n  I said something about this a week ago, and some people thought I \nmeant the Volkswagen plant in Tennessee wasn't going to be built. They \nare going to build the Tennessee Volkswagen plant. In our State, about \na third of our manufacturing jobs are auto-related jobs. We have a big \nNissan plant, we have a big General Motors plant, and we have 4,000 \nToyota jobs and suppliers. So if the big credit companies for \nautomobile manufacturers cannot easily get money or have to pay a lot \nfor the money they get, what do you suppose happens to us? When we go \nto get a car loan, either we can't get it or the price of it is too \nhigh and we don't buy the car. If we don't buy the car, then Volkswagen \nin Chattanooga or Nissan in Smyrna or General Motors, the Saturn plant, \nin Spring Hill, or the Toyota suppliers that are all over the State, \nthey don't make as many cars, they don't build as many supplies, and \nthey don't have as many jobs. That is what happens when the credit \nsqueeze comes.\n  Those are some of the personal examples that are happening in \nTennessee. We can see them all over the country.\n  On PBS's ``Nightly Business Report,'' September 26, which was Friday, \nDarren Gersh, Washington bureau chief, reported:\n\n       You know, Susie, we just heard a lot from Washington, but I \n     want to tell you something I heard from Ohio today. When I \n     was there for the primaries, I met a machinist named Ron \n     Gewax. Well, I talked to Ron this morning and he told me that \n     his boss came to him in tears and said: ``Look, Ron, you \n     know, our customers' loans have dried up, we can't--we're not \n     getting business and we have to let you go.'' So this credit \n     crunch is now hitting home. That's evidence of how it's \n     hitting home on Main Street.\n\n  This is a Main Street problem. I know we have been getting a lot of \ntelephone calls saying don't do this, but a lot of my telephone calls \nare changing. We are elected to come here and understand the problem \nand act before there is a crisis, not after there is a crisis.\n  When I was Governor of Tennessee in the 1980s, because of some \nproblems with east Tennessee banks that represented illegal activity, \nwe had about 40-50 bank failures, one after another. I don't want to go \nthrough that again because what that does is cause the stockholders to \nlose all their money.\n  You say: Well, the FDIC comes in and buys the assets, straightens it \nout, and banks pay for it through their insurance program. They do, and \nthey have done it in the last couple weeks a couple or three times, but \nit completely tears up the community when the bank fails. It disrupts \nrelationships. It means individuals and small businesses that have \ndepended on loans have a harder time getting them. It means there are \nindividual bankruptcies as a result of it.\n  If we had 50 bank failures in Tennessee, as we did 20 years ago, that \nwould be a thousand across this country. We don't want to go through \nthat. We don't want to have banks, insurance companies, individuals, \nsmall businesses, auto dealerships close. An auto dealership in \nTennessee, one of the largest in the country, closed the other day. It \nwas one of 13 dealerships for this particular Chevrolet company. The \ncompany had some other problems, but one reason it closed was because \nit could not get credit for its floor plan for its ability to finance \nits cars, and it is out of business, all 13 of those locations, and \n7,200 employees in those 13 locations are out of a job.\n\n  Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, Senator Domenici, Senator Kyl, and I \nwish to say to the American people and the American markets and the \nworld markets that we intend to do our job in the Congress. We are not \ngoing to sit around and look at the wreck and argue about who is to \nblame. We can do that next week and the next week and the next week, \nand we should do that.\n  We obviously need different kinds of regulations. No one seems to \nhave understood what these exotic instruments based on mortgages were, \nor how they were sold, or whether they are properly valued. We need to \nfigure that out. We need to deal with that. Maybe the Securities and \nExchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, and other agencies need to do \nmore.\n  These rules and regulations we have today are primarily a result of \nthe calamities in the 1930s--the Great Depression. I am sure many of \nthem need to be changed.\n  Next week, we need to fix the blame and find a long term fix for the \nproblem. Today, tomorrow, and the rest of this week, we need to \ncontinue our discussion of the Paulson plan, which has been \nsignificantly amended by the congressional negotiators over the last \nweek to protect the taxpayers. Then we need to act on it before the end \nof the week. The majority leader has very wisely given Members of the \nSenate--many of whom are here and some have gone back to their States \nthese extra days to read the legislation, to consider it, to come to \nthe floor, to debate the legislation, and to make up our minds whether \nwe like this Paulson plan, as significantly amended to protect the \ntaxpayers.\n  I am going to vote for it, even if the stock market continues to go \nup today and tomorrow, which I hope it does. I do not want to see a \ncredit freeze come. I want to get the wreck off the highway. I want to \nget the vehicles carrying the auto loans, and the mortgage loans, and \nthe farm credit loans, and the money for payroll checks, moving again. \nWe can get that moving again. It is a small step we will have to take. \nThen we will have the time to have aggressive supervision of the \nSecretary of Treasury, who will then have all the authority he needs to \nget the wreck off the highway and get things moving. And we can set \nabout making sure we create a proper regulatory system for the kind of \nworld in which we live.\n  I am greatly encouraged by the tone and the words and the actions of \nthe Democratic leader and the Republican leader in the Senate. I look \nforward to working with them over the next three days. We intend to \nfinish our job before we go home this week. We intend to get that wreck \noff the highway so the economic traffic can start flowing again.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to add to my remarks, \nbriefly, these opinions and these examples about the credit crunch.\n  In the Washington Post this morning there is an article by Michael A. \nFletcher and V. Dion Haynes, in which they say the following:\n\n       Meanwhile, tightening credit has made it harder and more \n     expensive for many small businesses to borrow money, a \n     process that many analysts say could accelerate with the \n     turmoil on Wall Street.\n\n[[Page S10124]]\n\n       Dee Smith, who runs a small contracting firm that renovates \n     and sells homes in Charlotte, Mich., said a bank he has dealt \n     with for more than a decade has decided to finance a smaller \n     share of his projects. While the bank would once give him \n     construction loans for 80 percent of a property's appraised \n     value, it now will pony up only 75 percent. That might seem \n     like small change, but Smith said it has shaken up his entire \n     business.\n       Because he cannot afford to put out the extra cash, he \n     said, he has laid off four of his\n     six workers. Meanwhile, because of the\n     slowdown in the housing market, he's been unable to sell \n     three houses he has renovated. . . .\n       Laura Richards said sales are down 10 percent at her two \n     California Tortilla restaurants in Bowie and Annapolis. . . .\n\n  That is in Maryland.\n\n       She said she's trying to attract customers with promotions.\n       Worse still, with banks tightening credit, she's been \n     forced to put off expansion plans. ``Any plans of opening new \n     restaurants are on the back burner until we see what's going \n     on on Wall Street,'' she said. ``Originally, I said that five \n     locations was a goal. Now I'm trying to manage my down side. \n     It will take two or three years to get back to where I was a \n     year ago.''\n       Although some corporations are sitting on large sums of \n     cash--and those with top bond ratings are enjoying favorable \n     access to credit markets--others are paying much more for \n     short-term loans, if they can get them at all.\n\n  And on the front page in, the main article in the Washington Post \nbusiness section, Tuesday, September 30, Heather Landy and Renae Merle \nwrite:\n\n       Underlying the panic is a seizing-up of the credit markets \n     that provide companies with financing for expenses such as \n     payroll and inventory. Analysts said banks are lending less \n     as they try to conserve cash for their own balance sheets, \n     while nervous investors are forcing companies to pay higher \n     interest rates to borrow in the debt markets.\n\n  The article quotes someone as saying:\n\n       The credit markets are kind of like the oil for an engine \n     that allows companies to buy something and finance it. And if \n     they don't have the ability to finance that at a reasonable \n     cost, then all of the sudden their profit margins are going \n     to get squeezed and they're perhaps not going to be able to \n     hold as much inventory, and this is happening around the \n     globe.\n\n  The article continues quoting:\n\n       You need to be able to have credit, and it needs to be at a \n     reasonable price for the economy to function.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 30, 2008]\n\n                         They Just Don't Get It\n\n                         (By Steven Pearlstein)\n\n       Oy vey.\n       That is the technical economic term that best sums up a day \n     in which the House of Representatives refuses to pass a $700 \n     billion rescue plan pushed by the White House and \n     congressional leaders from both parties, Wachovia is taken \n     over in a deal that will have the government potentially \n     owning 10 percent of Citigroup, a few European banks fail, \n     the Federal Reserve and other central banks are forced to \n     inject an additional $300 billion into the global banking \n     system, the Dow Jones industrial average plunges 778 points, \n     and investors everywhere rush to the safety of gold and \n     short-term Treasury bills.\n       The basic problem here is that too many people don't \n     understand the seriousness of the situation.\n       Americans fail to understand that they are facing the real \n     prospect of a decade of little or no economic growth because \n     of the bursting of a credit bubble that they helped create \n     and that now threatens to bring down the global financial \n     system.\n       Politicians worry less about preventing a financial \n     meltdown than about ideology, partisan posturing and teaching \n     people a lesson. Financiers have yet to own up publicly to \n     their own greed, arrogance and incompetence. And leaders of \n     foreign governments still think that this is an American \n     problem and that they have no need to mount similar rescue \n     efforts in their countries.\n       In the coming weeks and months, all of these people will \n     come to understand how deep the hole really is and how we're \n     all in it together.\n       They'll come to understand that the giant sucking sound \n     they hear is of a massive deleveraging of the global economy \n     and the global financial system as households, governments, \n     businesses and investment funds adjust to living in a world \n     with less debt and more inflation.\n       And they will come around, reluctantly to the understanding \n     that the only way to get out of these situations is to have \n     governments all around the world borrow gobs of money and \n     effectively nationalize large swaths of the financial system \n     so it can be restructured, recapitalized, reformed and \n     returned to private ownership once the crisis has passed and \n     the economy has gotten back on its feet.\n       In the next few weeks, the center of attention here in the \n     United States will shift from the Congress and an exhausted \n     Treasury to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which will \n     now have to rescue any number of failing banks, either by \n     taking them over directly or managing their transfer into \n     stronger hands. It will also shift back to the Federal \n     Reserve and other central banks, which will have to step up \n     their efforts to maintain liquidity in money markets and \n     prevent the credit crunch from taking down hedge funds \n     businesses, and state and local governments.\n       These will, alas, be only holding actions. Restoring real \n     stability to financial markets will require the kind of \n     systemic approach and extraordinary government interventions \n     that the public has refused to authorize and finance. In \n     better times the public might have put aside its reluctance \n     in response to the strong and unified recommendation of \n     political and business leaders. But it is a measure of how \n     little trust remains in both Washington and Wall Street that \n     voters are willing to risk a serious hit to their wealth and \n     income rather than follow their lead.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wanted to speak a little about where we \nstand. I know everybody is concerned about this relative to our efforts \nto provide for the economy and free up the credit markets and make sure \nMain Street continues to function and jobs are created and economic \nactivity is pursued.\n  Obviously, the House vote on Monday was disappointing, to be kind, \nand it had an immediate effect on America, with $1.2 trillion in wealth \ntaken out of the American system almost instantly--a 770-point drop in \nvalue in the exchange. Those dollars are real. That is pension fund \nvalue. Most people who work have pension funds. It is IRAs and 401(k)s \nall losing value very quickly. People who are right on the cusp of \nretiring are especially impacted by that. Today, it is up a little bit, \nwhich is good. I am glad calmer heads have prevailed in the markets and \nthat fear is not driving the markets today. That is good. But the \nproblem that drove that hasn't gone away.\n  The problem that created that event--and that is that the credit \nmarkets, not the equity markets--and this is important for people to \nunderstand; the stock market is different from the credit market--the \ncredit markets are moving toward the point of freezing up. What does \nthat mean? That means the local employer who maybe has to finance his \nor her payroll, the small restaurant or the small seasonal business \nthat one week doesn't make enough to cover that payroll but the next \nweek makes more than the payroll, in the week they have to borrow the \nmoney to make the payroll from the bank, they are not going to be able \nto do it or it will be less than what the total payroll is. The person \nwho buys inventory--a restaurant has to buy food, a small business has \nto buy materials, a store has to buy its inventory and the things it \nputs on its shelves. That is all done through credit on Main Street. \nThat credit won't be available. The family who sends their child to \ncollege--that is an event that energizes a debt and creates credit. The \nfamily who uses a credit card--that again energizes a debt and creates \ncredit. All these Main Street activities are freezing up.\n  What does that lead to? It leads to a loss of jobs, a loss of \neconomic activity, the loss of savings, the loss of the basic character \nof America to be a place of commerce and economic well-being. \nUnfortunately, whether we like it or not, we are on the cusp of that \nevent, and it is severe and it is serious and it is real.\n  So what did we suggest as a proposal? Well, the Treasury came to us \nand said the way to free up these markets, the way to get credit moving \nagain--or part of the way to get credit moving again--is to buy off the \nbooks of a large number of the financial entities in this country what \nare known as nonperforming loans--loans which are based on mortgages, \nmortgages on homes where the value has dropped so precipitously that \nthe mortgage actually exceeds the value of the home or, alternatively, \nor in combination, the\n\n[[Page S10125]]\n\nmortgage reset because it was a subprime mortgage and the payer of the \nmortgage can't afford to pay the mortgage anymore because interest \nrates went up so much on it. Those nonperforming loans are sitting on \nthe books of a lot of lending institutions, and there is no way to \nvalue them because the value of those underlying assets has dropped so \nmuch. The practical effect of that is those institutions can't lend \nagainst those assets.\n  So what we were going to do was to step in and buy those assets, \nthose nonperforming loans, so that those lending institutions could \nstart to lend against real assets--valued assets--and thus create \ncredit. Then we were going to take those assets which we purchased and \nwe were going to hold them while the market started to settle down and \nthe economy, hopefully, would improve, and then we would resell them \ninto the market and we would get money back to the taxpayer.\n  So even though $700 billion is the number we hear--and it has been, \nin the most inappropriate way, hyperbolized and demagogued, that we are \ntaking $700 billion and throwing it at Wall Street, and that is not \nwhat is happening. We are taking $700 billion and with that taxpayer \nmoney we are buying assets which the taxpayer will own, and then later \non we are going to sell those assets. We may sell them for what we paid \nfor them, we may sell them for less than we paid for them, or we may \nactually sell them for more than we paid for them--in fact, a lot of \npeople think we will. So the cost to the taxpayer is not going to be \ngreat, and it is not going to be anywhere near $700 billion. There is a \nchance--an outside chance--the taxpayer may make some money. That is \nnot our goal, but that is an opportunity that lies here.\n  Let me describe it this way, to put it in simpler terms and more \nvivid terms, hopefully. If you had an eight-lane highway in your town \nor in your city--most people don't, but let's say there was one--and \nyou had a crash on that highway that blocked the entire highway, and \nbacked up behind that crash might be trucks carrying the payrolls for \npeople who are working, carrying the money that made the hospital work, \ncarrying the money to make the school system work, carrying the money \nthat let the garbage get picked up, carrying the money that allowed the \nkids to go to college, all those trucks carrying that money are backed \nup behind this accident and they can't get to the places they need to \nget to. So what we want to do as a government is to come in and take \nthat accident off the highway and let the commerce flow again. Then we \nwould take the cars that were in the accident, those cars that are all \nmangled, and we are going to repair them a little bit and resell them, \nhopefully for more than what we paid for them, but we are certainly \ngoing to resell them for a value which is considerable. That is what we \nare doing here.\n  We need to act. This is not a theoretical or a virtual event. The \nmarket showed us yesterday just how worried people are and how \nimportant it is that we proceed. So what should we do now, now that the \nHouse has acted in this way and basically suspended the effort here? \nWell, we need to return to the issue. We need to, in a conscientious \nand constructive way, get this matter back up and get it moving in the \nright direction.\n  I hope the Senate will act. I think we should act. We are obviously \nhere at the Jewish holiday, so we are unable to take action today and \nmaybe not until late tomorrow night because of that recognition and \nbecause we want to be appreciative of those sacred days. But the fact \nis, we need to act soon.\n  This is not a situation which is going to get any better with time. \nIt is going to get significantly worse, and at some point it is like \nthe snowball rolling down the hill: It is going to get going so fast \nthat our ability to stop the damage that is going to be caused is going \nto be dramatically lessened.\n  Is this proposal we came forward with perfect? No, but it has a lot \nof safeguards in it. Taxpayers were safeguarded. This was all added on \nthrough the negotiation--at which negotiation, by the way, were \nrepresentatives of all the players: the House Members, House \nRepublicans and Democrats; the Senate Members, Senate Democrats and \nRepublicans; and Treasury. We put in very strict, very aggressive \ntaxpayer protection. For example, all the dollars which we get from \nselling these assets are going to go to reduce the debt. We limit \nexecutive compensation so people cannot take advantage of the \nsituation. We limit golden parachutes. We put in place language which \nsays that if we get these assets and they are mortgages of people who \nare in their home, we want to try to keep them in their home, and so we \nwill try to reorient that mortgage so they can afford it. We have \naggressive oversight, which is extremely important. So we have done a \nseries of moves to make this work better and work to the benefit of the \nAmerican taxpayers and the people who live in their homes.\n  But it is critical that we do it. Now, does it solve the problem? No, \nit doesn't solve the problem completely or even totally in any way. But \nhere is what it does do. Think of it is as a person who has received a \nsevere wound, and I mean a life-threatening wound. We are putting a \ntourniquet on that wound and stabilizing that person so we can take \nthem to the hospital and hopefully get them cured and get them on the \nroad again to a prosperous life. That is what we are doing with the \neconomy. We are putting a tourniquet on the economy to stabilize it so \nit can stand back up on its own two feet and get going again.\n  If we don't go forward, there are going to be severe events, and most \nof the burden of the severe events is going to be borne by Main Street. \nOrdinary Americans are going to bear the burden. They are going to be \nthe ones whose jobs are affected because payrolls can't be made, and so \nthey will lose their jobs. They are going to be the ones who can't \nborrow money to buy a car, who can't borrow money to buy a house or \nborrow money to send their kids to school. It is their hospitals that \nare not going to be able to roll over their revenue bonds. It is their \nindustrial parks, where their jobs are located, that won't be able to \nroll over their bonds to do the improvements that create the entities \nthat expand the economy. Those are all the things that are going to be \nimpacted here--on Main Street America.\n  So I think our responsibility as a government is to take action. But \nin this instance, people have been misrepresenting what is happening. \nThey have been hyperbolizing, and there has been a lot of theater in \nthe marketplace by some people who basically are being irresponsible \nand demagogic, in my opinion, about what we were doing, and so the \ngeneral public has been misinformed and really grossly misinformed. Of \ncourse, they naturally mistrust the Government, and they probably \nshould. We should all be a little suspicious of the Government, to say \nthe least. But as a very practical matter, in this instance, there has \nbeen a tremendous amount of misinformation, especially about the \nimmediate impact this will have on people on Main Street if we don't \nact.\n  So we have this situation, and I think what we need to do is to step \nback, calm these waters, and act in a responsible way and move forward \nin a way that allows us to take this opportunity to try to settle out \nthe markets, free up the markets, get credit flowing again, and \nhopefully relieve some of the pressure every American is going to be \nfacing from what is a very severe economic situation.\n  I hope we will vote soon. I would like the Senate to vote as soon as \nwe can--and not in any way impinge on the Jewish holiday--because I \nbelieve we need to do that. We need to pass this legislation because \nthe consequences of not passing it are so extraordinary and will be so \ndetrimental to our country and to our people that it would be totally \nirresponsible of us to not take this action.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, what is the business of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is under cloture on the motion to \nconcur.\n  Mr. WEBB. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to add my voice to a number of \nother people who have spoken today about this economic bailout \nsituation and, perhaps from a bit different perspective, suggest that \npeople need to\n\n[[Page S10126]]\n\ncalm down a little, that all of us are arguing responsibly with \ndifferent approaches, but serious approaches, to try to resolve the \nissue.\n  There is a lot of commentary out there today alleging that people in \nthe Congress, a lot of people in the Congress are simply playing \npolitics with this volatile issue. There is commentary about how the \naverage American does not understand the problem and, as a result, has \nobjected to the approach that has been taken. There are accusations \nthat the Congress is not doing its job because of the approach that was \ntaken in the vote in the House yesterday.\n  I would suggest there are a lot of people who are not playing \npolitics, who do understand the problem, who are doing their job, and \nyet, who still have grave concerns about the approach that has been \ntaken with this proposed solution.\n  Let's take a minute and review what has been going on. Only 11 days \nago, Secretary Paulson, on behalf of the Bush administration, came \nforward with a proposal, a three-page proposal, saying the Congress \nneeded, within a couple days, to give him $700 billion or the authority \nto invest $700 billion, with very little supervision or oversight, in a \nvery dramatic transfer of power to one individual.\n  Then we started having this great discussion in the media and on the \nfloor about us not acting quickly. Let me, first, say I was one of the \nfirst Members of this body to speak on this floor on September 22, on \nthat Monday, questioning publicly the approach that had been suggested \nin this Bush-Paulson proposal to address our crisis.\n  Also, last Friday, was joined by eight other Members of the Senate, \nurging that any bipartisan compromise addressing this crisis contain \nseveral important principles. I would say, with due respect to the \nSenator from New Hampshire and others, that there has been tremendous \neffort over this week to try to take a three-page proposal and make it \ninto a piece of legislation we can all live with and that addresses the \nproblems. They all have my appreciation and my admiration for that \neffort. But at the same time, we can do more. I hope, as they \nreconsider the vote yesterday, the drafters can take a hard look at \nsome of these areas and tighten these provisions so some, myself \nincluded, can feel more comfortable in supporting it.\n  Firstly, we need to recognize that we have, in this legislation, \ntaken into consideration the idea that we are going to transfer a \nmassive amount of power to the executive branch of this Government. \nThis, at a time when the executive branch, over the past 8 years, has \naccumulated more power, than perhaps at any time in our history, as a \nresult of 9/11, the war powers, and regarding the privacy of \nindividuals, et cetera.\n  We are not only transferring that power to the executive branch, we \nare giving the authority to one person, the Secretary of Treasury, who, \nas Senator Feinstein had pointed out, may have a conflict of interest. \nThis is an individual who has made hundreds of millions of dollars \nworking on Wall Street. I respect his confidence and I respect his \ncareer.\n  But at the same time, as a matter of policy, is this the best place \nor best way for us to transfer the money that would be invested in \norder to save our economy? In the past, when these situations have \narisen, money has been transferred to entities such as the RTC. There \nwere proposals brought forward, noting perhaps the necessity for a \nboard of people, honest brokers, wise men and women who would make \nthese determinations rather than simply one individual.\n  I know in this process we have left oversight to individual \ndiscretion, but perhaps we ought to think about a panel of three or \nsome other form where we can reassure ourselves that there would not be \na conflict of interest on the other side.\n  A number of us in this body and the other body have said, we need to \nproceed forward with an appropriate regulatory structure. There is \nlanguage in the bill that was voted on yesterday that had a commitment \nto move forward, to looking at the problem but no specificity from the \nCongress saying we need to fix the problem, or that we need to \nreinstate regulations.\n  There was an article in the Wall Street Journal today written by \nRobert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney. In this article he \npoints out:\n\n       There is $1.9 trillion, almost all of it run out of the New \n     York metropolitan area, that sits in the Cayman Islands, a \n     secrecy jurisdiction. Another $1.5 trillion is lodged in four \n     other secrecy jurisdictions.\n\n  And Morgenthau adds:\n\n       Any significant infusion to the financial system must carry \n     assurances that it will not add to the pool of money beyond \n     the safety net and supervisory authority of the United \n     States. Moreover, the trillions of dollars currently offshore \n     and invested in funds that can impact the American economy \n     must be brought under appropriate supervision.\n\n  This is a point that has been made many times on the Senate floor by \nother Members, particularly Senator Dorgan of North Dakota. This is a \nmoment in which we can have a commitment by the Congress that \nregulatory structures will be put in place in order to properly protect \nour economy.\n  Another area where you see the abandonment of regulatory structure, \nto the detriment of our economy, is in the commodities market. We had \ndebates during the consideration of the Energy bill in August where \nmany Senators came to the floor speaking relative to what happened when \nwe took regulation out of the oil futures market. A barrel of oil cost \n$24 in 2002, when this Congress voted to go to war in Iraq. Since then \nthe price has gone all the way up to $147. When you see the fluctuation \nin the oil markets that has attended this crisis, you see this is not \nan old-style commodities market, where people who are using the product \nare the ones who were purchasing the futures. This is now a speculative \nmarket. Just like a regular stock market, commodities should have a \nsimilar regulatory structure.\n  We need, and I have pointed out, along with other Members of this \nbody, the need to provide clear caps on executive compensation. The \nbill that was voted on yesterday has significant improvements over the \nPaulson bill which was totally lacking in this area. It could be \ntightened further. I would recount a conversation I had with an \nindividual who had a long respected career on Wall Street, is one of \nthe most brilliant Wall Street analysts, and now retired. When I \ncalled--I was calling around to as many people from different \nprofessional environments as I could to try and understand this crisis.\n  This is someone who made good money on Wall Street and is very well \nrespected. I asked him about the issue of executive compensation. His \ncomment to me was, ``The people who perpetrated this situation ought to \nbe punished.''\n  That was his word, ``punished.'' I do not believe specifically in \npunishing them, but I certainly believe strongly, as do most Americans, \nthat the people who have gotten us into this situation should not be \nunjustly enriched as we fix it.\n  Finally, we need to give the American taxpayer a clear up side in \nthis process, as the securities and assets are bought and sold by \nwhichever entity ends up doing that. An ``up side'' in the sense of \nreturning money back to the Treasury and, an up side in the sense that \nour legislation should do something that directly helps the people who \nare at the bottom in this crisis, the people who want to stay in their \nhomes.\n\n  Again, there has been movement in that direction in the last week, \nbut this area is where better assurances, clearer assurances could \nbring more people over to the side of passing this legislation. We want \na solution. We all recognize there is a problem. My reaction, quite \nfrankly, to the situation from yesterday, is that it brings me back to \na saying from when I was in the Marine Corps that sometimes you have an \nopportunity that is masking itself as a disaster.\n  Perhaps we can tighten this proposal, get the right kind of formula--\nit will not take a great deal of change--and bring the Congress to \nsupporting provisions and move into the future with a strengthened \neconomy, a better regulatory process, and an environment that truly \ntakes care of the interests of the taxpayers who are going to have to \nfoot the bill.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/30/senate-section/article/S10127-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10127]]\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--SENATE RESOLUTIONS\n\n  Mr. WEBB.

and\n       Whereas the Department of Homeland Security, in conjunction \n     with the National\n\n[[Page S10128]]\n\n     Cyber Security Alliance and the Multi-State Information \n     Sharing and Analysis Center, has designated October 2008 as \n     the fifth annual National Cyber Security Awareness Month \n     which serves to educate the people of the United States about \n     the importance of computer security: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Cyber \n     Security Awareness Month;\n       (2) congratulates the National Cyber Security Division of \n     the Department of Homeland Security, the National Cyber \n     Security Alliance, the Multi-State Information Sharing and \n     Analysis Center, and other organizations working to improve \n     cyber security in the United States on the fifth anniversary \n     of the National Cyber Security Month during October 2008; and\n       (3) continues to work with Federal agencies, national \n     organizations, businesses, and educational institutions to \n     encourage the development and implementation of voluntary \n     standards, practices, and technologies in order to enhance \n     the state of computer security in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/30/senate-section/article/S10128-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL MAMMOGRAPHY DAY\n\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 416, which was \nreceived from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 416) commending the \n     Barter Theatre on the occasion of its 75th anniversary.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a resolution \nhonoring a longstanding landmark of Virginia's southwest, Barter \nTheatre. Located in Abingdon, VA, Barter Theatre first opened in June \nof 1933 and remains open to this day, having never closed its doors in \nits 75 years of history.\n  The roots of Barter Theatre are found in what it calls ``a unique \nbeginning,'' during a time in our Nation's history when many Americans, \nincluding Virginians, were focused on financial woes. It was the Great \nDepression, and a young man named Robert Porterfield was inspired by \nproviding theater tickets to the many and not just to those who could \nafford them. It was the idea of bartering goods for services that \nserved as the foundation for this successful endeavor and earned \nPorterfield's theater its name.\n  By trading goods for theater tickets, Porterfield was able to fill \nthe seats of his theater. The price of admission was 40 cents, but if \nyou had no money to spare, you could bring the equivalent in produce. \nWhether it was vegetables, dairy products, or a chicken, if it was \nworth 40 cents, it was worth entrance. The idea of bartering goods for \nservices is by no means a unique idea, but it is an idea that allowed \nmany Virginians the opportunity to enjoy the arts. The idea of trading \n``ham for Hamlet,'' as Barter Theatre calls it, was a success, a \nsuccess that allowed the theater to endure to today.\n  In 1946, the Virginia General Assembly designated Barter Theatre as \nthe State Theatre of Virginia, the first theater in the Commonwealth of \nVirginia to receive this distinction, and rightly so. The excellence of \nBarter reaches far beyond the lengthy list of famous actors who have \ngraced its stage throughout its years and touches more on its efforts \nto enrich and enhance the culture of our Commonwealth.\n  The impact of this historic theater does not go unnoticed in \nsouthwest Virginia, as it has continually aimed to increase levels of \nartistic development in the region. Each year, Barter Theatre's \nAppalachian Festival of Plays and Playwrights showcases and honors \nAppalachian history and culture for all to see upon its stage. I also \nwant to recognize the efforts of Barter Theatre as they continue \neducational outreach programs to Virginia's youth. Several programs, \nsuch as the Young Playwrights Festival, the Internet Distance Learning \nProgram, the Student Matinee Program, and the theatre's touring \ncompany, are in place and continue to foster creativity through \nplaywrighting and theatrical performances.\n  I must note that Barter Theatre remains true to its humble beginnings \nand pays homage to its history. At least one performance a year \ncelebrates the Barter heritage by accepting donations for an area food \nbank as the price of admission. An endeavor rooted in the ideals of \ncommunity continues to give back to that community today.\n  I am pleased by the passage of H. Con. Res. 416, and I thank my \ncolleagues in joining me in support of this resolution.\n  Mr. WEBB. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the resolution be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I come today to talk about the subject that \nis on the minds of people all over America--certainly it is on the \nminds of my friends in Missouri--and that is the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act of 2008.\n  Yesterday afternoon, the House of Representatives voted on this \nimportant bill. Unfortunately, the bill failed to gain sufficient \nsupport on the floor despite strong leadership from both the Democratic \nand Republican Parties. The negative outcome of the House vote is \ndisappointing, and clearly the financial markets registered their \ndispleasure. I was further disappointed by finger-pointing that \noccurred after the vote. But I am heartened that everyone realizes the \nfinancial credit crisis is still with us and that Congress needs to get \nits job done.\n  We must get our job done. We will get it done. We owe it to our \nconstituents, our communities, our economy, and our country. That \nmeans, first, no more finger-pointing, no more political blame games. \nThose we have to put off the table. We need to stop the bleeding. Right \nnow, there is a fire raging. To mix the metaphors, we need to stem the \nflow of the bleeding or put out the fire. The institutions are asking \nfor our help to come to this immediate rescue. Beyond that, we need to \ntake a broad view of the needed changes in our regulatory system. There \nare mistakes and omissions. There is lots of blame to go around. There \nare lots of areas where Congress acted or did not act, the \nadministration acted or did not act, and the agencies did not do the \nproper work.\n  As a 22-year housing authorizer and appropriator, I have some strong \nviews as to what needs to be done, and I have offered those on the \nfloor, citing a letter I sent to the Secretary of the Treasury, the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the leadership of the \nbanking committees in both Houses. I would only amend that today to say \nwe need, either in this bill or--probably in this bill--we need to \nraise the limit of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance \nso that individuals, farmers, small businesses that may in the course \nof their business operation have more than $100,000 do not pull it out \nof the banks, thus endangering the capitalization of the banks. We want \nthose people who are the lifeblood of our economy to be able to keep it \nin their local banks, the regional banks, the community banks, and not \ndraw it out and put it in Treasurys.\n  I heard today from a broker in Missouri who has been asked by small \nbusinesses if they can take their deposits out and put them in \nTreasurys. That may be a safe move, but right now that means they are \ngoing to reduce the deposits in that bank, which further puts pressure \non banks, other institutions, that should not be any part of this \nproblem.\n  Now, Americans are angry about the prospect of using their tax \ndollars to fix Wall Street's problems. I, like many other Members of \nCongress, share that anger. I do not want to be doing this. I do not \nwant to be supporting this. But what I really care about is protecting \nMain Street: the individuals, the families, the businesses, the \nfarmers. We must act to prevent workers from missing paychecks, small \nbusinesses from failing, college savings plans and retirements put in \njeopardy.\n  This plan includes the transparency I called for when I spoke on this \nfloor exactly a week ago. I was not satisfied with the Treasury plan. I \nsaid we must do something, but we must add three things: \naccountability, increased oversight, and increased transparency. Well, \nI called on my House and Senate colleagues to come together in a \nbipartisan fashion and work with the administration and other public \nand private sector experts to move quickly and boldly but responsibly \nto prevent another financial credit disaster. The leadership and \nnegotiators from both sides did just that.\n\n  It has been just 12 days since the Treasury Secretary and the Federal \nReserve Chairman approached Congress about the need to act on this \ncrisis. They said we must take temporary emergency action to get us \nthrough this financial crisis--the biggest financial crisis we have \nfaced in a long time. As at least one commentator said, we are facing a \nfinancial ``stone age.''\n  This crisis is real. This is a rare moment. This is an emergency. The \ncredit markets have been struggling mightily for the past several weeks \ndue to the subprime housing crisis and falling home values. Despite \nunprecedented intervention by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury, the \ncredit market got worse. I commend those institutions for doing what \nthey did, but that is not enough. They don't have enough tools in their \ntoolbox. Clearly, it is time for a comprehensive and systematic \napproach in order to restore stability to the credit markets to make \nsure that all of us, and the entire wheels of the Nation, can have the \ncredit we need to move.\n  It is much more than about Wall Street; it is about average American \nfamilies, individuals, small businesses, and farmers. Average American \nfamilies are outraged at what is happening in the financial markets. \nThey see excessive greed at the heart of the problem. They do not \nunderstand how many corporate executives make more in a day than many \nof them do in a year. They do not understand how some rich corporate \nexecutives can be paid to leave their company, given a golden parachute \nfor failing at their job, not doing it and leaving their company in \nshambles. The folks in Missouri are also afraid this crisis will make \nthem victims. They will be victims if we do not put the taxpayer \ncredit, the Treasury credit on the line. It has brought down the rich \nand powerful. It should not bring down Main Street. That is what we are \nworried about.\n  Back in my home State of Missouri, I heard from seniors who were \nasking me about their retirement accounts, parents worried about their \nchildren's college savings, families worried about their checking and \nsavings accounts, farmers worried about where their credit lines will \nbe and whether they will be able to get operating loans so they can go \ninto the fields next spring to plant, small business owners and \nhomeowners worried about their mortgages. Folks are worried about their \njobs, their children's future, and their financial security. There is \nalso a lot of anger, frustration, and disgust at why we have gotten to \nthis point.\n  I have heard those feelings loudly and clearly. I share those \nfeelings. As I said before, frankly, I don't want to be here--not as a \nSenator, not as a Missourian, not as an American, and not as a family \nman. But I believe this is something we have to do. We have no choice \nbut to act. We must act because the financial well-being and health of \nall Americans and our economy is in jeopardy.\n  However, we must act responsibly. That is why I demanded increased \naccountability, strong oversight, and more transparency so that the \ntaxpayers, communities, small businesses, farmers, and our financial \nsystem are never put in this position again. This doesn't mean we are \ngiving a blank check to the Treasury; this means just not bailing out \nthose who made bad decisions with no consequences. This is one of the \npoints I got 5,000 calls about last week. Almost 4,999 of them objected \nspecifically to golden parachutes and to excessive compensation for top \ncorporate executives. Well, the compromise that the negotiators worked \nout dealt with those. This also means and the negotiators came up with \na system to ensure strong balances so that taxpayer funds are protected \nwhile achieving the goal of preventing a financial meltdown. This bill \nincorporates those measures.\n  This bill increases accountability by giving the Treasury Secretary \nspecific powers to reduce executive compensation and cut golden \nparachutes. This bill increases taxpayers' protections by giving \ntaxpayers an ownership interest in the firms they are helping to bail \nout.\n\n[[Page S10132]]\n\n  In addition, we expect the Treasury to do the analysis and to work \nwithin the market system to buy mortgages and other debts that are now \nat fire-sale prices below the prices those mortgages or other debt \nwould sell for when the credit markets begin to function once again. \nThat is the first level of protection. The first level of protection is \nto make sure Treasury has the power to put liquidity back into the \nsystem by buying this now fire-sale property at a reasonable price, but \none at which the Treasury can later recover, and at the same time \ntaking this bad debt off the books of the companies. They will be \ncrippled by selling it below what they bought it for, but they will \nhave liquidity again.\n  The bill provides stronger oversight by creating a special inspector \ngeneral. It will empower our U.S. Government Accountability Office to \nconduct ongoing audits and reviews of the program. It creates a new \noversight panel of executive officials such as the Federal Reserve \nChairman, and it sets up a special congressional oversight panel. This \nbill provides more transparency by requiring the Treasury to disclose \npublicly all transactions made under the bill.\n  These are very positive improvements in the bill.\n  Let me be clear. I would not vote in support of any bill simply to \nbail out irresponsible, incompetent, and greedy bankers--whether they \nare Wall Street or elsewhere--or investors. I will vote in support of a \nbill that protects the average Missourian, the average American family, \nthe individuals, the communities, the small businesses, and the \nfarmers. This is about doing what is right, not necessarily popular--\nand popular this is not.\n  Without a bill of these elements, the Federal Government will \ncontinue to use existing authorities with taxpayer funds to rescue \nfinancial institutions. That is why we need a bill that provides \ntaxpayer protection, accountability, transparency, and oversight, in a \nsystematic, controlled manner. In other words, with or without this \nbill, taxpayers will be on the hook. They will be asked to chip in. The \nproblem is now, when we have tried--or as the Treasury and the FDIC \nhave done and the Federal Reserve has done--to rescue firm by firm, we \nare putting more money at risk, but we are not solving the basic credit \nproblem. The credit illiquidity is still there.\n  Last week, I talked with a friend who deals in municipal bonds. Those \nare the bonds State and local governments offer. They are the ones that \nfinance the ongoing operations of States and of cities, of counties, of \nrevenue districts, of special districts. She told me the market was \ntotally frozen. They can't go to the market.\n  Continuing to just let the system go downhill and provide rescues for \nindividual banks that may get into problems is not going to solve the \nliquidity problem--liquidity problems faced by businesses that have to \nmeet their payroll, liquidity problems which would face farmers who try \nto get operating loans, liquidity problems that would face the average \nfamily if they want to get a loan to buy a house or a car. They can't \nget it.\n  This measure we are talking about is protecting savings, retirement \naccounts, and investments of Missouri families and American families. \nIt is about making sure no Missouri worker misses a paycheck. To me, it \nis about Missouri businesses, small and large, not going under. To me, \nthis is about helping struggling homeowners in default so they can get \ntheir mortgages reworked. To me, this is about Missourians getting car \nloans, home loans, and student loans. In summary, I believe it is what \nis best for my Missouri constituents.\n  It is imperative that we continue to work on this bill and consider \nother ideas to improve it. As I mentioned earlier, now both \nPresidential candidates back a proposal to increase the current Federal \ndeposit insurance guarantee level from $100,000 to $250,000. That is a \nvery good idea. I urge my colleagues to consider this proposal. \nFrankly, I think, at least for the time being, we ought to up that \nlimit, but we need to do it soon, and we need to do it responsibly so \nthere will not be a silent, backdoor run on banks and small businesses \nthat have needs for large amounts of operating cash don't take all \ntheir money out of the small banks they work with and leave those banks \nin a perilous condition.\n\n  We need to pull together and do what each of us individually can do \nto address the crisis. This also means troubled homeowners must seek \nassistance in avoiding foreclosure. Help is available through home \nownership counseling. It is available due to funding I was proud to \nwork on with my colleague, Senator Dodd, to provide last year. We \nprovided $180 million. Based on the preliminary data we saw from one \norganization counseling homeowners, 69 percent of those who received \nthat counseling were able to avoid foreclosure. That counseling is \navailable now. The program is working. But we need troubled homeowners \nto contact their counseling agency before they get into foreclosure. \nContact them if you are having problems. Call the HOPE hotline: 888-\n995-HOPE. Again: 888-995-HOPE. A lot of the problem can be solved for \nhomeowners if they get counseling.\n  Before closing, let me express my appreciation to the House and \nSenate leadership and lead negotiators and their staff for the hard \nwork and long hours they have put in over the past week to pass the \ngreatly improved proposal, originally coming from the Treasury. I thank \nespecially Senators Dodd and Gregg for representing and leading the \nSenate in the negotiations. I am proud of my good friend and Missouri \nconstituent Roy Blunt for his work, along with Chairman Frank in the \nHouse. Their work is not in vain. I expect we will finish the job--I \nhope this week. We have to do it. There is too much at stake not to do \nthe job and do it well.\n\n\n                          Tribute to Senators\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in saying goodbye, thank \nyou, and best wishes to good friends leaving the Senate, especially a \ncouple of Senators with long and distinguished service. One of those, \nwho has been a hero of mine for a long time and has become a good \nfriend, is John Warner. He is a Member in the Senate well known for his \npatriotism, for his long service to both his State and his Nation, and \nperhaps more than any other Member of the Senate, he is known for being \na gentleman in the true meaning of the word. I would say he is a \nSenator to whom we can all look up. I did when I arrived, and from the \nbeginning I learned a great deal.\n  Now, as a fellow UVA Law grad, my good friend, the squire from \nVirginia, John Warner, who is retiring after 30 years of service, has \nleft an indelible mark on this body. We will miss as much, though, the \npresence of his wonderful wife Jeanne. I think all of us in the Senate, \nat Senate gatherings, at Senate family affairs, know how much Jeanne \nadds to our family. She is truly a wonderful lady. She has cleaned up \nthe squire a good bit. My wife Linda and I always enjoy and look \nforward to seeing Jeanne and John after their service in the Senate \nbecause they are good friends.\n  Not only do John and I share the UVA Law connections, but he and I \nwere on a panel at his school, St. Albans, along with several other \ndistinguished Members of the Senate, and we had the opportunity to go \nback to the school that he had attended and my son attended.\n  Let me go back to what John Warner has done in his impressive 32 \nyears in the Senate. His service to the country began long before he \nwas elected to this body in 1978. At age 17, John chose not to go back \nto St. Albans immediately but first chose to serve his country, \nenlisting in the U.S. Navy to help keep our Nation safe from Nazi \nGermany.\n  He, again, answered his Nation's call to service at the outbreak of \nthe Korean war, when he served in the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  Since his service in our Armed Forces, John has been a tireless \nadvocate for our military and for our veterans. For the soldier \nreturning home after service, John has worked to improve the care our \nveterans receive, the care a grateful nation owes each and every one of \nour brave volunteers.\n  As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, as vice chairman, as a \nranking member, as a leader in the Armed Services Committee, John has \nworked to ensure that the military, particularly our troops on the \nfield in battle, have the equipment and the resources they need.\n\n[[Page S10133]]\n\n  Under John's watch, the Senate always passed a Defense authorization \nbill, a feat that is not only achievable because of John's skill but \nbecause of the respect he has for Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  John used this legislation year after year to modernize our military \nto make sure they meet 21st century needs. In this way and all others, \nJohn embodies the motto of his esteemed undergraduate Virginia school, \nWashington and Lee, which is ``Not Unmindful of the Future.''\n  John has always kept that responsibility to the future in mind as he \nhas worked to keep our fighting forces the best in the world.\n  But he has also done much in other areas. It has been my pleasure to \nwork with him on the Environment and Public Works Committee. He was an \ninvaluable leader, from whom I learned much. He was a great friend in \npassing the highway bill in 1998. I followed his work later on while \nworking on the current highway bill. I owe a great deal to the skill, \nto the advice, and the leadership he provided in making sure we could \nmeet the needs of our highways and our bridges. His guidance and \nleadership were extremely vital for the success of the bill I worked \non. He has also kept his responsibility of the future in mind during \nhis tenure on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  It has been an honor, a pleasure, and a treat to fight side by side \nwith John on the Intelligence Committee. He has always been looking to \nthe future, to all our futures. He worked on the committee to help us \nprevent another devastating attack on our soil such as 9/11.\n  John was an invaluable ally on the committee in our efforts to reform \nand oversee our intelligence operations. Probably the most important to \nme, with John's help, we passed probably the most important legislation \nI have had the opportunity to lead--the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act--to assure we had an early warning system against \nterrorist attacks.\n  Because of John's work in the Senate, his heart on the battlefield, \nour Nation is not only a safer place but, under his guidance, wisdom, \nand leadership, it has become a much better place.\n  It has been a tremendous honor and privilege to serve with John \nWarner. He is an icon of the Senate. He will be missed for his ability \nto work across the aisle, for putting his country first, and for the \nfriendship, personally, the friendship with Jeanne, his wife, and the \nrest of us. I join my colleagues in congratulating the Senator and his \nwife and thanking John for his many years of service.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday's House vote has come and \ngone, but the threat to our economy has not. Congress must still act \nswiftly and decisively to protect millions of ordinary Americans from a \ncredit crisis that they had no hand whatsoever in causing but which \nobviously threatens to reach into every single household in our \ncountry.\n  Retirees are worried about their savings. Small business owners are \npanicked because the banks will not lend. Homeowners are watching the \nequity they have in their houses dry up.\n  I am hearing from towns and municipalities throughout Kentucky that \ncannot find the money to finance new schools and other civic projects \nand from farmers and small business owners who are suddenly being told \nby their banks that a long-term loan is due. Others are being pressured \nto pay more or well ahead of schedule. These are people with good \ncredit.\n  I am hearing from people such as the retired school counselor in \nAnderson County who said she cannot afford to see her small retirement \nsavings vanish. ``I have never written to any Senator or Congressman \nbefore now,'' she wrote. ``This is so important to our Government and \nits citizens.''\n  One small business owner wrote me about a company he started in his \ngarage that now employs 100 people. He said that because of the credit \ncrisis, the interest rate he is paying on his building jumped 400 \npercent. Speaking on behalf of all small business owners in his \ncommunity, he had a simple message: ``Kentuckians need help now.''\n  Here is what a woman from central Kentucky wrote to me about the \nfinancial rescue plan the House of Representatives rejected yesterday. \nShe said:\n\n       I hope you will not lose sight of the vast numbers of \n     innocent Americans who work tirelessly to create a better \n     future for our children and fellow Americans, who could be \n     financially wrecked by plummeting U.S. and overseas markets.\n\n  If the rescue plan fails, this woman added, she is afraid she will \nhave to sell off part of her family's farmland.\n  The credit crisis is spreading. It has gotten too big to ignore, and \nit is too big for one party to solve on its own. Congressional leaders \nare assessing the legislative path forward, but one thing is clear: Any \nsolution will be a bipartisan solution. Both sides have to work \ntogether, and we will stay until the answer is yes.\n  There was a lot of frustration around here yesterday which led to a \nlot of accusations and blame. Today we must move forward together. The \nvoters sent us to respond to crises, not to ignore them, and if you \nfail the first time, you get back up and work with each other and you \nfigure a way to get it done.\n  We know what we need to do and we know we need to do it quickly and \nwe know that time is not the ally of millions of Americans facing a \nserious threat to their way of life. The majority leader understands \nthis, and he and I are working together to find a way to get to yes.\n  Working together is the only way to get this rescue plan passed, and \nthat is exactly what we intend to do.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the statement of the \nRepublican leader with respect to our determination to get this done. I \nthink all of us should recognize that these are extraordinary times, \nand I want to sound a warning to those who have the opinion that \nyesterday's drop in the stock market was simply a one-time correction; \nthat the stock market is coming back today, and that the markets are \ngoing to absorb the shock of the lack of action on the part of the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I would point out that markets are driven by future expectations, and \nwhen the stock market assumed, on the basis of the vote in the House, \nthat we would not have any kind of Federal action on the financial \nrescue package, it dropped more dramatically than at any other time in \nits history in total number of points, and it dropped percentage-wise \nfor the worst drop since \n9/11.\n  Now, as there has been an expectation that the Congress will move, \nthe stock market is back up today but nowhere near back up to the point \nit was before the drop occurred yesterday. If we break the expectation \nonce again, this time the market will drop and there will be no coming \nback up. This time, your 401(k), your pension plan, your retirement \naccount will be hurt in a way that will take years to recover.\n  Let's talk about numbers to demonstrate the importance of this. One \nof the things we have heard with respect to the financial rescue plan \nis that $700 billion is far too big an amount for the taxpayers to \nabsorb. Yesterday, over 1 trillion dollars' worth of market value was \nwiped off the books by the stock market drop. We must understand that \nit is ordinary people looking at ordinary pensions with their ordinary \nMain Street kind of 401(k) plans who lost that trillion dollars, and \nthey lost it in a matter of minutes. The market plunged over 700 points \nin a matter of minutes, and 1 trillion dollars' worth of ordinary \nAmerican value was wiped out.\n  This is not a trivial event, and we should pay attention to it. As I \nsay, the stock market now believes we are going to get serious about \nthis and get\n\n[[Page S10134]]\n\nsomething passed, and so it is up today about 250 points. But that is \nonly one-third of the 777 points that were lost yesterday. We should \nnot congratulate ourselves on the 250-point rally that it has somehow \nremoved the sting of the 777-point drop that occurred yesterday.\n  We keep hearing, well, the markets will adjust and everything will be \nall right and the stock market will be OK. But let's move away from the \nstock market to where the real problem lies, which is in the credit \nmarkets. We don't have a single barometer for the credit markets the \nway we do with Dow Jones following the stock market, but we have \nindications all along the way that the credit markets throughout the \nworld have seized up; that is, banks are not loaning to banks, banks \nare not making credit available to those who have been their best \ncustomers as they wait to see how this works out. That is the place \nwhere those people who are saying this applies only to Wall Street are \ngoing to end up paying a huge price.\n  I have used this example before, but I am finding it is being \nduplicated in other States. Amidst the avalanche of phone calls into my \noffice from angry Utahns demanding that we vote against this because \nthey say this is a bailout of Wall Street, there are one or two other \nphone calls that get through. One of them came from an auto dealer. In \nthe city or town where he operates, he is the city's largest employer.\n  He called and said: Senator, I know you are getting a lot of calls on \nthe other side of this issue. Let me just point out one thing with \nrespect to my business. I am the biggest employer in this town, and I \nmay not be able to make payroll on Wednesday. The biggest employer in \ntown, and none of my employees will get checks because the bank won't \ngive me the line of credit that the bank has been making available to \nme for decades.\n  That is the implication of the seizing up of the credit markets. That \nhas nothing to do with the stock value of this particular car dealer. \nThat has to do with the paychecks that go into the pockets of the \npeople who fix the cars, who wash the cars, and who try to sell the \ncars. They are the ones who will pay the price of the inaction in the \nCongress.\n  There are those who say, well, we should restructure the regulatory \nsystem so this doesn't happen again. We shouldn't act in such a \nprecipitous fashion until we get all of these other issues on the table \nand discussed. Let's not act quickly.\n  I am perfectly willing to agree that the regulatory structure we have \nbasically going back to the 1930s is inadequate for the kind of world \nin which we now live. And I am perfectly willing to agree the \nrestructuring should be a serious one and a deep one. If you do a \nserious and deep restructuring of the way we handle credit markets in \nthis country and confer with our counterparts in other countries around \nthe world so the world structure is intelligently constructed, you are \ntalking months, if not a year or so. And while we are putting forward \nour pet theories as to how that should be done, with experts on talk \nshows and from think tanks pontificating on cable television, payrolls \nmay not be met in towns in my State.\n  This is a crisis that has to be dealt with now. We can deal with the \nrestructuring of the financial regulatory system at our leisure, but we \nmust not take our eye off the seriousness of the crisis, both in terms \nof its size and in terms of its pressure. This morning's financial \njournals make it clear that throughout many countries in the world they \nand their central banks have not yet addressed the seriousness of the \ncrisis, and we will see problems overseas begin to wash up on our \nshores to make our problem that much worse if we don't act.\n  There are those who say, well, we shouldn't give this much power to \nthe Secretary of the Treasury. I don't like the idea of one man having \nthis much authority. The proposal that has been put together creates an \noversight board with real power. It creates a board that could rein in \na Secretary of the Treasury who abused his power or who got out too far \nin front. It is my understanding that we have built-in congressional \nreview in the bill that the House defeated--congressional review, \ncongressional oversight--that could have said to a Secretary of \nTreasury: You are too far extended, and we are going to hold back on \nthe authority we have given you.\n  But we have a crisis that needs to be dealt with and needs to be \ndealt with now. We shouldn't be arguing over whether the city council \nshould second-guess the police chief as he rushes to deal with a \ncrisis, a police chief in whom the city council had confidence when \nthey chose him in the first place. This Secretary of the Treasury is \nwell known as one of the more expert money managers in the country. He \nhas been completely open in all of his discussions with members of the \nleadership of both parties, and members of the leadership of both \nparties have expressed confidence in his ability to do this. They have \ncreated the oversight board that is in the bill that will pull him back \nif he does it improperly.\n  The entire $700 billion will not be committed immediately--cannot be \ncommitted immediately. It must be handled in an orderly fashion. We \nunderstand from the Secretary that the pattern of its disbursement will \nrun at the level of about $50 billion a month. So we are not talking \nabout giving $700 billion overnight in a single check to a single man \nfor him to go out and waste. Those on the talk shows who make that \ncomment simply demonstrate they do not understand what is in the bill.\n  But the fact that the Secretary of the Treasury can say to the credit \nmarkets that are frozen: I have potentially $700 billion available to \nsolve this problem, is a very powerful message that will help solve the \nproblem. A very important part of the problem is the sense of \nconfidence that we are serious about getting it done.\n  If we say, well, we are going to give the Secretary of the Treasury \n$100 billion and see how it works, that sends a message we are not \nconfident that this will do any good. If we are going to say, well, we \nwant a board to examine every aspect of this proposal. We are not going \nto give the Secretary authority to move ahead decisively. That sends \nthe message we are not confident this will work.\n  The bill the House voted down which said the Secretary can say to the \nmarket that potentially we have $700 billion that can be applied to \nthis problem, and he has full authority to commit it, subject to review \nof the oversight board and the ultimate review of Congress, that is a \nstatement of confidence that the markets can believe.\n  Now, let me talk just briefly about where the $700 billion number \ncomes from. It is not pulled from out of the air. It is not a number \nthat somebody thought up as sounding pretty big. The total amount of \nmortgages in the United States is approximately $14 trillion, and the \npercentage of those mortgages that are bad and probably cannot pay out \nis about 5 percent. Five percent of $14 trillion is $700 billion. But \nthe assets that the $700 billion will acquire will not be all of the \nbad mortgages. The assets they will acquire will be a mixture of bad \nmortgages and good mortgages. Why? Because nobody knows which are the \nbad mortgages and which are the good mortgages. The only way we are \ngoing to find out is hold the mortgage to maturity and see which ones \nget paid and which ones don't. They are all packaged together.\n  So the Secretary, by putting 5 percent of the total amount of \nmortgages available to acquire those that are questionable is sending a \nmessage of great confidence to the market by acquiring those mortgages \nand creating a circumstance whereby once the good ones pay out, the \ntaxpayers will receive money back.\n  Indeed, there are some who say the U.S. Government will make money. I \ndon't happen to believe that it will, but I can't prove that it will \nnot, and there is certainly an indication in past history that it will.\n  If we go through the past circumstances, where the Federal Government \nhas intervened in circumstances of need, starting with the Chrysler \nloans, the Federal Government made money on the Chrysler loans.\n  Chrysler righted itself by virtue of having access to that money, \npaid interest on the loans, and the taxpayer received a financial \nbenefit for the Government having entered into the Chrysler loan \nprogram.\n  If I had been in Congress at the time, I probably would have voted \nagainst it for other reasons, but for financial reasons, it was a good \ndeal. If you look at\n\n[[Page S10135]]\n\nthe deal that has been made recently with the Federal Reserve and Bear \nStearns, the Federal Reserve stepped in with the Bear Stearns \ncircumstances. What did they do?\n  They forced the sale of Bear Stearns and then they opened the Fed \nwindow so Bear Stearns could borrow money. What happens when you borrow \nmoney? You pay interest. By making sure Bear Stearns did not go down, \nthe Federal Reserve guaranteed that Bear Stearns will be able to pay \nthe interest on the money that is made available to them. Who gets that \ninterest when it is paid? The American taxpayer.\n  It will be paid into the Federal Reserve account. When the Federal \nReserve makes money, their surplus gets paid to the American taxpayer. \nThe American taxpayer will receive a benefit, a financial benefit, from \nthe deal that was made by the Federal Reserve and Bear Stearns. The \nsame will be true with AIG, the insurance giant. They will be paying \ninterest on the money that has been made available to them on a loan \nbasis, and the taxpayer will receive that interest.\n  So for those who are out there adding up the face value of every deal \nwe have made and then adding it to the $700 billion and then telling us \nall that it is gone and there will never be any of it coming back to \nthe Treasury, they are wrong. They are misleading the American people \nwith that kind of talk. Frankly, it is those commentators who are \nadding up those numbers irresponsibly, who are driving the angry phone \ncalls that are coming into my office and the office of everyone else \nhere.\n  Now, I understand their anger. I am sympathetic with their anger. I \nam as disappointed as anybody that we allowed this situation to get to \nwhere it is. But I say to those who are angry: Let's leave it up to the \nhistorians to sort out where the blame should go. Let's put out the \nfire right now. Let's not spend our time as the fire is burning running \naround trying to find out who the arsonist may have been, while the \nfire destroys the building. Let's free up the credit markets right now. \nLet's send a signal of confidence to the world markets right now. We \nshould have done it on Monday in the House of Representatives. We did \nnot.\n  Negotiations are now going on between the leaders of both Houses and \nthe leaders of both parties to try to find some new program that might \npass. Once we do, we will get another vote. The Republican leader has \nmade that very clear. The majority leader has made that clear. We are \nnot leaving town until we get another vote.\n  That is why the stock market is as encouraging as it is. But we must \nunderstand, if we do not act, the lack of confidence will produce a \nworldwide wave of credit seizing up, and it will be the small \nbusinesses, it will be the 401(k) plans, it will be the pension \nprograms for teachers and nurses and others who are depending upon \nthose plans for their retirement that will pay the price.\n  Some will feel very virtuous about having voted against Wall Street \nand then turn around and find that their constituents generally have \npaid a huge price for that vote. The stock market took over $1 trillion \nworth of value out of the American economy in a matter of minutes on \nMonday afternoon. We must do everything we can to make sure that does \nnot turn into $2 trillion, $3 trillion or $4 trillion wiped away \nbecause the Congress was not willing to stand up to its \nresponsibilities.\n  I have faith that ultimately we will. I have faith that the Members \nof the House and the Members of the Senate will ultimately recognize \ntheir responsibility and do the right thing.\n  I go back to a quote by Winston Churchill, who commented on \nAmericans, generally. He said:\n\n       The Americans can always be depended upon to do the right \n     thing after they have exhausted every other possibility.\n\n  Monday we exhausted our every other possibility. It is time to do the \nright thing. We in this body, as well as those in the other body, need \nto rise to the occasion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Taxes\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, beginning in the third week of July, I \nhave come to the floor quite often to compare the tax plans of Senator \nMcCain and Senator Obama, our two Presidential candidates. I have \ntalked about the relationship between party control and the likelihood \nof tax hikes or tax cuts. I have used the infamous thermometer chart to \ndemonstrate. I am not going to go through all of it again because I \nhave talked about it several times on the floor of the Senate.\n  But up on the top, you can see that when a Democratic President \ncontrols the White House and the Congress at the same time, you had the \nbiggest tax increase. And then, if you come down through there, you \nfind in various phases you have more or less tax decreases or tax \nincreases, and you have the most tax decreases when you have a \nRepublican President and a Republican Congress.\n  Now, that is over the last 28 years, approximately. In another speech \nI talked about the 1992 campaign promise of the middle-class tax cut. I \ncontrasted the promised tax cut with the 1993 tax legislation that \ncontained a world record price increase. I have used this chart that is \ngoing up there now to depict what it would look like with 16 years of \ntax hike amnesia and Rip Van Winkle.\n  In our first week back after the August recess, I returned to these \ntopics and I discussed the effects of the proposed 17- to 33-percent \nincrease in the top two rates. I focused on small business activity and \nhow increased taxes hurt that small business activity and hurt the job \ncreation machine of our great economy, which is small business.\n  Last week, I discussed the impact of Senator McCain's and Obama's tax \nplans on seniors. Earlier this week, I discussed the fiscal effects of \nSenator McCain and Senator Obama's plans. Today, I focus on how both \ntax plans would affect the middle class. The press and the candidates \nhave focused a lot of attention on the middle class. In fact, I \nremember a speech of Senator Obama's alluding to something about he \nnever heard Senator McCain in the debate last week say anything about \nthe middle class.\n  Well, Senator McCain is not comfortable in the class war-type \nrhetoric that some people are comfortable using, and he talks about the \nmiddle class a lot when he talks about small business and working men \nand women. So we have heard a lot about the middle class. So I wish to \nconcentrate on that.\n  My discussion today will focus on tax policy. But to get a handle on \nwhat is and is not middle-class relief, we need to see if we can define \nthe term ``middle class.'' Today I think we need to get answers to \nseveral questions as we try to get to the bottom line of where Senators \nMcCain and Obama are on middle-class tax relief.\n  The first question would be: What is the definition of ``middle \nclass''? To get at this question, we need to see what the two \ncandidates say about who is in the middle class and how their plan \ndefines the middle class.\n  The second question would be: Where are Senators McCain and Obama on \nthe current law of middle-class tax relief that is set to expire. I am \nreferring to the family tax relief provisions that expire at the \nbeginning of 2011 and the alternative minimum tax fix.\n  To get to that question, we need to look at where each candidate's \nrecord has been on bipartisan tax relief. We also need to look at what \nthey plan to do with these expiring tax relief provisions, which means \nwhen the tax laws of 2001 and 2003 sunset December 31, 2010.\n  The third broad question is: Where would Senator McCain and Senator \nObama further reduce or hike taxes on middle-class families? To get an \nanswer to this question we will take a look at each of the candidate's \nnew proposals for middle-class tax cuts.\n  If you turn to factcheck.org, you will find the definition is not \nsimple about what is a middle class. According to factcheck.org, there \nis no clear definition of middle class. Here is what they say there:\n\n       Middle class means different things to different people and \n     politicians. There is no standard definition, and, in fact, \n     an overwhelming majority of Americans say they are middle \n     class or upper middle class or\n\n[[Page S10136]]\n\n     working class in public opinion polls. Hardly anyone \n     considers themselves lower class or upper class in America.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this material printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have a chart that breaks down the answers to a Pugh \nResearch Center poll. Among other questions, the poll asks whether \nfolks thought of themselves as upper class, upper middle class, middle \nclass, lower middle class, and lower class. In other words, basically \ndividing the country into different quintiles.\n  According to the poll, 53 percent of Americans considered themselves \nmiddle class, 19 percent consider themselves upper middle class, and 19 \npercent consider themselves lower middle class. So you have this \noutstandingly high percentage of 92 percent of Americans who consider \nthemselves something other than upper class or lower class.\n  Since we are examining Senator McCain's and Senator Obama's tax \nplans, it is fair to ask about their definition of middle class.\n  On August 16 of this year, Senator McCain appeared on Pastor Rick \nWarren's forum at Saddleback Church in Albuquerque, NM. Pastor Warren \nasked Senator McCain to draw a line, in tax relief dollar terms, \nbetween the middle class and the rich. Senator McCain's answer reflects \nthe ambiguity of the factcheck.org definition. I quote Senator McCain:\n\n       I think the rich should be defined by a home, a good job, \n     an education and the ability to hand our children a more \n     prosperous and safer world than the one we inherited.\n       So if you're just talking about income--\n\n  Then on television there was kind of a laugh and smile at that \npoint--\n\n     how about $5 million? No, but seriously, I don't think you \n     can. I don't think seriously that the point is I'm trying to \n     make, seriously, and I'm sure that comment will be distorted \n     but the point is . . . that we want to keep people's taxes \n     low, and increase revenues. . . . So it doesn't really matter \n     what my definition of rich is because I don't want to raise \n     anyone's taxes. I really don't.\n\n  How does Senator Obama define the middle class? In an interview with \nFox News of Bill Hemmer, Senator Obama answered the question this way:\n\n       You know, what I would say is, if you are making more than \n     $250,000, then you're more than middle class. You're doing \n     better. If you are making less than $250,000, then you are \n     definitely somewhere in the middle class. And if you're \n     making $150,000 or less, then I would think most Americans \n     would agree you're middle class. So that's why the fact that \n     you are making less than $250,000, you will not see your \n     taxes go up under an Obama administration. And you will see \n     tax cuts with more money in your pocket, if you are making \n     less than $150,000.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Bill Hemmer \ninterview.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Obama Defines ``Middle Class''\n\n                           (By Major Garrett)\n\n       Washington.--I wanted to throw out for consideration and \n     debate a question I've found myself asking Democrats, \n     Republicans, Independents and economists for years: who is in \n     the middle class?\n       In the 1990s, the answers I received were almost entirely \n     linked to income figures--the income of a family of four, or \n     three or of a single person in his or her twenties, or an \n     elderly person on a fixed income determined how close or how \n     far they were from ``middle class'' status.\n       About the time of millennium, I began to notice that the \n     answer to who was ``middle class'' began to change from \n     relatively precise figures to very broad income strata. It \n     was as if politicians--particularly at the national level--\n     began to believe that incomes varied as widely as the core \n     cost of living. Therefore, an income designation, for \n     example, linked to the U.S. Census Bureau definition of \n     median or mean income for an individual or family, would no \n     longer work as a means of defining with precision who was or \n     was not middle class.\n       In other words, individuals or families in New York, Los \n     Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston or other high-cost \n     urban areas could earn three times the median or mean family \n     income and still feel strapped by month-to-month costs.\n       In other words, middle class status seemed over time to be \n     less rooted in specific income figures, but regional \n     differences in income and cost-of-living. It also seemed to \n     reflect a sense among politicians and some economists that \n     ``middle class'' is not just a matter of figures, but also a \n     state of mind.\n       At my suggestion, my colleague Bill Hemmer was kind of \n     enough to ask Sen. Barack Obama in London how he defined the \n     middle class.\n       Here is the transcript of that exchange:\n       HEMMER: You mentioned the economy. You travel back to the \n     U.S. this weekend. You're going back to a country with a \n     limping economy, ``ailing,'' I think, is one of the words The \n     Economist used at the end of last week.\n       You have suggested that taxes will be raised on some \n     Americans. You have also suggested that taxes will be lowered \n     for some Americans. In a limping or an ailing economy, why \n     raise taxes on anyone?\n       OBAMA: Well, the--because we also have a $400 billion or so \n     budget deficit, because we've also got to invest in \n     infrastructure. We've got to deal with the fact that a lot \n     more people are unemployed and are going to need unemployment \n     benefits. We've got to shore up the housing market because \n     people are experiencing foreclosures.\n       And that's why I've structured a change in the tax code \n     where if you are making $150,000 a year or less, you're \n     getting a tax cut, 95 percent of the American families will \n     get a tax cut.\n       HEMMER: What do you consider . . .\n       OBAMA: And the people who are going to see their income \n     taxes raised, go up, are making more than $250,000 a year. So \n     you and I will pay a little bit more in taxes because we can \n     afford it. And what that allows us to do is to help the vast \n     majority of Americans who are really hurting in this economy.\n       HEMMER: I know we're pushed for time. Can you give me a \n     definition of the middle class based on income, within a \n     range?\n       OBAMA: You know, what I would say is, if you are making \n     more than $250,000, then you're more than middle class. \n     You're doing better. If you are making less than $250,000, \n     then you are definitely somewhere in the middle class.\n       And if you're making $150,000 or less, then I think most \n     Americans would agree that you're middle class. So that's why \n     the fact that if you are making less than $250,000, you will \n     not see your taxes go up under an Obama administration. And \n     you will get tax cuts and more money in your pocket if you \n     make less $150,000.\n       I think that's the right way to promote the kind of bottom-\n     up economic growth that's going to make a difference in \n     people's lives.\n       Here is how the government tabulates two different types of \n     mid-point incomes in America. The Census Bureau calculates \n     median income (the precise mid-point between all tabulated \n     incomes) and the mean income (the average of all the \n     tabulated incomes) of families and individuals. The figures \n     below are for families and individuals for 2006.\n       Income of family households in U.S. in 2006 (most recent \n     year available)Median: $59,894 Mean: $77,315\n       (Source: Census Bureau: Income, Poverty, and Health \n     Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006, http://\nwww.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/p60-233.pdf and Current \n     Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) \n     Supplement, http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032007/faminc/\nnew07_000.htm)\n       Income of all households in U.S. in 2006 (most recent year \n     available)Median: $48,201 Mean: $66,570\n       (Source: Census Bureau: Income, Poverty, and Health \n     Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006, http://\nwww.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/p60-233.pdf and Current \n     Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) \n     Supplement, http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032007/hhinc/\nnew06_000.htm)\n       So, the question I set before those of you who wish to \n     discuss and debate are these: what is the middle class; are \n     you in the middle class; have you always been there and do \n     you ever imagine you live better than ``middle class''; and \n     to what extent does your conception of ``middle class'' \n     affect your view on how high taxes should be which income \n     category.\n       Let the discussion and debate begin.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Senator McCain doesn't adopt a sharp line definition of \nmiddle class. Senator Obama defines middle class as everyone below \n$150,000. Senator Obama defines as a neutral area those earning between \n$150,000 and $250,000. Senator Obama defines families earning above \n$250,000 as upper class.\n  Now that we have the stated definitions of middle class, let's take a \nlook at where Senators McCain and Obama would change the current family \ntax rate. If you take a look at Senator McCain's plan, you can get a \nhandle of where he wants to cut middle-class taxes. In effect, you can \nget an idea of where Senator McCain believes further middle-class tax \nrelief ought to go. Senator McCain would lower current law levels of \ntaxation in two widely applicable proposals. The first would double the \ndependent personal exemption for a family of four. This relief would \napply to taxpayers with incomes up to $120,000. This new tax relief \nwould be phased out for those families between $50,000 and $120,000. I \nhave a chart that shows which groups of families would be affected by \nSenator McCain's tax proposal. It is called the regular tax, between \n$32,000 and $132,000, by increasing the dependent personal exemption \nfrom $3,500 to $7,000.\n\n[[Page S10137]]\n\n  The other area of family tax relief that Senator McCain is targeting \nis relief from the alternative minimum tax. During the last couple of \nweeks, the House and Senate have debated AMT extension bills. Take a \nlook at the Congressional Record and examine the debate. If you do, you \nwill see nearly all the Democrats and most Republicans in both bodies \ndescribe the overreach of the alternative minimum tax as a middle-class \nfamily tax problem. If the AMT patch is almost universally defined as \nmiddle-class tax relief, then a fair question is: Who benefits from \nthis fix?\n  I have a chart that shows this. The chart refers to a Joint Committee \non Taxation analysis of the last fix that became law, meaning the 2007 \nalternative minimum tax fix. You can see how it affected people in \ndifferent categories. You will see from the chart that the AMT patch \nbenefited families between $40,000 and $50,000 on the low end. And as \nwe travel across the chart, you will see the biggest category of \nfamilies benefiting to be in the $75,000 to $100,000 category and the \n$100,000 to $200,000 category. Roughly half the families benefiting, \nover 9 million, earned between $100,000 and $200,00. On the higher end, \nwe find about half a million families earning between $200,000 and \n$500,000 also benefited from making sure that the alternative minimum \ntax doesn't hit middle-income people, a group of people who could be \nhit if Congress didn't fix it from year to year so that they didn't get \nhit. This year that number is 23 million people who would get hit if \nthe Senate hadn't passed the bill we did last week.\n  The AMT patch relief conforms to polling data on how Americans define \nthemselves. The AMT patch problem that the patch remedies spreads \nacross a broad swath of American taxpayers, as we saw from the chart.\n  Senator McCain's second major tax relief proposal would build upon \nthe alternative minimum tax fix. Senator McCain would extend the \nalternative minimum tax fix and enlarge it, starting in the year 2013. \nUnder Senator McCain's plan, we would start to reduce the reach of the \nalternative minimum tax by expanding the patch by 5 percent per year on \ntop of the increase in exemption amount of the patch for inflation. \nThat proposal would provide more relief to some of the 4 million \nfamilies currently paying the alternative minimum tax.\n  If we step back and take a look, we see that Senator McCain would \nfurther reduce regular taxes for families between $32,000 and $120,000. \nAgain, we have up the same chart. Senator McCain would extend the AMT \npatch and gradually enhance it, and most of the families who would \nbenefit from the AMT patch have incomes between $50,000 on the low end \nand $200,000 on the high. So it looks as if Senator McCain's \noperational definition of middle class probably conforms to the \ndefinition that we find in public opinion polls.\n  Senator Obama's stated definition of the middle class, in terms of \nfurther tax relief, consists of taxpayers earning under $150,000. Let's \ntake a look at how his plan would operate. Senator Obama used a \ndifferent definition of middle class in contrasting his tax relief plan \nwith that of Senator McCain. Here is what Senator Obama's campaign \nsaid:\n\n       According to the Tax Policy Center, the Obama plan provides \n     three times as much tax relief for middle-class families as \n     the McCain plan.\n\n  Behind that claim is a comparison of the Tax Policy Center analysis \nof Senators McCain's and Obama's plans, proposals on families in the \nmiddle-income quintile. The middle-income quintile refers to the middle \n20 percent of all families in America. According to the Tax Policy \nCenter, that band of income runs between $37,596 and $66,354. I have a \nchart that depicts the band of income that would represent that middle \nincome. We would point here to Senator Obama's tax relief down there, \nthe light blue, between $37,000 and the $66,000 figures. As we can see, \nthis is a much smaller group, 20 percent of the population topping out \na bit above $66,000 a year income. That is far below the $150,000 and \n$250,000 figures Senator Obama mentioned in the Fox News interview I \nplaced in the Record.\n  On the AMT patch, Senator Obama supports his words ``fiscally \nresponsible'' AMT reform, whatever that vague concept means. Unlike \nSenator McCain, Senator Obama conditions extension of the AMT patch on \nhis notion of ``fiscal responsibility.'' The Tax Policy Center assumes \nthat this means that Senator Obama would extend the AMT patch and index \nit for inflation. However, this is just one think tank's interpretation \nof Senator Obama's statement that he supports fiscally responsible AMT \nreform. But for the sake of comparison, at least until 2013, the two \ncandidates seem to be targeting the same middle-class family \npopulation. I depicted that band of middle-class tax relief on the \nchart, as we can see.\n  When we look at how both plans operate, Senator McCain's plan targets \nnew regular family tax relief at middle-class families between $32,000 \nand $120,000. Senator Obama targets new regular family tax relief at \nmiddle-class families between $38,000 and $66,000. Both candidates \ntarget the same population for AMT patch extension. Senator McCain \nproposes additional alternative minimum tax relief by expanding the AMT \npatch in the year 2013 and beyond.\n  Let's turn to the second question. The question is, How will Senators \nMcCain and Obama deal with middle-class family tax relief that will \nexpire? The bipartisan tax cuts, from 2001 and 2003, provide a very \nlarge amount of tax relief to middle-class families. So the question \nis, Should we allow this tax relief to expire, as it will at the end of \n2010? And if Congress doesn't do anything, as you have heard me say, we \nwill get the biggest tax increase in the history of the country without \neven a vote of Congress because that is what sunsets do. You go back to \nold law. These 2001 and 2003 bipartisan tax cuts are set to expire at \nthe end of 2010. If these tax cuts are extended, then in 2011 a married \ncouple making $50,000 with two children would save an average of $2,300 \non their tax bill. It is clear enough. I don't have to dwell on what \nthe chart says. If we don't do anything for this class of taxpayers, \nthe tax bill is going to go up $2,300 per year.\n  Likewise, you can take any class of people, but let's look at a \nsingle mom with two kids who makes $30,000 a year. She would save an \naverage of $1,100 off of her tax bill in 2011, if the 2001 and 2003 tax \ncuts are extended--the same wall only with different figures. The 2001 \nand 2003 bipartisan tax relief bills provide much needed tax relief, \nalmost all of which is scheduled to expire by the end of 2010. This \nbipartisan tax relief doubled the child tax credit, allowed this child \ntax credit to be used against any AMT liability, and made a large \nportion of this child tax credit refundable. This bipartisan tax relief \nalso permanently extended the adoption tax credit and increased the \ncredit to $10,000 per child. This bipartisan tax relief also increased \nthe dependent care credit to a maximum of $6,000. In addition, it also \nprovided tax relief from the marriage penalty. This bipartisan tax \nrelief also provided a number of tax relief provisions to help make \neducation more affordable.\n  For example, one provision gave a deduction up to $4,000 for college \ntuition and related expenses. In addition, another provision increased \nthe annual limit on contributions to education IRAs from $500 a year to \n$2,000 a year.\n  I believe it is useful to look at where the candidates have been with \nrespect to their positions on middle-class tax relief. Senator McCain \nhas consistently supported middle-class tax relief in his Senate \ncareer. As far as I am aware, Senator McCain has never voted to raise \ntaxes on middle-income families. Senator McCain helped prevent tax \nincreases on middle-income families in 2004 by voting for the Working \nFamilies Tax Relief Act of 2004. Senator McCain's budget votes have \nconsistently provided room for the extension of the lower income tax \nrates as well as suspension of the harmful PEP and PEASE provisions \nthat are now being phased out because of the 2001 tax bill. In \naddition, Senator McCain has been consistently a supporter of even the \nrepeal of those two provisions.\n  On the other hand, Senator Obama voted for the Democratic budget and \nthe budget conference report this year that did not provide room to \nprotect Americans in the 25-, 28-, 33-, and 35-percent tax brackets \nfrom being hit with this tax increase that will automatically happen at \nthe end of 2010 because of sunsets. So we get, as I said once before, \nthe biggest tax increase in the history of the country, without a vote \nof Congress.\n\n[[Page S10138]]\n\n  According to the IRS, single individuals falling within the 25-\npercent bracket in 2008 start at taxable income of more than $32,550. \nThey earn taxable income of no more than $78,850. Singles in the 28-\npercent bracket will earn taxable income of more than $78,850 or less \nthan $164,550.\n  Senator Obama said in the Presidential candidates' September 26, \n2008, debate he would not raise taxes a dime on people making under \n$250,000. But his two budget votes in 2008 do not provide room for him \nto keep that promise. In fact, he could not even make good on that \npromise to those singles making over $32,550 on taxable income based on \nthe Democratic budget he voted for.\n  Instead, these taxpayers with over $32,550 in taxable income would be \nhit with a hidden marginal tax rate increase in the PEP and PEASE \ncategories as well as a transparent marginal tax rate increase \naccording to the budget that Senator Obama voted for.\n  I turn now to the harmful alternative minimum tax, or the AMT. Both \nparties agree the AMT is a tax on the middle class that the middle \nclass should never have to pay. Why it hits them--and they should never \nhave to pay it--and why Congress takes corrective action is because it \nwas never indexed. In addition, both parties deserve blame for the \nproblem we have, that the AMT is not indexed. However, the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1993, passed strictly on party-line votes \nby a Democratic majority and signed into law by President Clinton, did \neven a lot more damage to the alternative minimum tax.\n  In the 1993 tax bill, the exemption level was increased to $33,750 \nfor individuals and $45,000 for joint returns, but this was accompanied \nby yet great increases beyond what was already in law. Importantly, as \nin previous bills related to the AMT, these exemption amounts were not \nindexed for inflation. By the way, the 1993 tax increase was passed on \nstrictly party-line votes, with the Democrats supplying the majority.\n  Once again, graduated rates were introduced, except this time they \nwere 26 percent and 28 percent. By tinkering with the rate, as well as \nthe exemption level of the AMT, these bills were only doing what \nCongress has been doing on a bipartisan basis for almost 40 years, \nwhich is to undertake a wholly inadequate approach to the problem that \nkeeps getting bigger. By ``problem'' I mean taxing middle-income people \nby the alternative minimum tax--a class of people whom it was never \nsupposed to apply to.\n  Aside from this futile tinkering I suggested from the 1993 bill, \nCongress--and, of course, we have tinkered with the AMT over the years \nto keep it from hitting additional middle class--Congress has in other \ncircumstances completely ignored the impact of tax legislation on \ntaxpayers caught by the AMT. In the 1990s, a series of tax credits, \nsuch as the child tax credit and the lifetime learning credit, were \nadopted without any regard to the AMT. The AMT limited the use of \nnonrefundable credits, and that did not change.\n  However, Congress quickly realized the ridiculousness of this \nsituation and waived the AMT disallowance of nonrefundable personal \ncredits, but it only did it through the year 1998. In 1999, the issue \nagain had to be dealt with. The Congress passed the Taxpayer Refund and \nRelief Act of 1999. In the Senate, only Republicans voted for the bill. \nThat bill included a provision to finally repeal the alternative \nminimum tax that was on the books from 1969 to that point. Senator \nMcCain voted in favor of this bill to repeal the AMT. However, then-\nPresident Clinton vetoed the bill. So we still continued to have the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  Later on, in 1999, an extenders bill, including a fix good through \n2001, was enacted which held harmless AMT for a little while longer.\n  In 2001, we departed from these temporary piecemeal solutions to fix \nthe AMT through the tax bill of 2001. That bill permanently allowed the \nchild tax credit, the adoption tax credit, and the IRA contribution \ncredit to be claimed against a taxpayer's AMT. While this was certainly \nnot a complete solution, it was a step in the right direction. More \nimportantly, the 2001 bill was a bipartisan effort to stop the further \nintrusion of the alternative minimum tax hitting the middle class. The \npackage Senator Baucus and I put together effectively prevented \ninflation from pulling anyone else into the AMT through the year 2005.\n  Our friends in the House originally wanted to enact a hold harmless \nonly through the end of 2001. But the final compromise bill signed by \nthe President increased the AMT exemption amount through 2005. Since \nthe 2001 tax relief bill, the Finance Committee has produced bipartisan \npackages to continue to increase exemption amounts to keep taxpayers \nahead of inflation, including the bill of 2005. Most currently, the \n2007 AMT patch was extended in late 2007. Hopefully, the House will go \nalong with what we did last week, and we will extend that through 2008.\n  These packages put together since 2001 are very unique in that they \nare the first sustained attempt undertaken by Congress to stem the \nspread of the AMT through inflation, hitting the middle class who was \nnever intended to be hit.\n  Now, admittedly, these were nothing but short-term fixes. But they \nillustrate a comprehension of the AMT inflation problem and what needs \nto be done to solve it.\n  I now look at how the candidates have voted with respect to the AMT. \nSenator McCain has consistently voted to protect Americans from the \nalternative minimum tax. Senator McCain voted for the Tax Refund and \nReconciliation Act of 1999, which contained a proposal to completely \nphase out the AMT. In fact, in the Senate, that conference report \npassed on Republican votes only, including Senator McCain's. In 2001, \nwhen the AMT patch began, Senator McCain supported the Senate version \nof the tax relief bill that patched the AMT for a longer period of \ntime. Moreover, Senator McCain voted for the Tax Increase Prevention \nand Reconciliation Act of 2005 and later bills that extended the AMT \npatch.\n  In stark contrast to Senator McCain's voting record of providing \nrelief from the AMT, Senator Obama voted against the AMT patch \ncontained in the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of \n2005. Also, Senator Obama opposed Republican budgets in 2005 and 2006 \nthat provided revenue room for the AMT patch. Senator Obama supported \nthe 2007 Democratic budget that omitted any revenue room for such an \nAMT patch. In 2008, Senator Obama supported the Democratic budget that, \nfor the first time in this election year, provided some tax relief \nrevenue room for fixing the AMT.\n  Senator McCain supported the 2008 Republican budget that provided \nsimilar revenue room for the AMT.\n  Therefore, when looking at each candidate's voting record, the \nconclusion that becomes apparent is Senator McCain has been much more \nsupportive of middle-class tax relief than Senator Obama.\n  I will now turn to that third and final question I posed at the \nbeginning of my remarks: What new proposals do the candidates offer on \nmiddle-class tax relief? We are going to move from the actions of the \ncandidates and look, instead, at their words and what we can anticipate \non whoever is sworn in on January 20 next year.\n  Let's take a look at Senator McCain's tax plan. Senator McCain \nproposes to extend all of the 2001 and 2003 bipartisan tax relief. In \nother words, for the most part, it seems to me you can say Senator \nMcCain does not want to increase taxes, by keeping the present tax \npolicy basically where it has been, at least as far as not sunsetting \nin 2010 what we did in 2001 and 2003 and, hence, not get the biggest \ntax increase in the history of the country, without even a vote of \nCongress, because that is what happens when those tax provisions \nexpire. Also, that is where you go back to that family of four getting \na $2,300 tax increase on a married couple making $50,000. Likewise, a \nsingle mom with two kids who makes $30,000 a year would save an average \nof $1,100 if the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are extended. Now, we have gone \nthrough those figures before, but they are up here on the chart so you \ncan recall what I previously had said. But I think it is necessary to \nemphasize it because that is exactly what is going to happen at the end \nof 2010 if Congress does not step in and keep the American people, but, \nmore importantly, the American economy, from being harmed\n\n[[Page S10139]]\n\nby the biggest tax increase in the history of the country without a \nvote of the Congress.\n  In addition, Senator McCain proposes additional AMT relief by \nexpanding the AMT patch in 2013 by indexing the patch by an additional \n5 percent per year in addition to the indexing done for inflation, \nuntil the joint exemption amount is $143,000, at which time the patch \nwould only be indexed for inflation. Therefore, those families making \n$143,000 and below would eventually be exempt from the AMT, and this \n$143,000 amount would be indexed for inflation.\n  Senator McCain would also double the dependent exemption from the \ncurrent amount of $3,500 to $7,000. Senator McCain proposes to do this \nby increasing the dependent exemption by $500 each year beginning in \n2010, until it reaches that $7,000 by the year 2016.\n  Therefore, this would provide significant additional tax savings for \nany married couple or single parent with one or more children. The tax \nrelief provided by the doubling of the dependent exemption would be in \naddition to tax relief provided by the alternative minimum tax patch \nand extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.\n  Now, let's look at Senator Obama. He has said he is in favor of \nextending what he calls the Bush tax cuts, except for those Americans \nwho make over $250,000 a year. As I have mentioned before, these should \nnot be referred to as the ``Bush tax cuts,'' because if President Bush \nhad gotten his way in 2001, they would have been much more than what \nthey were. So Senator Baucus and I sat down in 2001. We were the \nleaders of the Finance Committee, as we are still; in his case, the \nchairman now, and I am ranking Republican. We worked on a bipartisan \nbasis and did something significantly different than what President \nBush wanted to do.\n  Regardless, Senator Obama says he would extend all of the 2001 and \n2003 bipartisan tax relief for those making $250,000 or less. This \nincludes the provision I discussed above regarding the 2001 and 2003 \nbipartisan tax relief, including lowering some of the marginal tax \nrates, providing marriage penalty relief and doubling the amount of the \nchild tax credit to $1,000 per child.\n  Although Senator Obama's voting record might indicate otherwise, \nSenator Obama claims that he is in favor of ``fiscally responsible AMT \nreform.'' The Tax Policy Center assumes this means using the \nalternative minimum tax patch and indexing that patch for inflation to \nprevent more middle-class Americans from being hit by the AMT each \nyear.\n  Senator Obama is proposing a new $500 tax credit called the making \nwork pay credit that has the effect of exempting the first $8,100 of \nearnings from the Social Security tax. He also proposes a credit of up \nto $800 equal to 10 percent of the mortgage interest paid by Americans \nwho do not itemize deductions.\n  Senator Obama also proposes turning the current nonrefundable saver's \ntax credit into a refundable credit, and the maximum credit for a \nmarried couple is $500.\n  Senator Obama proposes to rename the HOPE and lifetime learning \ncredit by calling it the American opportunity tax credit. In addition, \nhe would like to increase the maximum amount of this refundable credit \nfrom $1,800 to $4,000 and to make the credit refundable.\n  Finally, Senator Obama claims he wants to expand the earned-income \ntax credit in various ways. He also claims he wants to expand the child \nand dependent care credit by making it refundable.\n  I turn now to examine whether Senator McCain's and Senator Obama's \npromises regarding middle-class tax relief are realistic. Even if we \nassume both Senators want to enact all the tax cuts they are promising, \ncould they deliver on these promises?\n  The nominally nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that Senator \nObama's tax plan will lose $2.9 trillion over 10 years when compared to \ncurrent law. I have used this chart before in my speeches. I won't go \ninto detail, but you can see the Obama plan is the top red line there \nwhich says how much it would lose. As I mentioned in a previous speech, \nthis $2.9 trillion figure inaccurately assumes that Senator Obama's \nplan will be partially offset by $925 billion in revenue raisers. The \nTax Policy Center refers to Senator Obama's $925 billion number as an \n``unverifiable campaign-provided revenue estimate.'' As I mentioned in \nthat previous speech, a more realistic estimate of revenue raisers over \n10 years is approximately $220 billion, meaning Senator Obama's tax \nplan would actually lose another $705 billion in revenue. Therefore, \nthe total revenue lost from Senator Obama's plan is not $2.9 trillion \nover 10 years but instead is approximately $3.6 trillion over 10 years.\n  The figure for Senator McCain's plan is higher. As my colleagues can \nsee, the Tax Policy Center shows Senator McCain's plan to prevent \nwidespread tax increases would lose revenue of $4.2 trillion over 10 \nyears. In addition, as I mentioned in my prior remarks to the Senate, \nSenator McCain's proposal assumes revenue raisers of $365 billion. If \nwe net that $365 billion number against the known revenue raisers \nnumber of $220 billion, we find that Senator McCain's plan is short of \nrevenue raisers by $145 billion. Therefore, adding this $145 billion to \nthe revenue loss of $4.2 trillion that the Tax Policy Center estimates \nfor Senator McCain's tax relief plan results in total revenue loss of \n$4.3 trillion.\n  The National Taxpayers Union, also referred to around here as the \nNTU, is a nonpartisan public policy research organization. The NTU's \nanalysis, updated September 25, 2008, says that Senator McCain's plan \nwould include new spending of $92.4 billion per year. According to the \nNTU, this would result in spending increases of $924 billion over 10 \nyears. Adding this $924 billion in estimated new spending to the \nrevenue loss from Senator McCain's tax plan, this results in a total of \n$5.2 trillion of revenue loss, plus spending for Senator McCain's plan.\n  Now let's look at Senator Obama's tax and spending plans. Would \nSenator Obama's Democratic colleagues who have an obsession with pay-\nas-you-go on the tax side but not on the spending side, including House \nBlue Dog Democrats, go along with increasing the deficit approximately \n$3.6 trillion by Senator Obama's proposed tax cuts? This is even before \ntaking into account the spending increases Senator Obama is proposing.\n  According to the nonpartisan NTU's analysis, which was updated \nSeptember 25, 2008, Senator Obama has proposed to increase spending by \n$293 billion per year, which amounts to $2.9 trillion in additional \nspending over the 10-year window the Congressional Budget Office uses. \nTherefore, Senator Obama is proposing tax and spending programs that \nwould increase the deficit by $6.5 trillion before even considering the \ncost of interest resulting from such an astronomical addition to our \nnational debt. Therefore, Senator Obama proposes to increase the \nnational debt by a whopping $1.3 trillion more than Senator McCain over \nthat next 10-year period.\n  A portion of Senator Obama's March 13, 2006, speech regarding fiscal \nresponsibility is posted on his campaign Web site. A portion of this \nspeech states:\n\n       If Washington were serious about honest tax relief in this \n     country, we would see an effort to reduce our national debt \n     by returning to responsible fiscal policies.\n\n  Senator Obama's proposal to increase the national debt by $6.5 \ntrillion is inconsistent with his statement regarding a return to \nfiscally responsible policy.\n  Even if he really did want to provide the tax relief he is promising, \nwould a Democratic Congress let Senator Obama make good on most of his \npromises that would provide middle-class tax relief? Also, would a \nDemocratic Congress fight attempts by Senator McCain to enact the tax \nrelief proposals he has made?\n  Similar promises to those made by Senator Obama were made by \ncandidate Clinton in 1992. Candidate Clinton said taxes wouldn't be \nraised on people making under $200,000 a year. However, President \nClinton then raised taxes on everyone making $20,000 and over in 1993.\n  Perhaps Senator Obama would be able to provide some of the tax relief \nhe has been promising but only to those Americans falling within his \nnarrow version of the middle class, stopping at individuals making \n$66,000 or less, that he has been using in his campaign ads stating \nthat he will provide three times more tax breaks than Senator McCain. \nSenator Obama has changed his definition of the middle class from \n$250,000 and below in his public statements to those making\n\n[[Page S10140]]\n\n$66,000 and below in his campaign ads and on his campaign Web site. \nThis is definitely a change, but if you make more than $66,000, I \nwouldn't think this is a change you would ever want to believe in. One \nman's change is another man's flip-flop.\n  Considering the history when the Democratic Party has had control of \nthe House, the Senate, and the Presidency--and I am going to put my \nthermometer chart back up here--considering the history of when the \nDemocratic Party had control of the House, the Senate, and the \nPresidency, are you confident that Democrats won't raise taxes on you \nif you make $67,000, which is above the middle class, according to one \nof Senator Obama's two inconsistent definitions of middle class? As \nhistory has shown us, the largest tax increases come when Democrats \ncontrol the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, and you see it at \nthe top of the thermometer there. The lowest levels of taxation happen \nwhen you have a Republican President and you have a Republican \nCongress. As you look at the bottom, the figures appear at the bottom \nof the thermometer.\n  We need to carefully scrutinize Senator Obama's claims that Senator \nMcCain wouldn't provide any tax relief at all for 100 million \nAmericans, citing the IRS statistics of income tax stats. Moreover, \nSenator Obama has criticized Senator McCain's tax relief plan by saying \nthat Senator McCain's plan would not provide any direct tax cut other \nthan increasing the dependent exemption. Even the nominally nonpartisan \nTax Policy Center states that Senator McCain would provide tax cuts for \nall Americans, as did the 2001 and 2003 bipartisan tax relief packages.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Q: Is there a standard, accepted definition of what \n     constitutes the ``middle class''?\n       Is there a standard, accepted definition of what \n     constitutes the ``middle class''? Politicians are fond of \n     talking about how the middle class will be affected by \n     policies and laws, but rarely do they define who is actually \n     part of that group.\n       A: No, there isn't. ``Middle class'' means different things \n     to different people--and politicians.\n       There is no standard definition, and in fact, an \n     overwhelming majority of Americans say they are ``middle \n     class'' or ``upper-middle class'' or ``working class'' in \n     public opinion polls. Hardly anybody considers themselves \n     ``lower class'' or ``upper class'' in America.\n       It's possible to come up with a definition of what \n     constitutes ``middle income,'' but it will depend on how \n     large a slice of the middle one prefers. If we look at U.S. \n     Census Bureau statistics, which divide household income into \n     quintiles, we could say that the ``middle'' quintile, or 20 \n     percent, might be the ``middle'' class. In 2006, the average \n     income for households in that middle group was $48,561 and \n     the upper limit was $60,224. But we could just as reasonably \n     use another Census figure, median family income. In 2006, the \n     median--or ``middle''--income for a family of four was \n     $70,354. Half of all four-person families made more; half \n     made less.\n       Journalist Chris Baker examined the ambiguous meaning of \n     the term ``middle class'' in a 2003 Washington Times story. \n     He, too, found no generally accepted definition, but he did \n     get this broad one from Jared Bernstein, an economist at the \n     liberal Economic Policy Institute: ``There are working \n     families who can pay their bills, but they have to really \n     think about such minimal expenditures as picking up a pizza \n     after work, going to the movies, making a long-distance \n     telephone call. They may have some investments, but they \n     depend on each paycheck for their well-being.''\n       But others could have different definitions. Baker \n     interviewed a man who earned about $100,000 a year and a \n     woman who made $35,000, both of whom said they were middle \n     class.\n       Public opinion polls show how slippery the term can be. An \n     Oct. 2007 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, Harvard \n     School of Public Health and National Public Radio asked 1,527 \n     adults what income level makes a family of four middle class. \n     About 60 percent said a family earning $50,000 or $60,000 fit \n     that description. But 42 percent answered an income of \n     $40,000 and 48 percent said $80,000 were both middle class.\n       Other polls suggest that 90 percent or more of Americans \n     consider themselves to be ``middle class'' or ``upper-middle \n     class'' or ``working class.'' An April 2007 poll by CBS News \n     found that of 994 adults surveyed only 2 percent said they \n     were ``upper class,'' and 7 percent said they were ``lower \n     class.'' In another poll, taken by Gallup/USA Today in May \n     2006, 1 percent said they were ``upper class,'' and 6 percent \n     said they were ``lower class.'' Interestingly, since 12.3 \n     percent of Americans were living below the official federal \n     poverty level in 2006, these poll findings suggest many who \n     are officially poor still consider themselves to be ``middle \n     class'' or ``working class.''\n       So what do politicians mean when they say ``the middle \n     class''? Good question. Each politician may be talking about \n     a different group of Americans, but the message many voters \n     hear is that the politician is talking about them.\n       For example, Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards \n     calls for ``tax breaks to honor and strengthen three pillars \n     of America's middle class: savings, work, and families.'' One \n     of his proposals is to expand a tax credit to give dollar-\n     for-dollar matches on savings up to $500 a year. Some version \n     of that credit would be available to families earning up to \n     $75,000.\n       Republican candidate Mitt Romney, meanwhile, has proposed \n     eliminating ``taxes on dividends, capital gains, and interest \n     on middle class families.'' He defines ``middle class'' as \n     anyone with an adjusted gross income of under $200,000--and \n     acknowledges that such a proposal would affect ``over 95 \n     percent of American families.''--Lori Robertson\n\n\n                                sources\n\n       U.S. Census Bureau. 2006 American Community Survey.

The Washington Times, 30 Nov. \n     2003.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from North Dakota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, are we in a period of morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are postcloture on the motion to concur.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wish to talk about what is happening \nin the economy, the consequences, a bit about what happened yesterday, \nand what I think we should do going forward.\n  Yesterday, as most Americans now know, the stock market had a very \nsignificant down day--777 points down. Today it is up over 300 points \nas I speak.\n  We have gone through a very difficult time for a long period of time \nin this country. I wish to talk about the causes of it and the \nconsequences of it. I am not going to, as some do, come to the floor to \ndescribe one party or another that is responsible for this or that. I \ndon't think that is particularly helpful today. But I do wish to say \nthat, tracking back to a couple of significant events--one in 1999 when \nthe Congress, without my support, passed a piece of legislation that \nessentially repealed what is called the Glass-Steagall Act. This \nlegislation was put in place by Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the \nGreat Depression to protect banks and depositors by separating banks \nfrom riskier enterprises of real estate and securities--I pulled out \nsome of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's radio addresses.\n  Here is an address he made in 1933. As my colleagues know, this is a \nPresident who had to confront the Great Depression, and here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       We had a bad banking situation. Some of our bankers have \n     shown themselves either incompetent or dishonest in their \n     handling of the people's funds. They had used the money \n     entrusted to them in speculations and unwise loans. This was \n     of course not true in the vast majority of our banks, but it \n     was true in enough of them to shock the people for a time \n     into a sense of insecurity . . . It was the government's job \n     to straighten out this situation and do it as quickly as \n     possible . . . After all, there is an element in the \n     readjustment of our financial system more important than \n     currency, more important than gold, and that is the \n     confidence of the people. You people must have faith; you \n     must not be stampeded by rumors or guesses. Let us unite \n     at banishing fear. We provided the machinery to restore \n     our financial system. It is up to you to support it and \n     make it work.\n  That was Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1933. In 1934, he said this:\n\n       The second step we have taken in the restoration of normal \n     business enterprise has been to clean up thoroughly \n     unwholesome conditions in the field of investment. In this we \n     have had assistance from many bankers and businessmen, most \n     of whom recognize the past evils in the banking system, in \n     the sale of securities, in the deliberate encouragement of \n     stock gambling, in the sale of unsound mortgages and in many \n     other ways in which the public lost billions of dollars. They \n     saw that without changes in the policies and methods of \n     investment there could\n\n[[Page S10141]]\n\n     be no recovery of public confidence in the security of \n     savings.\n\n  Sounds a little like today, although Franklin Delano Roosevelt then \ntook very aggressive steps to say we are going to separate banking from \nrisk. You are no longer going to be able to have an FDIC-insured \ndeposit institution called a bank and merge it with the speculation in \nreal estate and securities. You just cannot do it. The Congress passed, \nat the President's request, something called the Glass-Steagall Act. \nThat lasted for nearly 80 years, until 1999, when it was repealed.\n  There was a story this morning in a Wisconsin newspaper quoting me \nand quoting my late colleague, Paul Wellstone, who sat at the end of \nthat row. We both spoke on the Senate floor. There were eight of us who \nopposed the Financial Modernization Act, they called it, because they \nalways wrap bad things in good names. The Financial Modernization Act, \nwhat a misnamed act, but it repealed the Glass-Steagall Act. It set the \nstage for large financial holding companies. It set the stage for banks \nto be engaged in more risk. They said: We have to do this to move \nforward. Senator Phil Gramm actually led the charge. Gramm-Leach-Bliley \nwas the name. Modernization they called it.\n  Some of us said it was going to be an unbelievable debacle. Here are \na couple things I said when it passed the Senate the first time:\n\n       I say to the people who own banks, if you want to gamble, \n     go to Las Vegas. If you want to trade in derivatives, God \n     bless you, do it with your own money. Do not do it through \n     the deposits guaranteed by the American people.\n\n  Further, I said on the same day on the floor of the Senate:\n\n       This bill will, in my judgment, raise the likelihood of \n     future massive taxpayer bailouts.\n\n  I wish I had been wrong. I take no joy in being right.\n  When the bill came back in November as a conference report and eight \nof us voted against it in 1999, I said:\n\n       Fusing together the idea of banking, which requires not \n     just safety and soundness to\n     be successful but the perception of safety\n     and soundness, with other inherently risky\n     speculative activity is, in my judgment,\n     unwise . . .\n\n  Then I said on the same day in November 1999 before the vote:\n\n       We will in 10 years time look back and say: We should not \n     have done that\n\n  Repeal Glass-Steagall--\n\n     because we forgot the lessons of the past.\n\n  What did we allow to happen as a result of all of this? We have seen \ntoday a substantial amount of activity as a result of the collapse on \nWall Street and in the banking industry. Here are just a few of the \nactions most recently. J.P. Morgan decided to buy Bear Stearns because \nBear Stearns was going to go belly up. And over a weekend, they worked, \nand the Federal Reserve Board and the Secretary of Treasury said the \ntaxpayers will put up $29 billion so that J.P. Morgan can buy Bear \nStearns so Bear Stearns doesn't have to go belly up.\n  I was looking in the Wall Street Journal today, and there is \nsomething about Bear Stearns. It is kind of interesting because it \nrelates to what I am going to talk about in a whole range of these \nareas. It relates to something I call ``dark money.'' That is a massive \namount of money, essentially like money in a casino, that is moving \naround speculating that no one can see, no one knows who has it, where \nit is, how much it is.\n  This article is entitled ``Too Much Money Is Beyond Legal Reach,'' \nfrom the Wall Street Journal. It talks about the ``$1.9 trillion, \nalmost all of it run out of the New York metropolitan area, that sits \nin the Cayman Islands, a secrecy jurisdiction. And another $1.5 \ntrillion is lodged in four other secrecy jurisdictions.''\n  Then they say:\n\n       Most recently, two Bear Stearns hedge funds, based in the \n     Cayman Islands, but run out of New York, collapsed without \n     any warning to its investors. Because of the location of \n     these financial institutions--in secrecy jurisdiction, \n     outside the U.S. safety net of appropriate supervision--their \n     desperate financial condition went undetected until it was \n     too late.\n\n  You run the dark money through hedge funds, through Bear Stearns, \nthrough the Cayman Islands, it all goes belly up, no one even knows it \nis there. Then we have to find in a weekend that the American taxpayers \nshould put up $29 billion so that J.P. Morgan can bail out a failed \nBear Stearns.\n  Madam President, $300 billion immediately following that was \navailable to investment banks that are unregulated because the Federal \nReserve Board said: Investment banks can come to our loan window and \nget loans directly from the Federal Reserve Board. Never in the history \nof this country has that been allowed. Only FDIC-insured regulated \nbanks could do that. It is estimated that $300 billion in direct loans \nfrom the window of the Federal Reserve Board went out to unregulated \nWall Street firms.\n  Then bailing out Freddie and Fannie. J.P. Morgan Chase in Lehman \nfinancing. They have been around since the Civil War and went belly up \nthrough bad investments. AIG, the insurance company, goes belly up, and \nso there is an $85 billion loan provided by our Government to prevent \ntheir failure. Why did they fail? We are told a small unit in England \nwith about 375 employees were engaged in something I will talk about in \na bit, credit default swaps, which is essentially a huge gamble, and it \npulled that whole company down, so the Federal Government had to bail \nthem out with $85 billion. And $50 billion has now been pledged as \nguarantees for certain money market funds.\n  In recent days, Washington Mutual, a big bank, had to be taken over. \nThen in more recent days we have had Wachovia bank subsumed.\n  Here is what is happening. We have all these financial institutions \nwe are told are too big to fail, which means we guarantee them. The \nFederal Reserve Board has a list of firms too big to fail. They are \napparently not too big to regulate, just too big to fail, so the \nAmerican taxpayer has to guarantee it.\n  Here is what has happened as a result. Bank of America buys Merrill \nLynch. Washington Mutual is put on top of J.P. Morgan Chase. Citigroup, \nyesterday, buys Wachovia. What we have done is continued to consolidate \neven bigger and bigger firms. These three firms comprise almost one-\nthird of all the banking activity in America now. Too big to fail? What \nis the answer? Make them bigger. It doesn't make any sense to me, but \nthat is exactly where it is going.\n  Let me describe what I think is no-fault capitalism. You have all \nthis dark money, and what has happened is you have had all of these \nfancy financial engineers who have concocted in recent years since \n1999--since the shackles were taken off to do whatever they want, by \nand large, and since this administration came to town bragging it \nwasn't going to regulate. We hired the regulators, paid the regulators, \nbut they boasted they were not interested in regulating anything.\n\n  I am quoting Steven Pearlstein who wrote a terrific piece on this \nearlier this year:\n\n       Wall Street has been brilliant at dreaming up other \n     financial innovations that picked up where junk bonds left \n     off. These included complex futures and derivatives \n     contracts; loan syndication; securitization; credit default \n     swaps; off-balance-sheet vehicles; collateralized debt \n     obligations . . .\n\n  And on and on.\n  What happens is this financial engineering that was so brilliant put \neverybody at risk--everybody. He says junk bonds were the first. I know \nsomething about junk bonds because I am the person who passed the \nlegislation that brought down that market on junk bonds when, in fact, \nMichael Milken, sitting in his car in the morning riding as a \npassenger, going to work at Drexel Burnham, was wearing a miner's hat \nwith a lamp on it so he could study his financial sheets. What he was \ndoing is creating junk bonds and parking them in federally insured \ninstitutions.\n  The hood ornament of the excess back in those days was that the \nAmerican taxpayers eventually ended up having to own and take \npossession of nonperforming junk bonds in one of America's largest \ncasinos. Think about the stupidity of all that. I passed the \nlegislation that shut that down, so I know about those excesses.\n  Now we have credit default swaps and CDOs and so many other exotic \ninstruments and, by the way, so complicated that a lot of people don't \neven know what they are. Even those who have issued them cannot very \neasily understand them. What they have done is been able to hide risk, \nliabilities and losses from investors. ``They have given traders a \ngreater ability to secretly manipulate markets,'' Mr. Pearlstein says, \nand I agree.\n\n[[Page S10142]]\n\n  Let me talk about this chart, the no-fault capitalism portion.\n  Merrill Lynch went belly up. What did the CEO of Merrill Lynch make \nlast year? He made $161 million for running a company that got into \ntrouble and had to be purchased. I don't understand.\n  John Mack, Morgan Stanley--they got into trouble--$41 million \ncompensation last year.\n  Bear Stearns, the first company I mentioned, we had to arrange the \npurchase, the American taxpayers had to put up $29 billion to guarantee \nit, and the CEO of Bear Stearns made $34 million last year.\n  Lehman Brothers went belly up. The CEO made $22 million last year.\n  Washington Mutual went belly up. The CEO made $14 million last year. \nBy the way, they just had a new CEO, or did. He had been on the job 3 \nweeks and signed a contract for a $7 million bonus for signing and a \n$12 million termination fee. I understand that has been voided. But it \njust shows you the same money is ricocheting around in the halls of \nthese firms.\n  AIG, Martin Sullivan--we had to bail out AIG he made $14 million last \nyear.\n  The question is, Where is the discipline? There is so much money \nricocheting around Wall Street from all of these issues, and now we are \ntold they all went sour. There are toxic, mortgage-backed securities, \nand the American taxpayers somehow have to come up with the money.\n  Let me talk for a moment about hedge funds. Warren Buffett once \ncalled hedge funds ``financial weapons of mass destruction'' because of \nthe damage they can do to Wall Street in an instant. I just talked \nabout some $20 million, $160 million for folks running failed \ninstitutions. Let me talk about the big income earners. The big income \nearners were John Paulson. He was the top of the heap last year. John \nPaulson made $3.7 billion. That means when he came home from work and \nhis wife said, How did we do this month, sweetheart? he said: Well, we \nmade $300 million this month. Madam President, $3.7 billion. Or perhaps \nhe would say to his spouse: I made $10 million today. That would be \nmore accurate--$10 million a day. John Paulson was the top income \nearner last year.\n  How did he make that money? In a hedge fund he bet very big in the \ndrop of housing values and made $15 billion for his hedge fund. By the \nway, he also hired former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan \nas an adviser. Yes, that is the same Alan Greenspan who was content to \nbe an observer as this housing bubble burst, as predatory lending \nexisted, and all these exotic instruments and all those mortgages I \nwill talk about in a moment were created and traded. Nothing really \nseems too wacky these days in the world of finance.\n  There are some wonderful and creative people who work in finance and \nwho run America's corporations and, by the way, many of them are worth \ntheir weight in gold. But what I see here is a form of no-fault \ncapitalism in which a substantial amount of money is paid to some who \nrun these corporations right into the ground, run their financial firms \nright into the ground with unbelievably risky bets on credit default \nswaps, collateralized debt, in which they back their balance sheet with \nrisk, in some cases even move it offshore to tax haven countries at \nunbelievable risks, and then the American taxpayers are told: You know \nwhat. It didn't work very well, and you need to pay for it.\n  Let me go through the roots of this situation. I have done this many \ntimes. But as people sit on the edge of the chair watching what is \nhappening to the Dow Jones Industrial Average today, they need to \nunderstand what is the root rot that exists out there, what is spoiled \nand rotten at the bottom. Let me describe what happened. It is not very \ncomplicated.\n  Almost every American has heard the radio and television ads over \nrecent years: You know what you really need to do is get a better home \nmortgage, and we have one for you. We will give you a home mortgage \nwhere you get a 2-percent interest rate. Yes, that is right. Sounds \nunbelievable; it is not. We will give you a 2-percent interest rate on \nyour home mortgage. We are not going to tell you, at least not very \nloudly, that it is going to reset in 3 years to 10 percent, but we can \nget you in at 2 percent. And by the way, home values are increasing. \nGet this loan at 2 percent, cut your monthly mortgage payment by two-\nthirds, and then, if 3 years from now you can't pay the reset mortgage, \nyou can sell the house. Between now and then, you will make a lot of \nmoney anyway because home values are continuing to go up. That was the \nsales pitch.\n\n  So here is what happened all around this country. Here is Countrywide \nmortgage bank. They were purchased. They were run by a guy named \nMozilo. He was given the Horatio Alger Award. Barron's named him one of \nthe 30 most respected CEOs in America. In 2006, he made $142 million. \nAs he was touting his company's stock, the New York Times reports he \nwas selling $130 million of his company's stock, even as he was \ndescribing what a wonderful stock it was.\n  But here is what Countrywide said. They were advertising:\n\n       Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \n     mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? \n     Call us.\n\n  That is their advertisement. If you have bad credit, call us. We will \ngive you a loan. The biggest mortgage bank in the country, run by a CEO \nwho made a fortune and then got out--and by the way, he got away with \nit--before the company went down.\n  But it wasn't only Countrywide. Here is what Millennia Mortgage said:\n\n       12 months, no payments. That's right, we will give you the \n     money to make your first 12 months' payments if you call in \n     the next 7 days. We will pay it for you. Our loan program may \n     reduce your current monthly payment by as much as 50 percent \n     and allow you no payments for the first 12 months.\n\n  Here is a mortgage company saying, get a home mortgage from us and \nyou don't have to make a payment for 12 months. They didn't, of course, \nsay we are going to put that on the back end and that, ultimately, you \nwill pay more for that home, and we are going to increase the interest \nrate.\n  Zoom Credit. I don't know who the CEO is or what he made, but here is \nwhat they said.\n\n       Credit approval is just seconds away. Get on the fast track \n     at Zoom Credit. At the speed of light, Zoom Credit will \n     preapprove you for a car loan, a home loan, or a credit card. \n     Even if your credit's in the tank, Zoom Credit's like money \n     in the bank. Zoom Credit specializes in credit repair and \n     debt consolidations, too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no \n     credit--who cares?\n\n  That is unbelievable, isn't it? So we had all these mortgages put out \nthere, and we had a lot of people buying them, and here is what would \nhappen. Countrywide would get a broker. They would sell somebody one of \nthese mortgages--perhaps call them at home at night and say: You want \nto cut your home mortgage payment by two-thirds? We have a good deal \nfor you. So they would go to Countrywide, they would securitize the \nloan, package them together with other loans into what is called a \nsecurity, and then they would sell it upstream. They would put good \nloans in with bad loans, subprime with regular. They would cut them, \nslice them and dice them and hedge funds and investment banks and \nothers would buy them. They didn't have the foggiest idea what they \nwere doing. By the way, the rating companies were rating these as \npretty good securities. So everybody was fat and happy and making lots \nof money.\n  Now, the result is that all these companies--and Wachovia is a good \nexample because Wachovia was bought by Citigroup yesterday. Wachovia \nbought a company called Golden West about a year and a half ago, and \nGolden West was putting out these options mortgages. By the way, these \nare mortgages in which they advertise, we will give you a no \ndocumentation mortgage. You don't have to document your income. Or we \nwill give you a no doc or low doc loan. No doc meaning you don't have \nto document how much money you make.\n  They also say that if you can't pay all your principal, that is okay. \nYou can pay a part of the principal of the mortgage. Or you don't have \nto pay any principal, just pay interest. Or you don't have to pay any \nprincipal or all the interest, just part of the interest. Or with \nMillennia, you don't have to make any payments for the first 12 months. \nIt got better and better and better. Why did they do that? Because they \nwere locking people into bad mortgages--mortgages with teaser rates, \nvery low, 2 percent in some cases, to be reset to a much higher rate\n\n[[Page S10143]]\n\nin 3 years--and then they would lock in a prepayment penalty so you \ncould never get out of it. Or to get out you would have to pay a huge \npenalty. Then they would sell it upstream. As they sold it upstream, \nthey would sell a security that promised a 10-percent interest rate in \n3 years with a prepayment penalty so it was unlikely the person could \nget out of it, and that security then had a higher yield. All these \nfolks were amazed that they were able to buy securities with such a \nwonderful rate of return.\n  In the meantime, of course, it all collapsed. Because all those \nsecurities got out there on the balance sheets of these companies \nbuying these securities in the name of greed--big returns. Then it all \nturned sour and began to smell like rotten fish, lying out there on the \nbalance sheets, these nonperforming assets. It all turned sour. It \nbegan to pull under companies that were unwise enough to make these \ninvestments, and they were companies all over the country.\n  I mentioned some of the ways they did it. This is describing part of \nit. No documentation loans, low documentation loans. Even as we talk \nabout its impact on the economy, if you think this has stopped, it has \nnot. There is a credit lockup in this country, they say. Probably so, \nin some areas. But I went to the Internet a couple days ago and I \nfound, under a search for a no doc income loans, I found 325 different \nplaces on the Internet that provide these kind of home loans right now: \nNo credit check. Bad credit loans.\n  It has not yet stopped. Here is part of what I found on the Internet.\n\n       Easy loan for you. Do you have bad credit? Get approved \n     today.\n\n  You can go find that on the Internet right now. Here is another one \nyou can find on the Internet right now: speedybadcreditloans.com. Think \nof that. How unbelievably ignorant, speedybadcreditloans. When we face \nthe crisis we now face because of this unparalleled greed and the toxic \nmortgage-backed securities that exist on the balance sheets of all \nthese companies, threatening to bring down these corporations, and they \nare still selling them.\n\n       SpeedyBadCreditLoans. Bad credit, no problem. No credit, no \n     problem. Bankruptcy, no problem.\n\n  I think I have described what has put out a substantial amount of \ntoxic investments throughout this country, which has caused \nunbelievable chaos not just in this country but across the world. I \nthink there are a number of things we ought to do.\n  I know the discussion yesterday was about a $700 billion bailout, or \nrescue fund, that did not survive in the House of Representatives. I \nhope now those who are going to put together some changes to that \nplan--I assume there will be some changes, and I do support some of the \ndiscussion today about increasing the size of bank accounts that are \nFDIC insured from $100,000 to $250,000. If we had changed that over \ntime for the value of money, it would be well over $200,000 now. So I \nbelieve it would be useful and provide some confidence to provide that \nadditional insurance to a $250,000-per-account level. But I strongly \nfeel that a couple other things have to be done.\n  We can't let this moment pass, and we can't have this economy in \nperil because of the greed and the avarice of some who decided to take \ndramatic risks and to gamble with other people's money. We can't do \nthat. We can't proceed without deciding we are going to regulate hedge \nfunds and regulate the trading of derivatives. We cannot do it. Where I \ncome from, you call that leaving the gate open. You have to close the \ngate.\n  In 1999, and even beyond, these institutions and traders and others \nwere allowed to go hog-wild here and do almost everything with almost \nno supervision and no regulation. We have to learn from that and \nunderstand that part and parcel of this action by the Congress has to \nbe re-regulation. Now, I have talked about the three Rs that are \nnecessary, and I believe you have to do all of it here. I am willing to \nsupport something that deals with some kind of recovery. I understand \nthe need to address this. But I also think you have to do some reform \nand you have to do some regulation at the same time.\n  You can't say to the American people, by the way, ante up a bunch of \nmoney for recovery and forget reform and forget regulation. If we don't \npatch that which we tore in 1999 and decide to take apart again the \nfundamental banking functions of the federally insured institutions, if \nwe don't separate them from the inherent risk that exists in investment \nbanking and others, where they take these risks with things such as \nswaps and collateralized debt obligations and others, if we don't \nunderstand the lesson, we are destined to repeat it, just as sure as I \nam here. You have to have reform. Reform is to back up some steps and \nto decide to protect the banking institutions from excessive risk. \nRegrettably, we went in the wrong direction in 1999. I think we need to \ngo back some ways.\n  Second, there is so much dark money out in this economy that you \ncan't see. Hedge funds. We must have a regulatory provision for hedge \nfunds. I am not suggesting the recovery bill itself has to describe the \nspecific set of regulations, but the bill can, as it has in a couple \nother areas, describe a rulemaking process for regulating hedge funds. \nThe same is true with respect to derivative trading. We have been told \nthere is somewhere around $62 trillion in notional value of credit \ndefault swaps out in this country. Most people think that sounds like a \nforeign language. They wouldn't even know what it is. It is an \nunbelievable amount of insurance out there against securities that have \nbecome toxic--securities that are lying and smelling, fouling in the \nbowels of the balance sheets of some of these corporations. We have to \ndo something that does reform and regulation. There may never be \nanother moment to be able to do it.\n  I understand a whole lot of folks have been opposed to this for a \nlong time. I have pushed it for years on the floor of the Senate. \nSenator Feinstein, I, and many others have been pushing for regulation \nof hedge funds and the regulation of derivative trading. But as I \nindicated when I started, when you have a Bear Stearns that has \nderivative or credit default swaps running through the Cayman Islands \nand they go belly up, and nobody even knew it was there--and they \nhelped pull down this firm--then you wonder how does that happen \noutside the gaze or view of regulators? How on Earth does that happen?\n  We have, unfortunately, been looking only at this question of \nproviding the funding. As I said, I am willing to consider a process \nthat deals with rescue. I am willing to consider that. But I believe \nthat if we move past this moment and don't address the reform and the \nregulation piece, we will be back again--maybe in 5 years, maybe 10 \nyears. We will be back again, almost certainly.\n  Warren Buffett once said, when I talked to him on the phone, that \nthere is an old saying on Wall Street: You can't see who is swimming \nnaked until the tide goes out. Well, you know what, the tide is going \nout. We have lots of trouble, and now we see the consequences of \nunbelievable, rampant speculation in institutions that should have \nknown better. We have to try to protect the financial system of the \nUnited States from collapsing. I understand that. We have to do that. \nBut we cannot possibly ask our constituents to believe in that mission \nif we don't also provide the regulation and reform that must accompany \nit. We can't do half a job.\n  As I indicated, I am not suggesting that legislation has to, in the \n130-some-page bill, describe exactly how you regulate hedge funds or \nhow you regulate derivative trading.\n  But I do believe we ought to describe a specific date by which a \nrulemaking process proceeds for that regulation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, first, I apologize for not hearing all of your \nremarks. I was in earshot when I heard you talking about available \ncredit, talking about what you could find on the Internet. You showed \nthese advertisements where people are still in the business of trying \nto sucker Americans into buying things they cannot afford and vice \nversa, those companies that are treating our Americans who cannot \nafford things as suckers and getting them in and telling them to buy \nthings they ultimately cannot pay for. Is that part of your talk here \ntoday?\n\n[[Page S10144]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct. My point was, that which has occurred \nthat has caused this unbelievable collapse, I think the Senator from \nNew Mexico would agree that what has precipitated this is the massive \namount of failure out there of mortgage-backed securities that are held \non the balance sheets of these financial institutions. They turned out \nto be sour. It has begun to pull down on some of these institutions.\n  My point was that you can go to the Internet today and you can find \nexactly the same kind of irresponsible advertising that existed for a \nlong time, including the biggest mortgage bank in the country, \nCountrywide, which is saying: Bad credit, come over here, we will give \nyou a loan. The same things exists. Go to the Internet today, and you \nwill find exactly the same kind of advertising.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think Countrywide has been taken over by Bank of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It has.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say to the Senator--and I am giving you an \nobservation--what has happened, it seems to me, in terms of our efforts \nto pass a rescue package is that we started out by talking about a \nbailout--somebody did--and also, at the same time, a Wall Street \nbailout. You know, what caught my eye as a Senator wondering whether I \nwas going to help with this, until I found out that there was no \nbailout and Wall Street was not being bailed out, what was happening \nwas--well, let's take the biggest purveyor of mortgage-backed \nsecurities, and that happened to be Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They \nhad most of them. What they really were, were mortgages on homes that \npeople bought by the hundreds of thousands. As a matter of fact, those \ntwo entities have mortgaged more than half, well over half--almost two-\nthirds of all American houses. They had taken these mortgage-backed \nsecurities and they were selling them. That is how they made this \ninordinate amount of money over the last 10 or 12 years. Then what \nhappened is those mortgage-backed securities--people started looking at \nit and tried to find out: Where did they get the mortgages?\n  I wanted to add to your scenario of where all of these bad, what we \nmight call toxic assets, which are mortgage-backed securities that are \nin default, where did they come from and where are they? And I wanted \nto make sure that your wonderful talk about this subject included the \nfact that for a period of time the U.S. Government was pushing very \nhard on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to accept mortgages on homes that \nany reasonable person knew could not be afforded, could not be paid \nfor, and they were pushing thousands of them to get people in homes \neven if they could not pay for them. And that is thousands of those--\nhundreds of thousands are coming home to roost now, as I understand it, \nand we do not even know where we are, but we find out when a bank \nstarts failing because they are using this as their equity--they bought \nthem--and it turns out to be sour because they are not paying on the \nmortgage. You go look, and there is a house there backing up that \nmortgage, and maybe a family was in it, but they are already 6 months \nin default and they have left the place and it is falling down, and you \nhave a mortgage here that you are holding.\n  I do not think we ever painted properly for the American people that \nthis was not a bailout of Wall Street; it was an effort to buy up those \nassets, these mortgages that were out there that were not going to be \npaid, that could not be paid, and they had gone sour. We are trying to \nbuy them and let the system work while we try to repackage them and \nsell them. It could very well be, Senator--I think you would agree--\nthat when this $700 billion, or whatever number it is, is used, it will \ncome back to the Federal Government as they sell the toxic assets they \nbuy. They will be buying them and bundling them and selling them again, \nand they may bring more money 3 or 4 years from now than you paid for \nthem.\n  So in no way is it a bailout. It is a buyout, if anything. I wondered \nif you had thought of it that way. Is that a fair reading, as you \nunderstand things?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, let me talk about the banker's role for a minute, \nbecause the way the Senator describes it is part of my concern. It used \nto be that when you bought a home, you would go down to the local \nsavings and loan or the local bank and try to negotiate a home loan. \nThen sitting across the desk, they would evaluate what kind of job do \nyou have, how much family income do you have, how secure is your job, \nis this a loan we want to provide to you because of the risk, and so \non. They would make a judgment about you. They would check your credit \nrating. That is the way it would work. It doesn't work that way in most \ncases now. It does in some cases, in most cases not. This has become a \nbig go-go effort to get home loans out there, securitize them, and sell \nthe mortgage-backed securities.\n  So when we are talking about banks buying mortgage-backed securities, \nI asked the question: Why should they be buying mortgage-backed \nsecurities? They shouldn't even have the right to buy mortgage-backed \nsecurities that are cut into these little pieces of sausage and sent \nupstream when they do not even know what is in them. How many of them \nare subprime? They don't have any idea. All they see is an advertised \nyield that says: Well, if I buy this security, I am going to get a big, \nfat income from it.\n  Going back, I would like to see us get back to the day when a \nmortgage is something negotiated across the desk from the local banker. \nI would like to see the day when you can take a look at the balance \nsheet of a bank--and I would say in my home State most of our bankers \nhave not been engaged in this at all. They do not have toxic mortgages, \nby and large. They have not invested in these things. But this became a \ngo-go industry--I described some of them, and I will do it again in a \nminute--with massive amounts of money being made, on Wall Street, I \nmight say. So Wall Street was wallowing in cash. You know it and I know \nit--I mean, the highest income earner last year, $3.7 billion; that is \n$300 million a month, $10 million a day.\n  So I understand why the American people are angry. They are saying, \nyou know: If you have to do something to rescue the financial system, \nfor gosh sakes, don't let the system collapse, but they also say: Let's \nclean up this carnival of greed that existed around here that caused \nthis to happen.\n  So that is why I think the American people--I do not know who uses \nthe term ``bailout'' or ``rescue,'' but that is why the American people \nlooked at this and said: Wait a second, I want you to do the whole job, \nnot half a job. In my judgment, half a job is putting up whatever money \nyou need at this point. Perhaps there is a better way to do it. Perhaps \nwe ought to invest in the capital structure of some of the failing \ninstitutions and get a return from that. The other side of it is to \ndecide that, in addition to whatever we decide on the money, we are \ngoing to re-regulate and reform. If those two things are not in the \nbill, I hope those who are now negotiating will put that in the bill \nbecause I think the American people might better understand what is \ngoing to be done.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say in closing that I am not sure that a \nrecovery bill--that we have time to do the kind of reshaping of the \nregulatory system that the Senator so aptly describes. I don't know \nthat it can be done. That requires an awful lot of hearings and \nthinking.\n  I would hope this bill doesn't fail when they have it ready because, \nas somebody as knowledgeable as you--and you know the problem and you \nknow we are going to have a big failure in our system that is going to \naffect far more people than the culprits who got us into it. I would \nhope that ultimately you would help to pass the bill. But I understand \nyou would like other things that are going to be needed. We are going \nto have to do them. I will not be here. I wish you luck. It has been \nhard to revamp Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, but it has been done. I am \njust not expert enough today to tell you that all of the problems with \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been solved because we changed their \nrules when we helped and tried to stabilize them within the last month. \nAnd they are the biggest purveyors of these mortgage-backed securities.\n  A mortgage-backed security is just a mortgage and a loan put into a \npackage, and it becomes a security so that it can be traded as a \nsecurity instrument instead of a mortgage being\n\n[[Page S10145]]\n\npassed around. Sometimes there are lots of them in there, sometimes \nthere are fewer.\n  But I would hope that, like many others, you would express yourself \nand talk to the American people about the problem but also suggest that \nwe have to do something now or the banking system, which is our \nlifeblood--we do not think it is, but the financial system is our \nlifeblood--will go belly-up.\n  I believe, like you, that there are many changes to be made, but I \nsure hope we can pass this bill and then in due course have hearings \nand insist that we change the regulations, impose new ones, and do some \nof the things you have been talking about.\n  I thank you for letting me--I have had plenty of opportunity here on \nthe floor, and I did not mean to barge in on you, but I thought maybe \nwe could have a couple of minutes of exchange so we understand mutually \nthe problem.\n  Let me also say, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fooled a lot of us. I \ndon't ask that as a question of you because I do not want to ask you \nwhether you know it or not, but they were the instrument that permitted \nAmerica to have so many millions of homes in the hands of our people. \nBut they were, at certain times, the instrument of pushing through, as \nmortgage-backed securities, hundreds of thousands of mortgages on homes \nthat were being bought by purchasers who it was known could not afford \nwhat they were buying. They were in the merry business of the more the \nmerrier, whether they pay or not, and they got away with that, and they \nfooled me. I am not sure whether they fooled you, but they fooled a lot \nof Senators and Representatives. I think they have been caught, and I \nthink they are doing business differently. But they were the biggest \nones. You can talk about a bank here and there or someone running an \nadvertisement that looks as though it is bad, but they were the ones \nthat were pushing those through. And maybe they were asked to by the \nGovernment. There seems to be an enabling act passed that said they \nwere supposed to get out there and do that even if the people could not \nafford it.\n  Our American people ultimately, when this episode has ended, are \ngoing to be embarrassed with us that during this big-boom era of \nhousing, we were forcing on the market hundreds upon thousands of loans \nand mortgages in the hands of people that it was known upfront would \nnot be able to pay for the houses. That is what they are going to be \nsurprised about, when they find out that was the case as the hearings \ncommence on changing regulation, as you are suggesting, because we are \nprobably going to be able to identify how many hundreds of thousands of \nthose kinds of loans--they have a name; the name slips me, but we call \nthem toxic assets, but they are subprime loans. Fannie Mae and our \nFederal Government pushed so that we would sell more houses and get \nmore people in housing. We made a bad mistake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the comments of my colleague from New \nMexico. He has been involved in all of the great debates in this Senate \nfor a long time. I always appreciate his thoughts and comments.\n  Let me say that the collateralizing and securitizing of these exotic \ninstruments was not something that was done for fun; it was because it \ncould become very profitable to securitize everything, roll them up \ninto these little sausage deals and sell them upstream. Everybody was \nmaking a lot of money doing it, and nobody knew what was in them. The \ninteresting thing is that at least when you negotiated your home loan \nacross the desk of the banker in the old days, if you found a time when \nyou really could not make your payment--something happened, an illness \nin the family or something happened--you went back to the bank and sat \ndown and said: Look, here is my situation. Can we work something out? \nAnd the banker, in most cases, would say: I understand. Let's work \nsomething out. Nowadays, you do not know who has the mortgage. The \nlocal bank does not have it anymore; they have sold it. Countrywide \nmortgage bank had it. They do not have it for a very long period of \ntime. They have sold it to two or three different people, so you do not \neven know who has it.\n  That is why, as these things go belly-up, because I think they had \npredatory lending, I think they had terms in them that were \nunbelievable, resetting mortgages, and so on. These homeowners were set \nup for failure, and they have no one to go talk to to work it out.\n  That is precisely why one of the most important provisions that \nshould be in this new agreement, and I hope is in a new agreement, is \nsomething that some now strongly object to; that is, in a bankruptcy \nproceeding, allowing a bankruptcy court to discharge and allow the \nrenegotiation of that home loan. They would allow the renegotiation of \na second home or a mortgage on a boat or a mortgage on almost anything \nelse but not the prime home. That makes no sense.\n  If you believe--and I think most people do--that the foundation of \nthis mess we are in is these bad mortgages out there, these toxic \nsecurities, then the quickest and best and most effective way to begin \nputting some sort of a foundation under home values is to allow those \nwith those home loans that are troubled to be able to negotiate with \nsomebody; in this case, through a bankruptcy court, to negotiate that \nthey could continue to pay, albeit at a lower interest rate. At least \nyou would have someone who can stay in their home. You would have \nsomeone who is making a payment every month, probably not what they had \nintended to pay, but they are making the payment. They are in the home. \nThey have provided some value to that mortgage. All of a sudden that \nprovides a foundation. Instead of empty homes and mortgages that are \ndestroyed, you have someone living in the home with a mortgage and \nmaking monthly payments on it. That would provide some stability for \nhome values. It would keep some people in their homes. We have 2 \nmillion people this year who will have lost their homes. That is pretty \nunbelievable.\n  My colleague said it would be hard to put together a regime of doing \nthe necessary regulation of hedge funds or regulation of derivatives \ntrading. It would be difficult to do that. I am not suggesting they \nhave to do that. I am suggesting that they mimic what they did in the \noriginal bill on a couple other pieces and require by law a rulemaking \non the regulation of hedge funds, require by law a rulemaking on the \nregulation of derivatives by a date certain. They don't have to \ndescribe to me exactly what the rulemaking would require in detail or \nwhat the regulation would require in detail. At least we ought to \nexpect that we begin to reform and regulate, even as we try to rescue. \nOne of the important things the American people continue to ask--and it \nis a very important question--is, who is accountable for all of this? \nNot just how did it happen, but who is accountable? Who has been made \naccountable? The answer is no one. They all got away with their big \nbonuses and their money. The consequences are, we are bailing all these \norganizations out. We are creating bigger banks. These three banks will \nrepresent one-third of all the banking business in America now with \nthese new acquisitions. It used to be that we had these folks who were \ntoo big to fail. Now we have gotten them too ``bigger'' to fail. So no \nmatter what happens to them, the American taxpayer has to be the \nbackstop. We are going to have to bear the consequences of their \nfailure because they are bigger. They were too big to fail previously. \nWhere is the accountability for predatory lending that was out there? \nWhere is the accountability for brokers who were putting people into \nsubprime loans. They qualified for other loans, but they still put them \nin subprime. A substantial portion of subprime loans were put to people \nwho would qualify for regular loans. They put them in loans with very \nbad conditions in which they were almost destined to fail, with higher \ninterest rates being reset in the future.\n  People are also concerned about this issue of compensation. There are \nsome great CEOs in this country. There are people running companies and \nbanks and others who do a great job. But this has been a wild ride for \nunbelievably excessive compensation. Why is it that we read that \nWashington Mutual failed and last year the CEO made $14 million? For \nwhat? Maybe the board of directors will answer for what. Or AIG, the \nCEO made $14 million last year. They had a little operation over in\n\n[[Page S10146]]\n\nLondon that nearly brought that whole company down. We had to bail them \nout. Lehman Brothers, $22 million the previous year, Merrill Lynch, \n$161 million. There is plenty of reason for the American people to take \na look at all that and say: That is a carnival of greed, creating \nexotic financial instruments they can't even explain that are so \ncomplicated. Trading them upward and backward and sideways, everybody \nmaking massive amounts of money, and then all of a sudden it goes belly \nup and starts to pull down the entire financial system. All of a sudden \nwe are talking rescue, but nobody is talking regulate.\n  As I said, in my part of the country, they say that is not closing \nthe gate. You have to close the gate. You have to shut the gate. If you \ndon't include reform and if you don't include regulation, we are not \ngoing to solve this problem.\n  The next day and a half we will talk a lot about these issues. My \nhope is whoever is negotiating--I know some, and I have been in \nmeetings last evening on this subject--will understand the need that \nsome of us feel that anything that is done require the issues of reform \nand regulation that do not now exist in the plan that has been offered.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are postcloture on the motion to concur.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Paul Newman\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the life of a man and a \nfriend who passed away this past weekend, an American icon to many \nAmericans--in fact, not only to Americans but to people all over the \nworld--for more than half a century, a remarkable philanthropist in his \ngenerosity, a terrific husband, father to six children, a daredevil \nboth on the screen and off.\n  In words that have added poignancy at this moment, Paul Newman once \nsaid, ``We are such spendthrifts with our lives. The trick of living is \nto slip on and off the planet with the least fuss you can muster. I'm \nnot running for sainthood. I just happen to think that in life we need \nto be a little like the farmer, who puts back into the soil what he \ntakes out.''\n  The New York Times concluded its obituary of Paul Newman with those \nwords. But I would like them to begin my remarks, because I don't think \nthat will be the last thing people should consider when they remember \nPaul Newman, but the very first.\n  Where the charitable work of public figures today often seems \nmotivated less by the public interest than by public relations, Paul \nNewman was a rarity.\n  An enormous celebrity whose commitment to making a difference meant \nfar more to him than any box office, critical notice or award \nnomination. Believe me. Having known him or 25 years, I can attest to \nthat.\n  A star, with genuine humility, he cared deeply about the people, not \nonly of this country but around the world, and made a significant \ncontribution to their benefit in his own way. We are all, of course, \nfamiliar with the Newman's Own brand, which raised nearly a quarter-\nbillion dollars for charitable causes in a quarter century.\n  But that was only part of the story. Paul also founded the Hole In \nthe Wall Gang camps for children with life-threatening diseases that \nbegan in Ashford, CT and has since opened three on three different \ncontinents.\n  Those camps serve more than 15,000 children annually, with all \nservices provided free of charge to everyone.\n  He also founded the Rowdy Ridge Gang Camp, for families recovering \nfrom drug addiction and survivors of spousal abuse.\n  These were no vanity causes to which he simply attached his name and \nface.\n  Paul was intimately involved in their operations and success.\n  In fact, just this afternoon, I spoke with a friend of mine. I serve \non the advisory board of the Hole in the Wall Camp in Ashford, CT, but \na good friend of mine is on the board of directors of that camp. He had \nflown from San Francisco to be back in Connecticut today where people \nin the Hole in the Wall Gang camp are gathering to remember Paul \nNewman. They each got up and talked about his intimate involvement with \nthat camp. Believe me, as someone who has been involved on a daily \nbasis, he worked and cared about the maintenance of that facility, as \nhe did the ones on the other two continents I described.\n  Indeed, these examples remind us that every endeavor to which Paul \nNewman committed himself over his 83 years shared one fundamental \nquality: They were the product of an enduring appreciation for the \nspecial, unique place he was afforded in our society.\n  You could not spend any time with Paul without noticing that he had \nremarkable life.\n  A wife and family that were not there simply to support him, but to \npush and prod him, to tease him, to that wonderful kind of vitality we \nsee in vibrant families, a career that afforded him opportunities and \nexperiences many of the characters he played could not have imagined.\n  And Paul Newman knew it.\n  But as much as he recognized the good fortune behind his success, he \nalso understood the obligations that came with it.\n  This was never someone who pretended to be something he was not. He \ndid not rise from poverty or grow up in a broken home. His father was, \nin fact, a successful entrepreneur himself from the Shaker Heights \nsection of Cleveland, OH.\n  But to watch Paul's Oscar-nominated turn in that remarkable courtroom \ndrama, ``The Verdict,'' is to witness someone whose true kinship was \nnot with those who came from wealth, from power or privilege, but with \nthose who struggled, who earned, who overcame.\n  For all his generosity, kind-heartedness, and compassion, there was \nanother side to this man, one that was utterly driven to succeed, \nwhether it was acting or directing, film or theater, charity or \nbusiness.\n  I suspect I was not the only friend of Paul's who did not share his \npassion for racing, which he often did at our State's Lime Rock Park.\n  But compared to Hollywood, Paul found racing's lack of pretension \nrefreshing.\n  The pure love he had for the sport was what made it such a thrill for \nhim--a thrill he pursued into his eighties.\n  He was impossible to pigeonhole. I loved his sense of humor and \nirony, a devilish spirit which hid--just barely--a contempt for the \npredictable and lazy you couldn't help but admire.\n  He once commented that the ``single highest honor'' paid to him was \nlearning he was 19th on Nixon's so-called ``enemies list'' assembled by \nCharles Colson.\n  He named the Hole in the Wall Gang camps after Butch Cassidy's band \nof outlaws and offered cowboy hats to children who had lost their hair \nbecause of chemotherapy.\n  The first vat of Newman's Own salad dressing was stirred with a canoe \npaddle, to give some idea of his sense of humor.\n  And one of the biographies he wrote for a local production read, \n``Paul Newman is probably best known for his spectacularly successful \nfood conglomerate. In addition to giving the profits to charity he also \nran Frank Sinatra out of the spaghetti sauce business. On the downside, \nthe spaghetti sauce is outgrossing his films.''\n  Let it never be said there wasn't a sparkle in those famous blue eyes \nof Paul's to the end.\n  In a career that required him to fabricate many a character and \nexperience, Paul Newman's rebellious yet playful quality always struck \nme as completely genuine.\n  It often masked and helped him promote some very serious work.\n  A resident of Westport, CT he made enduring contributions to our \nState. Some will remember that he insisted on holding the first movie \npremiere in New Haven history when ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance \nKid'' made\n\n[[Page S10147]]\n\nits debut at the Roger Sherman theater. The Presiding Officer is \nfamiliar with that community.\n  But for the sprinkle of glitter a star of Paul's magnitude brought to \nConnecticut, the difference he made to our communities was far more \nlasting--from helping to preserve open spaces such as the Trout Brook \nValley and renovate the Westport Historical Society and its Country \nPlayhouse, to the active role he played in government at the local, \nState, and Federal levels.\n  Like all Americans at this hour, I will miss him, a great guy and a \ngood friend. As much as I will miss his friendship and his performances \non the television screen or at the movie theater, I will miss being \nreminded every time that we saw him just how good and decent a man he \ntruly was.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are, obviously, with Joanne, his lovely \nwife, his daughters, and the rest of the Newman family.\n  I wanted to thank them for sharing with us these many years a great \nguy.\n  Mr. President, I have a wonderful obituary that was written in the \nNew York Times. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 28, 2008]\n\n       Paul Newman, a Magnetic Titan of Hollywood, Is Dead at 83\n\n                          (By Aljean Harmetz)\n\n       Paul Newman, one of the last of the great 20th-century \n     movie stars, died Friday at his home in Westport, Conn. He \n     was 83.\n       The cause was cancer, said Jeff Sanderson of Chasen & \n     Company, Mr. Newman's publicists.\n       If Marlon Brando and James Dean defined the defiant \n     American male as a sullen rebel, Paul Newman recreated him as \n     a likable renegade, a strikingly handsome figure of animal \n     high spirits and blue-eyed candor whose magnetism was almost \n     impossible to resist, whether the character was Hud, Cool \n     Hand Luke or Butch Cassidy.\n       He acted in more than 65 movies over more than 50 years, \n     drawing on a physical grace, unassuming intelligence and good \n     humor that made it all seem effortless. Yet he was also an \n     ambitious, intellectual actor and a passionate student of his \n     craft, and he achieved what most of his peers find \n     impossible: remaining a major star into a craggy, charismatic \n     old age even as he redefined himself as more than Hollywood \n     star. He raced cars, opened summer camps for ailing children \n     and became a nonprofit entrepreneur with a line of foods that \n     put his picture on supermarket shelves around the world.\n       Mr. Newman made his Hollywood debut in the 1954 costume \n     film ``The Silver Chalice.'' Stardom arrived a year and a \n     half later, when he inherited from James Dean the role of the \n     boxer Rocky Graziano in ``Somebody Up There Likes Me.'' Mr. \n     Dean had been killed in a car crash before the screenplay was \n     finished.\n       It was a rapid rise for Mr. Newman, but being taken \n     seriously as an actor took longer. He was almost undone by \n     his star power, his classic good looks and, most of all, his \n     brilliant blue eyes. ``I picture my epitaph,'' he once said. \n     ``Here lies Paul Newman, who died a failure because his eyes \n     turned brown.''\n       Mr. Newman's filmography was a cavalcade of flawed heroes \n     and winning antiheroes stretching over decades. In 1958 he \n     was a drifting confidence man determined to marry a Southern \n     belle in an adaptation of ``The Long, Hot Summer.'' In 1982, \n     in ``The Verdict,'' he was a washed-up alcoholic lawyer who \n     finds a chance to redeem himself in a medical malpractice \n     case.\n       And in 2002, at 77, having lost none of his charm, he was \n     affably deadly as Tom Hanks's gangster boss in ``Road to \n     Perdition.'' It was his last onscreen role in a major \n     theatrical release. (He supplied the voice of the veteran \n     race car Doc in the Pixar animated film ``Cars'' in 2006.)\n       Few major American stars have chosen to play so many \n     imperfect men.\n       As Hud Bannon in ``Hud'' (1963) Mr. Newman was a heel on \n     the Texas range who wanted the good life and was willing to \n     sell diseased cattle to get it. The character was intended to \n     make the audience feel ``loathing and disgust,'' Mr. Newman \n     told a reporter. Instead, he said, ``we created a folk \n     hero.''\n       As the self-destructive convict in ``Cool Hand Luke'' \n     (1967) Mr. Newman was too rebellious to be broken by a brutal \n     prison system. As Butch Cassidy in ``Butch Cassidy and the \n     Sundance Kid'' (1969) he was the most amiable and antic of \n     bank robbers, memorably paired with Robert Redford. And in \n     ``The Hustler'' (1961) he was the small-time pool shark Fast \n     Eddie, a role he recreated 25 years later, now as a well-\n     heeled middle-aged liquor salesman, in ``The Color of Money'' \n     (1986). That performance, alongside Tom Cruise, brought Mr. \n     Newman his sole Academy Award, for best actor, after he had \n     been nominated for that prize six times. In all he received \n     eight Oscar nominations for best actor and one for best \n     supporting actor, in ``Road to Perdition.'' ``Rachel, \n     Rachel,'' which he directed, was nominated for best picture.\n       ``When a role is right for him, he's peerless,'' the film \n     critic Pauline Kael wrote in 1977. ``Newman is most \n     comfortable in a role when it isn't scaled heroically; even \n     when he plays a bastard, he's not a big bastard--only a \n     callow, selfish one, like Hud. He can play what he's not--a \n     dumb lout. But you don't believe it when he plays someone \n     perverse or vicious, and the older he gets and the better you \n     know him, the less you believe it. His likableness is \n     infectious; nobody should ever be asked not to like Paul \n     Newman.''\n       But the movies and the occasional stage role were never \n     enough for him. He became a successful racecar driver, \n     winning several Sports Car Club of America national driving \n     titles. He even competed at Daytona in 1995 as a 70th \n     birthday present to himself. In 1982, as a lark, he \n     decided to sell a salad dressing he had created and \n     bottled for friends at Christmas. Thus was born the \n     Newman's Own brand, an enterprise he started with his \n     friend A. E. Hotchner, the writer. More than 25 years \n     later the brand has expanded to include, among other \n     foods, lemonade, popcorn, spaghetti sauce, pretzels, \n     organic Fig Newmans and wine. (His daughter Nell Newman \n     runs the company's organic arm.) All its profits, of more \n     than $200 million, have been donated to charity, the \n     company says.\n       Much of the money was used to create a string of Hole in \n     the Wall Gang Camps, named for the outlaw gang in ``Butch \n     Cassidy.'' The camps provide free summer recreation for \n     children with cancer and other serious illnesses. Mr. Newman \n     was actively involved in the project, even choosing cowboy \n     hats as gear so that children who had lost their hair because \n     of chemotherapy could disguise their baldness. Several years \n     before the establishment of Newman's Own, on Nov. 28, 1978, \n     Scott Newman, the oldest of Mr. Newman's six children and his \n     only son, died at 28 of an overdose of alcohol and pills. His \n     father's monument to him was the Scott Newman Center, created \n     to publicize the dangers of drugs and alcohol. It is headed \n     by Susan Newman, the oldest of his five daughters.\n       Mr. Newman's three younger daughters are the children of \n     his 50-year second marriage, to the actress Joanne Woodward. \n     Mr. Newman and Ms. Woodward both were cast--she as an \n     understudy--in the Broadway play ``Picnic'' in 1953. Starting \n     with ``The Long, Hot Summer'' in 1958, they co-starred in 10 \n     movies, including ``From the Terrace'' (1960), based on a \n     John O'Hara novel about a driven executive and his unfaithful \n     wife; ``Harry & Son'' (1984), which Mr. Newman also directed, \n     produced and helped write; and ``Mr. & Mrs. Bridge'' (1990), \n     James Ivory's version of a pair of Evan S. Connell novels, in \n     which Mr. Newman and Ms. Woodward played a conservative \n     Midwestern couple coping with life's changes.\n       When good roles for Ms. Woodward dwindled, Mr. Newman \n     produced and directed ``Rachel, Rachel'' for her in 1968. \n     Nominated for the best-picture Oscar, the film, a delicate \n     story of a spinster schoolteacher tentatively hoping for \n     love, brought Ms. Woodward her second of four best-actress \n     Oscar nominations. (She won the award on her first \n     nomination, for the 1957 film ``The Three Faces of Eve,'' and \n     was nominated again for her roles in ``Mr. & Mrs. Bridge'' \n     and the 1973 movie ``Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams.'')\n       Mr. Newman also directed his wife in ``The Effect of Gamma \n     Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds'' (1972), ``The Glass \n     Menagerie'' (1987) and the television movie ``The Shadow \n     Box'' (1980). As a director his most ambitious film was \n     ``Sometimes a Great Notion'' (1971), based on the Ken Kesey \n     novel.\n       In an industry in which long marriages might be defined as \n     those that last beyond the first year and the first \n     infidelity, Mr. Newman and Ms. Woodward's was striking for \n     its endurance. But they admitted that it was often turbulent. \n     She loved opera and ballet. He liked playing practical jokes \n     and racing cars. But as Mr. Newman told Playboy magazine, in \n     an often-repeated quotation about marital fidelity, ``I have \n     steak at home; why go out for hamburger?''\n\n\n                        Beginnings in Cleveland\n\n       Paul Leonard Newman was born on Jan. 26, 1925, in \n     Cleveland. His mother, the former Teresa Fetzer, was a Roman \n     Catholic who turned to Christian Science. His father, Arthur, \n     who was Jewish, owned a thriving sporting goods store that \n     enabled the family to settle in affluent Shaker Heights, \n     Ohio, where Paul and his older brother, Arthur, grew up.\n       Teresa Newman, an avid theatergoer, steered her son toward \n     acting as a child. In high school, besides playing football, \n     he acted in school plays, graduating in 1943. After less than \n     a year at Ohio University at Athens, he joined the Navy Air \n     Corps to be a pilot. When a test showed he was colorblind, he \n     was made an aircraft radio operator.\n       After the war Mr. Newman entered Kenyon College in Ohio on \n     an athletic scholarship. He played football and acted in a \n     dozen plays before graduating in 1949. Arthur Newman, a \n     strict and distant man, thought acting an impractical \n     occupation, but, perhaps persuaded by his wife, he agreed to \n     support his son for a year while Paul acted in small theater \n     companies.\n       In May 1950 his father died, and Mr. Newman returned to \n     Cleveland to run the sporting goods store. He brought with \n     him a wife, Jacqueline Witte, an actress he had met in summer \n     stock. But after 18 months Paul asked his brother to take \n     over the business\n\n[[Page S10148]]\n\n     while he, his wife and their year-old son, Scott, headed for \n     Yale University, where Mr. Newman intended to concentrate on \n     directing.\n       He left Yale in the summer of 1952, perhaps because the \n     money had run out and his wife was pregnant again. But almost \n     immediately, the director Josh Logan and the playwright \n     William Inge gave him a small role in ``Picnic,'' a play that \n     was to run 14 months on Broadway. Soon he was playing the \n     second male lead and understudying Ralph Meeker as the sexy \n     drifter who roils the women in a Kansas town. Mr. Newman and \n     Ms. Woodward were attracted to each other in rehearsals of \n     ``Picnic.'' But he was a married man, and Ms. Woodward has \n     insisted that they spent the next several years running away \n     from each other.\n       In the early 1950s roles in live television came easily to \n     both of them. Mr. Newman starred in segments of ``You Are \n     There,'' ``Goodyear Television Playhouse'' and other shows.\n       He was also accepted as a student at the Actors Studio in \n     New York, where he took lessons alongside James Dean, \n     Geraldine Page, Marlon Brando and, eventually, Ms. Woodward.\n       Then Hollywood knocked. In 1954 Warner Brothers offered Mr. \n     Newman $1,000 a week to star in ``The Silver Chalice'' as the \n     Greek slave who creates the silver cup used at the Last \n     Supper. Mr. Newman, who rarely watched his own films, once \n     gave out pots, wooden spoons and whistles to a roomful of \n     guests and forced them to sit through ``The Silver Chalice,'' \n     which he called the worst movie ever made. His antidote for \n     that early Hollywood experience was to hurry back to \n     Broadway. In Joseph Hayes's play ``The Desperate Hours,'' he \n     starred as an escaped convict who holds a family hostage. The \n     play was a hit, and during its run, Jacqueline Newman gave \n     birth to their third child.\n       On his nights off Mr. Newman acted on live television. In \n     one production he had the title role in ``The Death of Billy \n     the Kid,'' a psychological study of the outlaw written by \n     Gore Vidal and directed by Robert Mulligan for ``Philco \n     Playhouse''; in another, an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's \n     short story ``The Battler,'' he took over the lead role after \n     James Dean, who had been scheduled to star, was killed on \n     Sept. 30, 1955. Mr. Penn, who directed ``The Battler,'' was \n     later sure that Mr. Newman's performance in that drama, as a \n     disfigured prizefighter, won him the lead role in ``Somebody \n     Up There Likes Me,'' again replacing Dean. When Mr. Penn \n     adapted the Billy the Kid teleplay for his first Hollywood \n     film, ``The Left Handed Gun,'' in 1958, he again cast Mr. \n     Newman in the lead.\n       Even so, Mr. Newman was saddled for years with an image of \n     being a ``pretty boy'' lightweight.\n       ``Paul suffered a little bit from being so handsome--people \n     doubted just how well he could act,'' Mr. Penn told the \n     authors of the 1988 book ``Paul and Joanne.'' By 1957 Mr. \n     Newman and Ms. Woodward were discreetly living together in \n     Hollywood; his wife had initially refused to give him a \n     divorce. He later admitted that his drinking was out of \n     control during this period.\n       With his divorce granted, Mr. Newman and Ms. Woodward were \n     married on Jan. 29, 1958, and went on to rear their three \n     daughters far from Hollywood, in a farmhouse on 15 acres in \n     Westport, Conn.\n       That same year Mr. Newman played Brick, the reluctant \n     husband of Maggie the Cat, in the film version of Tennessee \n     Williams's ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' earning his first \n     Academy Award nomination, for best actor. In 1961, with ``The \n     Hustler,'' he earned his second best-actor Oscar nomination. \n     He had become more than a matinee idol.\n\n\n                        Directed by Martin Ritt\n\n       Many of his meaty performances during the early '60s came \n     in movies directed by Martin Ritt, who had been a teaching \n     assistant to Elia Kazan at the Actors Studio when Mr. \n     Newman was a student. After directing ``The Long, Hot \n     Summer,'' Mr. Ritt directed Mr. Newman in ``Paris Blues'' \n     (1961), a story of expatriate musicians; ``Hemingway's \n     Adventures of a Young Man'' (1962); ``Hud'' (1963), which \n     brought Mr. Newman a third Oscar nomination; ``The \n     Outrage'' (1964), with Mr. Newman as the bandit in a \n     western based on Akira Kurosawa's ``Rashomon''; and \n     ``Hombre'' (1967), in which Mr. Newman played a white man, \n     reared by Indians, struggling to live in a white world.\n       Among his other important films were Otto Preminger's \n     ``Exodus'' (1960), Alfred Hitchcock's ``Torn Curtain'' (1966) \n     and Jack Smight's ``Harper'' (1966), in which he played Ross \n     Macdonald's private detective Lew Archer.\n       In 1968--after he was cast as an ice-cold racecar driver in \n     ``Winning,'' with Ms. Woodward playing his frustrated wife--\n     Mr. Newman was sent to a racing school. In midlife racing \n     became his obsession. A Web site--newman-haas.com--details \n     his racing career, including his first race in 1972; his \n     first professional victory, in 1982; and his co-ownership of \n     the Newman/Haas Indy racing team, which won eight series \n     championships.\n       A politically active liberal Democrat, Mr. Newman was a \n     Eugene McCarthy delegate to the 1968 Democratic convention \n     and appointed by President Jimmy Carter to a United Nations \n     General Assembly session on disarmament. He expressed pride \n     at being on President Richard M. Nixon's enemies list.\n       When Mr. Newman turned 50, he settled into a new career as \n     a character actor, playing the title role--``with just the \n     right blend of craftiness and stupidity,'' Janet Maslin wrote \n     in The New York Times--of Robert Altman's ``Buffalo Bill and \n     the Indians'' (1976); an unscrupulous hockey coach in George \n     Roy Hill's ``Slap Shot'' (1977); and the disintegrating \n     lawyer in Sidney Lumet's ``Verdict.''\n       Most of Mr. Newman's films were commercial hits, probably \n     none more so than ``The Sting'' (1973), in which he teamed \n     with Mr. Redford again to play a couple of con men, and ``The \n     Towering Inferno'' (1974), in which he played an architect in \n     an all-star cast that included Steve McQueen and Faye \n     Dunaway.\n       After his fifth best-actor Oscar nomination, for his \n     portrait of an innocent man discredited by the press in \n     Sydney Pollack's ``Absence of Malice'' (1981), and his sixth \n     a year later, for ``The Verdict,'' the Academy of Motion \n     Picture Arts and Sciences in 1986 gave Mr. Newman the \n     consolation prize of an honorary award. In a videotaped \n     acceptance speech he said, ``I am especially grateful that \n     this did not come wrapped in a gift certificate to Forest \n     Lawn.''\n       His best-actor Oscar, for ``The Color of Money,'' came the \n     next year, and at the 1994 Oscars ceremony he received the \n     Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. The year after that he \n     earned his eighth nomination as best actor, for his \n     curmudgeonly construction worker trying to come to terms \n     with his failures in ``Nobody's Fool'' (1994). In 2003 he \n     was nominated as best supporting actor for his work in \n     ``Road to Perdition.'' And in 2006 he took home both a \n     Golden Globe and an Emmy for playing another rough-hewn \n     old-timer, this one in the HBO mini-series ``Empire \n     Falls.''\n       Besides Ms. Woodward and his daughters Susan and Nell, he \n     is survived by three other daughters, Stephanie, Melissa and \n     Clea; two grandchildren; and his brother. Mr. Newman returned \n     to Broadway for the last time in 2002, as the Stage Manager \n     in a lucrative revival of Thornton Wilder's ``Our Town.'' The \n     performance was nominated for a Tony Award, though critics \n     tended to find it modest. When the play was broadcast on PBS \n     in 2003, he won an Emmy.\n       This year he had planned to direct ``Of Mice and Men,'' \n     based on the John Steinbeck novel, in October at the Westport \n     Country Playhouse in Connecticut. But in May he announced \n     that he was stepping aside, citing his health.\n       Mr. Newman's last screen credit was as the narrator of Bill \n     Haney's documentary ``The Price of Sugar,'' released this \n     year. By then he had all but announced that he was through \n     with acting.\n       ``I'm not able to work anymore as an actor at the level I \n     would want to,'' Mr. Newman said last year on the ABC program \n     ``Good Morning America.'' ``You start to lose your memory, \n     your confidence, your invention. So that's pretty much a \n     closed book for me.''\n       But he remained fulfilled by his charitable work, saying it \n     was his greatest legacy, particularly in giving ailing \n     children a camp at which to play.\n       ``We are such spendthrifts with our lives,'' Mr. Newman \n     once told a reporter. ``The trick of living is to slip on and \n     off the planet with the least fuss you can muster. I'm not \n     running for sainthood. I just happen to think that in life we \n     need to be a little like the farmer, who puts back into the \n     soil what he takes out.''\n\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, could the Chair inform us whether there \nis an order for proceeding? It was my understanding we were \nalternating, going back and forth. I would inform the Senators on the \nfloor I have a 5-minute tribute to Senator Warner. But I am unaware of \nwhat the order is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order or agreement. We are \noperating postcloture under the motion.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I had intended to speak, but with an \nunderstanding that is the presentation by the Senator from Maine, I ask \nunanimous consent that after the Senator from Maine is recognized by \nthe Chair, I would be recognized following that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank the Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n\n\n                          Senator John Warner\n\n  Mr. President, throughout our Nation's history, the Commonwealth of \nVirginia has provided leaders of uncommon courage, dedication, and \nvision. The names that are revered in the Old Dominion are honored \nacross\n\n[[Page S10149]]\n\nAmerica: Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, Mason, and Henry, to name but a \nfew.\n  Today, as the 110th Congress draws to a close, we say farewell to \nanother great Virginian, a great patriot, public servant, and \ndistinguished colleague whose name history will add to that honor roll: \nthe name of our friend and colleague, Senator John Warner.\n  Senator Warner's career mirrors those of the Founding Fathers in many \nways. During World War II, when freedom was under attack, he enlisted \nin the U.S. Navy at just 17 years of age.\n  Following the war, he rejoined civilian life, earned a college \ndegree, and entered law school. At the outbreak of the Korean war, he \nsuspended his studies to serve his Nation once again, this time as an \nofficer in the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  After he returned from Korea, he completed his law degree but \nremained an officer in the Reserves, always ready to answer the call of \nhis Nation. Senator John Warner truly exemplifies the American \ntradition of the citizen soldier.\n  As a civilian, John Warner continued to serve: as an assistant U.S. \nattorney, as Under Secretary of the Navy, and as Secretary of the Navy. \nDuring his 5 years in the Navy's Secretariat, he demonstrated another \nAmerican tradition: a commitment to both military strength and \ndiplomacy.\n  It is fitting that one so steeped in the best of America's traditions \nwas chosen by the President, in 1976, to coordinate our Nation's \nbicentennial celebrations in all 50 States and in 22 foreign countries.\n  It was in 1978 that the wise citizens of Virginia sent John Warner to \nthe U.S. Senate. For 30 years, the people of America have been \ngrateful. The hallmark of Senator Warner's service in the Senate has \nbeen his absolute and unwavering commitment to a strong national \ndefense. It has been my honor to serve with him on two committees that \nbear directly upon that commitment--the Senate Armed Services Committee \nand the Senate Homeland Security Committee.\n  As the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Warner has consistently upheld the pledge he took to defend \nAmerica when he enlisted in the Navy 63 years ago. His support for our \nmen and women in uniform, for their families, and for our veterans is \nunwavering. He has been an effective and strong advocate for \nmodernizing our military to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\n  Senator Warner also understands that America's future does not just \ndepend upon defending our Nation against attack. I am proud to have \nworked with him on climate change legislation, and his leadership on \nthe America's Climate Security Act with our friend, Senator Joe \nLieberman, demonstrates his commitment to protecting our environment \nand to securing our energy future.\n  Senator Warner's career has been defined by his involvement in some \nof the most pressing issues of our time. But he has also worked hard on \nthose seemingly smaller issues that make a big difference in people's \nlives. As just one example, he joined me in authoring the tax deduction \nfor teachers who spend their own money on classroom supplies. Whether \nin uniform or in our classrooms, John Warner believes those who serve \nhave earned our gratitude and our support.\n  Also, we remember John Warner's pivotal role at a time when our \ninstitution of the Senate was at a threshold of chaos and dysfunction. \nI refer to his leadership in the so-called Gang of 14, which worked out \na compromise on judicial nominations that helped save this institution \nfrom what would have otherwise been a very bleak time.\n  Senator Warner has continued and enhanced the best traditions of this \nNation and of the Commonwealth of Virginia in countless ways. One that \nmust be mentioned, before I conclude my remarks, is his unfailing \ncivility and courtesy toward his Senate colleagues. Regardless of the \nsignificance of the issue or the intensity of the debate or the \nstrength of his colleagues' feelings, Senator Warner has always \ntempered staunch advocacy for his convictions with the utmost respect \nfor the convictions of others.\n  On a personal note, he has been a wonderful friend and mentor to me, \nthe Senator from Maine. I know all Americans join me today in thanking \nSenator John Warner for his dedicated decades of service to his \ncountry, whether in times of peace or war, and in wishing him all the \nbest in the years to come.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is sometimes somewhat breathless to be \nseated on this Senate floor knowing that just maybe 48 hours remain of \nmy career in the Senate. I shall remain in office through early \nJanuary, but I tell you, it takes me a few minutes to assemble my \nthoughts. But in your case, I would say: Look at the many things we \nhave worked on together.\n  This fine Senator is so proud of the Naval installations in her \nState. We visited the shipyard together, indeed the facilities at \nPortsmouth. The ships are made there. The ships are berthed there. It \nhas been home to the U.S. Navy, I imagine, from the earliest days of \nthe formation of our Colonies and the first of the ships we had.\n  I hope what I am about to say is fully understood. But those of us--I \nhave had some modest career in the Navy in my lifetime--but we always \nrefer to the ship in an affectionate way, as if it were a female. \nIndeed, it does protect the sailors at sea with its steadiness and its \nseaworthiness, and we often refer to the ships as the fighting lady.\n  I say to the Senator, I would hope that you would accept that as an \naccolade, the fighting lady from Maine. We have watched you under the \ntoughest of circumstances. One time I remember working with you and \nyour tenacity was fierce, and you really sort of turned back a lot of \nmy thoughts which I thought were so important. But it worked out in the \nend. You prevailed and that was the development of the legislation \nwhich reconstructed, reformulated so much of our intelligence \ncommunity. That was truly a masterful accomplishment on your part.\n  Again, the reason I am a bit breathless is when I first came to the \nSenate, these 30 years ago, there were not any ladies in the Senate at \nthat time. We were joined in my class by Nancy Kassebaum from Kansas, a \nwonderful lady. Believe me, she very quickly established her own \nstature. We all admired her tremendously as a very strong Senator, \nwhich she was throughout her career. But from that small beginning \ncommenced the transformation of the Senate in many ways--from the one \nlady--she certainly was a fighting lady, too--to where today we have \nmany. As a matter of fact, we do not even count them anymore because \nthey just have gotten into the full fabric of the Senate and everybody \nis just totally unconscious to that except, I guess, people like \nmyself, with a wandering eye, constantly taking a look at the dress one \nday and compliment my dear friends.\n  But on a serious note, we have had a marvelous, strong friendship and \nworking relationship, and I shall miss you dearly, as I will this \ninstitution. But I do leave with the thought that you are one of the \ngreat strengths of this institution which will be called upon, as it is \nin this hour. The Nation calls upon this body to save it.\n  I was looking last night, as I was trying to drift off to a rest, at \nthe famous poem that was written, ``O Ship Of State.'' Do you remember \nthat poem? And America today is looking to its Congress like few times \nin history. ``O Ship Of State''--I have that poem on my desk.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to have that poem printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            O Ship of State\n\n                    (By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow)\n\n     Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\n     Sail on, O Union, strong and great!\n     Humanity with all its fears,\n     With all the hopes of future years,\n     Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\n     We know what Master laid thy keel,\n     What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\n     Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\n     What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\n     In what a forge and what a heat\n     Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!\n     Fear not each sudden sound and shock,\n     `Tis of the wave and not the rock;\n     `Tis but the flapping of the sail,\n     And not a rent made by the gale!\n     In spite of rock and tempest's roar,\n     In spite of false lights on the shore,\n\n[[Page S10150]]\n\n     Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!\n     Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee.\n     Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,\n     Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,\n     Are all with thee,--are all with thee!\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I see the Senator is desiring to speak.\n  But those two things remind me that this great ship of State will \nsail on and you will be at the helm. I wish you the best.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his \nvery kind and thoughtful comments. At a time when we are attempting to \npay tribute to him, he, of course, is gracious to others.\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his tolerance on the extra \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nJersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I was happy to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine on her recognition of Senator Warner. \nI certainly join in her comments about Senator Warner, as we did \nrecently when the Senator appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and recognized his tremendous service to this institution and \nto the country. I often say, as I said to him before at the hearing, \nthat, in fact, I am privileged I came to the Senate at a time when I \ngot to serve with John Warner and to see some of the finest traditions \nof service in this country. I appreciate his tremendous service, not \njust to the people of Virginia but to the people of this Nation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the gracious Senator from New \nJersey. I appreciate those remarks. Although it has been short-lived, \nwe have had a good, strong working relationship; not always on the same \nside on several issues, but that is what democracy is all about. I \nthank the Senator.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the distinguished Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to talk about the financial crisis our country \nis facing. I think to classify it as such is an understanding most \nAmericans have. It is not an overstatement. The reality shows that \ntoday in a Washington Post ABC News poll, most Americans see the \ncurrent financial situation as a crisis, and there is overwhelming \nconcern that the failure of the House of Representatives to pass the \neconomic recovery package may very well deepen that problem.\n  I think it is important to note the poll also revealed significant \npublic concern with the bill that Congress rejected yesterday. Few \nvoters have said the package did enough to protect ordinary Americans \nand nearly half said it did not go far enough to shore up the Nation's \neconomy. Half said the failed plan did not do enough to help the \nbroader economy, and 61 percent said there was insufficient assistance \nfor the general public.\n  I think it is important, as we try to move forward in this \ninstitution and show some leadership, to keep those realities in mind--\nof what our constituents back at home are saying. They recognize there \nis a crisis. They also recognize there is a challenge to them in the \nmainstream economy, and they felt as though that specific package \ndidn't do enough for them. So many Americans--I would say the great \nmajority of Americans--who are meeting their obligations with \ntremendous stress and challenges, who meet their monthly mortgage \npayments--have for years and have continued to do so--what they \nreasonably want to know is what do they get out of this?\n  As my home State newspaper, the Star Ledger, said: Why, they continue \nto ask, should taxpayers have to subsidize the stupidity of people who \nwere either greedy or maybe failed to do their homework? They go on to \nsay in the editorial the real problem in Washington is that no one has \nmade a cogent argument for why, in essence--this is paraphrasing--for \nwhy, in essence, we need to have a response and what does it mean to \nthose who are not investment bankers or whose homes aren't in \nforeclosure.\n  I think the economists generally agree the Nation's economy is at a \nserious risk of the flow of credit threatening to freeze beyond where \nit is already. We see the interest rates at which banks lend to each \nother rising each and every day, suggesting that lenders are hoarding \ncash. I think that gets to the question of what the editorials have \nsaid in my home State and others as well: So then what is the case to \nbe made?\n  Well, with banks leery of lending to each other, credit markets \ncontract, making it difficult for businesses to obtain loans for \nexpansion, to start new ventures or even to cover bills until \nunanticipated revenue comes in; car loans dry up, causing further \nsuffering among the already ailing automakers; credit card interest \nrates rise, and all that forces, in essence, markets to shed jobs, \ncreating more unemployment. Overall, this bleak fiscal picture causes \nconsumers to scale back on spending, and then the little shop on Main \nStreet closes as well. That is a broad brush. I would like to get to \nsome of the specifics of how that affects us.\n  When we have watched the news or picked up a newspaper over the last \nfew months, we see top stories about the problems of big institutions: \nBear Stearns and Washington Mutual and Wachovia. It has been easy to \nsee what dire straits our financial system is in, but what is not \nmaking the headlines is what this economic crisis means for people in \nour hometowns.\n  We have heard a lot about mortgage-backed securities, credit default \nswaps, and overnight lending rates. To be very honest with my \ncolleagues, to a large number of Americans that is a foreign language--\nbut not about what they actually mean in terms of mortgages, credit \ncard bills, and week-to-week budgets of our families. Those are items \nwhich they clearly understand and speak about around the kitchen table \nas they face challenges.\n  I think some of us have been left with a mistaken impression that \nthis crisis is just about Wall Street. I am worried people on every \nstreet in this country, who are being powerfully affected by this \ncrisis, are being forgotten.\n  Now, the heart of this crisis is the housing market. So many houses \nare going into foreclosure that now it is hard for anybody to get a \nloan of any kind, to buy a home, to invest in a business or have that \nbusiness grow, to get a college education. There is a credit freeze so \nbusinesses can't grow. They can't pay expenses. They can't look to the \nfuture. It is becoming a financial wildfire, ravishing our economy and \nburning away at the fabric of our communities. The crisis stretches \nacross every city in, for example, my home State, but it is replicated \nacross the landscape of the country, North and South and East and West.\n  In Newark, there is a single mother who has lost her job and now \nholds down three different part-time jobs to make up for it, while her \nkids are at home by themselves. In Clifton, there is a couple who work \ntwo jobs and bring in $4,000 a month together, but when the mortgage \npayment, the car payment, the electricity and gas, utility bills come \nin, and the grocery bills and the credit card bills come in every \nmonth, they worry they can't make ends meet. In another part of the \nState, there is a builder who is finding it almost impossible to get \nfunding to keep his business going. Banks want bigger deposits, bigger \nmonthly payments, and stricter payment deadlines.\n  Today, I wish to focus on what the credit crunch means for every New \nJerseyan and American--the jobs, the businesses or anyone who needs a \nloan to drive a car or go to college--and what it means for those who \nare closer to the twilight of their life and are thinking about their \nretirement and what that retirement has meant to them in terms of what \nis taking place and what will continue to take place if we see no \naction and how they may very well have to extend the time in which they \nthought they could retire.\n  Let's talk about businesses, especially small businesses, because \nthey are the ones that create 75 percent of all the jobs in America. We \nhave always been an entrepreneurial people. We have always had the \nideas and are willing to take intelligent risks to start a business, \nand those businesses are the ones that create jobs. They rent stores. \nThey buy buildings. Those people who are employed ultimately are \ngainfully employed in a way that they have income to spend in other \nbusinesses for goods and services they\n\n[[Page S10151]]\n\nneed, which employ other people, and, of course, these businesses pay \nrevenues, to their local, State, and Federal entities. So we can see \nthe cycle of how important they are.\n\n  Now, if you want to start a business, this is one of the worst \nclimates in our history to do so. Loans aren't available, even to \npeople with good credit, and especially not to entrepreneurs who are \ngetting started. So that dream of Americans having business ownership \nis now miles further away. But the credit crunch hurts small \nbusinesses. There are those of us who every day are feeling restricted \nin our spending and frugal when we open our checkbooks. That means we \naren't going, for example, to see this lady at the counter. She is \nultimately at the other end of the business cycle. We are restricted in \nour spending. This is a reality. It is a reality we feel in our lives. \nWe see what is happening in the country. We may already have faced some \npressures in our own economic circumstances in a personal family way, \nso we hold back. We say: Let's see what will happen. How do I decide? \nSo we restrict our spending and we are frugal when we open our \ncheckbooks. That is probably in many ways smart, but there is also a \nconsequence. That means a lot of us aren't going out to eat as much, \nwhich means the waitress isn't getting the tips she depended on to \nbring home for her family and the challenges her family has, and owners \nof that business aren't getting the checks they depend on, which means \nrestaurants have to either contract dramatically the size of their \nworkforce, or, in the acute set of circumstances, they have to close. \nIt means the local retailer--perhaps from whom we buy the treat we have \nonce a week at the end of a long week or a gift we are buying for a \nfamily member or a friend's birthday--will see depleting sales. As \ntheir cash input decreases, they have to decrease their output, and \nthey will be giving pink slips to their employees. It means we see more \nof this sign that says ``store closed'' for business. It means the \nlocal lunch spot or the barber will not have the same lunchtime rush or \nthe same Saturday appointments. While we certainly can all live without \na haircut as frequently or without eating our favorite sandwich, those \nshop owners depend on our steady business. They depend on that \nappointment to make ends meet. When, in fact, that doesn't happen, \nthere is a consequence to them and those who work there and the \nfamilies of all who are situated there.\n  Small businesses don't have access to capital because banks have \nseverely cut back in lending. So, for example, when my dear father was \nalive, he was an itinerant carpenter, and he used to go to the lumber \nshop where he had a little bit of credit to get some supplies as he did \nthe business--the work for the people who hired him--but that lumber \nstore obviously had to get their suppliers and the credit that, in \nfact, they needed to get those supplies there, to then extend credit to \nhim so he would be able to go ahead and do the job and then get paid \nand then pay for his supplies and the chain goes on. When, in fact, \nthat chain is broken, there is a consequence, and the consequence of \nthat is people lose their employment. There is a ripple effect. It is \nnot only they who lose their employment but all the resources they had \nin making the purchase of goods and services that ultimately hired \nother people and who had families and who had needs and who made \nexpenditures. So we see the consequences of that.\n  In the construction field, for example, we have a set of \ncircumstances where, in fact, you have contractors who get a job in \nsouthern New Jersey, but he doesn't get paid for that job upfront.\n  He makes a bid. It might be a public contract or it might be a \nprivate construction project. He doesn't get paid up front. So that \ncontractor needs credit.\n  What does he need the credit for? He needs the credit for the \nsupplies to bring to the job to do the work. He needs credit for \nfloating so that he can keep his payroll going for the people he has to \npay up front every week so they can do the work that creates the home \nor the building or the business structure that ultimately will pay \nthem, and they will repay their credit from their suppliers and then \nultimately be able to make a profit.\n  Again, all of those construction materials that are provided to that \ncontractor, those people, those entities have credit as it relates to \nthose who provide the supplies that they sell to contractors. So there \nis, again, an intricate balance of all of these interests coming \ntogether in a way that affects the person wearing a hard hat on the \nfront lines of building the infrastructure, the homes, the churches, \nand the businesses of our community.\n  Again, the reality: When a credit freeze takes place, the pink slips \nstart getting printed, and the workforce is suddenly unemployed. Now \nthe contractors cannot pay their suppliers, so their cash inventory \ndrops and their ability to issue payroll at the end of the week is also \njeopardized, and it pushes more families into the ranks of the \nunemployed. It is a vicious cycle occurring far away from Wall Street, \nbut it is affecting our families, our neighbors, our friends on Main \nStreet.\n  The credit crunch changes our ability to shop. Every business to some \ndegree depends on this credit process for what they sell and the \nsupplies they get. We often use our credit cards in the process of \npurchasing those goods. But when manufacturers cannot get loans that \nthey need to keep the manufacturing process going to create the \nproducts that ultimately get consumed at a store where the store takes \ncredit and purchases it from them but gets maybe 30 days, 60 days the \nmanufacturer needs to continue to produce the product so that \nultimately it goes to that store where ultimately consumers seek to \npurchase, in fact, they cannot get the money to keep the product on the \nshelves, and, of course, the cycle is clear.\n  Look at farmers. New Jersey is called the Garden State. I often tell \nmy friends you have to get off the turnpike if you want to know what \nthe Garden State really looks like. We have spinach. We are in the top \ntwo or three in spinach. We have a whole host of speciality products--\npeach orchards, cranberry bogs, blueberries, to mention some.\n  For farmers, crop planting depends greatly on the amount of available \ncredit. Farmers cannot plant next year's crop if they cannot get this \nyear's loans. So from cranberries to blueberries to all of these other \nproducts, everything you buy at the grocery store is going to be more \nexpensive. Some food products may wind up in very short supply. They \nare going to be more expensive because even if you have a great credit \nhistory--as the cranberry bogs in the pinelands of New Jersey--if you \nhave a good credit history but the credit crunch creates a higher and \nhigher standard for what you will borrow and under what terms and \nconditions you will borrow, that is going to be reflected ultimately in \nthe end cost of the product we consume on the dining room table.\n  We have a challenge that is direct for farmers, for family farmers, \nand for all of us as consumers as we put fruits and vegetables on the \ntable for our families to consume, and that has a direct consequence to \nus.\n  Credit cards. As loans become more and more difficult and expensive \nto get, people will continue to increase their usage of credit cards. I \nhope if people have some disposable money that they will pay down their \ncredit card debts. That is a good thing to be doing in these times and \nnot be looking at spending a lot of interest on credit card debt. This \nis a good time, if you have the resources, to pay down credit card \ndebt.\n  I know so many families who tell me they are using that credit card \nas they have transitions in jobs, as they meet some of their \nchallenges. We see credit card interest rates which are already rising, \nand they will continue to escalate as banks look for ways to recoup the \nlosses resulting from those defaults that are taking place.\n  This is an issue I raised before about credit card reform. We need to \npursue reform in several sectors of our financial industry. We already \nhave credit card debt in this country that collectively equals $850 \nbillion. Now we are seeing the consequences of those who find \nthemselves using their credit cards in this economy who ultimately are \nfacing higher interest rates and, should they be somewhat late, higher \nfees for those payments for being slightly late. Then we will see a \nripple effect of those fees pushing people beyond their limits, and \nwhen they get pushed beyond\n\n[[Page S10152]]\n\ntheir limits artificially, they are in default. When they are in that \ndefault, they find themselves with a whole host of new charges that \ncontinue to push up their debt. We need to do something about this \nsituation. But it is part of the reality of our present existence that, \nin fact, we see this driving up as we speak. That is a consequence to \nthe average consumer in this country.\n  I had a teacher in New Jersey who recently showed how hard it is \ngetting for anyone to get a car loan. This teacher is not living within \nthe community in which she teaches. She has to drive there. It is not a \nlocation where public transit is easily available. This teacher in New \nJersey, who has driven to work every day for the past few years, has to \nbuy a new car because hers is broken down. But the auto lending market \nessentially has been closed to buyers with credit scores of less than \n720.\n  By the way, 720 is an excellent score. Yet finding the resources for \nan auto loan, not having the money to put it all out to purchase a car \nup front in cash--they need the opportunity to get access to that auto \nloan, and even with scores of 720 or less, they are finding it \nincreasingly difficult to do so. Even if they have some savings and \njust want a modest new car to take them where they need to go to work, \nunless they have excellent credit, they quite simply are not going to \nget a loan to get that car.\n  If we don't act soon, we are going to see students who will have \ntrouble paying for their education. Parents trying to save for their \nchildren's college education will see their investments shrink, along \nwith the stock market. College endowments that invest in the stock \nmarket are also getting hit hard, which makes it harder for them to \nprovide financial assistance to students.\n  If students need loans--and I know in my own life, someone who grew \nup poor in a tenement, the first in my family to go to college, if it \nwasn't for what we have done in the Federal Government through Pell \ngrants and Perkins loans and also through other loans, I would not have \nbeen the first in my family to go to college and then law school.\n  Students who manage to find loans will carry a higher interest rate \nthan they would otherwise, leaving our graduates with crushing debt. We \nare already seeing so many of our children graduate with enormous debt. \nThey graduate with a diploma in one hand and enormous debt in the other \none. That is only going to rise under the current circumstances--\ncrushing debt before they even enter the job market.\n  When they do leave school and start to look for a job, at this point, \nthese graduates in the next year or two are going to be greeted by one \nof the worst job markets in 5 years. We are already at 6.1 percent \nunemployment and rising. We will see inaction only create a greater \npercentage of unemployment than we have experienced, and that will be \nsome of the highest unemployment we have seen in well over a \ngeneration.\n  In addition to burdening young people who are just about to launch \ntheir careers, failing to act will exacerbate the already difficult \nsituation facing those who are winding down their careers and looking \nforward to retirement. We saw yesterday that the Dow lost the \nequivalent of $1.2 trillion in value. That is not just about wealthy \npeople who have money to make investments in stocks. That is about \nthose who have 401(k)s, that is about pension plans that make \ninvestments on behalf of their pensioners, that is about a broad \nbreadth of all of us.\n  Failing to act exacerbates the already difficult situation facing \nthose who are winding down their careers and looking forward to \nretirement. When I looked before, the Dow was going back up, but the \nproblem is that we see no sense of stability. Losses are real. It is \nnot just the point on the Dow; it is the overall S performance as \nwell. These people will see their decades of savings continue to shrink \nsmaller and smaller as their IRAs, 401(k)s, and mutual funds drop in \nvalue.\n  Yesterday's stock market alone accounted for approximately a $1.2 \ntrillion loss. Without action, those losses will only get worse.\n  I know that a lot of people do not want to look at their 401(k)s \nright now, but everyone is going to have to look at them eventually. \nThose on the cusp of retirement cannot afford to wait several years for \nthe market to stabilize on its own. They will be forced to stay in the \njob market long after they planned on retiring. That is a cruel reality \nfor people who have worked a lifetime to help create families, build \ncommunities, and now find themselves in this challenge as they go into \nthose years in which they thought their hard work would pay off. These \nhard-working Americans, who worked hard their whole lives, need us to \nact in a strong and sensible way to ensure that 30 years of savings do \nnot get largely eliminated within 30 days.\n  Let's talk about mortgages, which is at the heart of what our \nchallenges are and the foreclosures that are mounting.\n  The credit crunch affects your mortgage even if you pay it on time \nbecause if you have a mortgage, whether you pay it on time or not, you \nare going to find it difficult, if not impossible, to refinance your \nmortgage or to take out a second mortgage if you need it for the \ncollege education of your children or if, God forbid, there is an \nillness in your family that isn't covered by the insurance you have, if \nyou have insurance, or if you are underinsured. You are going to find \nyourself with higher rates and different lending conditions.\n  Your neighbors who are struggling and who are walking away from their \nhomes because there is a padlock on the front door--their loss; you may \nthink they maybe didn't make the right decisions, maybe they are part \nof that 6.1 percent unemployment who lost their jobs and now find \nthemselves in a set of circumstances where they cannot meet the \nmortgage payment, maybe some should have known better. But regardless \nof the circumstances, whether they lost their job, don't have the \nincome stream they had before to pay their mortgage, or whether it is \nbecause they were led to bad mortgages--I have people come into my \nSenate offices in New Jersey, and when we look at their information, we \nsee they could have been very responsible borrowers at fixed rates, but \nthey were led to mortgage instruments that, yes, were lower at the \nbeginning but ultimately ballooned later. It is a crime that those \nmortgage lenders drove them to those products, knowing they could have \nbeen a very responsible borrower and had the ability to pay a long-term \nloan at a fixed rate, they led them to those products and had them \nchoose a mortgage product where now they find themselves losing their \nhome.\n\n  Neighborhoods with foreclosures bring down home values for everyone \nin that community. I looked at the Center for Responsible Lending, and \nI looked at what they are saying about some of our challenges. In New \nJersey alone, there are approximately 53,000 homes, and rising, in \nforeclosure. By the way, we are not the worst State in the Nation in \nthis regard but by way of example. What does that mean? That affects \nneighborhoods and other homes and becomes a multiplier effect of \nenormous proportions.\n  When a home forecloses in your neighborhood, the overall value of \nhomes in that neighborhood falls. In New Jersey, that is the equivalent \nof about an $11,000 loss on your home. Having done absolutely nothing, \npaying your mortgage, being responsible, you still lost $11,000 on your \nhome because of foreclosures taking place in your neighborhood. When \nthere is a multiplicity of those foreclosures taking place in your \nneighborhood, it drives the value down even more.\n  That has a consequence too. When values are driven down, as a former \nmayor I can tell you that means the ratable base begins to shrink. When \nthe ratable base of all values begins to shrink, that is less taxes \nbeing paid. When that happens, there are two decisions to make. Either \nyou cut services--police, fire, education--or you have to raise taxes \ncollectively. Of course, that has a spiraling effect in and of itself.\n  This foreclosure crisis is very much a reality not only for those who \nare losing and/or have lost their homes, but it is very real for those \nof us who still have a home because our home simply isn't worth as much \nas we paid for it.\n  The credit crunch makes it harder to get financing to go buy a home \npresently. We have a story of someone who, totally responsible, good \njob, buys a condo and gets preapproved for their\n\n[[Page S10153]]\n\nloan and they sign a contract. But a week before the closing, they are \ntold the market in which they have purchased is declining and now they \nhave to come up with twice the downpayment they had originally been \napproved for. So that may mean that home doesn't get sold, that person \nhas to make other choices or, if they have any assets to meet the \ngreater downpayment, they now have to make other choices in their lives \nas well. So the house sits on the market continuing to lose value and \naffects the values of all other homes in that neighborhood. That has a \nconsequence for all of us.\n  I have tried to outline what some of the challenges are. Let me talk \nabout what I hope we will consider moving toward. As bad as the \nsituation has gotten, with hundreds of thousands of Americans losing \ntheir jobs and millions losing their homes, energy and health costs \nsky-high, with businesses in trouble and loans of any kind incredibly \nhard to come by, most Americans have been morally opposed to the rescue \nplan leaders in Congress and the administration presented. Most \nAmericans aren't too interested in a plan that risks rewarding those \nwho got us into this mess, and they are absolutely right to be \noutraged.\n  I, personally, as someone who in March of 2007, at a Senate Banking \nCommittee hearing, raised the fact that we were going to face a tsunami \nof foreclosures and that we should be ahead of the curve and deal with \nthat reality, unfortunately, had the administration say to me at that \nhearing that it was an exaggeration. Well, unfortunately, we haven't \neven seen the crest of that tsunami, and this is the issue that is at \nthe core of our challenge. So I am, personally, incredibly angry that \nthe greatest economy in the world has been brought to this point.\n  But let us be very clear: Those people who brought us into this \nprocess have to be brought to justice, but while we consider that, the \nreality is we are all facing a consequence. That said, the need for \naccountability doesn't take away the need for action to rescue the \nsystem they damaged. As much as maybe some reckless CEO deserves to \nlose their job, we can't watch 2 to 3 million Americans lose their jobs \nto achieve that result. We can't let the entire system fail to punish \nthe few who brought us to where we are today.\n  We have already lost over 600,000 jobs this year alone. We have a \n6.2-percent unemployment rate--the highest in 5 years. In some \ncommunities, such as the Latino community, it is 8 percent unemployment \nand rising. We have to be very clear. If the crisis continues, it is \ngoing to drastically change our way of life for the worse. So doing \nnothing is not an option. If we don't shore up the economy's \nfoundation, the floor is going to cave in on all of us. We have to do \nsomething to thaw out the credit market, restore trust in our financial \nsystem, and put out this economic wildfire before it is too late.\n  Once we saw centuries-old financial institutions fail, once we saw \nour credit markets freeze up and Americans' savings begin to disappear, \nthe question wasn't do we have to act, the question was how to craft a \nplan that would work and would give maximum protection to the taxpayers \nwho might fund it.\n  Now, I believe there is something that wasn't in the plan but that \nshould be included, and I appreciate Senator Obama's suggestion of it \ntoday, where he proposed lifting the current limit on the Federal \nDeposit Insurance from its current limit of $100,000 to $250,000. He \nsaid he believed it would be:\n\n       A step that would boost small businesses, make our banking \n     system more secure, and help restore public confidence in our \n     financial system.\n\n  Right now, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guarantees \ndeposits up to $100,000 for every citizen or business. Meaning that if \nthe bank goes down, the Federal Government guarantees your first \n$100,000 are safe. This would raise that limit, at least for a period \nof time.\n  The FDIC has a long history of experience in protecting taxpayers \nfrom an infusion of public capital, especially by preferred stocks and \nwarrants. They know what is the right stock and warrant. These are the \nguarantees for taxpayers. It would stop the flight by small businesses \nfrom some banks to those banks that are considered too big to fail but \nleaves other institutions without the resources to be part of the \nlending that is necessary in the community. Deposits would stay in \nthese institutions because there would be newfound confidence, and \nothers would now be depositing their money because they would have a \nhigher insurance level, of up to $250,000, which would provide \nliquidity to lend to those very businesses that may be placing their \nresources there. Again, these are the small businesses that create 75 \npercent of all the jobs in the country.\n  So I hope we will look toward including that provision. I think it is \na good one. Change is a good part of what we are seeking to do with an \ninstitution that has a long history of being successful on behalf of \nthe taxpayers.\n  I also hope we will look at homeowners. I had a pastor in my home \nState of New Jersey who had been working with not only his congregation \nbut others with his community development organization to try to save \nhomes. We are told that, in fact, we are getting the lenders and the \nbanks to reconsider the mortgages and refinance them and work with \npeople so they can stay in their home and be responsible borrowers. It \nis better to have a performing mortgage versus one that is \nnonperforming and is a negative asset to that bank. So if we can keep \npeople in their homes, making it a performing mortgage and making sure \nit is, in fact, an asset and not a liability to those institutions, we \nshould do that.\n  Yet recently we had a situation--one example--of a home in New Jersey \nwith a $238,000 mortgage. The homeowner was in foreclosure crisis. They \noffered to give $220,000 of the $238,000 through the community \ndevelopment corporation. The bank said no. So they are getting zero. \nInstead of getting zero, they were going to get $220,000 of the \n$238,000--an $18,000 difference--and they said no. So the community \ndevelopment corporation went to the foreclosure sale and bid the \n$238,000, the full amount of the mortgage. What did the bank do? They \nbid it up to $240,000. So they preferred to have this person go \nin foreclosure. They bid more than they were even getting on the \nmortgage, even though they could have been made whole, and at the end \nof the day they had a mortgage that was nonperforming. So we need to do \na lot better, a lot better at what is the core of the problem.\n\n  I think the New York Times said it well when they said:\n\n       Homeowners were also given short shrift with provisions \n     that mainly urged lenders and the Treasury to do more to help \n     them. That's unconscionable. The financial crisis is as much \n     a problem for homeowners as for Wall Street investment \n     bankers. Appeals to lenders' better natures has not worked to \n     bring lasting relief to homeowners. If they are still not \n     working in the coming months, Congress needs to revisit the \n     issue.\n\n  I agree with them totally. It should be a basic principle of our \nactions now, that if we have to rescue Wall Street from their profit-\nseeking failures, we should also rescue homeowners, many of whom are in \ntrouble through no fault of their own. Remembering Main Street is \nbeneficial to all of us, and remembering that a foreclosure in our \nneighborhood affects the value of every house on the block and brings \ndown the broader economy, it doesn't make sense to simply sign off on a \nplan that keeps the CEO in their office but kicks a family out of their \nhome.\n  If we are going to solve the problems that are at the root of the \ncrisis, we have to provide real relief for struggling homeowners. That \nis incredibly important. One of those ways is through Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac. They are now Federal entities. Not only were they \nfederally backed at one time, but they have now been taken over by the \nFederal Government. They do not need legislation to have a 90-day \nfreeze on mortgages that may be in foreclosure. We can try to rework \nthose mortgages and make them performing loans and keep people in their \nhomes. We can make them positive assets versus negative assets for the \nbank, and that is one thing we can do without any action. But we need \nthe Government and the administration to move in that direction. That \nalso further limits taxpayer exposure.\n  Finally, let's go back to that poll. What did Americans say? They \nunderstand this is a crisis, but they don't see the connection in their \nlives, and I have tried to make that. They also didn't think there was \nenough in the package to deal with the challenges they face. Therefore, \nI know our colleagues, many on the other side of the\n\n[[Page S10154]]\n\naisle, didn't vote for the stimulus package we offered as Democrats. \nBut it is time to hear what Americans are saying to you. It is time for \na new economic stimulus package targeted at creating hundreds of \nthousands of good-paying jobs so we can offset the 600,000 that were \nlost over the course of this year and to prevent cuts in critical \nservices for millions of Americans. I hope we will revisit that.\n  We should institute a loan program to help jump-start one of the most \nimportant economic engines in America--small business. As I have said \nbefore, because of this severe credit crunch, many small businesses--\nespecially those starting out but many well-established businesses--are \nhaving trouble finding credit on the private market. I think emergency \nloans should be available to small business along the lines of what we \nprovide during a natural disaster. This is a pretty big financial \nstorm, and temporary relief can make a big difference. After all, these \nare the businesses that create 75 percent of America's jobs.\n  Tom Friedman put it well when he said:\n\n       If our economy were a car, the financial markets would be \n     the transmission, but they're not the engine. The engine of \n     American prosperity is American innovation. And until we get \n     that engine revved up again, investing in higher education \n     and advanced energy, we are going to be driving over a rough \n     stretch of road.\n\n  Most importantly, if the Federal Government is either going to take \non these bad assets or find some other way of capitalization, there \nmust be regulatory reform as well. Those regulations must be robustly \nenforced. We can't have the cop on the beat, which is the regulator, \nultimately hitting the snooze button instead of being at their post and \nmaking sure we don't have excesses in the marketplace in a way that \nultimately leads us to where we are today.\n  So we never find ourselves in this position again if we pursue robust \nregulation and its enforcement. If we do not do that, we will send the \nmessage that it is okay for firms to behave recklessly, and we will be \nforced to follow this challenge further down the line.\n  I do not mean to say that the movement toward a rescue plan, with \nsome of the additions I talked about, whether in that plan or following \non, is going to bring the sunlight of prosperity tomorrow. I think no \none here should believe that. But the consequences would be far \ngreater.\n  I think it was said best in the past when President Hoover said, \n``The fundamental business of the country is on a sound and prosperous \nbasis.'' Well, we are not on a sound and prosperous basis. It sounds \nsimilar to some of the comments being made today. We need to address \nsome of these fundamentals. This in and of itself will not be it.\n  So I hope the Senate will stay even after we meet this challenge in \nthe next day or so, and hopefully the House will follow the leadership \nthat has taken place here. I hope we will understand that there are \nstill challenges in the days ahead. The administration has left us with \nbad choices, but they are choices, nonetheless, that we have to deal \nthe best and act on in the Nation's interests at the end of the day.\n  As a member of the Banking Committee, I agree with Chairman Dodd. We \nshould have sessions to look very closely at the regulations we need, \nthis administration and the one in the future. This one does not have \ntoo much left to it to adopt. We need a strong response, but we need \none that is well calibrated, has the appropriate oversight, and we want \nto make sure Main Street is protected as much as Wall Street.\n  The financial crisis we face is not an academic exercise. I know some \npeople talk about this esoterically. It is not an academic exercise. I \nhope people do not treat it that way because in an academic exercise, \nyou can be wrong and the consequences are not great. If we think this \nis an academic exercise and we are wrong, then the consequences will be \nvery significant. It is a threat to our everyday way of life, and if we \ndo not act, we risk the flood of suffering washing over the entire \ncountry.\n  This is one of those moments that each Member of the Senate and each \nMember of the House must look to determine the courage that is \nnecessary to act in the face of something that is not very popular, \nobviously.\n  We might take a page out of John F. Kennedy's book ``Profiles in \nCourage.'' In that book, which is stories of courage that have taken \nplace in this institution and in the other in moments of great \nimportance to the country, he said in that book: In whatever arena of \nlife one meets the challenge of courage, no matter the sacrifices he \nmakes--the loss of his friends, his fortune, his contentment, even the \nesteem of his fellow man--the stories of past courage can teach, they \ncan offer hope, and they can provide inspiration, but they cannot \nprovide courage itself. For this, each man--and, I would add, each \nwoman--must look into his own soul.\n  Preventing collapse, helping those in need--that is our challenge. I \nhope that, with some changes and a commitment to do more in the \nmainstream economy, we will have every Member look in their own soul \nand provide the courage that is necessary to do what is right for our \ncountry and its people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Before my colleague from New Jersey leaves the floor, I \nwish to commend him for his comments. I had an opportunity--I was not \non the floor the whole time but was in the adjoining offices. Of \ncourse, with modern technology, we have the opportunity to listen to \neach other and express our views. I commend him on his. It was a very \nthorough and important hour to take. We have few opportunities which \nallow us to have a chance to lay this out as the Senator from New \nJersey has just done, going back and examining sort of the autopsy of \nall of this.\n  We are sort of caught up in the moment and exactly what is happening \nfrom moment to moment with the stock market and the bond market, the \ncredit markets across the country and the unemployment numbers. But I \nthink going back and understanding the genesis of this is tremendously \nvaluable. We have some very important and difficult decisions to make \nin the next few days that are critically important. He has outlined \nthem as well. None of them are perfect. None of us like being here. But \nwe have a challenge in front of us.\n  I think he did an admirable job of explaining this, of where we have \ncome and the idea of how we come back to the decision we make in the \nnext 24 or 48 hours but also what needs to be done after that to make \nsure we do not find ourselves back here in a matter of weeks or months \ngrappling with even more compound and difficult economic choices.\n  So I did not want to miss the opportunity to come out and thank you.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate Senator Dodd's words, and I appreciate, \nabove all, his leadership on the Banking Committee and here in this \ninstitution. You took a document that was sent to us that had no \nprotections, no guarantees, and certainly nothing for the homeowner, \nand you dramatically made it better. I know you are working to look at \nwhat else can be done.\n  Above all, I appreciate the statements you have made moving beyond \nthe immediate crisis, the leadership you will exert on the committee to \nhave us immediately look at some of these other challenges which are \nincredibly important for the Nation and a reassurance to the American \npeople. I appreciate the Senator's leadership.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator for that. The Senator has pointed out, \nof course, just as the Presiding Officer, his great interest in these \nmatters, and the Senator from New Jersey is, of course, a very \nworthwhile member of our committee, as is the Presiding Officer.\n  As we look at these questions, and I intend to do that. In fact, I am \nnot going to wait long. Our intention is that on the committee, we will \nmove aggressively--in a matter of days--to examine further as to how we \narrived in this situation, No. 1; No. 2, to monitor how the bromide \nthat we have been offered by the Secretary of the Treasury, the \nsolution to all of this, is working; and then thirdly, of course, how \ndo we reconstruct or construct anew the architecture for a 21st-century \nfinancial services economy or one that depends upon financial services \nas much as this one does?\n  Clearly, the architecture of our regulatory system, some rules of \nwhich go back to the 19th century--many, of\n\n[[Page S10155]]\n\ncourse, were adopted in the wake of the Great Depression back in the \n1920s and 1930s--needs to be revisited. The world is a very different \nplace today, much more complicated, global in its complexity, and \nclearly warrants a fresh look at some new structures. And it is my \nintention as the committee chairman, along with my colleagues who serve \non the committee and others who are involved in these issues, that we \nbegin our work very quickly to address those questions.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Virginia. Of course, the irony or \nironies is I was just about to talk about him, and this was not \nprearranged, him arriving on the floor, and he may have some comments \nto make as the system here allows us to go back and forth. I really \ncame over to commend Senator Menendez, but I have some comments I want \nto make about my friend from Virginia, but I do not want to deprive him \nof the opportunity to be heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. No. I have been very honored to be on the floor in \nconnection with certain tributes, and I just by coincidence am here. \nBut I am hopeful that the distinguished chairman could maybe tell us, \nthe Senate--I am quite anxious; I have been here throughout the day, \nmost of it--what is the state of the resolution of this very important \nproblem that faces our Nation here today?\n  Mr. DODD. Well, I can tell you, my friend, the majority leader, \nSenator Reid--I know from having met with him earlier today--is in \nconstant consultation and discussions with the leadership of the \nRepublican minority of this body as well as the Democratic and \nRepublican leadership of the other body, the House of Representatives, \nto determine when and how we can go forward on the legislation that we \ncrafted both here and there over the last 2 weeks to respond to this \neconomic crisis we are in.\n  I am proud to have been involved, and I am sad to have been involved. \nNormally, we craft bills and we take pride in the fact that we are \nsolving a problem, and I hope we are in this case. But I am fairly \nconfident we will be able to get to another vote and that the other \nbody will bring up the matter as well. The order of all of this is \nbeing discussed as you and I stand in this Chamber. No final \nconclusions have been reached about that, but I know people are working \nhard to determine how best to proceed forward.\n  The last thing we need is to have this not work again. We better \ndecide whether we are serious about this. This is a difficult vote--I \nwould not suggest otherwise--but it is an important one. I know that \nthose who cast votes yesterday are having some second thoughts about \nthe condition they placed us in and are trying to find a way to get \nback on track again. So I am very optimistic we can do that. I know the \nWhite House is now engaged much more aggressively than it has been on \nthis issue, which I welcome. I know the leadership of the House is also \nworking on this. I do not want to predict things with any great \ncertainty, but I am quite confident we are working in the right \ndirection and we should end up with a very positive result within the \nnext 24 or 48 hours.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Banking \nCommittee for those remarks. I found the work product that you and \nothers produced and which was distributed yesterday to be of great \nvalue. I was prepared to move forward and add my voice in support. But \nI yield now, of course, to the circumstances as the consequence of the \nHouse's action last night.\n  I think the leadership on both sides is very diligent; that is, the \nleadership--our Senate distinguished majority leader, Senator Reid, and \nSenator McConnell, the minority leader--is working on this, and I do \nhope we can bring this to some sort of a resolution tomorrow.\n  You know, it is interesting, as I sit here to talk to the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, our friendship goes back almost the full 30 years I \nhave been in the Senate. And last night, when I went home with a bit of \na heavy heart for fear that this situation was of such consequence as \nto almost every single American, I was trying to reflect, as I so often \ndo, on other chapters of history which confronted our great Republic \nand other nations, because this is a global problem, as the chairman \nknows. I put together some remarks that I thought something of giving \non the floor at some point in time. But I went back to a very famous \nletter. And the reason I raise this, I think my good friend, the \nSenator from Connecticut, and I have discussed many times the chapter \nof history during World War II and the role your father played at the \nconclusion of that war in terms of the Nuremberg Trials. You yourself \nhave written eloquently on this period. So just by coincidence, I went \nback and I thought about the year 1941 and, in particular, January of \n1941 when Great Britain at that time was undergoing the full wrath of \nall of Hitler's military might. It was one of the darkest hours in the \nlong history of the British Empire.\n  You recall that Roosevelt penned a short note, a letter, to \nChurchill, and it was hand delivered to Churchill by Wendell Willkie, \nwho was coincidentally in London. Roosevelt chose the first five lines \nof that famous poem of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:\n\n     THOU, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\n     Sail on, O UNION, strong and great!\n     Humanity, with all its fears,\n     With all the hopes of future years,\n     Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\n\n  And I simply say to those, the leadership of our body and the \nleadership of the House, they might read that because that is how \nserious this problem is. It may have some parallels. That was a war, \nbut in a sense we are in an economic titanic struggle to regain, in the \nUnited States, the confidence among our citizens--I am not talking \nabout Wall Street or Main Street, I am talking about every citizen--a \nsense of confidence and how we must henceforth conduct our business for \nthe better, the greater betterment for all Americans, whether they are \nrich or poor.\n  I just thought of that stanza. I found a great deal of encouragement \nand fell off to sleep thinking maybe tomorrow will be a better day. \nThus far it seems to me it has been productive.\n  I thank the Senator. I enjoy always talking history with my friend \nfrom Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I love that as well. My colleague from Virginia, during \nmoments of stress and strain over the years, when it looks as though \nall is lost and we could never come back together, he has pulled me \naside in one corner or niche of this building, and I can hear him say \nit over and over again, in the words of Winston Churchill: Never, \nnever, never give in. We are at one of those moments.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Presiding Officer is a man who is a great student of \nhistory. We shared a few words earlier today about this situation. I \nthink I best yield the floor so you can get down to it. I wish you \ngreat luck in all of your work, and good fortune, because it is so \nvitally important not just at home but indeed for the whole world.\n\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator. This is not a prearranged or prestaged \nevent. It was my intent at this moment to spend a few minutes talking \nabout my friend from Virginia with whom I have just shared, once again, \nanother memorable moment, as he talks about the moment we are in. That \nis characteristic of my friend from Virginia. One of the reasons he \nwill be missed, with his well-deserved retirement, is that throughout \nmy 28 years here--actually I have known John Warner a bit longer than \nthat, but we have served here together for almost three decades--in \nevery moment I can think of that we have been in a moment not unlike \nthe moment we are in--none quite so grave economically--it has always \nbeen the posture and position of John Warner to see this body not as \none that is divided by this architectural divide that separates us by \nparty, which must confound and confuse the public as they look at us, \nwondering if we ever begin to think of ourselves as Americans with a \ngreat privilege of serving in this historic institution, that we would \ncome together to find solutions to problems.\n  It has been characteristic of John Warner, from the first moments I \nhave known him, to always see this divide as being sort of a silly \nbarrier; that it probably would be a wise, although probably not a \nwelcome idea, that the seating arrangements ought not to be based on \nparty but maybe some other configuration where you actually have\n\n[[Page S10156]]\n\nto sit next to someone you may disagree with or of a different party \nfrom time to time. That, in itself, may serve as a crucible in which \nbetter decisions might be reached.\n  I am going to miss him very much on many different levels. We have \nonly served on a couple of committees together over the years, not by \nchoice but by circumstance. Yet on those occasions, I have enjoyed \nimmensely the work of John Warner. There have been times--and he will \nremind me often--when we haven't shared a philosophical standpoint in \ncommon over the years. But on levels far more significant and far more \nimportant to me--and I would hope with other Members as well--my \nrelationship with John Warner is one based on a love of this \ninstitution, the importance of it. The hope and the aspirations of a \npeople depend upon it. That, more than anything else, is what I have \nenjoyed so much about working with John Warner, his reverence for this \nbody.\n  I will use the words of John Stennis, the former chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee--the position which John Warner now holds--who \nspoke at a Democratic caucus meeting. He paused when he stood up for \nseveral seconds and said nothing at all, and the room quieted, as you \nmight imagine, to a stillness. The first words of John Stennis were: I \nam a Senate man.\n  I thought, what a remarkable moment, how he began his discourse with \nus, those of us who were new, by describing himself as a person of this \ninstitution. John Warner is a Senate man. He has done many things of \ngreat import in his life. But if I were to be asked by people what is a \ngood example of a Senate person--I guess more politically correct \ntoday, given the fact that we have a lot of diversity of gender in this \ninstitution--John Warner has been a Senate person. He understood the \nhistorical value of this institution and the importance it continues to \nplay. While we have had our differences philosophically, we have \nenjoyed great friendship on a personal level.\n  I cherish in my office a wonderful photograph of John Warner and I \nsailing together in my Old Friendship sloop off the coast of \nConnecticut and Rhode Island, enjoying great dinners together, a game \nof tennis every now and then over the years. So beyond the political \ndiscourse and the substantive debates or disagreements, there are \nrelationships here that are far more significant on a human level than \nthat.\n  I was thinking the other day about one of these battles that goes on \nfrom time to time. This one was over which State was going to win the \ncontract to build the Seawolf submarine. The Presiding Officer from \nRhode Island would have certainly taken the side of the New England \npoint of view. It was a serious discussion about whether it would be in \nNewport News or in Connecticut and Rhode Island that the contract would \nbe awarded. There was a lot of jockeying back and forth, a serious \ndebate and discussion. It ultimately worked out well for both States \nand the country as a result. But the final decision came down that \nConnecticut was going to be awarded that contract.\n  In a moment like that, after weeks and weeks of back and forth, you \nmight expect that the delegation or the Member you have been dealing \nwith on the other side would feel embittered or upset, a variety of \nemotions that would normally be put on the negative side of the ledger. \nI don't think I have ever told this to too many of our colleagues. I \narrived back in my apartment that night feeling good about the result \nand the fact that it worked out well. And there on the outside of my \ndoor was a package. I opened it and there was a first edition copy of \nJack London's ``The Seawolf.'' It was sent to me by my colleague from \nVirginia, with a congratulatory note on Connecticut and Rhode Island \nprevailing in this particular contest; that the country would be better \nif we all worked together to get this new piece of military hardware \nbuilt.\n  I thought to myself, what an incredible gesture at a moment like \nthis, the sensitivity, the appreciation, seeking out a first edition \ncopy of Jack London's ``The Seawolf,'' the very program we were talking \nabout. That is the kind of person John Warner has been.\n  While there will be great debate and discussion, and he has certainly \ndone a fantastic job working with Carl Levin on the Armed Services \nCommittee and has been a great custodian of guaranteeing and protecting \nour Nation's security during that tenure, it is those moments of \narriving home that night many years ago and picking up that book that I \nstill cherish and have by the way. I will read it to my daughters at an \nappropriate time in their lives, a great story in and of itself. It is \nmoments like that.\n  I wish you the very best, dear friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my friend. I must say to you that \nJohn Stennis, if I had to name five individuals in this institution--I \nthink I have served with 272 Senators--John Stennis would be one. He \nwas a magnificent man. As a matter of fact, I have his old desk. In his \nfinal days here he called me in one day and he said: I want you to have \nthis desk. Of course, it was a long story, but there it is. I still \nhave it in my office. He was a great teacher.\n  Scoop Jackson was another great teacher. I hope some of the young \nSenators, that maybe they have learned from you and me. Who knows. But \nin those days, those were men of formidable strength intellectually, \ncommand presence, and they were great teachers. Stennis was foremost \namong them all.\n  I thank my dear friend for his comments.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my friend for his distinguished career. There are \nplenty of references to that in the Record. I thought I would share at \nleast a couple of personal anecdotes.\n  Mr. WARNER. We finally solved the submarine problem by, I think you \nbuilt part of the ship--we call them ships now rather than boats--and \nwe built the other part. They are put together in the yards of the two. \nThey are sailing the seven seas today. That program is running on, and \nour sole production of submarines now is in Connecticut and in \nVirginia, putting the parts together.\n  Mr. DODD. That is right. We hope it works. At the time that happened, \nI kept thinking of the person who once described a camel as being a \nhorse that was designed by Congress in the sense of building two parts \nof this boat and welding them together. It was a perfect congressional \nresult of a matter. Nonetheless, I cherish those comments.\n  I wish you the very best. Thank you for your service to our country.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  I wanted to mention as well a couple of other colleagues who are also \nretiring. If I could, one is my great friend from Nebraska, Chuck \nHagel, with whom I have served on both the Banking and the Foreign \nRelations Committees for the past 12 years, truly a wonderful person. \nWe have worked together on a number of issues.\n  He got his first job at 9 years of age when he began to help his \nfamily economically. He was 16 when his dad died and took over raising \nhis family along with his mother. I believe most of my colleagues are \naware that he was a true hero of the Vietnam war. He saved his brother \nwho, in fact, was serving with him in that conflict.\n  He has done a remarkable job in his public service years as well. We \nserve on the Foreign Relations Committee together and the Banking \nCommittee. Whether the issue has been Iraq, Serbia, or Croatia, Cuba, \nregardless of who comes before our committee, no one asks tougher \nquestions or gets straighter answers than Chuck Hagel.\n  On Cuba, for instance--again, an explosive issue politically--Chuck \nand I offered a resolution to end the embargo in Cuba because we agreed \nthat the current policy toward the island has failed the Cuban people \nand the American people alike and because we refused to let America \nwait on the sidelines while the future of one of our closest neighbors \nis determined by others.\n  It is that kind of courage that he brings to the debate, kind of \nblows through it all and says: What is the right thing for our country \nand, in this case, the people of Cuba?\n  On the Banking Committee, Chuck and I worked for months to reinvent \nthe infrastructure of our Nation with the creation of a national \ninfrastructure bank, 2\\1/2\\ years developing that bill. In fact, it was \nChuck who convinced me we ought to announce the outcome of our work one \nday in August last year. I argued with him a bit. I said: No one will \npay any attention to announcing an infrastructure bill in August. Who \nwants to hear about infrastructure in August.\n\n[[Page S10157]]\n\n  Chuck said: No, let's have that press conference and let people know \nwhat we are doing.\n  We met in the gallery at 10 a.m. I think we had two reporters who \nshowed up. I said: I think I was right, Chuck. No one cares about \ninfrastructure.\n  By 5 o'clock that afternoon, Chuck Hagel and I were on every TV \nscreen in America because, regrettably, of the great tragedy in \nMinneapolis that occurred that afternoon. The bridge collapsed. Of \ncourse, infrastructure was the subject matter for the next weeks to \ncome. So, once again, Chuck Hagel understood the timing of an issue in \nbringing it up and how important it was for our Nation. Little did we \nknow that tragedy would fall on interstate 35-W over the Mississippi \nRiver.\n  There again was Chuck Hagel, standing with a colleague of a different \nbackground, putting aside ideology and politics to work together to \nfind new and innovative ways to address the Nation's most urgent \npriorities. That is Chuck Hagel, a remarkable person and a very good \nSenator over the years. Patriotic, never partisan, tough but fair, \nalways engaged, sometimes even confrontational, but never, ever \nbelligerent, a strong Member. This institution will miss Chuck's \nability to transcend politics and serve the American people. As such, \nthe people of Nebraska deserve our thanks for sending Chuck Hagel to \nserve with us over these past 12 years. I will miss him. We all wish \nhim the very best. He served our Nation very well during his service.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  The last Member I want to talk about is Pete Domenici with whom I \nhave had the privilege of working on so many issues over the years. In \nfact, only a few weeks ago I was honored to be asked to come and speak \non behalf of Pete Domenici in Las Cruces at New Mexico State University \nwhere the Center for Public Policy is named for Pete Domenici. It was \nquite a gathering at which I was the keynote speaker, where Pete was \nbeing recognized for his contribution to the State and our country.\n  Jim Baker, former Secretary of State, spoke at the conference as well \nover that weekend. It was quite a gathering of people from that State \nto express their appreciation for Pete's 36 years of serving the people \nof his home State. Again, a legislative record that is clear and almost \nwithout peer in many ways.\n  Because of Pete Domenici our country will soon recognize that mental \nillness is as serious as any physical illness. He, Ted Kennedy and Paul \nWellstone were so pivotal in making us all aware of how important this \nissue is. Without Pete's leadership, I don't think this would have \nhappened. Without Pete going to his colleagues and saying: Let me tell \nyou about my family--he had the courage to talk about his own family \nand what they have been through--it has made a difference. Today \nmillions of people will benefit as a result of Pete's leadership on an \nissue that is going to make a difference in their lives. Because of \nPete's leadership, candidates for President in both parties now \nacknowledge that we have to be serious about doing something about \nglobal warming; again, serious about reducing our emissions, ending our \ndependence on oil.\n  Again, John Warner and Pete Domenici are classic examples of people \nwho step out of what you might normally associate them with on an issue \nand get involved and make a difference, almost overnight, because they \nsaid this is worthy of our attention and certainly serious, so serious \nthat it demands action.\n  Thanks to Pete's relentless vigilance, I am confident that safe and \nsecure nuclear energy, which I happen to be a supporter of as well, \nwill play a large role in helping us address one of our largest \nproblems in the years ahead. Because of Pete, last year over 5 million \nchildren in 51 counties studied what character means in the classroom. \nPete and I are the authors of that idea. It started out as a small idea \nin his State and my State, to insist that part of the day, on the \nathletic fields, in classes--not just for some 15 minutes--students \nembrace one of the six pillars of great character and make it a part of \nthe seamless garment of a classroom.\n  Today, as I say, in 51 counties, as well as in virtually almost every \nState, Character Counts is there, to help children learn early on the \nimportance of what honesty and integrity mean, among the other pillars \nof good character.\n  Yet when we talk about Pete and what he has accomplished for our \ncommunities and our country, we would be doing a great disservice if we \nwere to sum up his legacy as some series of issues. My affection for \nthese Members I am talking about transcends the substantive issues \nwhich they have championed over the years. It goes deeper than that.\n  Pete's contribution to the Senate will be measured in a volume of \nbills he introduced with a number of votes he took; some 13,000, by the \nway, for which I think there are only 8 or 10 Senators who have a \nsimilar record.\n  But who Pete Domenici is, is much more than that. Long before he was \na Senator, Pete was a wonderful father and husband. He grew up in a \nremarkable family, an immigrant family to our country--the classic \nAmerican story. Many of our fellow colleagues can tell similar tales of \nhow they arrived in this great Nation of ours and the contributions \nthey have made.\n  Long before he dreamt of becoming chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Pete was a boy counting pennies at his father's grocery \nbusiness in New Mexico. So often all we hear about politicians is \nnegativity--and it breeds cynicism, too much, frankly. But in my \nexperience, the most effective legislators have remarkable strength and \nan inner confidence. That is Pete Domenici in so many ways.\n  You only need to know his wife Nancy, whom Jackie and I have gotten \nto know--they are neighbors of ours on Capitol Hill. We have had \nwonderful dinners together on Sunday nights, with Pete doing some of \nthe cooking, and Nancy, I suspect, doing most of it, but Pete taking \ncredit for most of it, as we would gather and have wonderful family \ngatherings, as they would embrace and cherish the new arrivals of my \nfamily, my two daughters. So we are losing not just a colleague but a \nneighbor and a friend and a person I care deeply about.\n  Together, these two people, Nancy and Pete, have raised eight \nwonderful children. As one of six myself, their house reminds me so \nmuch of growing up in my own house--kids, very independent thinkers, \nall challenging their parents on every imaginable subject matter, and \nthen going out the door and parroting their parents' positions on every \nissue--the parents never to appreciate the fact that their words were \nactually carrying the day. It can be messy in those households, but it \nis never boring, and certainly never so in the Domenici household as \nwell.\n  That is why there is one legislative accomplishment that best \ncaptures Pete Domenici, and that is the Character Counts bill that we \nstarted together in 1994. Character Counts was founded on a simple \nnotion: that core ethical values are not just important to us as \nindividuals, they form the foundation of a democratic society as well.\n  Values like trustworthiness and respect, responsibility and fairness, \ncaring and citizenship are at the core of who Pete is as a human being. \nDespite the fact that it was Pete's own family, heritage, and faith \nthat taught him character's importance--his mother and father, the nuns \nin his Catholic school--he recognized something that too often gets \nlost today: that in a society that celebrates our differences--our \nheritage, our personal interests as individuals--character is the one \nthing that transcends them, whether they be cultural, religious, \neconomic, or social.\n  Somewhere along the way we lost that as a country. We forgot how \nimportant character is to the strength of our families, our \ncommunities, our institutions, and who we are as individuals.\n  Quite frankly, when Pete retires at the end of this year, in a matter \nof days now, I am worried we will be losing a piece of that from the \ninstitution in which he and I serve--the value that he has brought on \nthis subject matter and so many others.\n  So let me say thanks to Pete for his warmth and friendship, and I \nwish him and Nancy the very best in the years to come. He is a \nremarkable individual and one who will make a difference in whatever he \ndecides to do with the remainder of his life. I thank him for all of \nhis contributions, and I look forward\n\n[[Page S10158]]\n\nto seeing him and Nancy as often as we can in the years to come.\n\n\n                              Wayne Allard\n\n  Mr. President, I, again, want to say a kind word or two about Wayne \nAllard as well, who is retiring. We serve on the Banking Committee \ntogether. He has a wonderful family history dating back decades in \nColorado. Some of the earliest arrivals from the East were the Allard \nfamily in northern Colorado. That family has made wonderful \ncontributions.\n  Wayne has been a wonderful member of the Banking Committee. We have \nnot spent a lot of time on many issues together, but I can tell you, on \nissues such as regulatory reform and working together to see we had a \ngood housing bill last summer, Wayne Allard was a very constructive and \npositive member, and he can be very proud of his contribution to this \nbody.\n  Certainly, as to the landmark Transportation bill we sent to the \nPresident just a few years ago, Wayne Allard was as much responsible \nfor that as any Member of this body, coming from a State where you \nnormally would not think of transportation issues, certainly not mass \ntransit issues as being pivotal. But Wayne Allard played a very \nimportant role in all of that.\n  So to Wayne Allard, his wife Joan, and their family, I wish them the \nvery best as well in their retirement years.\n  Again, Mr. President, to my friend, John Warner, a special thanks, my \ndear friend. Now, when they say there is a white-haired Senator roaming \naround the floor, they will not have to guess whether it is the guy \nfrom Virginia or the guy from Connecticut, unless someone else arrives \nhere with a full head of white hair. So to the white-haired caucus, \nagain to John Warner, I thank you, dear friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to give a speech regarding \nSenator Warner in just a minute.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is very standard in the Senate, we say \n``the distinguished gentleman,'' and we say that a lot, and we mean it. \nBut it is never more meaningful than when you refer to John Warner as a \ndistinguished gentleman because that says it all. If there were ever a \ndistinguished gentleman, John Warner is that person.\n  I can remember when I first came to the Senate 22 years ago, I was so \nfortunate. I was placed on the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nJohn Warner, even though he had been here a while, was one of the \nrelatively new members of that committee. Some people had been there \nfor so long. John Chafee was the ranking Republican on that committee. \nWhat a wonderful man he was. But anyway, John Warner, he took such good \ncare of me. He looked out for me. I sat on the other side of the dais, \nbut he took good care of me. We were able to do some good things.\n  I was fortunate, I was subcommittee chairman my freshman year. \nSenator Warner will probably remember this. We worked on a number of \nthings. One of the things we worked on was Alar. It was a product that \npeople sprayed on cherries, apples, grapes to keep them from falling \noff the trees and vines more quickly. We legislated and legislated, and \nwe were never able to get anything passed, but we accomplished what we \nset out to do because through the hearing process we focused so much \nattention on this that people stopped using it.\n  John Warner is a distinguished gentleman. There is no more \ndistinguished gentleman than the man we refer to as John Warner--John \nWilliam Warner. I love his stories. He talks about his dad who was a \nphysician.\n  When John was 17, he had in his heart that it was important to wear \nthe uniform of the American serviceman. He volunteered for the Navy so \nhe could fight in World War II. He says he did not do any fighting, but \nhe would have if he had been called upon to do so.\n  After his first tour of duty, he returned home to his native \nVirginia, where he attended Washington and Lee University on the GI \nbill, and then the University of Virginia Law School, which, by the \nway, then and is now a very difficult school to get in. It is always \nrated as one of the top 10 law schools in America. It is a great \nschool.\n  His legal studies were interrupted again to be in the U.S. military, \nthis time as an officer in the Marine Corps during the Korean war. His \n10 years in the Marine Corps earned him the rank of captain, CAPT John \nWarner.\n  When he completed law school, he was selected as a law clerk by one \nof the outstanding and historic circuit court judges: E. Barrett \nPrettyman. What a name: E. Barrett Prettyman. But those of us who have \nbeen in the practice of law have always recognized that Prettyman wrote \nsome pretty opinions. He was a renowned lawyer and, of course, now we \nhave a Federal courthouse named after Judge Prettyman as a result of \nhis being such an outstanding judge. John Warner worked for him.\n  After 4 years as an assistant U.S. attorney, John Warner was \nappointed and confirmed as Under Secretary of the Navy, then as \nSecretary of the Navy.\n  Then, one of my fond memories of John Warner is his telling a story. \nHe was Under Secretary; John Chafee, whom I had the good fortune to \nserve with in the Senate, was the Secretary of the Navy. The Vietnam \nwar was ongoing. They were asked by the Secretary of Defense, Melvin \nLaird, to come down and see what was going on at the Capitol Mall. So, \nas Senator Warner said, they left their Cadillacs someplace else that \nwas supplied to the Secretary and the Under Secretary, and they took \noff their fancy clothes and came down to the Capitol Mall. And look \naround they did. There were tens of thousands of people here, tens of \nthousands--hundreds of thousands of people at the Mall. They were \ndemonstrating against the war. Frankly, after listening to the speeches \nand watching the crowd and seeing the fervor of the crowd, both \nSecretary Chafee and Under Secretary Warner returned to the Pentagon \nand recommended to Melvin Laird that he better take a close look at \nthis war, that things would have to change, based on their observation \nof what was happening on the Capitol Mall that day.\n  That is John Warner perfectly described: Someone who gathers the \nfacts, and after having an understanding of the facts, issues his \nhonest opinion as to what is going on. He and John Chafee, two \nwonderful human beings, two dedicated servants of the U.S. military \nreturned back to the Secretary of Defense and said: Things have to \nchange.\n  After serving in the Department of the Navy, he did a number of other \nthings. But the story I try to tell is, I repeat, a real John Warner \nportrayal because he is always eager to listen to all sides of an \nissue. He is always willing to part from conventional wisdom in order \nto do the right thing, and then once he says he is going to do \nsomething, that is it. So after serving in the Department of the Navy, \nhe decided he would accept the challenge of being the national \ncoordinator for America's bicentennial celebration in 1976. As my \ncolleagues know, there are a lot of things that happened during that \nperiod of time under his leadership. But as a little side story, there \nis a story about Virginia City, NV. Virginia City, NV, at one time was \na thriving place of some 30,000 or 40,000. It was the reason Nevada \nbecame a State so far ahead of most Western territories. In 1864, we \nbecame a State. But as part of his going around the country, as you do \nwhen you have a job such as his, raising money and giving speeches, he \nwas asked to go to Virginia City, this historic place in Nevada. He had \nnever been there. It is a very winding road to get up there, and it is \na dangerous road. But he was looking forward to being there because one \nof the patrons in the area--there are some people who are wealthy in \nVirginia City--decided to have dinner in honor of the bicentennial \ncelebration. So John Warner and his entourage arrive in little Virginia \nCity, which now, by the way, is not 30,000 or 40,000, it is a very \nsmall community of maybe, if we are lucky,\n\n[[Page S10159]]\n\na thousand--but probably not. He goes to the assigned place. He knocks \non the door. There is no answer. He looks in the window, and you can \nsee the beautiful table, it is all set. It is a banquet in this \nbeautiful home. So someone with John Warner goes to the local law \nenforcement and says: Could you help us? Because they thought maybe \nsomething was wrong. So the local deputy comes and looks in the window \nwith everybody else, walks around the house, and he comes to Senator \nWarner and says: Mrs. So-and-so is in her vapors. The dinner will not \ngo forward. In Nevada, rather than ``in her vapors,'' we would have \nsaid she is too drunk to a have a party. But anyway, John Warner, being \nthe gentleman he is, responded that was okay. Although he came to \nVirginia City, he did not have dinner at that home that night. He went \nsomeplace else for dinner.\n  I heard Senator Dodd's remarks about him. John Warner is a unique \nindividual. I see the Presiding Officer who is a brandnew Senator. \nDuring that time, we had something called the nuclear option, and I \nheard Senator Collins talk about this today. Senator Collins was \ntalking about how John Warner silently was the leader of that situation \nthat took place. I talked to John Warner during that period of time. \nJohn Warner told me what he was going to do. I never once told anyone \npublicly what he said he would do, but we all knew where he was. I knew \nwhere he was. He was on the right side of the issue. Because of his \ncredibility, the issue, with the help of some new Senators such as the \nPresiding Officer from Colorado, was settled to the good of the \ncountry.\n  John Warner is a person who has class. He has clout and he has \ntremendous courage. John Warner was sitting as a Senator. A Democratic \nSenator was his colleague. A person was running as a Republican against \nhis colleague in the Senate, somebody whom John Warner didn't agree \nwith, and he said so. That takes courage. Think about that. You are a \nRepublican from a Republican State. You are sitting with a Democrat. \nThe person who is the nominee for the party is somebody whom you would \nthink the senior Senator from Virginia would support. John Warner, as a \nmatter of conscience, couldn't do that, and he didn't. Everybody said \n``that is the end of John Warner. He will never get reelected.'' But, \nof course, it only caused his popularity to grow in the State of \nVirginia because they know John Warner is a person who supports people \nfor whom they are, what they do, not any political party.\n  John Warner was elected in 1978 to the first of five terms \nrepresenting the Commonwealth of Virginia. Three years ago, he became \nthe second longest serving Senator in the history of the Commonwealth \nof Virginia. It is without any elaboration or fluff of any kind that \nnow, in his 30th year as a Senator, John Warner has rightly earned the \nreputation as one of America's alltime great legislators. He is an \nexpert in a number of different areas: national security. He is a \nchampion for the men and women in the military, there is no question \nabout that; he served as chairman and now the ranking member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee; he is a leader on environmental \nissues; he served as long-time senior member of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, where I had the pleasure of serving with him.\n  John Warner is going to return to private life at the end of the \nyear. The family, our family, our Senate family will lose a tremendous \nleader and friend. In a place where one's integrity is paramount, I \nhave not known anyone more honest and honorable than John William \nWarner. I have served throughout my career with lots of people at city \nlevel, county level, State level, in the House of Representatives, and \nin the Senate. I have served with hundreds and hundreds of men and \nwomen. There may be, John Warner, people who are as honest and as \nhonorable as you, but never have I met anyone more honorable and more \nhonest than you. Our country is grateful to you for your service. Even \nthough the people of Nevada don't know you, if they did, they would be \nas grateful as I am for what you have done for our country: Dedicated \nservice in the Senate, in the Armed Services Committee, for the cause \nof democracy.\n  He knows everybody. I was talking to him the day before yesterday \nwhen Paul Newman died. I said: Did you know Paul Newman? He said: Yes. \nMy son went with his daughter for a couple years. I said to him: Was \nhis daughter as pretty as Paul Newman was handsome? He said: More so. \nThat kind of speaks to his son, too, doesn't it?\n  John Warner, a man who had an estate in Virginia, decided a number of \nyears ago to no longer have that and moved into the city. I wish I had \nthe words to express, to communicate, to tell him of my affection, my \nadmiration. But even though I may not be able to express it very well, \nI want John Warner to know that John Warner will always be in my heart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think sometimes Senators should be seen \nand not heard from. That might be this moment for me. I am deeply moved \nand humbled by your comments, my dear friend and leader of this body, \nat this time. As I was talking with Senator Dodd about history and how \nboth of us have an interest in the great events of our Nation, we \ntalked about the challenges facing America tonight and how fortunate we \nare to have leaders such as yourself and Senator McConnell on this side \nof the aisle to lead our Nation out of this situation. I am glad we \ndidn't dwell on those heavy matters. We touched on the light ones as we \ntalked together. How well I remember you as the chairman of the \ncommittee; you remember we worked on batteries. For some reason, the \nlead battery was the center focus at that time.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, now it is a big issue. We tried a long \ntime ago.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is right. But we got some money and put it into \nresearch of batteries, which hopefully might be contributing in the \nfuture to our deliverance from the problems we have with reliance on \nforeign oil and greater use of our motor vehicles operated by natural \ngas. But I could go on.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could I interrupt my friend and say one \nthing? I wish to say this because I try not to be envious. Envy is not \nanything that is good, but I have to admit that I am so envious of your \nhair. I mean, for a man--I mean, I am envious. I have to acknowledge \nthat. It is great. I wish I could get up in the morning and go to the \nmirror and have that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am about breathless at the moment, but if you will \nspare me a minute to tell a story about that. My mother lived to be 96 \nyears old and she bequeathed this to me. But I can tell you a number of \ntimes calls come into my office and people will inquire and ask for the \nSecretary, not me, and they will say my husband has a bit of a problem, \nbut it can be solved if the Senator would say where he gets his wig. So \nI am not--that is true. It has happened about a dozen times in my 30 \nyears. So that is one of the great things----\n  Mr. REID. So you will forgive me of my envy?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you.\n  Mr. WARNER. But I thank my distinguished leader. I also wish to say, \non behalf of my wife, the deep affection our two wives have. They have \nbeen privileged to serve the responsibility of shepherding the annual \nevent for the First Lady. When that occurred in my house, everything \nstopped. I mean all engines, everything. The total focus for weeks was \nthat luncheon. I think my wife succeeded your wife.\n\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. WARNER. My wife learned the meticulous manner in which your wife \nplanned that event. But the wives play a vital role in this \ninstitution. While we sit here and have what I call the good old \ndemocracy mind and we argue between each other in the quietude of the \nevening, our wives will put us together and all is forgotten. That is \nthe strength of this institution.\n  I thank my good friend. I do not deserve the rich remarks he made, \nbut I accept them in the sense that he made them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join in the tributes of my colleagues \nwho are leaving the Senate on the Republican side. There are only three \nways to leave the Senate. You can retire, you\n\n[[Page S10160]]\n\ncan lose, or you can die. They have chosen the best of the three \noptions, to leave of their own will.\n  The first Senator to whom I wish to pay tribute is on the floor. That \nis Senator John Warner of Virginia. I have listened to the tributes \nfrom Senators Harry Reid and Chris Dodd and so many others and I join \nin the chorus. I will not recount John's illustrious career and service \nto our country. But he was kind enough a few weeks ago, when I called \nand said I do a cable show, can I drop by his office, and he agreed to \nit. We have captured forever, in this little cable show I do, his \noffice. Some of the memorabilia tell the story of his life and the \nstory of Virginia and the U.S. Navy, I might add, and he also shared so \nmany great stories of his service to our country in so many different \ncapacities--in the Navy, in the Marine Corps, in the President's \nCabinet, and in the Senate.\n  I think of John Warner and his gentlemanly ways as I hope not a \nthrowback to the Senate of the past but perhaps an inspiration of the \nSenate of the future because his friendship transcends party label.\n  There have been times in the Senate when he has proven, with his \nindependence, that he looks at issues honestly and directly and \nsometimes has broken from the ranks of his fellow Republicans when he \nfelt it was necessary. I know he thinks long and hard before he makes \nthose decisions.\n  There have been times when he showed extraordinary leadership during \nthis contentious debate over this war in Iraq. He and Senator Levin \nexemplified the very best in the Senate. Even when they disagreed, they \nwere totally respectful of one another, they were deferential to one \nanother's feelings and interest. Yet they served the national purpose \nby engaging in a meaningful, thoughtful debate on an extremely \ncontroversial issue.\n  During the course of the last several years--John Warner may not \nremember this, but I will never forget it--when I got into hot water on \nthe floor of the Senate for words that were spoken, John Warner was one \nof the first to come to me afterward. He put an arm on my shoulder and \nsaid: Look, we all make mistakes. Carry on.\n  I know it is probably something he has forgotten, but I never will. I \nthank him for that generous spirit and compassion, which I hope will be \npart of my public service career in the future, as has exemplified his \nown. He showed courage so many times and foresight that will be part of \nhis legacy.\n  As Harry Reid mentioned, the courage to step out in his own home \nState against all the odds and to take on a member of his own party \nwith whom he disagreed in a very public way, that wasn't missed. We \nnoticed all across America that you were willing to show that kind of \ncourage.\n  In the Senate recently, if Senator Barbara Boxer was on the floor--if \nshe hasn't already done it, I am sure she will when she returns--she \nwill tell you, were it not for John Warner's leadership, the debate on \nthe issue of global warming would not have gone forward in the Senate \nthis year. Both Senator Warner and Senator Lieberman stepped up and \nfound a bipartisan approach to deal with this issue. We did not pass \nit. I wish we had. But we certainly engaged in debate many thought was \nimpossible. We brought it to the floor. We engaged the Senate and the \nAmerican people in a thoughtful consideration of an issue that will be \nhere for generations to come.\n  I consider it a great honor to have served with John. I think he is \nan exceptional individual. Virginia was lucky to have him as their \nvoice in the Senate for 30 years. America was lucky to have him in \nservice to our country in so many different capacities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his very \nthoughtful remarks. Our relationship has been one that included both \nwives. I recall an event we attended, and immediately the next morning \nmy wife received from you a book which she, being an avid reader, \nstayed in that book for the evenings that went on for a week or so. \nThat is the way this great institution works. It is not all on the \nfloor before the television cameras.\n  Senator Durbin is a strong leader, a tough adversary. I wish to say \nhow much I have enjoyed working with you through these years. I wish \nyou and my other colleagues well because you have a great challenge in \nthe next few days or two. We have to solve--and you will be part of \nthat leadership team dealing with it, along with colleagues on this \nside--we have to reach the right solution to restore America's \nconfidence in the lifeblood of this Nation; namely, its economics.\n  I thank the Senator. I wish to add that my mother very proudly always \nclaimed Illinois as her State.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are honored being the home of your \nmother's birthplace. I failed to mention one other bill that I think is \nso important, and that is the extraordinary assistance Senator Warner \ngave to his colleague, Senator Webb, when it came to the new GI bill. \nThat bill passed, and it will dramatically improve the lives of so many \nveterans and their families because we stepped forward in a bipartisan \nfashion. It was the first thing Senator Webb said to me as a new \nSenator was his goal, and he would be the first to add he could never \nhave achieved it without the support of his colleague from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, how thoughtful to raise that, not in the \ncontext of this Senator but Senator Webb. I have great respect for him, \nparticularly his military career, which is extraordinary, where mine is \nof far less consequence. I joined him. He was the leader on that \nlegislation. I always said I was the sergeant in the mere ranks of his \nplatoon. But it did, and it enabled me to add one more chapter to what \nI have tried to do so much: to repay to the current generation, the men \nand women who very bravely wear the uniform, all the wonderful things \nthat were taught me by previous generations of men and women who wore \nthe uniform from whom I learned so much throughout my entire career and \npublic life.\n  That is landmark legislation, I say to my good friend from Illinois. \nIt is something that is well-deserved for the men and women and their \nfamilies. I commend you for bringing up that about our good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Webb.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 12 years ago when I came to the Senate, I \nwas joined by a new Senator from Nebraska, Chuck Hagel. Chuck became a \nfriend, and we have worked together on a number of issues over the \nyears. He also, in a weak moment, agreed to do my cable show. I went to \nhis office. We talked about his background; first, his service in \nVietnam, something I particularly admire, the courage he showed in \nvolunteering to serve in our Army, and then coming together with his \nbrother in the same unit and both of them under fire. Both of them \nserved our country in combat. He came back and was a successful \nbusinessman. He went on to serve the people of Nebraska and eventually \nto serve in the Senate.\n  We have worked over the years together. I have always found him to be \na gentleman. His word is good, and he has the courage to step up and \ntake a position once in a while that may not be popular, even in \nNebraska.\n  I know his leadership on the issue of the war in Iraq will be \nremembered because, during the last 2 years when we struggled to find a \nway to bring this war to a close, he is one who would cross the aisle \nand join us in an effort to find a reasonable way to end this conflict \nin an honorable manner. I respect him so much for that.\n  I have one special little measure of gratitude for Chuck Hagel. There \nis a bill I introduced which is as near and dear to me as any I \nconsidered. It is called the DREAM Act, to give literally tens of \nthousands of children across America who came to this country, were \nbrought here by undocumented parents, grew up as Americans, never \nknowing any other life, any other culture, maybe not knowing any other \nlanguage but English, and now find themselves graduating high school \nwith no country. They are told officially by American law they are not \nwanted or needed and asked to leave. They have nowhere to go. This is \nhome. They want a chance, just a chance to be part of America's future \nin a legal way.\n  This DREAM Act has been controversial because it relates to \nimmigration,\n\n[[Page S10161]]\n\nand that is not an easy issue. Chuck Hagel stepped up and cosponsored \nthat legislation with me, and I will never forget it. It meant a lot \nfor him to show that kind of courage.\n  Even though we did not prevail, someday we will, and when that day \ncomes, I will honor him on the floor for his exceptional courage on \nthis matter that means so much to so many young people across our \ncountry.\n\n\n                             Pete Domenici\n\n  Pete Domenici of New Mexico has been an institution in the Senate for \nmany years. It has been a pleasure to serve with him for 12. I once \nvisited New Mexico and went to a roadside stand where they sell these \nChristmas wreaths made out of chili peppers. There was a Mexican-\nAmerican lady. I started to buy the Christmas wreath to take home to my \nfamily, and I said to her: So I understand you have a Senator in this \nState named Domenici. Oh, I love Pete Domenici, she said, and went on \nand on about what a great man he was, how much she liked him. She said: \nYou know, I am a Democrat, but I am a Domenici Democrat. I always voted \nfor Pete. I think he is a good man.\n  He is a good man. He and his wife Nancy have raised a good family. He \nhas done so many things. He feels passionate about so many issues, but \nthe one I wish to particularly credit him for leadership on is the \nissue of mental health parity.\n  He and Paul Wellstone stood up on that issue when nobody else would. \nPaul passed away 6 years ago in a plane crash. We have continued to \nfind a way to pass that bill. We still have a chance in the closing \nhours of this session, and I hope we do.\n  In a magnanimous gesture, Pete came forward and said this should be \nknown as the Wellstone-Domenici bill; Paul Wellstone deserves top \nbilling on it. I am glad he did that. It showed character and the kind \nof man he is. We need to pass that bill before we go home, not just for \nPete Domenici and the memory of Paul Wellstone but for the millions of \npeople across America counting on us to make sure victims of mental \nillness are given fair treatment under hospitalization policies across \nthis Nation. He certainly deserves it.\n\n\n                              Wayne Allard\n\n  The last is Wayne Allard. Wayne Allard is a colleague of mine who \nmade a promise to the people of Colorado that he would not run for \nreelection, and he kept his word. He did not stand for reelection this \nyear. Wayne and I had an interesting responsibility, assignment, to \ndeal with the legislative appropriations bill. It does not get a lot of \nattention because it just deals with Capitol Hill and the people who \nwork here. But this Nation's Capitol is a great American treasure. \nWayne took it so seriously. He held more thoughtful hearings about this \nCapitol and the new Capitol Visitor Center. He asked the hard questions \nand did it in a respectful, gentlemanly way. I was honored to sit next \nto him and to participate in those hearings.\n  I came to know him and his family and respect him. We get to see one \nanother in the Senate gym in the morning. I go there in the morning for \nno obvious reason, but I get to at least socialize with Wayne and a \nnumber of other colleagues. I am going to miss him and wish him the \nvery best.\n  Those Senators leaving our ranks leave positive memories for this \nSenator from Illinois. The fact that I have been able to serve with \nthem, know them, and count them as friends, I count as one of the real \nblessings of my service in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I had occasion to share my thoughts \nabout the Senator from Virginia before and do not intend to expand on \nthose remarks at this point other than to note that I think all of us, \nparticularly those of us who are new, very much feel we are graced by \nthis institution and by the opportunity we have to serve in it. Some of \nus have the opportunity to grace it back, and Senator Warner of \nVirginia has certainly done that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks, the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation, as \nalways, to my good friend. This man will leave his mark in this \ninstitution. I tell all that with a great sense of pride, as will the \nPresiding Officer. I have come to know him and work with him on many \noccasions.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                  Department of Justice Investigations\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am particularly gratified to be \nspeaking about this now because you, the distinguished Senator from \nColorado, were formerly the attorney general from Colorado at a time \nwhen I was the attorney general of Rhode Island, and I just want to \nmake a quick point.\n  We all recall the very unfortunate tragedy, really, that befell the \nDepartment of Justice as a result of extremely unfortunate decisions \nmade at the management level which culminated in the forced \nretirement--the firing, if you will--of a significant number of U.S. \nattorneys for political reasons. The fallout from that disaster has \nobviously been profound: the Attorney General resigned, the entire top \nstructure of the Department of Justice is gone, and a lengthy \ninvestigation has taken place into what happened.\n  In the last 2 days, the Office of Inspector General at the Department \nof Justice and the Office of Professional Responsibility of the \nDepartment of Justice have released their report. It is about this \nbig--it is 348 pages, I think--and I have been through it.\n  First of all, I want to compliment the Office of Inspector General \nand the Office of Professional Responsibility on the work they did. It \nis an exhaustive, thorough, and profound piece of investigative \nresearch. But what sticks out more than anything else from that report \nto me is the fact that former White House appointees refused to be \ninterviewed. The former counsel, a lawyer, to the White House refused \nto be interviewed. The President's political adviser refused to be \ninterviewed. More than that, the White House itself refused to provide \ninternal e-mails relevant to this investigation to the Department of \nJustice.\n  We have been denied those things on grounds of executive privilege, \nbut there is no executive privilege between the White House and an \nexecutive agency. So there were no grounds for refusing to cooperate \nand refusing to provide those materials. There was no legal \njustification for it. They just said no.\n  Worse still, as the Presiding Officer knows, there is an office \nwithin the Department of Justice known as the Office of Legal Counsel--\nI repeat, within the Department of Justice. The Office of Legal Counsel \nitself refused to provide a document in its possession to the Office of \nInspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility in this \ninvestigation. It was a triple stonewall--the former White House \nofficials, the White House itself, and the Office of Legal Counsel with \nrespect to this one White House document. As a result, the inspector \ngeneral's report itself concludes that their investigation was \nhampered--that is their word--that their investigation was hindered--\nthat is their word--and that there were gaps left in this investigation \nas a result of the failure of the White House to cooperate and \ninstruction to the OLC not to produce the document. And indeed, one of \nthe people who refused to cooperate--a former White House employee, \nformer White House Counsel Miers--indicated that the reason she wasn't \nwas because to cooperate with this would be inconsistent with White \nHouse instructions not to cooperate with Congress.\n  So here is the point. Where is the Attorney General in this? You have \nbeen an attorney general; I have been an attorney general. What happens \nwhen you are in charge of an investigation and your investigators are \nhampered and hindered in their investigation in a way that leaves gaps \nin the investigation as a result of noncooperation by your own \nadministration? What do you do? We were elected to our positions as \nattorney general. We would have known what to do.\n  I think this is a very important moment in the history of the \nDepartment of Justice. It is a contest of wills between the White House \nrefusing to cooperate and the Department of Justice going about its \nlegitimate investigative function. I think the Attorney General has an \nimportant role. I think it is vital for the Attorney General to stand \nwith his investigators, with his\n\n[[Page S10162]]\n\nOffice of Inspector General, and with his Office of Professional \nResponsibility. I think he has no choice, without doing lasting damage \nto the Department of Justice and creating forever the precedent that \nwhen it comes to the investigative responsibilities of the Department \nof Justice, White House participation is optional, even when the \ninvestigation leads into the White House. That is an admission by the \nDepartment of Justice at the highest level, by the Attorney General \nhimself, that the White House is above the law in this country, which I \ndon't think is the right answer.\n  I haven't been in that position. I know it is a tough call. But other \nAttorneys General have been in that position and they have faced that \ntough call. Just recently, we learned that Attorney General Ashcroft \nwas prepared to resign in a similar face-off with the White House. \nBacked by Deputy Attorney General Comey and others in the Department \nand faced with that stern resolve by those men, the White House blinked \nand backed down. So the question now is, Does Attorney General Mukasey \nhave that same stern resolve or will he be the one who blinks and backs \ndown? He has appointed a new Special Prosecutor, but we don't know what \nis going to happen there.\n  As a former attorney general, the Presiding Officer knows well that \ncould disappear into a grand jury, be protected by Rule 6(e) secrecy of \nthe grand jury, and never be heard from again. This could be a way to \nput the investigation aside and quiet it rather than to see it through. \nBut what the Attorney General can do is march up to the White House and \nsay: This noncooperation is not tolerable, it is not acceptable, and I \nwill not stand for it. One of two things is going to happen: Either the \nWhite House is going to cooperate with my investigation or I am going \nto resign.\n  That is the position the Attorney General is now in.\n  Winston Churchill used to talk about the fine agate points on which \ngreat institutions and history turn. I think Attorney General Mukasey \nis at one of those points, and the question for him now is, Do you \nblink or do you stand with your investigators?\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa. I said I \nwould be brief, and I was only marginally brief. Perhaps by Senate \nstandards I was brief but not by real standards, and I appreciate his \npatience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                     Tax Treatment Health Insurance\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to visit with my colleagues for a \nbit about the tax treatment of health insurance. Republicans and \nDemocrats who have studied the issue agree that the current tax \ntreatment of health insurance is inequitable. Others believe our \ncurrent tax rules increase health care spending and contribute to the \ngrowing number of uninsured, to add to other negative aspects of the \npresent tax treatment of health insurance. Congress needs to take a \nvery hard look at the Tax Code when it takes up health care reform.\n  There are a number of ways to structure a proposal that would change \nthe tax treatment of health insurance. Today, I wish to talk about the \nway Senator McCain structures his proposal to change the tax treatment \nof health insurance. The reason I want to do this is because, as the \nsenior Republican tax writer, it is my obligation to set the record \nstraight.\n  For too many weeks, I have heard inaccurate statements made about \nMcCain's proposal for a tax credit for health insurance proposals, and \nI have heard them from mostly Democrats. For example, my friend, the \nsenior Senator from Illinois and the majority whip, was on the floor of \nthis Chamber on Thursday, September 11, saying that ``Senator McCain \nwill tax Americans' health insurance.'' The very next day, the junior \nSenator from Ohio, in an exchange with the majority whip, also said \nthat Senator McCain ``wants to tax those health care policies that tens \nof millions of Americans have.'' The senior Senator from Delaware has \nalso been saying Senator McCain wants to tax people's health \ninsurance--not here on the floor but on the campaign trail as the \nDemocratic nominee for Vice President. He has also been saying that in \ntelevision interviews. The junior Senator from Illinois consistently \nmakes this explosive claim on the stump.\n  Well, using the words of my distinguished friend: Enough. Whether or \nnot the tax credit for health insurance proposals taxes a worker's \nhealth insurance, the claims that have been made are half-baked, and \nthis is the reason: The critics of the McCain plan fail to mention a \nkey component of his proposal. That key component is that Senator \nMcCain would provide every American who purchases health insurance a \ntax credit.\n  It appears that the critics overlook--or maybe they just don't \nunderstand--that the tax credit provides a bigger tax benefit to people \nthan they would receive under the current system. So people would be \nbetter off under the McCain plan. Don't the critics want to help lower \nand middle income workers better afford health insurance? Don't they \nwant to help the uninsured? Senator McCain is on the side of these \nAmericans, while his critics are favoring the status quo.\n  Another false claim I have heard is that the tax credit proposal \nwould ``deny the deduction employers can take when they pay for all or \na portion of their employees' health insurance.'' Again, that is flat \nwrong. Even Senator Obama has said that employers will pay taxes on \nhealth insurance under the McCain plan.\n  In the recent Presidential debate, my friend from Illinois said:\n\n       Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes \n     on health care that you're getting from your employer.\n\n  I am taking the floor now to tell the junior Senator from Illinois \nand his Democratic colleagues, and especially the American people, that \nSenator Obama's description of his rival's proposal is inaccurate. \nEmployers--and I emphasize this--will not pay taxes on the health \ninsurance they offer to their workers.\n  I want to discuss how this issue is playing out in the media. Here is \none instance. This past Sunday, on ABC ``This Week,'' Senator McCain \nwas interviewed. In the interview, Senator McCain was asked about the \naccuracy of Senator Obama's claim that the McCain proposal for the tax \ncredit for health insurance would ``tax health benefits for the first \ntime by taking away the deduction that employers now get to provide \nhealth benefits.''\n  Here are the facts: The McCain plan does not--I repeat, does not--\ntake away the employer deduction.\n  Employers will not pay taxes on health benefits. Businesses will \ncontinue to be able to deduct health care expenses as they do now, and \nthey will continue to be able to provide health care, as they do now.\n  For employers, then, there will be no change. No change. Finally, and \nmost importantly, Senator Obama's campaign has consistently stated that \nthe McCain tax credit proposal would ``raise taxes on the middle \nclass.''\n  The left-leaning think tanks, funded by the likes of George Soros and \ncompany, have been making that same claim. So again I say enough. The \nMcCain tax credit for health care insurance proposal would not increase \ntaxes on the middle class. To the contrary, the proposal would provide \nlow- and middle-income workers with, get this, a tax cut. But do not \ntake my word for it. I would like to have you listen to the Tax Policy \nCenter, a nonpartisan think tank that has received notoriety for \nanalyzing the tax plans of Senator McCain and Senator Obama.\n  The Tax Policy Center illustrates that the McCain tax credit for \nhealth insurance produces a tax cut for workers. Len Burman, director \nof the Tax Policy Center, said, ``It is mostly a tax break,'' when he \nwas interviewed by CBS News on September 15.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the CBS News report printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The bottom line, the McCain tax credit for health \ninsurance would not affect the employers' business deduction nor would \nemployers pay taxes on health insurance. The proposal would not raise \ntaxes on the middle class, rather it would provide a tax cut for the \nmiddle class.\n  Finally, while the proposal taxes workers' health insurance, Senator \nMcCain is providing the same workers\n\n[[Page S10163]]\n\nwith a tax credit, which is a bigger tax benefit than low- and middle-\nincome workers receive under our current system.\n  I am going to slow down. Let me explain how health insurance is \ncurrently taxed. And the reason is because it is vitally important that \nmy Senate colleagues and my friends in the media understand the current \nrules governing the taxation of health insurance. To be clear, there \nare very distinct tax rules that apply to, one, an individual \npurchasing their health insurance; two, an employer paying for all or a \nportion of its employees' health insurance; and, three, workers \npurchasing insurance through their employer.\n  Unfortunately, most people mix up these three different kinds of tax \nrules. For example, far too often I have heard people get the employee \nexclusion, which I will explain in a moment, confused with the employer \nbusiness deduction. So I have a chart that lays it out. Employee \nexception and employer business deduction is not equal. Employee \nexclusion is for the worker; employer business deduction is for the \nemployer.\n  The employee exclusion is there. Well, a worker purchasing health \ncare through his or her employer does not pay income or payroll taxes \non the cost of the health insurance policy.\n  In other words, the amount of health insurance coverage that is paid \nfor by the employer is excludable from income. This means that the cost \nof the employer-provided health insurance is not taxable for income or \npayroll tax purposes.\n  In addition, the amount of the health insurance coverage that is paid \nfor by the individual worker on their own behalf through a salary \nreduction arrangement reduces the worker's taxable income. This means \nthat a worker has less income on which to pay income and payroll taxes.\n  As the chart says, the employee's exclusion is the tax benefit \nprovided to the worker. Let's drill down on the employee exclusion for \na moment. I want to explain how this tax benefit works.\n  Tax 101 teaches us that the tax benefit that you get from a tax \nexclusion, just like a tax deduction, is based on the tax bracket you \nare in. This means if you are in a high tax bracket, you receive a \nbigger tax benefit than someone in a lower tax bracket. So it is very \nregressive.\n  Here is a chart that illustrates how regressive the current employee \nexclusion of the cost of employer-provided health insurance really is.\n  So we have a new chart. Take a look at it. Here we assume that the \naverage cost of a family's health insurance policy would be about \n$12,000. After all, the coverage that Members of Congress get costs \naround $12,000. So this ought to be a good number to use. As you can \nsee, a worker in the 10-percent tax bracket would receive 1,200 \ndollars' worth of benefits. Compare this with a tax benefit that an \nupper income worker receives, and you find out it is $4,200 a year, a \ngreat amount of inequity.\n  We have to ask ourselves, is it fair that low- and middle-income \nworkers receive a smaller tax benefit for health insurance than upper \nincome workers receive?\n  Now, what is the employer business deduction? Here an employer paying \nfor all or a portion of its employees' health insurance can deduct the \namounts they pay as ordinary and necessary business expenses, no \ndifferent than the employer can deduct wages. In essence, the Tax Code \ntreats employer contributions for health benefits as compensation. This \nis consistent with how economists view employer contributions for \nhealth benefits. It is as simple as that.\n  It is important to note that the employer business deduction is a tax \nbenefit provided to the employer. So we put the original chart back up. \nI did not want to leave out another very important tax benefit for \nhealth insurance, or should I say, the lack of a tax benefit. I am \nspeaking about the fact that people who purchase their own health \ninsurance generally do not receive a tax benefit under our current \nlaws.\n  They could if they were self-employed, but I am talking about people \nnot self-employed or not otherwise employed or employed where they do \nnot have health insurance, and you want to buy it on your own. In this \ncase, the individual purchases his or her own insurance with aftertax \ndollars out of their own pocket. These individuals are able to deduct \nmedical expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross \nincome, but only if the individual itemizes their return. And exceeding \nthe 7.5 percent of gross income to get an income tax deduction for \nhealth care and health insurance is not very common. That is why only \nabout 6 percent of all tax returns claim the deduction above that 7.5 \npercent.\n  Let's now turn to how changing the current tax rules in the same \nmanner, as contemplated by Senator McCain, would affect people and \nwould affect employers. I want to explain to my friends who are \ncritics, and I have told you who those Senators are, and my friends in \nthe media, how the McCain tax credit for health insurance would \nactually work.\n  We can quickly cross the impact any changes would have on employers \noff the list right away. The reason: As I have said two or three times, \nemployers will not be affected, contrary to what several Senators have \nsaid criticizing the health insurance plan of Senator McCain. Everyone \nneeds to understand this key fact because the critics keep getting it \nwrong.\n  In other words, let me say for a fourth or fifth time: Employers will \nnot be affected by how the McCain tax plan works.\n  Let's talk about individuals purchasing their own health insurance. \nAs I mentioned, under the current tax laws, these people generally do \nnot get a tax benefit. The McCain tax credit for health insurance \nproposal would give these people a meaningful tax benefit and do it for \nthe very first time. The tax credit could be used by the individual to \nreduce the cost of their health insurance. In this case, the individual \nwould not be required to spend as much of their own hard-earned money \non health insurance as they do under the current system.\n\n  If the tax credit exceeds the pricetag of the individual's health \ninsurance policy, the excess may be used for other health care \nexpenses. You could use it like for copays or deductibles.\n  Now we get to the most important part. I am going to explain how \nworkers will be affected by the McCain tax credit for health insurance. \nI would like all of my colleagues, whether you are Republican or \nDemocrat, and particularly my friends in the media, to pay close \nattention because the senior Senator from Arizona has structured his \ntax credit for health insurance in a very unique way.\n  Let's get back to the basic. As I stated, health insurance that a \nworker purchases through his or her employer is not taxable to the \nworker. Again, this is referred to as the employee exclusion. The \nexclusion, however, has two parts. So we will look at a new chart.\n  No. 1, the worker does not pay income taxes on the cost of coverage; \nand, two, the worker does not pay payroll taxes on the cost of \ncoverage. Very clear on the chart. The proposal advanced by my friend \nfrom Arizona would maintain the payroll tax exclusion. So let me \nrepeat. The cost of health insurance a worker gets through their \nemployer would not be taxed for payroll tax purposes. This goes for the \nemployer as well.\n  That is why I have emphasized that the employers do not pay any taxes \nunder the McCain plan. With regard to income taxes, Senator McCain \nconverts the current income tax exclusion into a tax credit. Let me say \nit another way. The McCain tax credit for health insurance proposals \ndoes not eliminate the income tax exclusion. Instead, the income tax \nexclusion is converted to a tax credit.\n  So here, let's go back to tax 101. As I discussed earlier, tax 101 \nteaches us that a tax exclusion, just like a tax deduction, is tied to \nyour tax bracket. A tax credit, on the other hand, is not tied to your \ntax bracket. Rather, the tax credit reduces your tax liability dollar \nfor dollar. This means that, by definition, a tax credit is more \nvaluable to a lower-income taxpayer. So if you were to convert the \nincome tax exclusion into a tax credit, you would effectively be \nincreasing the tax benefits for low-income workers.\n  Depending on the dollar amount of the tax credit, this would also be \ntrue for middle-income workers as well. So this is what I am saying: I \nam saying the McCain tax credit for health insurance is effectively \nincreasing the tax\n\n[[Page S10164]]\n\nbenefit for low- and middle-income workers. I am saying the McCain tax \ncredit makes the tax treatment of health insurance more equitable \nbecause every worker is receiving the same tax benefit.\n  How can some of my friends on the other side oppose making the \ncurrent tax treatment of health insurance more equitable? Do my friends \nnot want to help out low- and middle-income workers? Let me show my \ncolleagues and my friends in the media how the McCain tax credit for \nhealth insurance produces a tax cut.\n  Under the proposal, the health insurance a worker purchases through \nhis or her employer would be taxed like compensation for income tax \npurposes. But, unlike compensation paid in the form of taxes, the \nproposal would not subject the cost of employer-provided health \ninsurance to payroll taxes, as I have discussed. This means that amount \nof taxes a worker would be required to pay on the cost of their health \ninsurance would only depend on the worker's income tax bracket.\n  Under the proposal, the worker would apply the tax credit against the \nnew income tax liability that is generated from taxing the worker's \nhealth insurance.\n  In other words, the tax credit would offset any new income tax \nliability. As illustrated in this chart, because the new income tax \nliability would be less than the tax credit, the worker would actually \nreceive a tax cut.\n  So let's take a closer look at the chart. We have several different \nbrackets. Let's assume a family of four purchases a family health \ninsurance policy of $12,000 through its employer. Under the proposal, \nthis family would pay income taxes on a $12,000 policy. Let's assume \nthis family would be in the 25-percent tax bracket. This family would \npay $3,000 in additional income taxes. This new tax liability would be \noffset by a $5,000 tax credit for family health insurance. As a result, \n$2,000 would be left over. This means the family would receive a $2,000 \ntax cut. This is a tax cut that would be greater if a family purchased \neven less expensive coverage.\n  As we can see, the tax credit for health insurance produces a tax cut \nfor all workers. The tax cut is progressive because workers in the 10-\npercent bracket are receiving almost five times the tax cuts for the \nworkers in the 35-percent tax bracket.\n  You can see again, by looking at the chart, that a worker in the 10-\npercent tax bracket would receive a $3,800 tax cut, compared to the tax \ncut for an upper income worker in the 35-percent tax bracket of $800.\n  Like most campaign-related proposals, there are a number of questions \nof how the idea will impact people in the long run. As the senior \nRepublican tax writer, I will ask these questions. If I determine that \nCongress needs to tweak the proposal here or there to improve it, I \nwill recommend that we do so. But only time will tell whether we have \nto undertake such an exercise.\n  I hope my friends on the other side and those in the media have heard \nme. I hope they work on getting it right because it is clear, No. 1, \nthat the McCain tax credit for health insurance produces a tax cut for \nworkers; two, that the McCain tax credit for health insurance provides \na tax benefit to people purchasing their own insurance and doing this \nfor the very first time; and, three, that the proposal does not \nadversely impact employers in any way, shape, or form.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                           [From CBSNews.com]\n\n               The Truth About McCain and Insurance Taxes\n\n       Washington, September 15, 2008.--It's one of the most \n     explosive and important political charges of the election: \n     ``He wants to tax your health benefits,'' Barack Obama said.\n       Obama's charge was that that John McCain wants to tax the \n     health insurance benefits. Americans buy through employers, \n     CBS News correspondent Wyatt Andrews reports.\n       ``That's a $3.6 trillion tax potentially increase on middle \n     class families,'' Obama said. ``That will eventually leave \n     tens of millions of you paying higher taxes.''\n       John McCain wants a multi-trillion dollar tax on the middle \n     class? Here are the facts.\n       Obama has the tax part correct, but the impact on the \n     middle class is exaggerated--most people will see tax cuts.\n       McCain has proposed to end one of the largest tax breaks in \n     the entire economy. Some 60 million Americans buy health \n     insurance thru employers tax-free, and McCain would indeed \n     begin to tax the value of the benefit.\n       However McCain also proposes to give the money back as a \n     tax credit, $2,500 for individuals, $5,000 for families. \n     ``Let's give them a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go out \n     and get the health insurance of their choice,'' McCain said. \n     ``It's mostly a tax break,'' said Len Burman of the Tax \n     Policy Center.\n       The non-partisan Tax Policy Center says except for the very \n     richest Americans, most people buying insurance will see a \n     tax cut.\n       ``Families at all income levels would pay lower taxes, at \n     least on average,'' said Burman. ``On average, is about a \n     $1,200 tax cut in 2009.''\n       On the issue of energy, meanwhile Gov Palin touts her \n     energy expertise based on Alaska's production.\n       ``My job has been to oversee nearly 20 percent of the U.S. \n     domestic supply of oil and gas,'' she said.\n       Here are the facts: According to the Energy Department, \n     Palin's numbers are high.\n       Alaska provides 14.3 percent of America's crude oil, and \n     only 2.6 percent of its natural gas. You can check out the \n     Energy Information Administration statistics here.\n       On the health care debate, the Obama campaign tells CBS \n     News that one day, the middle class will be hit by a McCain \n     tax increase--but the experts CBS News consulted said that \n     day is 10 years away.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Passenger Rail \nImprovement and Investment Act and the rail safety bill.\n  I thank Senator Lautenberg, the senior Senator from New Jersey, for \nbeing a tireless advocate for rail travel and for successfully \nshepherding these two essential bills to the floor and hopefully to \nfinal passage. In a time of high gas prices, rising air fares, \nincreasing traffic congestion and concerns about greenhouse gas \nemissions, rail travel can give Americans a sensible alternative mode \nof travel.\n  Unfortunately, we have not provided rail travel the funding it needs \nto truly flourish. Every year since 2002 Amtrak has had to scrape by \nand continue operations on a yearly basis without adequate funds to \nmaintain the rail system over the long haul. The system is at a \nbreaking point. Amtrak's equipment is aging and no amount of \nmaintenance can keep old equipment in service forever.\n  And our rail infrastructure is at the breaking point at a time when \nour citizens need this system the most. In July Amtrak had more \npassengers than in any month in its 37 year history. But Amtrak is not \njust a transportation system that serves 25 million people each year. \nAmtrak is also an economic engine that creates jobs, fights sprawl, and \nfosters economic activity. I know firsthand the benefits of Amtrak \nbecause over one hundred thousand New Jersey commuters depend on \nAmtrak's infrastructure every day.\n  Some critics want Amtrak to be the only major transportation system \nin the world that operates without government subsidy. This prompts a \nquestion. Do we ask roads to pay for themselves? Some of my colleagues \nlike to think that gas taxes pay for roads, but this has never been the \ncase. The Texas Department of Transportation recently revealed that not \na single road in Texas has ever been fully paid for by a gas tax and \nmost roads recoup less than half their costs from the gas tax.\n  Asking transportation to pay for itself is a standard that is simply \nimpossible to meet and a standard we do not hold any other mode of \ntransportation to. Over the last 35 years we have spent less money on \nAmtrak than we will on highways in this year alone. When you factor in \nState and local subsidies for infrastructure and parking some studies \nsuggest that up to 8 percent of our gross national product is spent on \nsubsidies for automobile use.\n  This bill will not give all the funds I think Amtrak deserves or \nneeds to meet its full potential, but I think this legislation finally \nauthorizes the funding Amtrak needs over the next 6 years to plan \nahead, adequately fund its operations and finance some critical capital \nimprovements. But these funds are not free.\n  The bill requires Amtrak to tighten its belt while simultaneously \nimproving service. The bill requires reforms that will reduce Amtrak's \noperating costs by 40 percent. In addition, the bill provides funds for \nStates to provide new passenger rail service between cities. In some \ninstances these State operations will likely provide service that \ncomplements existing Amtrak service just as the recent light rail \nprojects in New Jersey have done. But in other cases these funds may \nactually create competition for Amtrak for service between some cities. \nAnd this bill will\n\n[[Page S10165]]\n\nalso require Amtrak to use its resources to provide a new level of \nservice that improves on-time performance, upgrades on-board services, \nand provides easier access to other transportation systems.\n  The Amtrak bill has also been combined with critical rail safety \nlegislation that would strengthen our railroad security apparatus by \ninvesting $1.6 billion in critical transportation safety initiatives.\n  Tragically, we learned just over 2 weeks ago how important railroad \nsafety is when a Metrolink commuter train plowed head-on into a Union \nPacific freight locomotive just outside of Los Angeles. Twenty-five \npeople lost their lives and over 135 people were injured in the \ndeadliest train crash this nation has seen in 15 years.\n  Every one of those 25 Americans woke up and got ready for work that \nFriday morning just like any other day. Mothers and fathers kissed \ntheir children goodbye after breakfast, never assuming this would be \nthe last time they would see their loved ones. Weekend plans were \nmade--but were never fulfilled. That fateful Friday morning not only \nended the lives of these 25 Americans, but took away 25 mothers and \nfathers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters from family members \nwho will never be the same.\n  When people board a train in the morning on their way to work, they \ndeserve to have peace of mind that they will reach their destination \nsafely. This legislation would take significant steps to give the \nAmerican people this peace of mind. It ensures that railroad officials \nhave the resources and tools to do their job safely and effectively by \nimplementing training standards for all safety-related railroad \nemployees and requiring train conductors be certified that they are up \nto speed with the newest systems in place.\n  The bill also reforms hours-of-service requirements for crews and \nsignal employees so that these critical workers are at their sharpest \nand most alert while on duty. In addition to these measures designed to \nreduce human error, we must also address the shortcomings in our rail \ninfrastructure. Crumbling tracks, deteriorating bridges, and failing \nsignals create an environment where it is only a matter of time before \nthe next rail disaster strikes. This legislation fills many of these \ngaps by authorizing millions of dollars for critical improvements to \ninfrastructure and safety features to make our rail network as safe as \npossible.\n  This bill also ensures that safety rules are strictly adhered to by \nstrengthening the Federal Railroad Administration's enforcement tools \nand increasing the penalties for safety violations.\n  It is important to remember that our railroad network is not just \ncritical to commerce and transportation but to national security as \nwell. When the terrorist attacks on September 11 crippled our aviation \nsector, our Nation relied heavily on trains to make up the shortfall. \nThis illustrates just how important a safe, efficient, well-operated \nrail transportation network is to all aspects of our nation's well-\nbeing--from commercial and economic capacity to national security.\n  With record high gasoline prices, congested highways and airports \nthat are experiencing record delays, we need all of the alternative \nforms of transportation we can provide to the frustrated American \ntraveler. I urge my colleagues to recognize that a strong, well-funded \nand safe rail system is essential to our country. Please join me in \nvoting for this critical bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/30/senate-section/article/S10165-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   YUCCA MOUNTAIN RADIATION STANDARD\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today President Bush took time away from \ndealing with the Nation's economic crisis to direct his Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA, to release a new standard for `acceptable' \npublic radiation exposure from the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump. \nIn other words, the agency decided just how much radiation you and I \ncan live with. Let me be clear, there is no way this weak standard will \nbreathe life into the Bush-McCain plan to dump nuclear waste in Nevada. \nInstead, it will breath life into more litigation against this terrible \nproject.\n  The EPA has collaborated with the Department of Energy, DOE, to tweak \na standard that a Federal court of appeals threw out in 2001 because it \nfailed to comply with the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and would have left \nNevadans dangerously unprotected against radioactive contamination. If \nthe repository at Yucca Mountain was ever actually built, the DOE does \nnot deny that water infiltration would eventually corrode nuclear waste \npackages and radioactivity will inevitably leak into Nevada's ground \nwater. Instead of working to protect Nevadans from a public health \ncatastrophe, this scandal-ridden EPA has chosen to simply make the \nrules more lenient so DOE can legally dump waste less than 100 miles \noutside of Las Vegas. This is unacceptable.\n  Instead of working to protect the health and safety of Nevadans, EPA \nand DOE are casting science aside in an attempt to get the nuclear \nwaste dump approved. Instead of warring against science, I side with \nNevadans and experts who support safe and attainable solutions to our \nNation's nuclear waste. That is why I am working with Senator Ensign to \nkeep nuclear waste on-site at the powerplants where it is produced in \nsecure dry cask storage containers that are approved by the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. This plan is safer, more cost effective, and \nwill give us at least a century to find a more permanent solution to \nnuclear waste.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/30/senate-section/article/S10165-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10165-S10166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RULE XLIV COMPLIANCE\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor on \nmany occasions to highlight a separate violent, hate-motivated crime \nthat has occurred in our country.\n  On Saturday, September 6, 2008, in Portland, ME, a 31-year-old \nresident was walking home at 12:30 a.m. when he was stopped by two men \nand assaulted. According to the police statement, one of the assailants \nused homophobic slurs toward the victim, questioning his sexual \norientation before attacking him. The police are searching for two \nsuspects in connection with the weekend assault that they have \nclassified as a hate crime. The victim was hit once in the head and \nrecalls little else, the police said. A passerby reportedly found the \nvictim unconscious on the sidewalk and called police. The victim was \ntaken by ambulance to Maine Medical Center where he was admitted for \ntreatment of a head injury.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/30/senate-section/article/S10166-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INCREASED BRAIN ANEURYSM AWARENESS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss an \nimportant medical condition that, in my opinion, is in need of \nincreased attention. Brain aneurysm is defined by the National \nInstitute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS, as, ``the \ndilation, bulging, or ballooning-out of part of the wall of an artery \nin the brain.'' Nationwide, there are 27,000 patients who each year \nhave a ruptured aneurysm. But an estimated 6 million Americans \ncurrently live with an unruptured brain aneurysm. In Massachusetts \nalone, more than 1,000 cases of brain aneurysm are treated annually. \nWith few symptoms, brain aneurysm is a condition that can strike \nwithout warning and have a devastating impact on individual lives and \nfamilies in our country and abroad.\n  I applaud the efforts of the medical profession, research institutes \nsuch as the National Inistututes of Health, NIH, and nonprofit \norganizations and groups such as the Brain Aneurysm Foundation who work \ntirelessly to combat brain aneurysm. Such work is critical to \nincreasing the medical research and education that will lead to \nbreakthroughs in the diagnosis and treatment of this devastating \ncondition.\n  During the month of September, conferences and meetings are taking \nplace across the country to raise brain aneurysm awareness. I want to \nrecognize Massachusetts as one of several States which have declared \nthe month of September as ``Brain Aneurysm Awareness Month.'' Such \ndeclarations show that States across the country understand the \nimportance of raising awareness of this condition and are taking the \ntime to highlight the need for additional education. I support these \nefforts and look forward to Congress working in a similar fashion in \nthe near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/30/senate-section/article/S10166-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORKFORCE POLICY\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to thank Senator Murray. As chairman \nof the HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety, she works \nhard and effectively to protect workers and to champion skills \ndevelopment and employment services to help adults and dislocated \nworkers and at-risk youth succeed in this highly competitive economy. I \nam proud to serve on this subcommittee. I thank Senator Murray for her \nleadership in introducting the Promoting Innovations to 21st Century \nCareers Act that will help young adults transition from high school to \npostsecondary education, including registered apprenticeship, and to \nthe high skill jobs of the future. I am proud to cosponsor this \nlegislation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator. I appreciate the Senator's work on \nskills-training issues, and I am proud to cosponsor his legislation \nentitled, ``Strengthening Employment Clusters to Organize Regional \nSuccess--SECTORS--Act.'' Partnerships organized by industry sectors are \nan effective strategy to connect workers with thriving industries such \nas health care, emerging and transitioning industries like the energy \nindustry, and manufacturing, which are vital to both the Ohio and \nWashington State economies. The strategies of both Promoting \nInnovations to 21st Century Careers Act and SECTORS Act are effective \nbecause they bring together the key stakeholders, including business, \nlabor organizations, education at various levels, workforce boards, \neconomic development entities, and other community organizations.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator for highlighting local workforce \nboards as a key stakeholder in sector partnerships. It has been brought \nto my attention that we can further clarify that the SECTORS Act \nspecifies the connection to local workforce boards. It is the intent \nfor this legislation to acknowledge our local Ohio workforce boards and \nother regional and local workforce boards as key stakeholders in any \nindustry sector strategy, something that is important to champions of \ngood workforce policy.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator for clarifying that point. The \nSECTORS Act models itself after many successful industry sector \npartnerships in our home States of Washington and Ohio, and elsewhere, \nsuch as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. I look forward to continuing to \nwork with the Senator to develop innovative workforce policies and \nprograms that help our workers and communities stay competitive in this \nknowledge-based, technology-advanced, global economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/30/senate-section/article/S10166-4", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10166-S10167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         captain benedict smith\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and \nsacrifice of CPT Benedict Smith, who will\n\n[[Page S10167]]\n\nforever be a hometown hero of Monroe City, MO.\n  On Saturday, October 4, 2008, the citizens of Monroe City will gather \nat its local community airfield and name it in memory of Ben, who lost \nhis life on November 7, 2003, when, while piloting a U.S. Army \nBlackhawk helicopter near Tikrit, Iraq, he was shot down.\n  In a famous speech given by General Douglas MacArthur before the West \nPoint Corps of Cadets on May 12, 1962, MacArthur exclaimed:\n\n        Duty, Honor, Country: Those three hallowed words \n     reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, \n     what you will be. They are your rallying points: to build \n     courage when courage seems to fail; to regain faith when \n     there seems to be little cause for faith; to create hope when \n     hope becomes forlorn.\n\n  Ben Smith, a 1999 graduate of the United States Military Academy, was \nwhat MacArthur envisioned--he did not just live ``Duty, Honor, \nCountry,'' he was ``Duty, Honor, Country.'' He lived a life marked by a \nduty to serve a higher cause; he did so with impeccable honor; and, \nfinally, he committed and ultimately sacrificed his life for his \nbeloved country. Today, I humbly honor Ben and his family.\n  But saying that Ben served and sacrificed would only be telling part \nof his story, because Ben was more than a great man, he was also a lot \nof fun. I recently heard a story from one of Ben's West Point \nclassmates that demonstrates Ben's wise guy attitude. In the spring of \n1999 the senior cadets were brought together for a lecture. Officers \nfrom an Army unit that had recently returned from overseas deployment \nwere to talk to the cadets about the challenges they would soon face as \nnew second lieutenants in the U.S. Army. During a question and answer \nperiod Ben rose and boldly asked:\n\n       Sir, I was wondering, in the Army, will we be able to take \n     the afternoon naps we have grown accustomed to here at West \n     Point?\n\n  A roar of laughter followed. Ben Smith was brave well before his time \nand exhibited more than a healthy dose of a Missourians swagger.\n  Ben went on to become a helicopter pilot and soon joined the esteemed \n``Screaming Eagles'' of the 101st Airborne Division. He would marry a \nfellow helicopter pilot, Maggie, in December 2002, and both would soon \nfind themselves deployed to Iraq.\n  Ben, tragically, made the ultimate sacrifice for his country on this \ntour of duty. He would be received home by his family in Monroe City \nwhere an entire town rallied to honor its fallen hero and to support \nBen's loved ones. One military service member who attended Ben's \nfuneral later wrote:\n\n       The people of Monroe City, MO are truly what a community \n     should be modeled after. You, your family and the people of \n     Monroe City are and will always be true heroes.\n\n  I am proud of Ben Smith, of his family and of his many friends. I am \nalso proud of Monroe City, which has so humbly supported Ben and the \nSmith family. Monroe City reminds us all of the greatness of small town \nAmerica. And Monroe City has displayed the special values of \nMissourians who have such a strong love of country and such a \nremarkable commitment to their communities. It is no surprise that a \ntown like Monroe City produces American heroes such as Ben Smith.\n  As Ben's friends and family once again come out to honor his memory \nand remember his life on the occasion of the naming of the Monroe City \nRegional Airport as the ``Captain Ben Smith Airfield,'' we are reminded \nof what it means to be an American. More importantly, we recognize how \ngreat it is to have the freedoms we enjoy as we also acknowledge that \nour freedom did not and does not come for free.\n  Part of the West Point Alma-Mater reads\n\n       And when our work is done, Our course on earth is run, May \n     it be said, ``Well Done; Be Thou at Peace.''\n\n  Ben is no doubt at peace today. Ben's work was well done. His memory \nand sacrifice will always be with those of us still here on earth. \nThose who fly in and out of the Ben Smith Airfield may be said to take \nto the heavens in flight. Today I think we can safely say that Ben is \nflying in heaven.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/30/senate-section/article/S10167-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10167-S10169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through an address set up specifically for this \npurpose to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be \neasily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am listening to you on ``Probing America'' and wanted to \n     express my thoughts on the current oil situation.\n       We, as a family, have obviously cut down on our driving \n     around town and the trips to the store. We recently moved \n     back to Idaho from Washington to be closer to my parents, who \n     are having many health problems. They live in the small town \n     of Soda Springs. Due to employment, I am not able to live \n     closer than a couple hours away in Idaho Falls. Recently my \n     father has had a stroke, and we have not been able to travel \n     to Soda to help my mother out on the farm. We are a fairly \n     new family (not well-established) and do not have a large \n     amount of disposable income. Just the rise in our everyday \n     gas costs has cut the remaining disposable income down to nil \n     and now we cannot afford to do the needed extra traveling. My \n     oldest brother has been helping as much as he can, but I know \n     that gas prices are a burden for him as well. This is \n     frustrating to us as this is the only stumbling block that is \n     preventing us in doing what we moved back to do. This does \n     not even account for the increased price of all the other \n     everyday items that are more expensive due to the retail \n     market passing on their increased costs to the consumer.\n       I also just heard on the radio that Meals on Wheels in \n     Pocatello may start turning away new customers due to high \n     gas prices.\n       I think that the number one priority should be to expand \n     our own resources. I am tired of being pushed around by a \n     radical few. I believe that pollution is bad and that we \n     should protect our surroundings as much as possible. However, \n     I believe that a few radical environmentalists have outspoken \n     the silent majority. I think that we should tap into the oil \n     reserves that we have hear in our own back yard. I think that \n     it is ludicrous that other countries are drilling for oil \n     just off the coast and we are not able to. By allowing them \n     to drill off our coast, we are accepting the risk of \n     environmental pollution without any benefit. I think that we \n     should tap into the reserves in ANWR. I believe that the \n     imprint would be minimal compared to the benefit that we \n     would receive.\n       Other energy resources, such as nuclear, should be \n     expanded. However, our priority for the near future should be \n     to start processing our own oil.\n       Thank you for your work and allowing us as Idahoans express \n     our views.\n     Justin.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a retired Idahoan who spent much of his professional \n     career working at the Idaho National Laboratory, which, as \n     you know, is our nation's premier nuclear energy research \n     laboratory. We have not realized the real potential of \n     nuclear energy for decades. It was often said (at my \n     workplace) that we will not appreciate the need for this \n     technology until the brownouts and the cost of energy \n     overcomes our fear of nuclear power. I think the time is \n     near, and the sad part is that it takes years to permit and \n     build new nuclear power plants.\n       As a retiree, I am constantly reminded of my family's \n     vulnerability to the rising cost of living. Fuel prices \n     continue to force the costs of many of the staples of our \n     life higher and those of us on fixed incomes have no recourse \n     to mitigate this change to our lives. It takes little \n     imagination to realize that our food chain, and everything \n     connected to fossil fuels will be affected by this. Energy \n     independence is crucial for our nation's prosperity and to \n     our children's legacy as leaders of the free world. I am sure \n     each of us has a vision for our future retirement and the \n     quality of life that we have spent a lifetime planning for. \n     We depend on the leadership in the congress and our nation's \n     administration to preserve our future economic security. This \n     includes prioritizing the things we must do to avoid threats \n     to our economy such as is occurring with this fuel crisis. \n     Your help and those of your colleagues in congress is needed, \n     now more than ever, and I support your efforts to make a \n     difference.\n     R. E., Blackfoot.\n                                  ____\n\n       Yes, high energy costs are impacting my family quite \n     significantly. I grew up in Idaho and convinced my hubby and \n     family to move to Idaho about five years ago. We plan on \n     living here forever. We sold our house in Oregon and moved to \n     Ashton into our family's old farm house. My hubby works in \n     Jackson, WY because he only has three years left before\n\n[[Page S10168]]\n\n     he qualifies for his pension. Gas was approximately $1.50 \n     when we moved here. It is now $4.15 and rising. Our house is \n     heated with an old oil furnace that my dad was so proud of. \n     Oil costs have also gone sky high, too. Our savings for \n     purchasing a house are now exhausted. My son did not get \n     rehired for his job because the local farmer he worked for \n     last year cannot afford to transport him, and he does not \n     drive yet, and it is too far to bike.\n       We are very close to my hubby having to sleep over in his \n     car in the work parking lot. This is not the best situation \n     as he has to use a CPAP machine and has three of our \n     daughters also driving to work with him. I try to cut down on \n     gas, but with eight kids and living in a very small town, we \n     do have to drive 30-60 minutes to a bigger town at times, to \n     see the eye doctor, for allergy treatments, etc. I do use my \n     daughter's small Subaru as much as possible but it does not \n     hold all the children, so someone has to stay home or we take \n     the van that holds everyone but costs twice as much.\n       Our house savings has been exhausted as we have been forced \n     to draw on our savings for basic necessities. I am very \n     frugal person--I feed the ten of us on $100 a week. We rarely \n     buy new clothing, and my kids are not spoiled with computer \n     games, and modern toys. We garden, sew, and whatever it takes \n     it make it work. I have stopped doing WIC, even though we \n     qualify and I am considering stopping the free school lunches \n     due to allergy and other concerns.\n       This is my story thus far, and I am happy to share. I am \n     aggressively seeking way to cut our costs and keep my \n     family's needs met.\n     Vickie, Ashton.\n                                  ____\n\n       That energy bill was a great idea. Higher gas prices mean \n     less driving. My wife and I drive very little and have since \n     that mess in Katrina. The only solution to this ridiculous \n     oil situation is to tax the oil companies and use the money \n     for new renewable energy technologies. The prices will go up \n     anyway due to avarice. We do not need cheap oil; we need no \n     oil!\n     Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       While I favor alternative energy sources, I am hesitant to \n     support energies that will ultimately lead to another \n     calamity, such as nuclear power. If our air cannot handle the \n     particulates from petroleum, imagine creating a system \n     dependent on nuclear and the vast amount of highly hazardous \n     waste that it creates.\n       Support of renewable and alternative energies, increased \n     funding for public transit and rail, and promotion of local \n     businesses rather than dependence on goods that have to be \n     trucked in on diesel fueled trucks is essential.\n       Thank you for your time, consideration and thoughts on \n     these matters,\n     Jenah.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thanks for putting this as one of your high priorities. \n     High energy prices are extremely affecting the way we have to \n     budget our money since rising gas prices affect the cost of \n     shipping food and clothing those commodities are rising in \n     prices. High gas prices are affecting everything that one \n     would want to buy. We have to cut back in what we buy for \n     food. What our food budget could once buy, it does not buy \n     the same amount of food now for the same amount of money. \n     Therefore, we have to cut back in other areas like medical \n     visits, travel to family, clothes, and electronic gadgets. \n     Not only are we dealing with rising gas prices, but we are \n     dealing the increased cost of living in our own home by \n     paying more taxes and utility fees. It just seems to be \n     hitting us all at once, and Congress does not seem to be \n     doing anything about it. I hear a greater concern for health \n     care insurance, but that is not what is breaking the bank \n     right now in the average family it is the high rising gas \n     prices. It is going to put our country in a great financial \n     bind. My family still has enough of what we need to get by, \n     but that is because my husband works more than 50 hours a \n     week to make ends meet.\n       I think that our first priority should be in investing in \n     domestic energy possibilities so we do not have to depend so \n     much on the foreign market for our supply and then nuclear \n     power (although I am concerned about long time waste that is \n     created by nuclear power).\n     Shari, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       My request for you is to pursue legislation that opens up \n     more areas of the US to oil and gas exploration. We need more \n     secure supply, and that means drilling in areas we control.\n     Jim.\n                                  ____\n\n       In a way, the high energy costs may be the one thing that \n     forces the majority of Americans to wake up and demand action \n     from our government. Since I have been voting (1980), I have \n     heard time and time again that we need an ``energy policy''. \n     To date, all we have is a lot of talk with little to no \n     action on any policy. I believe that Ford, Carter, Reagan, \n     Bush1, Clinton and Bush2 have all talked about an energy \n     policy. They always set the timetable for doing something \n     long after they have left office knowing full well that \n     nothing will be accomplished.\n       The best thing that could happen is for gas to go to $5-$7 \n     per gallon because, at this level, Americans are going to \n     demand action. No more talk. No more promises. Action. It is \n     really sad to see that all branches of our government have \n     really dropped the ball in so many areas.\n       We have the Senate holding hearings on steroids in \n     baseball, on whether the NCAA BCS Bowl system is fair, and so \n     on. In the meantime, the national debt is sky rocketing, we \n     have millions of illegals living here, and we pretend that \n     BCS and steroids are important.\n       We have undeveloped and undrilled deposits here in the US \n     that we cannot touch due to environmentalists. Instead we \n     send billions of dollars overseas to countries who pretend to \n     be our friends.\n       History repeats itself all the time. We are following the \n     same path that Rome followed. Have we not learned anything? \n     Is our Senate any different from the Roman Senate? Time will \n     tell but so far the future does not look bright.\n     D.\n                                  ____\n\n       This was to be the year that my husband and I were to \n     become debt free. We have been like other people, living \n     paycheck to paycheck. We will soon own our home free and \n     clear, we have no car payments, and are only luxuries are \n     DirecTV and internet.\n       I do not work due to cost of daycare and driving distance \n     the amount coming in compared to going out it would not add \n     to our income and most likely cost us.\n       My husband makes approximately $16 an hour and usually at \n     this time of year works 60 to 70 hours per week. He drives 30 \n     miles one way to work. Due to the rising fuel prices, no one \n     is doing any road improvements which, in turn, the company \n     has had to reduce the hours their employees work, trying to \n     keep them at 40 hrs per week. The closest grocery store from \n     our home is 35 miles. For nearly two years, we have, due to \n     fuel prices, made no unnecessary trips to town for groceries, \n     we even put off needed dental and medical appointments \n     because what money we have extra, goes into gas for my \n     husband to get to work.\n       I agree in conservation and alternative fuels, but that is \n     for the future, not help for what people are going through \n     now. We cannot go out and buy a new hybrid car, and most \n     people in this state are in the same boat, or worse they are \n     sinking. The cycle is this: gas and groceries are at an all-\n     time high, you cannot afford the gas, you cannot go to the \n     store, people spend less, businesses have to lay off or close \n     leaving more people out there, to lose their homes, cars and \n     no way to feed and clothe their children, and what about \n     those whose only income is Social Security. Do you know \n     anyone that can live on $600 a month? That is what my mother \n     is trying to live on, her Medicaid and food stamps were taken \n     away, her rent from Idaho Housing went from $60 to $153 per \n     month due to what I feel is a clerical error that no one can \n     seem to help her with, her phone shut off because she was \n     late, which she cannot turn back on she cannot afford the \n     fees. We cannot help her, so what is she to do?\n       I am sorry, but I feel that most people in our government \n     right now have had it too easy and do not see what is \n     happening, and I bet any of them live in a 30-year-old mobile \n     home and are proud of it. They have forgotten what it is like \n     to struggle or ever knew what it is to juggle everyday needs. \n     I pray to God that my son, now 5, will someday be able to get \n     a higher education. I do not see it happening right now.\n       Thank you for reading this, and giving me a chance to speak \n     my mind.\n     Kari, Jerome.\n                                  ____\n\n       I read your message: Thank you. I recently drove to the \n     Idaho State Convention at Sandpoint. I have only good things \n     to say about the highway 95. It was a joy to drive and is \n     probably why I was able to drive to Sandpoint and return with \n     a quarter tank of gas left. Of course I had tires checked for \n     pressure so that may have helped. My complaint such as it \n     is--my car is a 2004 Buick I had asked sometime ago about \n     using Ethanol additive in it, I was told by the dealer's \n     mechanic that I should use regular gasoline as the engine is \n     not set for ethanol use. So I made a point to do that and \n     usually bought Chevron. Imagine my reaction when I discovered \n     all gas stations are required to use 10% Ethanol. I was told \n     that might require more frequent fuel filter change. Of \n     course I have no idea if using ethanol improved my mpg on \n     trip to Sandpoint, which is a possibility. The gauge on my \n     car said I averaged 23mpg.\n       I, of course, definitely support drilling for oil in the \n     Gulf States and I do not think it would be a disaster \n     environmentally to drill and start more drilling and \n     production in Alaska! I visited Fairbanks and also saw the \n     pipeline and I understand the caribou used some of the \n     structures as posts to scratch their backs.\n       Good luck with the energy crisis! The cost to suppliers is \n     definitely a worry that affects everyone.\n     Marie.\n                                  ____\n\n       In a global energy market in which we now live, we need to \n     stop complaining about the current reality of high gasoline \n     prices and limit our energies to the real problem of how to \n     facilitate an increase in our domestic energy production, \n     refining capabilities, and alternative energy research. The \n     priority in Congress should be to help resolve our current \n     energy dependence by attempting to eliminate the restrictions \n     to exploration (i.e. ANWR, etc. etc.) and the production of \n     other domestic energy sources? Why do we continue to focus on \n     the current hardships\n\n[[Page S10169]]\n\n     caused by the present day cost of gasoline instead of looking \n     at ways to facilitate pragmatic long term solutions to the \n     problem!\n     Ron, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I would like to tell you how the high gas prices are \n     affecting me and my wife. I am 76 years old, retired, and \n     have a chronic heart and lung disease. We live in Salmon. \n     Salmon, being a small town does not have a hospital to care \n     for major heart and lung disease. The nearest hospital that \n     has facilities for major heart and lung is Missoula, Montana, \n     about 160 miles north of Salmon, making it a 320-mile round \n     trip. My car gets 27 miles per gallon, making it about 12 \n     gallons per trip. Today, in Salmon, gas costs $4.23 per \n     gallon (and I am sure it will continue to go up); that is \n     about $50 per trip in gas alone. Between the two of us. we \n     have to make the trip to Missoula approximately 20 times per \n     year. That equates to about $1,000 for gas alone. That \n     smarts.\n       Please do what you can to stop this senseless rise in \n     energy prices. We have the resources here in our own country. \n     Let us start using them. Drill for oil; use nuclear; mine \n     coal; we are smart enough to do this sensibly. Do it now.\n     J. C., Salmon.\n                                  ____\n\n       Even if we opened up Alaska and any other likely source of \n     oil, I doubt very much it would bring the price of oil down. \n     Until we get rid of corporate government, nothing we are \n     presently experiencing is likely to change, certainly not \n     sharing stories of hardship.\n     John.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband is retired, and I am only able to work part-\n     time. It has put a great deal of stress on us. When we did \n     retirement planning, we planned for cost of living, i.e., \n     food, electric, water, gas, but never could we have imagined \n     that we would under budget our gas costs. This country has \n     the opportunity to resolve this issue. As other costs are \n     also rising, medical care, food, etc, this is one area that \n     the government can step in and resolve and help our not only \n     our economy, but also their fellow Americans. It is our \n     congressmen duty to take care of this issue, if not, then who \n     is going to take care of all the people who cannot afford the \n     gas to get to work and do not have access to mass transit or \n     cannot afford it.

JAMES PIERPONT COMER\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I honor a great Hoosier, Doctor \nJames Pierpont Comer. Today we recognize the many accomplishments of \nDr. Comer, a distinguished professor, innovator, author, and scholar.\n  Dr. Comer, in his role as an educator and mentor, embodies the spirit \nof hard work and service that Hoosiers value. The Maurice Falk \nProfessor of Child Psychiatry at the Yale University School of \nMedicine's Child Study Center, Dr. Comer has been a member of the Yale \nmedical faculty since 1968. As founder of the Comer School Development \nProgram at Yale, he has advanced a teamwork approach to ensuring \npositive child development and academic success. The ``Comer Model'' \nhas been implemented at over 500 schools nationwide and has promoted \nthe constructive growth of countless American youth.\n  A native of East Chicago, IN, Dr. Comer received his bachelor's \ndegree from Indiana University, his M.D. from Howard University, and a \nmaster's in public health from the University of Michigan. He has \nreceived no less than 46 honorary degrees as well as numerous other \naccolades, including the John P. McGovern Behavioral Science Award from \nthe Smithsonian, the John Hope Franklin Award, the Heinz Award in the \nHuman Condition, and the Healthtrac Foundation Prize. An unparalleled \nscholar, Dr. Comer has authored nine books and hundreds of articles \nrelating to child development, childhood education, and race relations.\n  As we honor Dr. Comer today, the words of Henry Brooks Adams come to \nmind: ``A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his \ninfluence stops.'' Dr. Comer has helped countless young people develop \nthe building blocks necessary to become the leaders of their \ngeneration, and the students whose lives he has touched over the years \nwill undoubtedly help shape our society through the 21st \ncentury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/30/senate-section/article/S10169-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO RUSSELL W. PETERSON\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I celebrate the 92nd birthday \nof a man I have known and admired for a long time, a man who has \ndedicated his life to making our world a better place for us and for \nour children. Russell W. Peterson was one of Delaware's most remarkable \ngovernors and has been a truly committed public servant for over 60 \nyears.\n  Within the early hours of being sworn in as governor of Delaware in \n1969, he delivered on a campaign promise to ease tensions in our \nracially charged city of Wilmington. He removed the presence of the \nNational Guard who had patrolled the city streets for almost a year, \nand, along with the Delaware State Police, he enforced curfews \nfollowing the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  One of the most memorable accomplishments of the governor's career \nwas the leadership role he played to protect our environment through \nthe passage of Delaware's Coastal Zone Act of 1971. This was a \ngroundbreaking law, the first of its kind in our Nation. Governor \nPeterson became known as a dedicated environmentalist for protecting \nthe 115 miles of Delaware's coastline from heavy industry. As an \nactivist for our environment, he was determined to help people on a \nlocal, State, and national level understand that living our lives is \nnot at odds with preserving our environment. He also contributed to the \nlandmark National Environmental Policy Act as chairman of the \nPresident's Council on Environmental Quality.\n  The governor's most recent project has already begun to rejuvenate \nthe city of Wilmington's riverfront. He is cochairman of the governor's \ntask force on the future of the Christiana and Brandywine Rivers and \nalso serves on the board of the Riverfront Development Corporation. \nThrough these efforts, the city's riverfront is becoming a brilliant \nasset to our State as it attracts visitors and new residents to the \narea. This beautiful new face to our riverfront also has an urban \nwildlife refuge center that has been named after Governor Peterson, for \nhis decades of remarkable work.\n  These are only a few of Governor Peterson's many, many \naccomplishments. Through his service, he has truly improved the lives \nof Delawareans and has invigorated the city of Wilmington. He is \ncurrently the Delaware Audubon Society's honorary chairman of the board \nand has received 15 honorary doctorates and numerous other awards.\n  Governor Peterson is being honored for his contributions at a \nluncheon next Tuesday, in Wilmington. I can't think of a more deserving \nindividual. I wish him all the best as we celebrate his 92nd \nbirthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/30/senate-section/article/S10169-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10169-S10170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PAUL WEYRICH\n\n Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes \nto honor Paul Weyrich, a dear friend, and a man who has spent the past \n44 years fighting to protect the freedom and liberty enjoyed by \nAmericans today. Throughout his adult life, Paul Weyrich has actively \nadvocated for conservative policies based on our founding principles. \nFrom his days as a young college Republican and foot soldier in Barry \nGoldwater's 1964 Presidential campaign to his tireless efforts on and \naround Capitol Hill, Paul has been an instrumental force in the \nconservative movement of both yesterday and today. With courage and \nconviction, he has declared the importance of family values, religious \nfreedom and limited government.\n  History will judge us not on our titles but on the lasting ideas we \nadvance and institutions we create. I have the honor of chairing the \nSenate Steering Committee, which owes its creation in 1974 to an idea \nborn in the mind of an enterprising staffer named Paul Weyrich. After \nhelping to found the Senate Steering Committee, Paul went on to found \nthe Heritage Foundation with Edwin J. Feulner in 1973. Paul also \nfounded the American Legislative Exchange Council and the Committee for \nthe Survival of a Free Congress, CSFC, which later became the Free \nCongress Foundation. Paul now serves as chairman and CEO of the Free \nCongress Foundation. And Paul's leadership, uniting religious \nconservatives of all faiths, has made the social\n\n[[Page S10170]]\n\nconservative movement one of the most effective movements in modern \nhistory.\n  Finally, I would also have to add that not only has Paul dedicated \nhis life to serving the conservative movement, his wonderful family, \nand his Nation, but he has also dedicated his life to serving God as a \nleader in his church.\n  Senators and conservative leaders will come and go. Most of us will \nbe barely remembered. But years from now when a new crop of \nconservatives is charged with advancing our cause, the sword they will \nwield will be the institutions left to them by previous generations. \nMany of them, from the numerous coalitions to the Steering Committee to \nthe mighty Free Congress Foundation and the Heritage Foundation, owe \ntheir creation to Paul Weyrich.\n  I want to personally express my gratitude to Paul for his friendship \nand for all that he has done to move the conservative cause forward. \nPaul's hard work and dedication have inspired me and countless others \nin the fight to protect liberty and to secure America's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/30/senate-section/article/S10170-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DES MOINES INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in Iowa and across the United \nStates, a new school year has begun. As you know, Iowa public schools \nhave an excellent reputation nationwide, and Iowa students' test scores \nare among the highest in the Nation.\n  I would like to take just a few minutes today to salute the dedicated \nteachers, administrators, and school board members in the Des Moines \nIndependent Community School District, and to report on their \nparticipation in a unique Federal partnership to repair and modernize \nschool facilities.\n  This fall marks the 10th year of the Iowa Demonstration Construction \nGrant Program. That is its formal name, but it is better known among \neducators in Iowa as the Harkin grants for Iowa public schools. Since \n1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 million for the \nState government in Iowa, which selects worthy school districts to \nreceive these grants for a range of renovation and repair efforts--\neverything from updating fire safety systems to building new schools or \nrenovating existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal funding is \nused to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it often has a \ntremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.\n  The Des Moines Independent Community School District is Iowa's \nlargest public school district, with more than 30,000 students, 5,000 \nteachers and staff members, and 60 schools in our State's capitol city. \nServing more students than even our State universities, Des Moines has \nreceived several grants, totaling $4,275,000, to help meet the diverse \nand important needs at dozens of their schools.\n  The school district received five construction grants totaling \n$3,250,000. The first construction grant for $750,000 was awarded in \n1999 to Capitol View Elementary, a new school just a few blocks from \nour State capitol building. In 2000, a $500,000 construction grant went \nto Moulton Extended Learning Center, a K-8 school in the heart of the \ncity. East High School, the oldest high school in Des Moines, received \na 2002 grant for $1 million to help with the construction of their new \nCommunity Activity Center. A 2004 construction grant for $500,000 \nhelped build a new elementary school combining Longfellow and Wallace, \nnow known as the George Washington Carver Community School. And in \n2005, a $500,000 construction grant helped to renovate the Walnut \nStreet School, a growing elementary school located in the city's \nbusiness district. These schools are the modern, state-of-the-art \nfacilities that befit the educational ambitions and excellence of this \nschool district. Indeed, they are the kind of schools that every child \nin America deserves.\n  The Des Moines Independent Community School District also received \nfive fire safety grants totaling $1,025,000 to install fire alarm \nsystems and make other safety repairs at over two dozen schools \nincluding, Central Campus, home to some of the Nation's top high school \nprograms, McCombs Middle School, King Elementary School, East High \nSchool, Hoover High, Meredith Middle School and Lincoln High School. \nThe Federal grants have made it possible for the district to provide \nquality and safe schools for their students.\n  Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. \nThey are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a \ntremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned \ncitizens. I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance in \nthe Des Moines Independent Community School District. In particular, I \nwould like to recognize the leadership of the board of education--chair \nGinny Strong, vice chair Jeanette Woods, along with members Connie \nBoesen, Teree Caldwell-Johnson, Patty Link, Dick Murphy and Jonathan \nNarcisse, and former board members Ako Abdul-Samad, Som Baccam, \nMargaret Borgen, Graham Gillette, Jane Hein, Jon Neiderbach, Jim Patch, \nPhil Roeder, Laura Sands, Mark Schuling, Nadine Hogate and Marc Ward.\n  I would also like to recognize superintendent Nancy Sebring, former \nsuperintendent Eric Witherspoon, chief operating officer Bill Good, \nchief financial officer Patricia Schroeder, former executive director \nof facilities management Duane Van Hemert, grant specialist Kris \nMesicek along with the principals, teachers, staff and parents at more \nthan two dozen Des Moines schools who have helped make the most \neffective use of these funds.\n  As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin school grant program in \nIowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings \nand facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation \nor replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, \nsome 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The \nharsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United \nStates is nearly 50 years.\n  Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming \nsports arenas on weekends, but during the week go to school in rundown \nor antiquated facilities. This sends exactly the wrong message to our \nyoung people about our priorities. We have to do better.\n  That is why I am deeply grateful to the professionals and parents in \nthe Des Moines Independent Community School District. There is no \nquestion that a quality public education for every child is a top \npriority in that community. I salute them, and wish them a very \nsuccessful new school year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/30/senate-section/article/S10170-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10170-S10171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ELK HORN-KIMBALLTON COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

This school is a modern, state-\nof-the-art facility that befits the educational ambitions and \nexcellence of this school district.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize a great \nAmerican who has honorably served our country through her role at \nUniformed Services University, USU.\n  In January 2006, Ms. Scheman began her service at USU. Prior to \nassuming the vice presidency of External Affairs at USU, she was vice \npresident for government, community and public affairs at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania for 11 years. Before serving at University \nof Pennsylvania, Ms. Scheman was the deputy commissioner of external \naffairs at the Food and Drug Administration. She also served as vice \npresident and director of Federal relations for the Association of \nAmerican Universities before working for the FDA.\n  During her time at USU, Ms. Scheman has helped create the \nuniversity's first Office of External Affairs bringing together the \nuniversity's various units that deal with its external communities \nincluding media outreach/public affairs, alumni affairs, board of \nregents support, publications, Web site oversight, and associated \nvisual, photo/videographic, graphic services, protocol and events, \nincluding commencement, and government and community affairs. Her team \ndeveloped the university's first unified branding initiative that \ncreated the content for a campaign to clearly describe the university \nto a wide variety of audiences. Under her skillful leadership, USU \nproduced its first annual report, calendar, combined university catalog \nand internal newsletter; launched a new Web site, and created a large \nvariety of multimedia products designed to increase the university's \nvisibility.

The \nOffice of External Affairs has developed into an interdisciplinary team \nthat continues to develop innovative and creative ways to portray this \nunique institution to a wide variety of constituencies.\n  Ms. Scheman worked closely with DOD's Office of the Assistant \nSecretary for Health Affairs on public relations outreach, with the \nrelevant congressional committees on issues vital to the university's \ncontinued growth, with academic and scientific societies and \nassociations and local and state government officials on ``town-grown'' \nissues, especially as the relate to the base realignment and closure/\nintegration process.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom an employee's gross income any employer-provided supplemental \ninstructional services assistance, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \nincrease access for our Nation's children to affordable, quality \ntutoring. The Affordable Tutoring for Our Children Act would enable \nmiddle-class families to purchase supplemental instructional services \non a pre-tax basis, ensuring greater utilization of critical \neducational tools.\n  A sound education for every American child is fundamental to the \nwell-being and prosperity of our society, both now and in the future. \nYet, as we are all acutely aware, not every child learns at the same \npace, nor in the same manner, and some face unique challenges that \ncannot be overcome simply in a typical classroom setting. Many children \nrequire--and greatly benefit from--additional help in academics. \nRegrettably, our nation's middle-class families are increasingly unable \nto afford this essential ancillary support for their children. These \nfamilies find themselves under considerable and ever-increasing \nfinancial strain, with more and more income going to pay for gasoline, \nhealth care, groceries, and a multitude of other expenses. Furthermore, \naccording to a 2007 report from Demos and the Institute on Assets & \nSocial Policy at Brandeis University, more than half of middle-class \nfamilies have no financial assets, or worse, their debts exceed their \nassets.\n  At present, employees may set aside a portion of their earnings to \nestablish a flexible spending account, or FSA, allowing them to pay for \nqualified medical or dependent care expenses free from income and \npayroll taxes. Our legislation would permit employees to use their \ndependent care FSAs to cover supplemental instructional expenses, \nthereby saving themselves up to 40 percent of their cost. Critically, \nthis bill is targeted to middle-class families, those who most \nnecessitate our assistance. Indeed, only those employees making \n$105,000 or less per year would be able to exclude amounts paid for \nthese services from their taxable income. Additionally, supplemental \ninstructional expenses would be subject to a combined $5,000 cap with \nother dependent care expenses.\n  This bill would help more middle-class children to receive extra \nassistance for a host of subjects ranging from English and mathematics \nto science, government, and foreign languages. At a time when graduates \nwho attain a bachelor's degree earn roughly 96 percent more than high \nschool graduates, according to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, it is \nvital that our Nation's children get the help they need to succeed.\n  With middle-class families feeling the squeeze from every angle, our \nlegislation would provide essential relief for those parents seeking to \nensure that their children have the best educational experience \npossible. I urge my colleagues to consider the dramatic advantage our \nchildren will gain from this crucial bill, and look forward to its \npassage in a timely manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3655\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 697\n\n       Whereas the use of the Internet in the United States, to \n     communicate, conduct business, or generate commerce that \n     benefits the overall United States economy, is ubiquitous;\n       Whereas more than 216,000,000 people use the Internet in \n     the United States, 70 percent of whom connect through \n     broadband connections, to communicate with family and \n     friends, manage finances and pay bills, access educational \n     opportunities, shop at home, participate in online \n     entertainment and games, and stay informed of news and \n     current events;\n       Whereas the nearly 27,000,000 United States small \n     businesses, which represent more than 99 percent of all \n     United States employers and employ more than 50 percent of \n     the private workforce, increasingly rely on the Internet to \n     manage their businesses, expand their customer reach, and \n     enhance the management of their supply chain;\n       Whereas nearly 100 percent of public schools in the United \n     States have Internet access to enhance children's education, \n     with a significant percentage of instructional rooms \n     connected to the Internet to enhance children's education by \n     providing access to educational online content and \n     encouraging self-initiative to discover research resources;\n       Whereas almost 9 in 10 teenagers between the ages of 12 and \n     17, or approximately 87 percent of that age group, use the \n     Internet;\n       Whereas the number of children who connect to the Internet \n     at school continues to rise, and teaching children of all \n     ages to become good cyber-citizens through safe, secure, and \n     ethical online behaviors and practices is essential to \n     protect their computer systems and potentially their physical \n     safety;\n       Whereas the growth and popularity of social networking \n     websites has attracted millions of teenagers, providing \n     access to a range of valuable services, making it all the \n     more important to teach teenaged users how to avoid potential \n     threats like cyber bullies, predators, and identity thieves \n     they may come across while using such services;\n       Whereas cyber security is a critical part of the United \n     States overall homeland security;\n       Whereas the United States critical infrastructures and \n     economy rely on the secure and reliable operation of \n     information networks to support the United States financial \n     services, energy, telecommunications, transportation, health \n     care, and emergency response systems;\n       Whereas cyber attacks have been attempted against the \n     United States and the economy of the United States, and the \n     mission of the Department of Homeland Security includes \n     securing the homeland against cyber terrorism and other \n     attacks;\n       Whereas Internet users and information infrastructure \n     owners and operators face an increasing threat of malicious \n     crime and fraud attacks through viruses, worms, Trojans, and \n     unwanted programs such as spyware, adware, hacking tools, and \n     password stealers, that are frequent and fast in propagation, \n     are costly to repair, and may disable entire systems;\n       Whereas coordination between the numerous Federal agencies \n     involved in cyber security efforts, including the Department \n     of Homeland Security, the National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology, and the National Science Foundation, is essential \n     to securing the cyber infrastructure of the United States;\n       Whereas millions of records containing personally \n     identifiable information have been lost, stolen, or breached, \n     threatening the security and financial well-being of United \n     States citizens;\n       Whereas consumers face significant financial and personal \n     privacy losses due to personally identifiable information \n     being more exposed to theft and fraud than ever before;\n       Whereas national organizations, policymakers, government \n     agencies, private sector companies, nonprofit institutions, \n     schools,\n\n[[Page S10179]]\n\n     academic organizations, consumers, and the media recognize \n     the need to increase awareness of computer security and the \n     need for enhanced computer security in the United States;\n       Whereas the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, \n     published in February 2003, recommends a comprehensive \n     national awareness program to empower all people in the \n     United States, including businesses, the general workforce, \n     and the general population, to secure their own parts of \n     cyberspace;

and\n       (3) continues to work with Federal agencies, national \n     organizations, businesses, and educational institutions to \n     encourage the development and implementation of voluntary \n     standards, practices, and technologies in order to enhance \n     the state of computer security in the United States.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit, along \nwith Senator Bennett, a resolution supporting National Cyber Security \nAwareness Month.\n  The connectivity provided by the Internet has profoundly changed \nalmost every aspect of our lives, but it has also given rise to what I \nview as the next great threat to our national security and our economic \nsecurity, the danger of cyber attack, cyber espionage, and cyber crime.\n  At the policy level, responding to this threat requires the \ndevelopment of advanced technologies combined with creative new \nGovernment policies. Above all, we need to focus on improving the cyber \nsecurity of the Federal Government and the critical infrastructure, \nincluding our electric power grid, communications, banking, and \ntransportation systems. These are all critical to our way of life and \nwe must work together to ensure they are secure.\n  Of course, whatever we do to monitor and thwart bad actors on the \nInternet, we must be careful to preserve the privacy and civil \nliberties of U.S. persons, especially during the transition from a \nlegal structure based on older technologies to a legal structure \ndesigned for the Internet age.\n  We must also think about the best way to communicate our national \ncyber security policy to the public. Though some elements of the threat \nand our response must be kept classified, the public needs to \nunderstand the general nature of the threat we face, the Government's \nresponsibility to secure the internet, and how Government involvement \nwill affect U.S. persons and privacy.\n  Fortunately, I am happy to report an increasing level of interest and \ndebate on Capitol Hill and around the country. Here in Washington, in \nthe past year, the Senate Intelligence Committee has held two hearings \nand many Member briefings, setup a working group with seven staff, \nsponsored two Technical Advisory Group studies, and worked with other \ncongressional committees in a bipartisan manner on cyber issues.\n  Back home in West Virginia, at our State Homeland Security Summit, we \nheld a productive session focused on cyber security for State and local \nleaders. I have taken on this issue as a priority of increasing \nimportance, but much work remains to be done. I encourage everyone to \nhelp me raise awareness and develop effective channels of communication \non this issue.\n  One of the ways we can raise awareness is by supporting National \nCyber Security Awareness Month, coming up in October. Each year, the \nNational Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security \njoins with the National Cyber Security Alliance, the Multi-State \nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center, and other organizations \nworking to improve cyber security in the U.S. to support National Cyber \nSecurity Awareness Month.\n  The goal is to educate and empower Internet users to take simple \nsteps to safeguard themselves from the latest online threats and \nrespond to cyber crime; and to bring Federal agencies, national \norganizations, businesses, and educational institutions together to \nencourage development and implementation of cyber security best \npractices.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Bennett, for cosponsoring \nthis resolution and for his leadership on this issue. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Bennett and other members of Congress to improve \nour cyber security in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/30/senate-section/article/S10179-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10179-S10180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 698--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 17, 2008, AS ``NATIONAL \n                           MAMMOGRAPHY DAY''\n\n  Mr. REID (for Mr. Biden (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Casey, Mrs. \nDole, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Johnson, \nMr. Wyden, and Mr. Bayh)) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 698\n\n       Whereas, according to the American Cancer Society, in 2008, \n     182,460 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer \n     and 40,480 women will die from that disease;\n       Whereas it is estimated that about 2,000,000 women were \n     diagnosed with breast cancer in the 1990s, and that in nearly \n     500,000 of those cases the cancer resulted in death;\n       Whereas approximately 3,000,000 women in the United States \n     are living with breast cancer, about 2,300,000 have been \n     diagnosed with the disease, and an estimated 1,000,000 do not \n     yet know they have the disease;\n       Whereas African-American women suffer a 36 percent greater \n     mortality rate from breast cancer than White women and more \n     than a 100 percent greater mortality rate from breast cancer \n     than women from Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian \n     populations;\n       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with \n     a woman at age 70 having twice as much of a chance of \n     developing the disease as a woman at age 50;\n       Whereas at least 90 percent of the women who get breast \n     cancer have no family history of the disease;\n       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a \n     certified facility, can provide safe screening and early \n     detection of breast cancer in many women;\n       Whereas mammography is an excellent method for early \n     detection of localized breast cancer, which has a 5-year \n     survival rate of 98 percent;\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute and the American \n     Cancer Society continue to recommend periodic mammograms; and\n       Whereas the National Breast Cancer Coalition recommends \n     that each woman and her health care provider make an \n     individual decision about mammography: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 17, 2008, as ``National Mammography \n     Day''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \ndesignating October 17, 2008, as ``National Mammography Day.'' This is \nthe 16th straight year I have introduced such legislation, and I am \nproud to say that on each occasion the Senate has shown its support for \nthe fight against breast cancer by approving the resolution.\n  Each year, as I prepare to introduce this resolution, I review the \nlatest information from the American Cancer Society about breast \ncancer. For 2008, it is estimated that nearly 182,460 women will be \ndiagnosed with invasive breast cancer and 40,480 women will die of this \ndisease.\n  The first several times I introduced this resolution, I commented on \nhow gloomy the statistics surrounding breast cancer were. While we \nstill must address the unfortunate trend of a higher mortality rate in \nAfrican American women when compared to that of White women and women \nfrom other minority groups, there are some numbers that give us hope in \nour struggle to defeat this disease. As I mentioned last year, the \ntrend over time is that the number of deaths from breast cancer is \nfairly stable and falling from year to year. According to the American \nCancer Society, the death rate from breast cancer in women has \ndecreased since 1990: between 1975-1990, the death rate increased by \n0.4 percent; between 1990-2004, the death rate decreased by 2.2 percent \nannually.\n  This decline in the breast cancer mortality rate has been attributed \nto improvements in breast cancer treatment, as well as early detection \nfrom mammograms and other screening methods. New digital techniques \nmake the process of mammography more rapid and precise than before. In \naddition, early detection of breast cancer\n\n[[Page S10180]]\n\ncontinues to result in extremely favorable outcomes: 98 percent of \nwomen with localized breast cancer and 84 percent of those with \nregional disease will survive 5 years or longer. Government programs \nwill provide free mammograms to those who can't afford them, as well as \nMedicaid eligibility for treatment if breast cancer is diagnosed. \nInformation about treatment of breast cancer with surgery, \nchemotherapy, and radiation therapy has exploded, reflecting enormous \nresearch developments with regards to this disease. Thanks to the \nadvances in research, screening, and treatment, a diagnosis of breast \ncancer is not a death sentence, all of us encounter long-term survivors \nof this disease almost daily, whether we realize it or not.\n  Recently, there has been discussion among scientists regarding the \nbest and most appropriate screening tool for breast cancer, traditional \nmammography or more advanced technology like magnetic resonance \nimaging, MRI. In addition, newspapers have been filled with discussions \nover whether the scientific evidence actually supports the conclusion \nthat periodic screening mammography saves lives. For those of us who \nare neither physicians nor scientists in this highly technical area, we \nlook to the experts. The American Cancer Society, the National Cancer \nInstitute, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force all continue to \nrecommend periodic screening mammography. However, it is also of note, \nthat in 2007, an expert panel convened by the American Cancer Society \nreleased new recommendations for the use of MRIs for women at increased \nrisk. The Society recommended annual screening, including an MRI in \naddition to mammography for high risk women, lifetime risk of greater \nthan 20 percent, of developing the disease. Women with moderately \nincreased risk of developing the disease, lifetime risk of 15 to 20 \npercent, should discuss with their physician the option of an MRI in \naddition to their annual mammogram. Women that do not fall into the \nhigh or moderate risk categories have no need to supplement their \nmammogram with an MRI.\n  I know that some women don't get annual mammograms due to fear or \nforgetfulness. It is only human nature for some to avoid mammograms \nbecause they are afraid of what the tests will reveal. To those who are \nfearful, I would say that if you get periodic routine mammograms, and \nthe latest one indicates a possible cancer, even before any symptoms or \nbefore detection of a lump through a self-exam, you have great reason \nto be optimistic. Such early detected breast cancers are highly \ntreatable.\n  Then there is forgetfulness. I understand how difficult it is to \nremember to schedule an annual appointment. This is where National \nMammography Day comes in. On that day, let's make sure that each woman \nwe know picks a specific date on which to get a mammogram each year, a \ndate that she won't forget: a child's birthday, an anniversary, perhaps \neven the day her taxes are due. On National Mammography Day, let's ask \nour loved ones: pick one of these dates, fix it in your mind along with \na picture of your child, your wedding, or another symbol of that date, \nand promise yourself to get a mammogram on that day. Once you pick a \ndate, call your health care provider and make the appointment. If you \nhave access to the internet, go to the American Cancer Society's \nwebsite and sign up for the mammogram reminder service they'll send you \nan e-mail to remind you about the date you picked.

The system--\n       (A) shall not require or permit any social networking \n     website to transmit Internet identifiers of its users to the \n     operator of the system, and\n       (B) shall use secure procedures that preserve the secrecy \n     of the information made available by the Attorney General, \n     including protection measures that render the Internet \n     identifiers and other data elements indecipherable.\n       (2) Provision of information relating to identity.--Upon \n     receiving a matched Internet identifier, the social \n     networking website may make a request of the Attorney General \n     for, and the Attorney General shall provide promptly, \n     information related to the identity of the individual that \n     has registered the matched Internet identifier. This \n     information is limited to the name, sex, resident address, \n     photograph, and physical description.\n       (b) Qualification for Use of System.--A social networking \n     website seeking to use the system shall submit an application \n     to the Attorney General which provides--\n       (1) the name and legal status of the website;\n       (2) the contact information for the website;\n       (3) a description of the nature and operations of the \n     website;\n       (4) a statement explaining why the website seeks to use the \n     system;\n       (5) a description of policies and procedures to ensure \n     that--\n       (A) any individual who is denied access to that website on \n     the basis of information obtained through the system is \n     promptly notified of the basis for the denial and has the \n     ability to challenge the denial of access;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6045 which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6045) to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime \n     Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to extend the \n     authorization of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \n     Program through fiscal year 2012.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has acted \nunanimously today to reauthorize the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \nProgram. This measure marks the fifth time that I have had the \nprivilege of working to reauthorize this life-saving Federal grant \nprogram. I first worked with Senator Campbell 10 years ago to author \nthe Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act of 1998, which responded to \nthe tragic Carl Drega shootout in 1997 on the Vermont-New Hampshire \nborder, in which two state troopers who did not have bulletproof vests \nwere killed. The Federal officers who responded to the shooting spree \nwere equipped with life-saving body armor, but the State and local law \nenforcement officers lacked protective vests because of the cost.\n  In 2007, as a result of the Bulletproof Vest Grant Program, \njurisdictions across the country received over $28 million in Federal \nfunds, which were used to purchase more than 180,000 armor vests. \nBetween 1999 and 2007, $234 million has gone to the States and has \nassisted in the purchase of an estimated 818,044 vests. It gives me a \ngreat sense of pride to know that the law we enacted is having a real \nimpact in directly supporting the safety and security of American law \nenforcement officers.\n  In May, the Judiciary Committee held an important hearing and learned \njust how crucial this program has been to our law enforcement officers. \nLieutenant Michael Macarilla with the Vermont State Police testified \nabout how valuable this program is to small jurisdictions in Vermont, \nwhich often operate on very tight budgets. And Detective David Azur of \nthe Baltimore Police Department testified about his experience of being \nshot at point-blank range and surviving because he was\n\n[[Page S10184]]\n\nwearing a bulletproof vest. His testimony left no doubt that this is an \nissue of life and death.\n  Just this week we were reminded again of the importance of \nbulletproof vests for law enforcement officers. A police officer in \nAlexandria, VA, Kyle Russell was shot in the chest during a traffic \nstop. According to Chief David Baker of the Alexandria Police, Officer \nRussell's vest saved his life. What was a very tragic situation was \nprevented from being made worse due to Officer Russell's bulletproof \nvest. This event, in a city close to the Nation's Capitol, should be \nanother reminder to Members of Congress about why this program is so \nimportant. Where Congress can help State and local jurisdictions equip \ntheir officers, there should be no hesitation to do so.\n  I regret that due to objections we were not able to include with the \nreauthorization a waiver system for those jurisdictions that have \nsuffered a natural disaster or severe budget shortfalls. The waiver \nwould have given those jurisdictions a way to keep their officers \nprotected, regardless of whether they can meet the law's matching \nrequirement. The waiver legislation also would provide authority to the \nDirector of the Bureau of Justice Assistance at the Justice Department \nto waive the grant program's matching requirement in cases of fiscal \nhardship. If a jurisdiction cannot meet this requirement, it is \nunlikely it can afford to purchase vests on its own. I hope the next \nCongress will be allowed to consider these important provisions. I do \nnot wish to return to the days when law enforcement officers were \nrequired to purchase their own vests, or simply go without. With \ntighter budgets and a troubled economy, it makes sense to give the \nBureau of Justice Assistance the authority and the flexibility to \nensure that no jurisdiction is excluded from such critical assistance \nsimply because it can't afford to meet the matching requirements.\n  We know that body armor saves lives, but the cost has put these vests \nout of the reach of many of the officers who need them. This program \nmakes it more affordable for police departments of all sizes. Few \nthings mean more to me than when I meet Vermont police officers and \nthey tell me that the protective vests they wear were made possible \nbecause of this program. This is the least we should do for the \nofficers on the front lines who put themselves in danger for us every \nday. I want to make sure that every police officer who needs a \nbulletproof vest gets one.\n  We do not thank our Nation's law enforcement officers enough for the \nsacrifices they make in order to protect all of us. But the actions the \nSenate has taken today in passing this legislation is a strong step \nforward in demonstrating Congress' commitment to supporting the men and \nwomen who serve us so well. I hope the President will quickly sign this \nreauthorization into law.\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

Earlier this year, the Senate passed a version of this \nbill, and I am glad that today it has once again given its unanimous \nsupport to this bill. I hope that the President will promptly sign this \nmeasure into law.\n  Senator Feinstein has been a leader on this issue, and she and others \nhave shown a strong commitment to combating illicit drug trafficking by \nonline predators. I also thank Representative Stupak and all of those \nwho worked on this bill in the House. Through their hard work and \ndiligent efforts, we have a strong bipartisan bill that includes \nimportant modifications and clarifications that will protect our \nchildren, and grandchildren, from purchasing illegal dangerous drugs \nonline. I hope this bill will help reduce the prevalence of rogue \nonline pharmacies in our society.\n  We are a nation in the midst of a technological revolution. In the \ndigital age, the Internet has provided Americans with better access to \nconvenient and more affordable medicine. Unfortunately, the prevalence \nof rogue online pharmacies has also made the Internet an increasing \nsource for the sale of dangerous controlled substances without a \nlicensed medical practitioner's valid prescription. Online drug \ntraffickers have used evolving tactics to evade detection by law \nenforcement and circumvent the proper constraints of doctors and \npharmacists.\n  Last year, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this issue. We \nheard compelling testimony from Francine Haight, a mother whose teenage \nson died from an overdose of painkillers he purchased online from a \nrogue pharmacy. We also heard from Joseph Califano, the former \nSecretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Both \nstrongly supported legislation to fill a gap in existing law and help \nprotect young people from illicit drugs online.\n\n[[Page S10185]]\n\n  Following our hearing, the Internet Drug Advisory Committee held a \nbriefing for the Judiciary Committee on this matter. We heard from \nvarious members of the Internet community on how the private sector may \neffectively collaborate with the public sector to combat the sales of \ndangerous drugs online. These private sector groups will be vital in \nthat effort, and we were happy to receive the benefit of their \ninsights.\n  I understand full well the growing danger that illegitimate online \npharmacies pose to youth. As the longtime cochair of the Congressional \nInternet Caucus, I know that the Internet offers tremendous benefits, \nbut I also understand that dangerous and addictive drugs are often only \na click away. As a former State's Attorney in Vermont, I will never \nforget how much successful prosecutions depend on whether the \ninvestigators and lawyers charged with protecting the public from crime \nhave the right tools to do so. That is why we are in urgent need of \nthis bill. No matter how dedicated we are to solving a problem, if the \nlaws are not clearly and sensibly drafted, no justice will be done.\n  This legislation does many important things. First, the bill requires \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration report to Congress on \nrecommendations to combat the online sale of controlled substances from \nforeign countries via the Internet and on ways that the private sector \ncan assist in this effort. A key ingredient in diminishing the impact \nof rogue Web sites on American citizens is combating the international \naspect of this problem, and strengthening the public-private sector \ncollaboration can help provide a solution.\n  Second, the legislation narrows the U.S. Sentencing Commission \ndirective to ensure that the most dangerous prescription drugs abused \nonline are treated more severely than less harmful prescription drugs. \nThis addition will ensure that the Commission has clear guidance to \nissue the guidelines necessary to hold those individuals who peddle \ndangerous prescription drugs to minors online accountable.\n  Third, the bill protects legitimate retail drug chains with online \nWeb sites for customers seeking refills on prescriptions, by exempting \nthem from the bill's requirements. This ensures that the bill does not \ntarget legitimate pharmacies that provide Vermonters and other \nAmericans with access to needed medicines, nor does it burden \nlegitimate pharmacies with additional registration and reporting \nrequirements.\n  I believe this legislation will be even better with these changes. I \nam confident that this legislation will strengthen our Nation's ability \nto effectively combat online drug trafficking. It also furthers the \ngoals of drug enforcement and deterrence, while also providing Congress \nwith additional oversight tools.\n  The administration supports this bill--and that is the right thing to \ndo. I know that our hard working men and women at the Drug Enforcement \nAgency need the added tools this bill will offer to assist their \nefforts to combat rogue online pharmacies. Even more, our children and \ngrandchildren need the safety and security of operating online free \nfrom drug dealers seeking to trick them into purchasing dangerous \ncontrolled substances.\n  I urge the President to promptly sign this bill into law.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for supporting \nthe Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act.\n  This is the House companion legislation to the Senate bill that I \noriginally introduced, with Senator Sessions, to protect the safety of \nconsumers who wish to fill legitimate prescriptions for controlled \nsubstances over the Internet, while holding accountable those who \noperate unregistered pharmacies.\n  Today, Congress took the first important step in stemming the tide of \nonline drug trafficking. Perhaps more importantly, Congress took the \nfirst steps toward ensuring that children and teens no longer overdose, \nor worse die, after purchasing controlled substances without a \nprescription from rogue Internet pharmacies.\n  This bill will do the following:\n  Bar the sale or distribution of all controlled substances over the \nInternet without a valid prescription;\n  Require online pharmacies to display on their Web site a statement of \ncompliance with U.S. law and DEA regulations--allowing consumers to \nknow which pharmacies are safe and which are not;\n  Clarify that rogue pharmacies that sell drugs over the Internet will \nface the same penalties as people who illegally sell the same drugs on \nthe street;\n  Increase the Federal penalties for illegally distributing controlled \nsubstances;\n  And create a new Federal cause of action that would allow a State \nattorney general to shut down a rogue Web site selling controlled \nsubstances.\n  In addition, I would like to clarify that the Ryan Haight Online \nPharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008 regulates practices related to \nthe delivery, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance by \nmeans of the Internet. The act does not address the delivery, \ndistribution, or dispensing of any noncontrolled substance by the \nInternet or any other means.\n  This bill does not infringe upon the powers of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services and its Secretary with respect to \nnoncontrolled substances. Nor does it infringe upon the traditional \npower of the States to regulate the practices of medicine and pharmacy \nwith respect to the prescription of noncontrolled substances.\n  Delivery, distribution, or dispensing of noncontrolled substances, \napproved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the \nregulatory bodies of the States, are not affected by the act. The \nSenate Committee report reflects Congress's intent related to this \nissue and is applicable to H.R. 6353.\n  In closing, I wish to share the story of this bill's namesake, Ryan \nT. Haight. Ryan was an 18-year-old honor student from La Mesa, CA, when \nhe died in his home on February 12, 2001. His parents found a bottle of \nVicodin in his room with a label from an out-of-State pharmacy.\n  It turns out that Ryan had been ordering addictive drugs online and \npaying with a debit card his parents gave him to buy baseball cards on \neBay.\n  Without a physical exam or his parents' consent, Ryan had been \nobtaining controlled substances, some from an Internet site in \nOklahoma. It only took a few months before Ryan's life was ended by an \noverdose on a cocktail of painkillers.\n  Ryan's story is just one of many. Rogue Internet pharmacies are \nmaking it increasingly easy for teens such as Ryan to access deadly \nprescription drugs. This bill is the first step against that terrible \ntide. It creates sensible requirements for Internet pharmacy Web sites \nthat will not impact access to convenient, oftentimes cost-saving \ndrugs.\n  I thank my House and Senate colleagues for passing this important \nbill. I also specifically thank Representatives Bart Stupak, Lamar \nSmith, John Conyers, Mary Bono Mack, and John Dingell, and Senators \nSessions and Leahy for their hard work and leadership in securing the \npassage of this bill.\n  I urge the President to sign this important legislation.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 931, H.R. 6531.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. Presdient, I am pleased that the Senate today will \npass the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act Amendments of 2008. The \nSenate unanimously passed a similar bill last year. This is a small, \nbut important, piece of legislation and has bipartisan support. This \nupdated version was introduced to address concerns of the Navy, and \ngives the Department of Defense full assurance that Government and \ndefense designs will not be subject to unwarranted restrictions. I \nthank the cosponsors of the Senate's bill--Senator Cornyn, Senator \nKohl, and Senator Whitehouse--for all their hard work and \ncontributions.\n  In 1998, Congress passed the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act to \nrecognize the significant time, effort, and innovation that figure into \nship design. Recent action in the courts has made it clear that in \norder to be effective, this law needs to be clarified and refined. This \nbill does exactly that, and no more, by clarifying the definition of \n``hull'' and ``deck.'' This ensures that the intellectual property \nrights of vessel hull designers will be protected.\n  I am pleased the Senate will adopt this measure today, and I look \nforward to the President signing it into law.\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 7084, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 7084) to amend section 114 of title 17, United \n     States Code, to provide for agreements for the reproduction \n     and performance of sound recordings by webcasters.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Presdient, I am pleased that the Senate has passed the \nWebcaster Settlement Act of 2008, a short but important bill for all of \nus who love to listen to music online. I have long championed the \ndevelopment of new business models for transmitting music to the \npublic, and I have been delighted to see the webcasting community grow \nand prosper. From tiny operations serving the smallest of musical \nniches, to collegiate stations playing cutting edge performers, to \nlarge established webcasters providing a whole new array of services to \nlisteners, the online music world has truly blossomed in the last 10 \nyears. But with all new growth comes growing pains, and we also must be \nconstantly vigilant to ensure that the development of new business \ninterests does not come at the expense of settled property rights.\n  When webcasting was even younger, I sponsored the Small Webcasters \nSettlement Act of 2004, which established a Copyright Royalty Tribunal \nto replace the old Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel as the \nadministrative body for determining--in the absence of privately \nnegotiated contracts--the royalty rates to be paid by online music \nproviders to the performers who hold the copyrights in that music. The \nnew system has seen its first adjudications, and this legislation \nreflects the need for a slight readjustment in that system. The bill \nsimply extends the time to next February during which the parties can \nnegotiate their own rates, even after the CRB proceeding, and will \npermit any deal that is negotiated by that time to bind the interested \nparties.\n  I am not, in the normal course, a proponent of legislative \nreadjustments like this one, but I understand the advisability of this \nparticular extension. I will not, however, sanction repeated returns to \nCongress if webcasters are again dissatisfied with the results of a \nsystem that they urged upon us in 2004, and which they applauded when \nit was created. The parties on both sides of these agreements--the \nwebcasters and the copyright owners--would be well advised to consider \nthese negotiations seriously, and to behave appropriately. The rights \nof our creative artists are the life blood of the entire music \nindustry, including that of the online music providers, and we all owe \nthem respect.\n  I trust the parties when they tell us that the time extension will \nallow them to come to terms that will ensure mutual benefit to them, \nand ultimate benefit to all the listeners, like myself, who enjoy music \ntransmitted over the Internet. I am pleased the Congress has passed \nthis measure before recessing.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me say that after long discussions with \nSenator Dodd, the chairman of the Finance Committee, the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, and other Senators, including Jack Reed, and, of \ncourse, in constant contact with the Republican leader, with maybe \neight or nine conversations today, and conversations with people in the \nHouse and with the White House, it has been determined in our judgment \nthis is the best way to move forward. This is good for the country.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to sound like a stuck record, but I have \nknown the distinguished Senator from Connecticut for 26 years. We have \nserved in the Senate together for 22 years. We have worked together on \nmany different issues but never as we have during the housing debate \nwhich concluded successfully and this financial crisis in which we find \nourselves.\n  Each day that goes by I am more admiring of the work he has done. \nToday is an example. This has been very difficult, and words cannot \nexpress well enough how satisfied I am with the work he has done and \nwhat a good thing he has done for the State of Connecticut, the State \nof Nevada, the State of Kentucky, and our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just say this is one of the \nfiner moments in the Senate. We have come together on a bipartisan \nbasis and structured a way forward on an important rescue package for \nour country.\n  I commend the majority leader, my good friend, for his extraordinary \nwork on this issue, as well as Senator Dodd and Senator Gregg, who have \nbeen the lead negotiators on this matter for the Senate.\n  This is an important accomplishment and a way forward to get a result \nwe need to achieve for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, Mr. President, if I could say this: One person has \nbeen with me now for the last 24 hours almost constantly: Senator \nDurbin from Illinois. He has helped me make dozens of phone calls \ntoday. He had a number of meetings. I want the Record to reflect his \ninvolvement in this has been important and essential.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
