Under the order of the Senate of \nJanuary 24, 1901, as modified on February 4, 2008, the Senator from \nArkansas, Mr. Pryor, having been appointed by the Vice President, will \nnow read Washington's Farewell Address, as follows:\n  Mr. PRYOR, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n\n  To the people of the United States:\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of\n\n[[Page S1094]]\n\nothers, has strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and, \nevery day, the increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more \nthat the shade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be \nwelcome. Satisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value \nto my services, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe \nthat, while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, \npatriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend \nthe deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my \nbeloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still \nmore for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and \nfor the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my \ninviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in \nusefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country \nfrom these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as \nan instructive example in our annals, that, under circumstances in \nwhich the passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, \namidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently, want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite movement that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national Union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The \nSouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nNorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East, in a like \nintercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies \nrequisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of still \ngreater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of \nindispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, \nand the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, \ndirected by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any \nother tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage, \nwhether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and \nunnatural connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically \nprecarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \nand embitter. Hence likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the\n\n[[Page S1095]]\n\nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, \naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \ndistrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to \nweaken its bands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen, in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a Constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize \nfaction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, \noften a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; \nand, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make \nthe public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and \nincongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent \nand wholesome plans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual \ninterests. However combinations or associations of the above \ndescription may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in \nthe course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which \ncunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the \npower of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of \ngovernment; destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted \nthem to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the Constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief of \nsome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and \nwill of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government,\n\n[[Page S1096]]\n\nand serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty. This within certain \nlimits is probably true--and in governments of a monarchial cast, \npatriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favor, upon the spirit \nof party. But in those of the popular character, in governments purely \nelective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural \ntendency, it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for \nevery salutary purpose. And there being constant danger of excess, the \neffort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate and assuage \nit. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to \nprevent it bursting into a flame, lest instead of warming, it should \nconsume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution \ndesignates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, \nin one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary \nweapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must \nalways greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient \nbenefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that the \npublic opinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity, or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead \nit astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation \nagainst another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, \nto lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and \nintractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. \nHence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. \nThe nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to \nwar the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The \ngovernment sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts \nthrough passion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation's subservient to projects of hostility, \ninstigated by pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious \nmotives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations, has \nbeen the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or justifications. \nIt leads also to concessions, to the favorite nation of privileges \ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with \npopularity gilding with the appearances of virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the\n\n[[Page S1097]]\n\npublic councils! Such an attachment of a small or weak towards a great \nand powerful nation, dooms the former to be the satellite of the \nlatter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake, since history and experience prove, that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealously to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the \ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \nagainst it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive \ndislike for another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on \none side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on \nthe other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, \nare liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes \nusurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their \ninterests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. (I hold the maxim no less \napplicable to public than private affairs, that honesty is always the \nbest policy)--I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed \nin their genuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would \nbe unwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course--in order to give to trade a stable \ncourse, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the \ngovernment to support them, conventional rules of intercourse, the best \nthat present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but \ntemporary, and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as \nexperience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view, \nthat it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from \nanother--that is must pay with a portion of its independence for \nwhatever it may accept under that character--that by such acceptance, \nit may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for \nnominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not \ngiving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate \nupon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which \nexperience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress, without \ninterruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                     Geo.

Mr. President, in the month since this year's congressional \nsession has opened, we have had the ability to focus on some of the \ndomestic priorities our country faces.\n  Today we turn to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Although we \noften have legitimate disagreements on matters of policy, Senator \nMcConnell and members of the Republican Caucus have worked with us in a \nbipartisan manner on what we believe is a critical piece of legislation \nthat does so much for the Native American community. I appreciate their \nefforts.\n  Chairman Dorgan and Senator Murkowski deserve our thanks for their \nleadership and hard work in managing this legislation.\n  Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley followed suit, working on a \nbipartisan basis on provisions to improve the way by which the Indian \nhealth care system and tribal recipients can participate more fully in \nSocial Security and the benefits that relate to health in Social \nSecurity. Senators Kennedy, Bingaman, Kyl, and Enzi spent years working \non this legislation. Because of their efforts and those of countless \ntribal leaders and Federal agency staff, this is legislation that \nDemocrats and Republicans can all support now.\n\n  A final word of praise is due to the tribal advocates who stood \nbehind this cause from the beginning: The National Congress of American \nIndians, the National Indian Health Board, the National Council of \nUrban Indian Health, the Indian Health Board of Nevada, and other State \ntribal organizations which have played crucial roles in this \nlegislation. I say with confidence that this bill reflects their \npriorities, their varied interests, and their solutions to the problems \nthat plague the health care system upon which Native Americans rely.\n  I was glad to be an original cosponsor of this initiative. Over the \npast 8 years, my staff and I have had countless meetings with tribal \nleaders. Now tribal leaders are making clear how this legislation is \nneeded all over the country. It is needed for 30,000 Native Americans \nliving in Nevada and millions living throughout the United States.\n  Right now, our Native American communities have access to the least \nadequate health care in America. Far too many Native children are \ndiagnosed with diabetes, suffer from abuse and neglect or die \nprematurely because of accidents or illness that could have been \nprevented or cured with basic health care. Far too many adult Indians \nget lost in a sea of bureaucracy and fail to receive preventive care \nand other health benefits they need and deserve. We can and must do \nbetter, and this legislative initiative will help Federal and tribal \nhealth professionals deliver quality care to Native Americans of all \nages. It supports the recruitment and retention of doctors, nurses, \npharmacists, and other health professionals for Indian health programs. \nIt strengthens and expands health services to American Indians. For the \nfirst time, tribes will be allowed to use Federal funds to provide \nhospice, long-term care and home-based and community-based care for \nelders and the most vulnerable tribal members. It increases individual \naccess to health services by facilitating third-party reimbursements \nfrom private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, and other Federal health \nbenefit programs. It expressly addresses behavioral health needs of \nadults and children by authorizing programs to address suicide, \nsubstance abuse, sexual abuse, and domestic violence programs affecting \nsome communities and households. It furthers tribal self-determination \nsovereignty by authorizing consultation and rulemaking on important \nprograms affecting health delivery and access.\n  Chairman Dorgan has often said America spends more on health care, \nper person, on Federal prisoners than on Native Americans. Senator \nDorgan has said that many times. This bill is only part of the \nsolution, but it is a critical first step. I urge all my colleagues to \nfinish work and approve this bill in the same spirit of bipartisan \ncooperation it has seen from the beginning.\n  Millions of our first Americans await our action. Let's quickly pass \nthis bill and send it to the President for his signature. We must let \nour country's Native Americans know they are not forgotten and that we \nwill deliver them the care they have earned.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1098-5", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1098-S1099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FISA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is going to be a very busy few \nweeks and a very important few weeks. First, we have to complete the \nIndian health bill. Then we will have a debate on progress in Iraq. \nAfter the Iraq debate, we will turn to the economy and home ownership, \nand then the annual budget debate when the two parties put their \npriorities on the table.\n  So in the midst of an extremely consequential Presidential race, the \nSenate will debate some of the most important issues of the day, \nincluding terrorism and the economy.\n  But the debate over FISA--the Terrorist Surveillance Act--should be \nover. A bipartisan majority in the Senate has already voted to revise \nand extend our Nation's foreign intelligence surveillance program. A \nmajority in the House, we know--a bipartisan majority--supports the \nSenate bill, and the Director of National Intelligence says our ability \nto track terrorists was weakened by the House leadership's failure to \nact.\n  This failure to act on FISA has weakened our ability to track \nterrorists. For the safety of the American people, the House needs to \ntake up the Senate bill that got 68 votes in the Senate, and it should \ndo so without further delay.\n  Two competing plans for moving America forward will be on vivid \ndisplay over the next few weeks. The two parties will make their case \non the issues that matter most. Republicans are ready and eager for the \ndebate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the minority leader of the Senate, \nSenator McConnell, for making that statement, but I would like to amend \nit. I would like to add something he failed to add and failed to advise \nthe Senate.\n  We offered to extend the terrorist surveillance law. We said there \nshouldn't be any gap in terms of the efforts of the United States to \nmonitor these conversations. We made a repeated effort on the floor of \nthe Senate\n\n[[Page S1099]]\n\nto extend the law. Each and every time we offered to extend the law, an \nobjection was heard from either Senator McConnell or another person on \nthe Republican side. It appears this is not about the security \nadvantage of the United States in fighting terrorism but about some \npolitical advantage that if this law appears to lapse, they believe \nthey can make some political gain, I guess. That is the only thing I \ncan deduce is their reason; otherwise, they would have extended this \nimportant law, but the decision was made by the Republican leadership \nnot to extend the law. I don't know why. We tried. We will continue to \ntry, and we will continue to try to work out an agreement between the \nHouse and the Senate to make certain America is safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1099-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1099-S1100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRAGEDY AT NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, about 60 miles west of the city of Chicago \nis the city of DeKalb, IL. DeKalb is a town of great historic \nimportance not only in our State but to our Nation. Many years ago in \nDeKalb, they invented barbed wire. It sounds like a small matter, but \nit turned out to be a major part of the settling of the Western part of \nthe United States. The town of DeKalb grew up around the farms that \nprovided not only produce but jobs, and eventually gave birth to a \ngreat university: Northern Illinois University. Last night I was at \nthat university. I went into the convocation hall there, to a gathering \nthat was called together to memorialize a terrible tragedy.\n  On February 14, as this Senate was leaving Washington, we heard word \nthat a shooter had come on campus, gone into a lecture hall and opened \nfire, wounding a score of students and killing five. It is hard to \nimagine. It is hard to imagine that a tragedy would take place at that \ngreat university. Today, Senator Obama and I are introducing a \nresolution expressing our condolences and the condolences of the Senate \nto all those affected by this tragedy.\n  If my colleagues have ever been to that campus, they know that under \nnormal circumstances, it is the picture-perfect American university \ncampus. On any day, you are going to find thousands of students and \nfaculty in their classrooms and research labs, on athletic fields and \nin the dorms, eating pizza, studying, stuck in front of their \ncomputers, going through the happiest moments of their lives. I look \nback, as many of us do, on my college days, and realize what a good \ntime it was, meeting all those wonderful new people, being challenged, \nlearning so many important things, and making friendships that last a \nlifetime.\n  Tragically, for many of those students on the campus of Northern \nIllinois University on February 14, that atmosphere and that \nenvironment changed. They were literally running for the exits of that \nlecture hall as this man stood before them, repeatedly firing handguns \nand a shotgun, killing their fellow students. Within minutes, the \ncampus police were there. No one has questioned the response to this \ntragedy, nor should they. There was a good plan in place to deal with \nit. They executed the plan, but when they arrived, it was too late. \nStudents had already been shot and wounded. Five students died and \nseventeen were wounded. We mourn their loss.\n  It is interesting, because in a circumstance such as this, we come to \nknow the victims and their families. Gayle Dubowski of Carol Stream, \nIL. She was a devout member of her church. She sang in the church \nchoir. She worked as a camp counselor and volunteer in rural Kentucky. \nWhen her parents went to her dorm room after she had been killed, they \nfound the Bible open on her bed. Her faith was very important to her \nlife.\n  Catalina Garcia, of Cicero, a first-generation American. Her parents \nare from Mexico. She wanted to make them proud. She was her family's \nprincess, her family said, and their inspiration. She wanted to be a \nteacher. She always had a smile on her face. If you saw the photograph \nthey used in most of the newspapers, you saw her beautiful smile.\n  Julianna Gehant of Mendota, IL. What a great story. She spent 12 \nyears of her life in the U.S. Army, serving overseas and serving her \nNation. She was in the Army Reserves. She went on to Northern Illinois \nto become a teacher.\n  Ryanne Mace, of Carpentersville, a much-loved only child who was \nrarely without a smile, and her dream was to be a counselor, to help \nthose in need.\n  Daniel Parmenter of Westchester, known as ``Danny,'' a 6-foot-5-inch \nrugby player, known as the gentle giant by all of his friends. He was a \nman who was sitting in that lecture hall next to his new girlfriend. He \nwas going to give her a silver necklace the day after this shooting. It \nnever happened. He died trying to protect his girlfriend from the \ngunfire, and she was able to survive.\n  On February 14, five beautiful lives ended in Cole Hall, a lecture \nhall at Northern Illinois University. Last night at the gathering there \nwere 10,000 people filling the university center. Senator Obama was \nthere. We had four Members of our House delegation from Illinois. I was \nglad they came: Congressman Don Manzullo, Congressman Peter Roskam, \nCongresswoman Melissa Bean, and Congressman Rahm Emanuel. The Governor \nof our State was there and many other State officials.\n  What struck me as touching was that as soon as we entered this hall, \nit was to silence; 10,000 people sitting in silence at this memorial \ntribute. Prayers were offered, as they should be, for the families of \nthose who died and for the families of those who were wounded and are \nstill recovering. They should not be forgotten. We wish them a speedy \nrecovery. But we also commended the emergency responders, the law \nenforcement officers, the health care providers. They were there on \nFebruary 14, and they did what they promised they would do: Everything \nthey could to save lives and heal the wounded. They were trained, they \nwere prepared, and they responded with courage. The toll from this \nshooting could have been worse if it wasn't for their efforts.\n  I wish to also acknowledge President John Peters of Northern Illinois \nUniversity and the entire administration. The program last night was a \nbeautiful program which they organized, but even more important was the \nwork they have done since February 14 to bring that campus back \ntogether.\n  Today, classes resumed at Northern Illinois University. Lessons were \nbeing taught. But last night, we gathered at the memorial service to \nreflect on the lessons of life we have learned from February 14. First, \nwe thanked all those across America who have joined us in expressing \nsympathy for our loss and solidarity of purpose for our future. From \nthe moment that news spread about this tragedy in DeKalb, IL, America \nhas been standing with the Northern Illinois University community.\n  This tragedy is a terrible reminder that we in Congress have work to \ndo to make our campuses and our country safer. We need to do all that \nwe can to make schools a safe place. When we grew up, we always thought \nschool was the safest place one could be. Now look what we face.\n  Last April, Senator Obama and I introduced campus safety legislation \nin response to the Virginia Tech shootings. The Presiding Officer \ncertainly knows the pain and sorrow and the grief that were associated \nwith that tragedy. Key parts of that legislation will reach the \nPresident's desk soon as part of the Higher Education Act \nreauthorization. I hope these new measures Senator Obama and I are \nsupporting will allow campuses and universities to think of ways to \nmake those environments safer for students and everyone who visits in \nthe future.\n  But we also need to take a look at two controversial issues. We need \nto take a look at gun violence. There is an epidemic of gun violence in \nour Nation. We have reached the point in Congress where we don't talk \nabout it, or if we do, it is in hushed tones. There is almost a feeling \nof inevitability that because there are 300 million guns in America, \nthere is nothing we can do about it. We get tied up in political knots, \nevery time we discuss it, about whether we are going too far, \ninfringing on constitutional rights, or whether we are going far enough \nto spare innocent victims such as these five college students.\n  In America, every day, we lose 81 people who die from gun violence. \n30,000 Americans die every year from\n\n[[Page S1100]]\n\ngun violence, which is more than twice as many as die from HIV/AIDS. \nThat doesn't count the 176 people who are wounded every day in this \ncountry by gunfire. It is of epidemic proportions. No matter where you \nare, where you live, or how safe you think you are, any of us could be \namong the dozens of victims each day who end up on the wrong side of a \ngun.\n  Just a few months ago, I was invited to speak at a memorial service \nfor a little girl who was killed near Logan Square in Chicago. She was \nplaying on a playground and got caught in the crossfire of gang \nviolence. The gangs started shooting at one another, and this little \ngirl was killed. Her mother could hardly stand, as she was sobbing \nuncontrollably, even days after it occurred. As I went up to say a few \nwords, the minister said to me, ``Don't bring up the gun control issue, \nit's too controversial.'' I reflected on that for a long time, and I \nabided by his wishes and the wishes of the family not to bring it up. \nBut that is an indication of the fact that we cannot even talk about \nit. We cannot talk about reasonable ways so that guns don't get in the \nhands of people who will misuse them.\n  The vast majority of people who own guns in America obtain them \nlegally and use them legally and responsibly. We should do everything \nwe can to protect their rights under our laws to continue to use guns \nin a safe and legal manner, for sporting purposes or self-defense. But \nwe know--even gun owners know--there are people buying guns at this \nvery minute who have an intent in mind of killing innocent people. This \ngreat Nation has to do a better job of keeping those guns out of the \nhands of those who would misuse them.\n  The second issue is equally challenging; it is the issue of mental \nillness. It is ironic that 30 years ago a young boy whom I knew in my \nhometown of East St. Louis, IL--and I had known him since he was a 2-\nyear old--grew up, graduated high school, and went away to Northern \nIllinois University. He was gone 5 weeks, and he was sent home. We \nstarted asking, ``Why did Gary come back? What happened?'' We never got \nthe full story until a few months later. When Gary went up to Northern \nIllinois University, for the first time in his life, he exhibited \nproblems with mental illness, serious mental illness. They decided it \nwas in his best interest for him to go home. And he did. He had a \nserious problem. Unfortunately, it troubled him for his entire life \nbefore he died. It first exhibited itself on that college campus. That \nis not unusual. Many people who leave their homes for the first time--\nleave the shelter and comfort of the home environment and head out to a \nnew place, like a new campus or university, move into a dorm room--have \na problem that exhibits itself for the first time. When we talk to \nthose who are leaders of universities, they say they offer counseling \nand try to find the students who need help.\n  In times gone by, in worst-case scenarios, many students took their \nlives. The suicide rate on college campuses is higher than people talk \nabout.\n  Now there is a new element. I spoke to the president of a major \nuniversity in Illinois about mental illness among the college \npopulation. He said that, in years gone by, a student would take his \nlife and it was a tragedy for the school and their family. But now this \nis a new era, where that student buys a firearm and wants to take \nothers with him. This university president said, ``I don't understand. \nI don't know if it is the video games or the movies or whatever it is; \nbut this idea that you will shoot innocent people before you kill \nyourself, as this gunman did at Northern Illinois University--this is a \nchallenge for all of us.''\n  We have to first understand that mental illness is an illness and not \na curse. It can be treated successfully in the vast majority of cases. \nWe need to enact the Mental Health Parity Act so that more people have \nmental health protection as part of their health plans. We have to \noffer counseling for students and people who need a helping hand in \nthis circumstance. We have to understand that the college campus can be \nan especially important place to focus our resources. We have to \nencourage students to move into those resources and get help. We cannot \npenalize or stigmatize them for fear that they won't seek help. But we \nalso have to be protective of the innocent people around them and to \nunderstand that at some point you have to draw a line and say this \nperson is now in an unstable or dangerous situation, should never be \nallowed a firearm, and needs to be at least monitored carefully, if not \nsome other action taken.\n  This is a difficult issue because for many years we didn't talk \nhonestly and responsibly about mental health. We should. The shooter of \nthese innocent students at Northern Illinois University obviously was \nsuffering from some form of mental illness. I don't know if it could \nhave been traced ahead of time and acted upon, but we have to think \nabout the future and what we can do.\n  After the shootings at NIU, a group of parents whose children died at \nVirginia Tech wrote to the newly bereaved parents at NIU to offer their \nsupport. Those parents are now joined together by a bond that no parent \never wants to share. The letter from the Virginia Tech parents is \nposted on the Web site of Northern Illinois University. The question \nfacing us now is, how much larger will we allow the circle of grief to \nbecome? How many more support groups will be formed by those who lose \nsomeone they love in school and on a campus?\n  We know guns and mental illness are controversial issues, but we also \nknow that five of the finest young men and women you could ever ask for \nwere taken from us on February 14. If there is any way we could have \nprevented their loss, we need to find it.\n  In the days and weeks to come, the victims of the shooting will be in \nour thoughts and prayers. We stand in solidarity with the Huskies of \nNorthern Illinois University, the students, faculty, the staff, and the \nmembers of the families as they mourn their losses and recover from \nthis tragic incident.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1100-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1100-S1101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE SENATE TO THOSE AFFECTED BY THE \n    DEVASTATING SHOOTING INCIDENT OF FEBRUARY 14, 2008, AT NORTHERN \n                ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY IN DeKALB, ILLINOIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that we have a cloture \nvote that will begin at 5:30 this evening. I know Senator DeMint has \ntwo amendments he intends to offer this evening. We expect to have \nvotes on those amendments. I have an opening statement I wish to give \nfor a short period, and I will defer on that. Senator Kyl wishes 10 \nminutes to speak, with 5 minutes on the bill and 5 minutes, I believe, \nin morning business. I don't want to disadvantage either of my \ncolleagues. I want to comment about the legislation.\n  We are finally, at long last, going to pass an Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act. It has been 8 long years. It is long past due. By \ntomorrow midday, we will have disposed of all of the amendments, and \nhaving succeeded in invoking cloture, we will have finally done \nsomething that will give cause for millions of Americans to celebrate \nin this country for the first time in a long time--an improvement in \nIndian health and Indian health care.\n  Mr. President, Senator Kyl has asked that he be allowed to speak for \n5 minutes at this point. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kyl be \nrecognized, following which I would like to speak--and I will make it \nshort--and then Senator DeMint will be recognized. I notice that the \nranking member, Senator Murkowski, is on the floor as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first of all, I will address an amendment to \nthe underlying Indian health bill. It is amendment No. 3897, offered by \nmy friend from Oregon. It is an amendment which I hope my colleagues \nwill reject.\n  This is an amendment that deals with the way in which moneys are \ndisbursed for health facility construction on Indian reservations. For \nthose of us who represent the majority of our Native American \npopulation in the United States, this is a very important proposition \nbecause most of the construction, as you could imagine, is on the \nIndian reservations in the Southwest--in particular, Arizona, New \nMexico, and, to a lesser extent, some of the other States. It is wrong, \ntherefore, to try to change the formula by which funding is allocated \nfor construction of these facilities to a broader based around-the-\ncountry formula rather than based upon the population we are trying to \nserve. As a result, I think my colleagues should oppose the amendment.\n  It is helpful that the amendment is not mandatory but, rather, \nprovides that the Secretary can use what is called an ``innovative \napproach'' and distribute funding equally among the Indian health care \nregions rather than target funding to areas where the health care \nservices are needed the most. But it still doesn't make sense to try to \nuse this Indian construction funding as kind of a honey pot of money \nfor everybody to share in equally when certain key areas have the bulk \nof the need based upon their population. I think this priority based \nupon need is a much more sensible way to serve our Indian population.\n  I disagree that the area distribution fund is the answer. It will \nturn the current process upside down. It would disrupt pending \nprojects. While it may be well intentioned, the amendment doesn't \nensure that Federal dollars will be appropriately allocated based upon \nthe greatest health care needs of the individual members of the tribes. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose that amendment.\n\n\n                          the fisa legislation\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to take 2 minutes to address the matter dealt \nwith by my counterpart on the majority side a little while ago, \nlegislation we will presumably have to deal with again--certainly the \nHouse of Representatives will--and that is the FISA Act legislation. I \nwish to put a couple of things in the Record. I will explain what they \nare, and then I will ask consent to do that.\n  As you know, the Senate has passed this important FISA legislation. \nThe legislation will enable us to continue to collect foreign \nintelligence on our terrorist enemies. We are waiting for the House of \nRepresentatives to act on that legislation so that it can be sent to \nthe President for signature.\n  There has been some confusion about what the effect of the failure of \nthe\n\n[[Page S1102]]\n\nHouse to act really is, because the House allowed the current law to \nlapse. The person who ought to know what the effect is is Admiral \nMcConnell, the Director of National Intelligence, who joined with \nAttorney General Mukasey in writing a letter to the chairman of the \nHouse Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, dated February 22, in \nwhich he addressed the significant concerns we have, given the fact \nthat there is no current law that enables us to appropriately collect \nthis intelligence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                February 22, 2008.\n     Hon. Silvestre Reyes,\n     Chairman, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, \n         House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Reyes: The President asked us to respond to \n     your letter of February 14, 2008, concerning the urgent need \n     to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n     1978 (FISA). Your assertion that there is no harm, in \n     allowing the temporary authorities provided by the Protect \n     America Act to expire without enacting the Senate's FISA \n     reform bill is inaccurate and based on a number of \n     misunderstandings concerning our intelligence capabilities. \n     We address those misunderstandings below. We hope that you \n     find this letter helpful and that you will reconsider your \n     opposition to the bill passed last week by a strong \n     bipartisan majority in the Senate and, when Congress returns \n     from its recess, support immediately bringing the Senate bill \n     to the floor, where it enjoys the support of a majority of \n     your fellow members. It is critical to our national security \n     that Congress acts as soon as possible to pass the Senate \n     bill.\n\n\n                        Intelligence Collection\n\n       Our experience since Congress allowed the Protect America \n     Act to expire without passing the bipartisan Senate bill \n     demonstrates why the Nation is now more vulnerable to \n     terrorist attack and other foreign threats. In our letter to \n     Senator Reid on February 5, 2008, we explained that: ``the \n     expiration of the authorities in the Protect America Act \n     would plunge critical intelligence programs into a state of \n     uncertainty which could cause us to delay the gathering of, \n     or simply miss, critical foreign intelligence information.'' \n     That is exactly what has happened since the Protect America \n     Act expired six days ago without enactment of the bipartisan \n     Senate bill. We have lost intelligence information this past \n     week as a direct result of the uncertainty created by \n     Congress' failure to act. Because of this uncertainty, some \n     partners have reduced cooperation. In particular, they have \n     delayed or refused compliance with our requests to initiate \n     new surveillances of terrorist and other foreign intelligence \n     targets under existing directives issued pursuant to the \n     Protect America Act. Although most partners intend to \n     cooperate for the time being, they have expressed deep \n     misgivings about doing so in light of the uncertainty and \n     have indicated that they may well cease to cooperate if the \n     uncertainty persists. We are working to mitigate these \n     problems and are hopeful that our efforts will be successful. \n     Nevertheless, the broader uncertainty caused by the Act's \n     expiration will persist unless and until the bipartisan \n     Senate bill is passed. This uncertainty may well continue to \n     cause us to miss information that we otherwise would be \n     collecting.\n       Thus, although it is correct that we can continue to \n     conduct certain activities authorized by the Protect America \n     Act for a period of one year from the time they were first \n     authorized, the Act's expiration has and may well continue to \n     adversely affect such activities. Any adverse effects will \n     result in a weakening of critical tools necessary to \n     protect the Nation. As we explained in our letter to \n     Senator Reid, expiration would create uncertainty \n     concerning: The ability to modify certifications and \n     procedures issued under the Protect America Act to reflect \n     operational needs and the implementation of procedures to \n     ensure that agencies are fully integrated protecting the \n     Nation; The continuing validity of liability of protection \n     for those who assist us according to the procedures under \n     the Protect America Act; The continuing validity of the \n     judicial mechanism for compelling the assistance of \n     private parties needed to protect our national security; \n     The ability to cover intelligence gaps created by new \n     communication paths or technologies.\n       Our experience in the past few days since the expiration of \n     the Act demonstrates that these concerns are neither \n     speculative nor theoretical: allowing the Act to expire \n     without passing the bipartisan Senate bill has had real and \n     negative consequences for our national security. Indeed, this \n     has led directly to a degraded intelligence capability.\n       It is imperative that our intelligence agencies retain the \n     tools they need to collect vital intelligence information. As \n     we have explained before, the core authorities provided by \n     the Protect America Act have helped us to obtain exactly the \n     type of information we need to keep America safe, and it is \n     essential that Congress reauthorize the Act's core \n     authorities while also extending liability protection to \n     those companies who assisted our Nation following the attacks \n     of September 11, 2001. Using the authorities provided in the \n     Protect America Act, we have obtained information about \n     efforts of an individual to become a suicide operative, \n     efforts by terrorists to obtain guns and ammunition, and \n     terrorists transferring money. Other information obtained \n     using the authorities provided by the Protect America Act has \n     led to the disruption of planned terrorist attacks. The \n     bipartisan Senate bill would preserve these core authorities \n     and improve on the Protect America Act in certain critical \n     ways, including by providing liability protection to \n     companies that assisted in defending the country after \n     September 11.\n       In your letter, you assert that the Intelligence \n     Community's ability to protect the Nation has not been \n     weakened, because the Intelligence Community continues to \n     have the ability to conduct surveillance abroad in accordance \n     with Executive Order 12333. We respectfully disagree. \n     Surveillance conducted under Executive Order 12333 in a \n     manner that does not implicate FISA or the Protect America \n     Act is not always as effective, efficient, or safe for our \n     intelligence professionals as acquisitions conducted under \n     the Protect America Act. And, in any event, surveillance \n     under the Protect America Act served as an essential adjunct \n     to our other intelligence tools. This is particularly true in \n     light of the changes since 1978 in the manner in foreign \n     targets with speed and agility. If we revert to a legal \n     framework in which the Intelligence Community needs to \n     make probable cause showings for foreign terrorists and \n     other national security threats located overseas, we are \n     certain to experience more intelligence gaps and miss \n     collecting information.\n       You imply that the emergency authorization process under \n     FISA is an adequate substitute for the legislative \n     authorities that have lapsed. This assertion reflects a basic \n     misunderstanding about FISA's emergency authorization \n     provisions. Specifically, you assert that the National \n     Security Agency (NSA) or the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     (FBI) ``may begin surveillance immediately'' in an emergency \n     situation. FISA requires far more, and it would be illegal to \n     proceed as you suggest. Before surveillance begins the \n     Attorney General must determine that there is probable cause \n     that the target of the surveillance is a foreign power or an \n     agent of a foreign power and that FISA's other requirements \n     are met. As explained above, the process of compiling the \n     facts necessary for such a determination and preparing \n     applications for emergency authorizations takes time and \n     results in delays. Again, it makes no sense to impose this \n     requirement in the context of foreign intelligence \n     surveillance of targets located overseas. Because of the \n     hurdles under FISA's emergency authorization provisions and \n     the requirement to go to the FISA Court within 72 hours, our \n     resource constraints limit our use of emergency \n     authorizations to certain high-priority circumstances and \n     cannot simply be employed for every foreign intelligence \n     target.\n       It is also inaccurate to state that because Congress has \n     amended FISA several times, there is no need to modernize \n     FISA. This statement runs counter to the very basis for \n     Congress's passage last August of the Protect America Act. It \n     was not until the passage of this Act that Congress amended \n     those provisions of FISA that had become outdated due to the \n     communications revolution we have experienced since 1978. As \n     we explained, those outdated provisions resulted in dangerous \n     intelligence gaps by causing constitutional protections to be \n     extended to foreign terrorists overseas. It is critical that \n     Congress enact long-term FISA modernization to ensure that \n     the Intelligence Community can collect effectively the \n     foreign intelligence information it needs to protect the \n     Nation. The bill passed by the Senate would achieve this \n     goal, while safeguarding the privacy interests of Americans.\n\n\n                          liability protection\n\n       Your assertion that the failure to provide liability \n     protection for those private-sector firms that helped defend \n     the Nation after the September 11 attacks does not affect our \n     intelligence collection capability is inaccurate and contrary \n     to the experience of intelligence professionals and to the \n     conclusions the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \n     reached after careful study of the matter. It also ignores \n     that providing liability protection to those companies sued \n     for answering their country's call for assistance in the \n     aftermath of September 11 is simply the right thing to \n     do. Through briefings and documents, we have provided the \n     members of your committee with access to the information \n     that shows that immunity is the fair and just result.\n       Private party assistance is necessary and critical to \n     ensuring that the Intelligence Community can collect the \n     information needed to protect our country from attack. In its \n     report on S. 2248, the Intelligence Committee stated that \n     ``the intelligence community cannot obtain the intelligence \n     it needs without assistance'' from electronic communication \n     service providers. The Committee also concluded that \n     ``without retroactive immunity, the private sector might be \n     unwilling to cooperate with lawful Government requests in the \n     future without unnecessary court involvement and protracted \n     litigation. The possible reduction in intelligence that might \n     result from this delay is simply unacceptable for the safety \n     of our Nation.'' Senior intelligence officials also have \n     testified regarding the importance of providing liability \n     protection to such companies for this very reason.\n\n[[Page S1103]]\n\n       Even prior to the expiration of the Protect America Act, we \n     experienced significant difficulties in working with the \n     private sector because of the continued failure to provide \n     liability protection for such companies. These difficulties \n     have only grown since expiration of the Act without passage \n     of the bipartisan Senate bill, which would provide fair and \n     just liability protection. Exposing the private sector to the \n     continued risk of billion-dollar class action suits for \n     assisting in efforts to defend the country understandably \n     makes the private sector much more reluctant to cooperate. \n     Without their cooperation, our efforts to protect the country \n     cannot succeed.\n\n\n                          pending legislation\n\n       Finally, as you note, the House passed a bill in November \n     to amend FISA, but we immediately made clear that the bill is \n     unworkable and unacceptable. Over three months ago, the \n     Administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy \n     (SAP) that stated that the House bill ``falls far short of \n     providing the Intelligence Community with the tools it needs \n     to collect effectively the foreign intelligence information \n     vital for the security of the Nation'' and that ``the \n     Director of National Intelligence and the President's other \n     senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the \n     bill.'' We adhere to that view today.\n       The House bill has several grave deficiencies. First, \n     although numerous senior intelligence officials have \n     testified regarding the importance of affording liability \n     protection for companies that assisted the Government in the \n     aftermath of September 11, the House bill does not address \n     the critical issue of liability protection. Second, the House \n     bill contains certain provisions and serious technical flaws \n     that would fatally undermine our ability to collect \n     effectively the intelligence needed to protect the Nation. In \n     contrast, the Senate bill deals with the issue of liability \n     protection in a way that is fair and that protects the \n     national security. In addition, the Senate bill is carefully \n     drafted and has been amended to avoid technical flaws similar \n     to the ones in the House bill. We note that the privacy \n     protections for Americans in the Senate bill exceed the \n     protections contained in both the Protect America Act and the \n     House bill.\n       The Department of Justice and the Intelligence Community \n     are taking the steps we can to try to keep the country safe \n     during this current period of uncertainty. These measures are \n     remedial at best, however, and do not provide the tools our \n     intelligence professionals need to protect the Nation or the \n     certainty needed by our intelligence professionals and our \n     private partners. The Senate passed a strong and balanced \n     bill by an overwhelming and bipartisan margin. That bill \n     would modernize FISA, ensure the future cooperation of the \n     private sector, and guard the civil liberties we value. We \n     hope that you will support giving your fellow members the \n     chance to vote on this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael B. Mukasey,\n       Attorney General.\n     J.M. McConnell,\n       Director of National Intelligence.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in addition to that, the Department of \nJustice has issued a news release dated February 23 that is titled \n``Statement by the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director \nof National Intelligence Regarding Cooperation with Private Partners,'' \nwhich press release makes it very clear that we are having a very \ndifficult time in dealing with the telecommunications companies that \nare assisting the U.S. Government in the absence of a law which \nproperly provides for liability protection for them and sets out the \nground rules for their intelligence collection.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the statement \nto which I just referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement by the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director \n  of National Intelligence Regarding Cooperation With Private Partners\n\n       As stated in the joint letter from the Attorney General and \n     the Director of National Intelligence dated February 22, the \n     Department of Justice and the Intelligence Community have \n     been working assiduously to mitigate the effects of the \n     uncertainty caused by the failure to enact long-term \n     modernization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n     1978. We learned last night after sending this letter that, \n     as a result of these efforts, new surveillances under \n     existing directives issued pursuant to the Protect America \n     Act will resume, at least for now. We appreciate the \n     willingness of our private partners to cooperate despite the \n     uncertainty. Unfortunately, the delay resulting from this \n     discussion impaired our ability to cover foreign intelligence \n     targets, which resulted in missed intelligence information. \n     In addition, although our private partners are cooperating \n     for the time being, they have expressed understandable \n     misgivings about doing so in light of the on-going \n     uncertainty and have indicated that they may well discontinue \n     cooperation if the uncertainty persists. Even with the \n     cooperation of these private partners under existing \n     directives, our ability to gather information concerning the \n     intentions and planning of terrorists and other foreign \n     intelligence targets will continue to degrade because we have \n     lost tools provided by the Protect America Act that enable us \n     to adjust to changing circumstances. Other intelligence tools \n     simply cannot replace these Protect America Act authorities. \n     The bipartisan Senate bill contains these authorities, as \n     well as liability protection for those companies who answered \n     their country's call in the aftermath of September 11. We \n     hope that the House will pass this bill soon and end the \n     continuing problems the Intelligence Community faces in \n     carrying out its mission to protect the country.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Finally, Mr. President, the Director of National \nIntelligence, Admiral McConnell, was on a television program in which \nhe made some points related to this issue. Among other things, he said:\n\n       We cannot do this mission, we cannot do this activity \n     without the help of the private sector.\n\n  Upon expiration of the Protect America Act ``the private sector \npartner said, `Well, wait a minute, are we now protected?' So we went \nthrough a discussion for the entire week. Now, this is the problem. We \nmay have the authority to conduct surveillance, and we do, for example, \non al-Qaida, but you can't make that actionable if you don't have \nsomething specific to load in our systems to target. So when we wanted \nto load new information, the private partners said, `We're not prepared \nto do that.' So we negotiated all week to be able to come to closure.''\n  The point he is making is, we are in a situation right now of grave \nvulnerability. Intelligence is not being collected, so there is no law \nunder which it can be collected. The private parties with whom we must \nwork to collect that intelligence are in a position of great \nvulnerability because of lack of liability protection, as a result of \nwhich there can undoubtedly arise a question as to whether they will \ncontinue to be able to perform this service for us. That is why we ask \nthe House of Representatives to take up the Senate-passed legislation \nand to pass it as soon as possible and send it to the President so this \nvulnerability of which the Director has spoken can come to an end and \nwe can resume collection of intelligence on our terrorist enemies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will make a few comments, and then \nSenator DeMint, by unanimous consent, will be recognized. He will have \nthe time that he desires to speak about his two amendments that we will \nvote on this evening.\n  I begin quickly by saying that we have had a lot of help to get this \nbill this far: Senator Reid, first of all, for allowing us and being \npersistent in getting this bill to the floor and to keep it here. \nSenator Kyl has worked closely with us. Senator Murkowski, the ranking \nmember, has worked very hard to help me get this bill from our \ncommittee to the floor. Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi and so many \nothers have worked with us to try to make a difference on this \nlegislation.\n  Let me describe why there is an urgency. We have a trust \nresponsibility for Indian health care. That is different from other \nresponsibilities. A trust responsibility means we took the land from \nthe indigenous Americans, from the first Americans. We took their land \nbut signed treaties and said: Tell you what, we will give you a deal. \nHere is our responsibility: We will provide health care for you. That \nwas interpreted much later as a trust responsibility.\n  Let me show what we do on Indian health care compared to other \nresponsibilities we have. This describes how much we spend per person \non Medicare, veterans, Medicaid, and so on. We actually spend twice as \nmuch money to provide health care for Federal prisoners, those \nincarcerated in Federal prisons, as we do to meet our responsibility \nfor health care for American Indians. We have a responsibility for \nboth, but we spend twice as much for Federal prisoners' health care as \nwe do for American Indians.\n  It is not as if there is not a need. American Indians have a 600 \npercent higher rate of tuberculosis, a 510 percent rate of alcoholism, \nand diabetes is off the charts. There are about one-third of doctors \nfor Indians versus other populations, and one-fourth of\n\n[[Page S1104]]\n\nnurses for Indians as other populations. There is a much higher rate of \nsudden infant death syndrome. Cervical cancer is four times higher. The \nsuicide rate among Indian teens is 10 times higher in the northern \nGreat Plains, and it is triple in the rest of the country. The \nstatistics are endless. We have a full-scale health care crisis.\n  This bill in itself will not fix all that is wrong, but it is the \nfirst time in 8 years we are finally getting this bill reauthorized. It \nshould have been done 8 years ago. It is now being done, and it is \nimportant.\n  I have described this bill through the eyes of two girls--one age 5, \nthe other age 14, both dead. Let me describe them. Their relatives and \nparents have allowed me to use their names so that we understand what \nthis is about and what this urgency is.\n  First, I will explain Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight, a beautiful 5-year-\nold Indian girl from the Crow Reservation in Montana. Ta'Shon Rain \nLittlelight died, and the last 3 months of her life was in unmedicated \npain. This little girl went to an Indian health clinic again and again \nto be diagnosed as having a condition of depression, and she was \ntreated for depression. It turns out she had terminal cancer. She was \nfinally rushed to Billings, MT, then rushed to Denver, CO, and \ndiagnosed as having terminal cancer when it was undiagnosed many months \nbefore, and it may well have been able to be treated.\n  When they finally diagnosed this 5-year-old girl, who loved to dance \nthe Indian dances, as having terminal cancer, she asked her mom if she \ncould go to Disney World and see Cinderella's castle and the Make-a-\nWish Foundation allowed her to go to Orlando, FL, to see Cinderella's \ncastle.\n  They got there and checked into a motel, and that evening, in her \nmother's arms, Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight said: Mommy, I'm sorry I'm \nsick. I will try to be better. She died that night in her mother's \narms. She never got to see Cinderella's castle.\n  This little girl deserved health treatment, deserved a health system \nthat we would expect for our children, a good diagnosis, first-class \nhealth treatment. She did not get it, and she is dead.\n  So is Avis Littlewind. Avis was 14. Avis Littlewind committed \nsuicide. She lay in her bed for 90 days in a fetal position, missing \nschool, missing everything. Her sister had committed suicide. Her dad \ntook his own life. This young girl age 14 was lying in a fetal position \nfor 3 months and somehow nobody missed her. No mental health treatment \nwas available. Nobody seemed to identify this little girl was in \ntrouble. And then she hung herself. She felt hopeless and helpless and \ntook her life.\n  A 14-year-old girl is gone. A 5-year-old girl is gone. But it is \nthousands, thousands of people suffering with a health care system that \nis not working. It is not working the way we would expect it to work \nfor us and for our families, and it does not work for Native Americans, \nthe first Americans, for whom we have a trust responsibility and to \nwhom we made a promise. That is why we must get this bill done. We will \nhave a cloture vote at 5:30 p.m.\n  We will have two amendments this evening by Senator DeMint, a couple \nof amendments tomorrow morning, and final passage, and there will be a \ncelebration by people who have waited a long time for this legislation \nto move through the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleague, Senator DeMint, has been waiting \npatiently. I yield the floor, and my guess is that Senator Murkowski, \nthe ranking member, will wish to be recognized following Senator \nDeMint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of the chairman on \nthe need to improve Indian health care. It is clear from the Government \nAccounting Office study that there is no doubt Indian health is \nsuffering and there are many reforms that are desperately needed. I \nwish to talk about several amendments we proposed that we think will \nhelp the bill. One is related to what Senator Dorgan was just talking \nabout and the fact that there is just not enough money currently to \nprovide the health care that is needed for many Indians across the \ncountry today.\n  Unlike a lot of other Federal support for health care, Indian health \ncare provides 100 percent coverage to all members of tribes across the \ncountry, regardless of income level. The problem that creates at a time \nwhen we are offering new programs and reforms is we are not offering \nenough money to actually support all the programs that are in this new \nbill.\n  My amendment No. 4073, which we call the Indian gaming amendment, \nwould allocate the scarce resources to the poorer tribes by excluding \nsome of the richer tribes that benefit from class III or casino-style \ngambling.\n  Many of us have looked at the statistics. Revenues from Indian casino \ngambling have surpassed $12 billion, and many members of these tribes \nwill receive income from these casinos from $30,000 to over $300,000. \nThere are clear discrepancies in the income in the tribes across the \ncountry, and in designing Indian health care reform, it is important \nthat we recognize that fact.\n  In 2001, there were 290 Indian casinos across 28 States that brought \nin more than $12.5 billion with more than $5 billion in profit. To put \nthis in context, the average family in South Carolina makes around \n$50,000 a year. These families, sometimes on their own, sometimes \nthrough their employers, have to pay and help pay for their health care \nand many times deductibles and copays. The average income in the tribes \nthat have casino gambling is generally much higher than that amount. \nYet we are providing free health care for these tribes.\n  This amendment would exclude from the new programs in the underlying \nbill those tribes with casino gambling, class III gambling, which would \ntake the money that is provided in the bill and allocate it to the \npoorer tribes, which uses just basic common sense. If we have a limited \namount of money to go around, let's target those tribes with the \ngreatest poverty and the greatest need and allow those tribes with the \nhighest incomes to participate in purchasing their own health care. \nThat is amendment No. 4073. We will vote on that amendment today.\n  Let me address another amendment that will be voted on today; that \nis, amendment No. 4070 which recognizes that some of the programs in \nthe bill that are designed for injury prevention or safety have \nactually been used in the past by Government agencies to promote \nantifirearm programs, gun buyback programs, or programs that generally \nstigmatize the ownership of guns for collecting, hunting, or self-\ndefense.\n  This amendment provides that none of the funds in the bill may be \nused to fund antifirearm programs, gun buyback programs, or programs \naimed at discouraging or stigmatizing the private ownership of firearms \nfor collecting, hunting, or self-defense. That is basically the \nlanguage in the bill.\n  We know from programs we have looked at before--we have legislation, \nfor instance, that we passed that would prohibit the Centers for \nDisease Control from doing exactly the same thing; that is, using money \nthat is supposed to be used for safety programs or other injury \nprevention and actually use it to promote a political agenda which is \nan anti-second-amendment agenda. This is another amendment we will vote \non today.\n  So two amendments we will be voting on today after the cloture motion \nvote is the Indian gaming amendment that would exclude those tribes \nthat have the revenue from casinos, as well as the other amendment \nwhich would prohibit funds from being used to stigmatize the ownership \nof guns.\n  Mr. President, I wish to address another amendment which is pending \nto this bill, which is what we call the health savings account choice. \nThis amendment would simply make another choice available to Indians in \nthe purchase of their health care. Right now, they have most of the \noptions that we have at the Federal level in our Federal employees \nplan, but they do not yet have a health savings account option which we \nhave added to our Federal programs. This simply would allow Indians the \nsame choice that we have. They could purchase a PPO or other plans--\nmanaged care, HMO, or with this amendment, they could also have a \nhealth savings account with a high-deductible plan.\n\n[[Page S1105]]\n\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. I am actually \nworking with the chairman on the possibility that this amendment could \nbe accepted and avoid a vote on the amendment tomorrow; otherwise, we \nwill be voting on it tomorrow before final passage.\n  I wish to make a few comments on a second-degree amendment that I \nadded to one of these amendments the week before we left last week \nwhich we call the Semper Fi amendment. This is an amendment that is not \ngermane and will fall after cloture but still deserves some \ncomment. The Semper Fi amendment is named in honor of the marine motto, \nwhich means ``always faithful,'' and it is a bill which I introduced \nafter the Berkeley, CA, city council voted to refer to our marines as \nunwelcome intruders and had proposed that they leave town--that their \nrecruiting office actually leave town. When I heard of this, it \nimmediately angered me and we developed this bill which would simply \ntake away about $2 million of wasteful Federal earmarks, which were not \nvoted on in the Senate or the House, but were added as what we call \nreport language. We are not trying to take away all their Federal \nfunding but simply to say, if they are not going to respect our marines \nor their mission, which part of it is recruiting, then certainly they \nshould not be the beneficiary of taxpayer-funded earmarks, and \ncertainly those that aren't necessary.\n\n  When I first introduced this bill, it was more to make a point and \nmaybe rattle the cages of the city council, because I know all the \npeople in Berkeley don't feel this way. If anyone looked at the video--\nand it was one of the most watched videos on YouTube--you could see \nperson after person stepping up and maligning our marines and the job \nthey are doing, not only in Iraq but throughout history, and referring \nto them as murderers and thugs, unthinkable things being said about the \nsame marines who provided them their freedom of speech.\n  Some have said by my introducing this bill I am against freedom of \nspeech, and that is not it at all. In fact, the anti-American group \nCode Pink had been demonstrating for months in front of the marine \nrecruitment office there in Berkeley, and I have no problem with that. \nThey have every right. But they wanted more than freedom of speech, \nthey wanted the power of the local government behind them, to give them \nan advantage over those who supported the marines, supported their \nmission, and supported our country. So the city council voted to give \nCode Pink a free parking place in front of the marine recruitment \noffice, and also voted to give them a permit to use a bullhorn, a \nmegaphone, to shout down any who would want to come into that \nrecruitment office. That is not free speech. That is a government-\nsponsored political agenda that took the side of a few liberal \ndemonstrators against traditional Americans and the marines who have \nfought for our freedom of speech.\n  My amendment got a fair amount of attention and a lot of supporters \nhere in the Senate, which I appreciate. The same bill was also \nintroduced in the House by a number of Republicans. I have been \nsurprised at the response we have gotten--literally thousands of phone \ncalls and e-mails and letters. What this has exposed to me is it is not \nonly a single event, but it has exposed a raw wound not only of our \nmarines but everyone serving in uniform, and their families.\n  I have heard it when I have been in Iraq, more than once, when I ask \nour soldiers, marines, and airmen what they need, and the response has \noften been: Don't forget us. The letters and e-mails I have gotten have \nindicated the same thing, that finally some are standing up for those \nwho are fighting for our freedoms.\n  I was surprised by the response. I have gotten letters at home from \nmothers who have sent me pictures of their marines, thanking those of \nus who have stood up for their marines. I have agonized over the fact \nthat they need someone to stand up for them.\n  But when I go back and see what was said in this Chamber and the \nHouse Chamber, and what governments such as the city of Berkeley have \ndone, it should come as no surprise to us that there are doubts in the \nminds of those who put on the uniform that we support them, that we \nbelieve in what they do, and that we support their constitutional \nmission to recruit and to talk about what we offer in our services. \nPeople--Americans--are concerned about this.\n  We have tried to get the Semper Fi act on the floor for an up-or-down \nvote, and we have not been able to do so. We tried to pass it by \nunanimous consent, which got 100 percent Republican support but was \nblocked on the Democratic side. I added it to an amendment to this \nbill, to try to get a vote, but it will fall after we vote for cloture.\n  I promise the marines and all those in uniform that I am going to \ncontinue to persist until we get a vote on this, because it is not just \nabout this amendment, it is not just about those who support it, it is \nabout letting those who put on the uniform and who are willing to fight \nfor our freedoms know we stand behind them. When any government, at any \nlevel, takes a position against them, it is our responsibility here in \nthe Congress to stand up for those marines and those fighting men and \nwomen and not to allow them to be taken advantage of and intimidated \nand bullied by some local government such as we saw in Berkeley.\n  I have been happy to see some local governments across the country \nactually pass resolutions in support of the marine recruiters, and I \nappreciate any across this country who stand and make a statement on \nbehalf of those who are fighting for our freedom. Again, I emphasize \nthat anyone who wants to speak out in protest against marine \nrecruiters, against the Iraq war, or anything, it is their free right. \nBut when government, whether it is a local government or a State \ngovernment, takes a position against our Federal constitutional \namendment to defend this country, which requires the recruitment of \nmarines, soldiers, airmen, and Coast Guard, that is part of our job. It \nis not freedom of speech when a local government takes a position \nagainst what we are charged to do here at the Federal level.\n  I encourage all those parents, all those in uniform, that the \nmajority of those here in the Senate, in the House, and across this \ncountry respect and appreciate what you are doing every day. I got back \nfrom Iraq last week, with 2 days on the ground, and I know I speak for \nall my colleagues when I say I was never prouder of my country and what \nI do here than when I stood with those in uniform who are sacrificing, \nin many instances, more than a year away from their family, and some on \nsecond and third tours. They are fighting for us and we need to stand \nup for them. I am going to continue to persist until my colleagues give \nme a chance to stand with our marines and to support the Semper Fi \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at this time I yield 7 minutes to the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  I rise in support of renewing and reinvigorating the Indian health \ncare programs. For too long we have neglected our duty to review this \nprogram and ensure that it continues to efficiently deliver high-\nquality health care. As part of that effort in the last Congress, \nSenator McCain and I and Senator Dorgan and Senator Murkowski \nintroduced comprehensive legislation that would do that, and I am \npleased that a great portion of the bill we are discussing today \nincludes provisions of that bill, which was S. 4122.\n  In crafting that legislation last Congress, we kept in mind the 80/20 \nrule in working between the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee and the Indian Affairs Committee. We used this 80/20 rule--or \nthe 80-percent rule--which is that 80 percent of the time we are going \nto agree on a topic and it is only 20 percent of the time that we \ndisagree. So to gain broad support we focused on that 80 percent to \nensure it was a strong bipartisan piece of legislation. It is a piece \nthat is long overdue. This should have been reauthorized years ago. It \nleaves out some important things that are necessary for the tribes in \nadministering Indian health.\n\n[[Page S1106]]\n\n  A few weeks ago, I did mention a few remaining concerns I had with \nthe underlying Indian health care bill, and thankfully, due to the work \nof many in this Chamber, and particularly Senator Dorgan and Senator \nMurkowski, I no longer have concerns with the underlying legislation. \nThe improvements to the bill required minimal language changes, but \nthey do have huge policy implications. I am glad we are better able to \nclarify the scope of Federal liability coverage. By doing so, we no \nlonger imply that the Federal Government could be telling Americans how \nto practice their own religious beliefs. For this and the issue of \nurban Indians, we were able to find a third way, a middle ground, on \nthe appropriate role for providing services to urban Indians.\n  I am also pleased to hear that at least two outstanding issues within \nthe Finance Committee's title of this bill have also been resolved. I \nthank Senator Kyl for all his efforts in the area to create better \nMedicaid copays and better citizenship documentation. I realize others \nmay not see these compromises as the perfect solution. However, they \nare moving us in the right direction on these key topics. As I remind \npeople around here a lot, there is no such thing as a perfect piece of \nlegislation.\n  The 80 percent this bill contains will solve immense problems for \ntribes throughout the United States. It will move health care forward \nfor all who are involved, and it will make a huge difference. It is \npast due. We still can work on other issues that are outstanding that \nwe hear mentioned around the Chamber in the debate, but this piece of \nlegislation needs to pass. It needs to pass now. It should have passed \na year and a half ago.\n  We almost passed it at the end of that session, until we got the \nscoring, and the scoring used the wrong bill. They did not use the bill \nSenator McCain and I and Senators Murkowski and Dorgan put together. \nThey used a different bill, and the cost came in extremely high. And it \nwould, under that bill. It wasn't this bill. It wasn't what we worked \non.\n  It has taken us another year and a half to get to the point where we \ncan pass a bill that will solve the problems for the tribes and keep \nthis program moving forward in a very positive way. I am glad we will \nbe able to pass this legislation out of the Senate, and I look forward \nto working with others to get this bill signed into law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague from Wyoming, speaking to essentially the urgency of where we \nare, and the recognition that we have been working on this legislation, \nthe Indian Health Care Improvement Act and its reauthorization--and as \nhe mentioned, it should have passed a year and a half ago--but that we \nhave been working on it for a good 10 years. It has been a \ncollaborative effort of many leaders in the Senate. Senator McCain has \nbeen mentioned, as the former chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. \nPrior to his chairing that committee, it was Senator Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell who was leading the effort to move forward with this very \nimportant reauthorization.\n  I had the opportunity to go home to Alaska over this past recess, and \nit was a busy recess for me, as it was for, I know, many of my \ncolleagues. I had an opportunity to visit Galena, which is the \nAthabascan Indian village on the Yukon River. I was in Fairbanks, \nSeward, Anchorage, and my hometown of Girdwood. I had a chance to visit \nwith seven or eight Alaskan natives who are training under the dental \nhealth aide therapist program in Anchorage. This is a very unique \npartnership with the University of Washington School of Medicine. What \nwe are doing in Alaska now is training Alaska natives as mid-level \nprofessional dental health aide therapists to go out and provide for \nthe dental health needs of so many in our rural communities, in our \nvillages around the State where they simply do not have any level of \ndental health care. I am not talking about a dentist who comes every \nother week. I am saying we don't have a dentist every other year \npractically in some of these villages. So we are providing a training \nopportunity that is unique to Alaska and is very important.\n  So even though it is tough to leave home and come back here to work, \nit is good to be back here knowing that we are working on the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act, working to finish this very important \nlegislation.\n  We have had many of our colleagues speak about the challenges of \ndelivering quality health care to America's Native people and the \nfunding environment that all have admitted is inadequate to support \nthose needs.\n  Those challenges are not limited to the lack of funding, they also \ninclude the lack of trained personnel who are willing to live in some \nof the most remote places in which Indian health care is delivered. So \nthat is one side of the coin. But there is also some very real \ninnovation that is going on within the Indian health care delivery \nsystem.\n  As I listened to the debate that went on on the Senate floor in the \npast several weeks, it dawned on me that we saw a lot of focus, a lot \nof attention on some of the inadequacies but that we did not spend any \ntime during that debate to recognize the people, the tribal leaders, \nthe health care professionals who are unwilling to let the lack of \nfunding stand in the way of excellence in health care delivery.\n  So as we move to conclude our debate on this very important piece of \nlegislation for the health of our Native people, I wish to take a few \nmoments this evening to focus on some of the ways, in my home State, \nour Native leaders and our Indian health care professionals have \npartnered to overcome what seemed to be insurmountable obstacles in \ntheir quest for excellence.\n  My focus now on these examples from Alaska is not intended to imply \nwe are not seeing innovation in Indian health care delivery in other \nplaces of Indian Country, but I have chosen to speak about these \nprograms because I know them, I believe in them.\n  In the State of Alaska, we have Native people who have lived in more \nthan 200 traditional villages along the rivers and coasts for thousands \nof years, and Natives continue to occupy those villages today. But \nthose are places, many of them are places where doctors and nurses and \nphysicians assistants or the PAs, where they did not live, and they \nwill not live.\n  But that does not mean Alaska's Native people lack access to basic \nmedical care. If one gets sick or injured in a Native village which may \nbe hundreds of miles from the nearest hospital, you need to know you \nare not alone. In our State, we faced up to the challenge of providing \naccess to medical care in remote places by training Native people to \nserve as community health aide practitioners. This is a program that \noriginated during the tuberculosis epidemics back in the 1950s. They \nhad volunteer chemotherapy aides who gave out oral medicine in the \nvillage under the remote supervision of a physician.\n  In the 1960s, a structured training program was created to train \nNative people residing in the villages to function as the eyes and \nears, the hands of medical personnel who may be hundreds of miles away.\n  At one point in time, this link between the village health aide and \nthe doctor in the regional hospitals was carried out by a single-\nsideband radio similar to what the ham operators use. Then later it was \ncarried out by telephone, subsequently e-mail. Now we have a state-of-\nthe-art telemedicine backbone that connects the health aides and the \nsupervising physicians.\n  Alaska's Community Health Aide/Practitioner Program was first \nrecognized and funded by the Congress in 1968 and is 40 years old this \nyear. It has earned the respect of the medical profession and has \ntremendously improved the health condition of Alaska's Native people. I \nmentioned earlier I had a chance to view those young people who are \ncurrently in the Dental Health Aide Therapist Program. This is an \nextension of this concept to improve the oral health condition of \nNative people who live in places where the dentists may visit once a \nyear if they visit at all.\n  These are a few examples from my State of the kind of innovation we \nhave seen going on in Indian health care delivery for some time. I wish \nto give you a more recent example. This is the Southcentral \nFoundation's patient-centered primary care initiative.\n  The initiative has transformed the quality of health care delivered \nto Native people residing in a service area of\n\n[[Page S1107]]\n\n150,000 square miles within southcentral Alaska. The Southcentral \nFoundation is a tribal health provider which delivers health care under \na self-governance compact with the IHS.\n  Our CEO of the Southcentral Foundation is Katherine Gottlieb, an \nAleut. She was the first Alaskan ever to win the MacArthur Foundation \nGenius Award. She won that award for the patient-centered primary care \ninitiative I will describe for you.\n  The initiative itself has been discussed in professional journals \nranging from the Journal of the American Medical Association, the \nFamily Practice Magazine published by the American Association of \nFamily Physicians. It is the subject of a case study published by the \nInstitute for Health Care Improvement in Boston, which is one of our \nNation's foremost think tanks on health care quality.\n  In 1977, when Southcentral Foundation began to take over primary care \ndelivery from the IHS, the average delay to schedule a routine \nappointment ranged from 4 weeks to several months. The no-show rate was \nabout 25 percent for appointments, and patients did not have any idea \nwho their primary care provider was. In 1999, Southcentral Foundation \nembarked on a massive effort to redesign their system.\n  Today, patients are guaranteed same-day access to their own primary \ncare provider if they call by a certain point in the afternoon; they \nget to choose their own primary care provider. They get to change their \nprovider if they do not like the one they have chosen. Use of the \nemergency room and urgent care for primary care is down 50 percent. Use \nof specialists is down 50 percent. Wait times have decreased across the \nsystem.\n  Customer satisfaction, 91 percent of customers rate their overall \ncare favorably. That is pretty impressive. Staff satisfaction has \nimproved immeasurably. This is a system where you have members of the \nmedical team, the doctors, the nurses, the physicians assistants, their \ntechnicians, and they all come together, they all rely on one another. \nEveryone is expected to work at the highest level allowed by their \nprofessional license.\n  What we saw with this transformation of Southcentral Foundation was \nit was not just achieved by throwing more money at the problem, it was \nachieved by changing the values of the system, from a staff-centered \nsystem to a patient-centered system that basically went from kind of a \nbig and impersonable crank-them-through-the-process place--and these \nare the words of the medical director, Doug Eby--to a customer-owned-\nand-directed system which operates in accordance with Native values, \nnot necessarily bureaucratic principles.\n\n  That transformation began with the decision of Native leaders to \nexercise their rights of self-governance under the provisions of the \nIndian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act.\n  These self-governance provisions allowed tribes to take over the \nresponsibilities for the delivery of health care from the Federal \nGovernment. The bill that is before us today, the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act, will provide self-governance providers, such as \nSouthcentral Foundation, with the tools and the flexibilities they need \nto further expand these innovations.\n  We know the bill, S. 1200, was not written in an ivory tower; it was \nwritten primarily by Indian health care providers, tribal leaders who \nknow the challenges we face in improving the health conditions of our \nNative people.\n  The leaders of our Alaska Native delivery system were key players in \nthe process of formulating this legislation. For me, it is truly an \nhonor and a privilege to be able to give voice to their ideas in the \nSenate. It is my sincere hope our colleagues today will vote to bring \nthe debate on this important legislation to a close.\n  The process, as has been mentioned, of drafting this legislation \nbegan back in 1999. It has moved through the Indian Affairs Committee \nin so many different years--I mentioned, under the leadership of \nSenator Nighthorse Campbell, Senator McCain, Senator Thomas before his \ndeath, Senator Dorgan, so many who have put so much time and effort \ninto this very important legislation.\n  It is long time that Congress modernize the legislation which governs \nthe Indian health care delivery system in a way that promotes exactly \nthis type of innovation I have spoken to that we have seen in Alaska. \nIt is long time that we give our Indian health care providers the tools \nthey need in their quest for excellence.\n  I anticipate we will move this legislation to final passage. It is \nsomething that as I speak to my constituents back home and as we talk \nabout those issues that are most important to them, so much seems to \ncome back to health care and how we are providing health care within \nthe State of Alaska or around the Nation.\n  So passage of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act is long overdue. \nI look forward to seeing the day the President will be able to enact \nthese changes into law.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the vote sequence beginning \nat 5:30 today be as follows:\n  Cloture on the Dorgan-Murkowski substitute amendment; DeMint \namendment No. 4070; and DeMint amendment No. 4073.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes \nfollowing the first vote be 10-minute votes, with 2 minutes equally \ndivided for debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me explain that the legislation, the Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act, does a number of things. We have talked about the \nurgency for it, but it expands cancer screenings, for example; it \nexpands monitoring and prevention programs for communicable and \ninfectious diseases; it expands recruitment and scholarship programs \nfor those nurses and doctors who serve American Indians; it seeks to \naddress the epidemic of teenage suicides on some Indian reservations; \nit enhances and expands the current diabetes screening efforts; it \ntries to address the shortage of health care professionals; provides \nfor home- and community-based services and hospice care; also \nauthorizes convenient care services; and authorizes programs to address \ndomestic violence and sexual abuse.\n  In short, it is a piece of legislation that attempts to modernize the \nIndian health care system that has been waiting to be reauthorized now \nfor 8 years. So this is a piece of legislation that I think is going to \nmake a difference in the lives of Americans who have expected and have \nbeen promised good health care and have, for a long time, not received \nit.\n  While we are waiting for colleagues who may wish to speak prior to \n5:30, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 minutes in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Tomorrow, we have a hearing in the Senate Energy \nCommittee that deals with the issue of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, \ncalled SPR, and the Administration's oil fill policies. In the 1970s, \nwe have created a Strategic Petroleum Reserve to put oil underground to \nsave it in case of a national security concern. It would be for an \nemergency so we would have some that is saved and would be available to \ntake out of the underground caverns and use it in these circumstances. \nThis is the basis of our strategic petroleum reserve. It is now almost \n97 percent filled. Over its 30-year lifetime, the barrels that have \nbeen put into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve have averaged about a $27 \na barrel. Yet, right now, when oil is trading at $100 a barrel and \ngasoline prices are going through the roof, we are putting 50,000 to \n60,000 barrels a day underground into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nthat is already almost 97 percent full.\n  How are we doing that? Our Government carries that out through \nroyalty-in-kind transfers. This oil is primarily coming from the Gulf \nof Mexico through the drilling and the production\n\n[[Page S1108]]\n\nthat occurs there. We are receiving this oil in kind in lieu of \nroyalties paid to the government for its production. So rather than put \nthat oil into the supply system, get the money for it, and reduce the \nFederal deficit, we are effectively sticking that money underground in \na hole. At a time when oil is $100 a barrel and gas is $3 to $3.50 a \ngallon, we are taking 50,000 to 60,000 barrels a day and sticking it \nunderground. Is somebody missing a few tubes here? I don't understand \nit. The wiring must be wrong for people who think that is the right \nthing to do. This is exactly the wrong time to be sticking oil \nunderground when oil is $100 a barrel. Yet I have tried very hard to \nget this changed, and I have been unable to do so.\n  We have a hearing tomorrow where we have representatives coming from \nthe Department of Energy as well as other witnesses. I will have an \nopportunity, if I am not here on the floor--and I hope I am not--to \nquestion them. I have recently introduced legislation--S. 2598, the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act \nof 2008. I will try very hard to move this bill on anything that moves, \nespecially a supplemental appropriations bill, to make sure we stop \nthis as soon as possible.\n  I chair the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee that \nfunds the Department of Energy. When I write my bill this spring, I \nwill be able to put a provision that stops filling the SPR in my bill. \nBut that bill likely won't be effective until towards the end of the \nyear. By that time, they will have continued to put all of this oil \nunderground to its full capacity and also boost the gas prices for the \nAmerican driver. I don't understand what they could be thinking.\n  As a part of this fill policy, they are putting underground a \ndisproportionate amount of sweet light crude. That is a subset of the \noil produced in the U.S. We had testimony before a joint Energy and \nGovernment Affairs/Homeland Committee hearing last year by an expert, \nDr. Phillip Verleger, who said that even the small amount of sweet \nlight crude they are putting underground is having a disproportionate \nimpact on the markets and may be increasing the price of gasoline by 10 \npercent.\n  If there are some wires crossed someplace, I urge the Department of \nEnergy to track those wires down and get them squared away. Let's start \nthinking straight. Do not be sticking oil underground when oil is $100 \na barrel. That takes oil out of our supply. It means supply is \ndiminished, even if it is a seemingly small amount as DOE contends. It \nmeans the price goes up.\n  This is a classic supply-demand question. All of us have studied \neconomics. I taught economics in college ever so briefly. I was able to \novercome that experience, nonetheless. But we all understand the \nsupply-demand relationship. If you take oil out of what otherwise would \nbe 50,000 or 60,000 additional barrels in the supply, you put upward \npressure on gasoline prices. That is especially true if you take the \nsubset of sweet light crude coming from the Gulf of Mexico and stick it \nunderground at exactly the time it ought be to be in the supply \npipeline.\n  Tomorrow, we will have the opportunity to have a public discussion \nwith the Department of Energy and representatives with other opinions. \nIf they don't do what is, in my judgment, obvious, I intend to move my \nlegislation forward. I have introduced this bill with about six \ncosponsors. I certainly hope many others will join me to put the brakes \non what the Department of Energy is now doing.\n  It is completely counterintuitive to anything one would expect that \nshould be done at a time when oil is bouncing around at $100 a barrel \nand you have to get a loan to gas up your car these days. My hope is we \ncan get the Department of Energy to think straight about this issue of \nputting oil underground in the SPR.\n  It felt good to say that because I have been thinking about it all \nweekend. There is so much we need to do that just represents a deep \nreservoir of common sense. This is one of those steps. My hope is we \nwill make some progress on it.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  Under the terms of many treaties and agreements, the U.S. Government \nhas the responsibility to provide health care and other benefits to \nNative Americans.\n  The Indian Health Care Service estimates that it provides only about \n60 percent of the health care that is needed in Indian Country: an \namount that is less than half of what we spend on the health care needs \nof Federal prisoners. Tribes with the resources, attempt to make up the \ndifference. In most cases, the result is inadequate to meet the needs \nof our Native American population.\n  In my State, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians has made \nprogress in improving its health care, and the overall health of its \npopulation, over the last 30 years. But, the sad fact is that health \ncare on the reservation is not adequate.\n  There are 9,600 members of the tribe and there are only 4 doctors. \nTheir small hospital has only 14 beds.\n  Over the last 5 years, there has been a 30.4-percent increase in the \nnumber of patients from the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians who \naccessed the health care system. During that same time period there was \na 41.4-percent increase in the number of ambulatory visits.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, 7 percent of Americans \nhave diabetes. By comparison, 20.5 percent of Choctaws have diabetes, \none of the highest percentages of any tribe in the country. Over the \nlast 5 years, there was a 62.3-percent increase in the number of \npatients diagnosed with diabetes.\n  Statistics for other tribes are similar. Some include alarming \nincidences of suicide, high infant mortality rates and practically \nnonexistent mental health care.\n  Some in the Senate have suggested that those tribes that have made \nprogress with economic development initiatives, specifically through \ngaming, ought not be eligible for Indian Health Care Services. I don't \nagree. The tribe in my State should not be penalized for its modest \neconomic success.\n  The tribe is responsible for the safety of not only its members but \nthose who visit. It maintains roads, schools, courts, law enforcement, \nfire fighting, housing, and other services we expect from local and \nState governments.\n  It has a poverty rate of approximately 30 percent. Forty years ago \nthere was a near 100 percent unemployment rate of tribal members.\n  There is no health care system near the tribe that has the capacity \nto serve tribal members. Even now, treatment facilities for dialysis, \nheart patients, and serious medical conditions are 80 miles away.\n  I urge the Senate to support the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Dorgan \n     substitute amendment No. 3899 to S. 1200, the Indian Health \n     Care Improvement Act Amendments.\n         Harry Reid, Russell D.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 4070 \noffered by the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, the underlying Indian health care bill \nallows Federal funds to be used for certain health promotion activities \nwhich include injury prevention, personal safety, and violence \nprevention. My amendment would simply say that none of these funds in \nthe bill may be used to fund any firearm programs, gun buyback \nprograms, or programs aimed at discouraging or stigmatizing the private \nownership of firearms for collecting, hunting, or self-defense \npurposes, which are important to the Indian community. So that is my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have no objection to the amendment. I \nknow of no cases in which Indian health funds have been used for \nfirearms programs. So I have no objection to the amendment and intend \nto vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 4073 offered by the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. \nDeMint.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the sponsor, I ask unanimous \nconsent that amendment No. 4073 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, with the withdrawal of the last amendment, \nthere will be no further votes tonight. My understanding is the next \nvote starts at 10 tomorrow morning. The withdrawal of the second \namendment on which we were going to have a recorded vote means there \nwill be no further recorded votes necessary this evening.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the only question is, I have not had a \nchance to confer with my distinguished Republican colleague, Senator \nMcConnell. We will make a decision as to what time we should start in \nthe morning. There is a lot of committee business\n\n[[Page S1110]]\n\ngoing on, and I want to visit with Senator McConnell first.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3897\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of my \namendment No. 3897. The amendment is cosponsored by Senators Cantwell, \nMurray, Crapo, and Wyden. It clarifies section 301(F) of the Indian \nhealth bill regarding innovative approaches to funding Indian Health \nServices facilities construction.\n  The amendment would allow those innovative approaches to include an \narea distribution fund. Such a fund would allow the IHS to take a \nportion of facility construction dollars and cede that money to all 12 \nIHS areas throughout the country.\n  To be clear, my amendment neither creates an area distribution fund \nnor does it require the IHS to do so; rather, we are simply giving IHS \nthe authority to do what is needed to bring equity to the system.\n  Currently, the vast majority of Federal funding for construction and \nmodernization of tribal health care facilities goes to tribes in less \nthan 10 States. In fact, my home State of Oregon, among many other \nStates, has never received funds to build an Indian Health Services \nhospital. This is a function of the current flawed construction formula \nand of the regrettably low levels of funding for IHS, particularly its \nfacilities construction budget.\n  These two wrongs, however, do not make a right. To correct this, it \nwill take a two-part process: one part to increase funding for IHS and \nits construction budget, but this is an appropriations issue. Another \nis to amend the language in the Indian health bill to create some level \nof parity in the way IHS funds construction projects, and that is an \nauthorizing issue.\n  As we debate today about the authorization of health care funding, I \nstand here to represent all the tribes that do not have access to \nfunding to improve or build health care facilities because of an \narchaic formula. If tribes do not have access, no amount of \nappropriations will make a difference. We have to create the access, \nand my amendment would do just that. Again, it would authorize, not \nrequire, the IHS to use an area distribution fund.\n  The amendment would not rob one IHS area to pay for another. It \nsimply allows other tribes across the Nation to also be eligible for \nfunding. This area distribution fund is not the idea of a single \nSenator or a single region of the country. It is the product of years \nof work and compromise by the Indian Health Services and tribes after \nCongress recognized the need to create a more equitable facilities \nconstruction system.\n  This approach is supported by tribes and area health boards that \ncover IHS areas representing over 400 of the 562 federally recognized \ntribes that are based in 39 States. For Members and staff currently \nlistening to my floor statement, allow me to read a list of the States \nwhere IHS areas want the type of flexibility provided by my amendment. \nTo my colleagues in the Senate, if they have the privilege of \nrepresenting Native Americans, I hope they will listen to find out if \ntheir State is mentioned because, right now, if they are mentioned, \nthey are not getting any construction dollars. It is that simple.\n  The Nashville area, which serves 28 States, includes these States: \nMaine, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, New Hampshire, Vermont, \nMaryland, Ohio, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, North \nCarolina, South Carolina, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Kentucky, \nIndiana, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Illinois, Missouri, \nArkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi. Then the Bemidji area \nwhich serves three States: Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan; the \nAlaska-California areas which serve those States; the Oklahoma area \nwhich serves Oklahoma and Kansas; the Portland area which serves \nOregon, Washington, and Idaho. Additionally, many tribes in Nevada also \nsupport this amendment.\n  The State of the Presiding Officer was mentioned, and so was mine. \nMr. President, you are getting no construction dollars because of the \nway this is managed.\n  Last May, during an Indian Affairs Committee meeting, we were doing a \nmarkup on the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. I filed a much more \nprescriptive amendment which would have mandated funds for the area \ndistribution fund. I withdrew that amendment in good faith because I \nwanted to work with the chairman and the vice chair and my other \ncolleagues to find a win-win compromise on this issue. Since then \ntribes have put in hundreds of hours of work to find a compromise that \ncould benefit all of Indian country. I have since scaled back my \noriginal amendment to reflect and recognize this compromise between the \nmajority of the IHS areas.\n  Unfortunately, my efforts to reach a compromise before floor action \nwere not successful. Yet I believe this issue is better left to the \nIndian Health Services than Members of Congress. That is why my \namendment would simply give them the flexibility to work this out on \ntheir own in consultation with the tribes. Opposition to my amendment \nis based on the notion that IHS funds will remain at the slow drip they \nare now for the foreseeable future. I wish to change that. I want IHS \nfacility funds to grow and to flow to every area that needs them. But \nthen again, that is an appropriations issue and not an authorization \nissue, the business before us.\n\n  I have already written to the administration in support of increased \nIHS funding, and I intend to follow up on that request with the \nAppropriations Committee. I am hopeful that request will be met and \nthat some of those funds would make their way to the 43 tribes in the \nPacific Northwest or to the 25 tribes in the Nashville IHS area or the \n40 tribes in the Oklahoma IHS area or the 109 tribes in the California \nIHS area, among others across the Nation. My amendment preserves that \npossibility for every State and every Native American in Indian \nCountry.\n  On numerous occasions, Chairman Dorgan has invoked the words of Chief \nJoseph, who said: ``Good words do not last long unless they amount to \nsomething.'' Chief Joseph said those words after being chased by the \nU.S. Cavalry out of the Wallowa Valley of Oregon, through the States of \nWashington, Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana toward Canada. Chief Joseph \nalso rightfully said: ``I am tired of talk that comes to nothing.''\n  I feel the same way. Eight years ago, Congress asked IHS and the \ntribes to revise the failed system for allocating facilities funding. \nThe compromise they reached may amount to nothing without my amendment. \nThat is why I feel so strongly about this issue. It is not just about \none region or a group of regions, this amendment is about holding true \nto the government-to-government relationship the United States holds \nwith all tribes.\n  I ask my fellow colleagues to support this amendment to ensure that \nall Native American Indians receive the health care they need--the \nhealth care they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me very briefly say that I understand \nthe point Senator Smith is making. There is not enough money for the \nfacilities in these programs. There is a $3 billion backlog for \nfacilities. I am not able to support his amendment, however, and the \ndifficulty is to create an area-wide distribution fund right this \nmoment, at a time when we have a priority list and some tribes have \nbeen waiting on that priority list for a long period of time for the \nconstruction that was to begin in their area. I think that would be the \nwrong approach.\n  But I do think we ought to, in a more comprehensive way, on the \nIndian Affairs Committee, with the help of Senator Smith and Senator \nMurkowski and my colleagues, we ought to try to work through this to \nfigure out how we do a better job of getting the funding for the \nconstruction that is necessary. I have been to so many facilities that \nare terrible facilities in terrible disrepair, and they are desperately \nin need of reform and change and new\n\n[[Page S1111]]\n\nconstruction, and we have to get about the business of doing it. But I \nregret I can't support this amendment. He is raising the right \nquestion, just providing the wrong solution, in my judgment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, while we are waiting, I wish to make a \nfew brief comments in reference to the amendment Senator Smith has \nintroduced regarding the area distribution fund.\n  Coming from the State of Alaska, I do support Senator Smith's \namendment, as we believe it will enable more Indian tribes to build the \nfacilities and to address the inequities currently in the system. We \nrecognize it has been under review, having been looked at for revision \nfor years, but I think it is time to do something to create \nimprovements to the system to get more facilities for the tribes.\n  Now, we recognize that funding is at the crux of this, but Senator \nSmith's amendment does not mandate that the Secretary create this \nsystem. It says if funding is available, that opportunity exists. \nFurthermore--and I think this goes to the concern many have--that \nwithin the current priority system, if there is a change, somehow or \nother those who have made their way up to the top will somehow be \ndisplaced. We understand it doesn't impact the current health care \nfacilities priority system. What we are attempting to do with this \namendment is to enhance that system.\n  I appreciate Senator Smith working with the committee, with the \ntribes, and with our colleagues on this issue. It is a very important \nissue, as Senator Dorgan has noted. So I do stand in support of Senator \nSmith.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we were expecting to clear two unanimous \nconsent requests, but I am told that, at the moment, the minority side \nhas yet to clear them. If we are not able to clear them at the moment, \nperhaps we will be able to clear them first thing in the morning before \nwe go to the votes that will be scheduled tomorrow.\n  I think we are at a point where we have about two or three votes \nremaining and then final passage tomorrow. And that should occur \nprobably close to midday, which will be a pretty happy occasion for a \nlot of folks who have waited a long time for this legislation to pass \nthe Senate.\n  I know a couple of my colleagues are waiting to do a colloquy, so if \nwe are not yet cleared, I think we will try to clear both these \nunanimous consent requests tomorrow morning. Our colleagues, I believe, \nare not on this subject, so at this point I will defer and we will come \nback to this tomorrow morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and also to engage in a colloquy with my colleague \nfrom Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Childhood Cancer\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I initially wish to make a few comments, and \nthen I will yield to my colleague from Oregon. Today, I rise to honor \ntwo young heroes and their families. Ben Haight of Rhode Island and \nBoey Byers of Oregon were two remarkable young people whose lives were \ncut short by cancer, but whose hopes were not.\n  Of course, when a child has cancer, it deeply affects the parents, \nsiblings, friends, and extended family. In fact, a pediatric illness \naffects the entire family. Even those who don't bear the damage of the \nillness bear the pressures, the strains, and the frustrations over \ndealing with the serious illness of a child. These two young children \nwere extraordinary. We mourn their loss and at the same time we \ncelebrate their lives.\n  Ben Haight was only 4 years old when he was diagnosed with \nneuroblastoma. He fought valiantly, enduring chemotherapy, two bone \nmarrow transplants, and total body radiation. Ben did not let cancer \nstop him from living life. I am told he would dictate his treatment \nschedules to his doctors: ``No treatments during science class; have to \nbe out by 3 to go to Cub Scouts, baseball or soccer.''\n  Even at a young age, Ben knew a lot about what was important in life. \nHe cared about others and wanted to help. He held a bandaid drive at \nschool to donate colorful bandaids to the hospital, which used plain \nbandaids to save money. Ben knew that patients enjoyed picking out a \n``cool'' bandaid and that this simple pleasure offered them a brief \nrespite from the rigors of their disease.\n  Ben's cancer went into remission, but after 2 years it came back. The \ndoctors gave him 3 months to live, but he was tough. He fought for 2 \nmore years. Ben was 9 years old when he died.\n  I never had a chance to meet Ben, but I have had the honor of meeting \nhis wonderful family. His family has turned the tragedy of losing their \nson into a message of hope for other families.\n  Just before Ben died, he and his family enjoyed a special activity \ntogether--swimming with dolphins. Now, the Haight family's mission is \nto do all they can to fight cancer and to provide one child a year with \nthe opportunity to swim with dolphins.\n  I think there is a sort of symbolic link here between his family and \nthese dolphins. His father was a career enlisted man in the U.S. Navy, \na chief in our submarine service. Of course, submarines use the \ndolphins as the symbol of their service branch. This is a family who \nhas served the Nation in uniform and who continues to serve the Nation \nby fighting hard for other families who are afflicted by childhood \ncancer.\n  Now, Boey Byers was, in her words, a warrior against cancer, and I \nwas very saddened to learn she has recently passed way. A few months \nago, I had the privilege of speaking with Boey over the phone. She was \nfull of life and spirit and struck me as very polite, poised, and wise \nbeyond her years. I wanted to thank Boey for all she was doing to try \nto help other kids with cancer. Her passion in life was to find a cure \nfor her warrior friends, as she called them, so they didn't have to \nsuffer anymore and so they could live out their dreams and contribute \nto this great country.\n  We must remember there are thousands of children like Ben and Boey \nacross the country. Each year, there are about 9,500 new cases of \npediatric cancer, the leading cause of death by disease among children \nin the United States. While the incidence of cancer in children is \nincreasing, the causes are largely unknown.\n  The National Cancer Institute--the NCI--currently spends about $170 \nmillion a year on pediatric cancer research, but most of the money goes \ntoward laboratory research and preclinical testing. While it is \nimportant to test treatments in a test tube, Petri dish, or on animals, \nit is equally important to test treatments on humans in clinical \ntrials.\n  For example, a recent clinical trial found that for children with \nneuroblastoma, less intensive chemotherapy is as effective as more \nintensive and toxic chemotherapy.\n  In 2002, an NCI peer review group of scientists recommended about $50 \nmillion in funding for pediatric cancer clinical trials. That level was \nnever funded, and since then it has been cut, despite biomedical \ninflation and the increasing incidence of childhood cancer. \nUnfortunately, declining funding has stopped promising clinical trials. \nPediatric cancer researchers expect only flat funding for clinical \ntrials this year.\n  We can do better. The Conquer Childhood Cancer Act invests $30 \nmillion a year to expand pediatric cancer research and develop \npediatric cancer clinical investigators. The bill also creates a \nnational childhood cancer registry to track pediatric cancer. \nResearchers would be able to contact patients within weeks, enroll them \nin research studies, and follow up with them over time. Similar \nregistries are already in place in Europe. If Europe can do it, we can \ndo it, and we should do it.\n  This bill awaits action by the full Senate. It recently reached a \nsignificant milestone, garnering its 51st cosponsor. So even before any \nvote, we know for sure a majority of the Senate supports the bill. It \nhas broad bipartisan support, with 14 Republican cosponsors and the \nsupport of both the majority and minority leaders.\n  Regrettably, a small minority is blocking this bill, and I call on \nthe Senate to carry out the will of the majority and pass the bill. It \nis my hope\n\n[[Page S1112]]\n\nthat in doing so we will intensify our fight against childhood cancer, \nso that one day the hopes of Ben and Boey, and thousands of children \nlike them, will be realized.\n  Mr. President, I yield now for the purpose of a colloquy with my \ncolleague from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first, I wish to commend my friend from \nRhode Island for persistently and energetically prosecuting this cause, \nbecause having gotten to know Boey at home and visiting her in the \nhospital, I think all of us will understand it is hard to conceive of \nanything more tragic than seeing a young person's life claimed by \ncancer.\n  Senator Reed has been educating the Senate on this issue of \nimportance, of research of this disease. I got to know Boey, and that \nis why I am glad he referred to her as a warrior. I would just tell my \ncolleagues that if Boey had been an elected official, she would have \nbeen the chair of the Warrior Caucus because this very young child \nreally did not know how to rest in the effort to try to get this \nlegislation passed and to help our youngsters.\n  When she was taken from us, she had battled cancer not once but \ntwice. The first time, she had beaten her cancer into remission. She \nlost her second battle, but she simply never rested. The day that I saw \nher last in the hospital, what we spent our time on was Boey and I \nwalking down the halls with Boey trying to cheer up the other \nyoungsters who were at the hospital. She put aside her own pain and \nfear that cancer would claim her life because she wanted to be, as \nSenator Reed has noted so eloquently, a warrior for all of the other \nchildren who have been suffering.\n  I am pleased to be out here with Senator Reed. I think this is \nanother example of the entire country coming together to try to stand \nup for these kids. As Senator Reed has noted, when cancer strikes, it \nstrikes a whole family. That was the certainly the case with Boey. Her \nloving parents, Rob and Rachel, her older brothers, Chris and Joe--all \nof us have continued to think about Boey and all she did to brighten \nour lives and particularly stand up for our children.\n  So for purposes of this evening, I simply wanted to ask my friend one \nquestion. This Senate can certainly have spirited debates about a lot \nof issues. Senators can have differences of opinion on a variety of \nquestions, and we come from different parts of the land. The Senator \nfrom Rhode Island represents a State 3,000 miles from mine where Boey \nlives. But I am still troubled why the Senate cannot come together and \npass this legislation. I think Senator Reed has made the case and made \nit well. He has clearly reached out to colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. Surely, there should be nothing partisan about legislation such \nas this that will be so meaningful to children and their families.\n  For purposes of this evening, I wanted to get a sense from my \ncolleague of what else he felt we ought to be trying to do to pass this \nimportant legislation and get it on its way to the President.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator. One of the things we are doing this \nevening is once again highlighting the critical importance of this \nlegislation, the impact it would make in the lives of children and \nfamilies across the country. And your voice is a strong voice for not \nonly this legislation but for issues affecting health care and children \nin this country.\n  I think we are picking up speed, but we need the cooperation of \nvirtually all of our colleagues, not to pass the bill--we have 51 \nvotes--but to get it on the floor. That is not something unusual here \nin the Senate. But I think this is the type of legislation that should \nnot be caught up in the kind of procedural rules that we all use.\n  I am going to try to reach out and explain personally what is at \nstake, how we have tried to make changes, how we have pursued a \nbipartisan approach. I hope we can be persuasive enough to get this \nlegislation on the floor for a vote. I do not think the opposition, \nfrankly, is the concept and the mechanisms we are talking about. \nCertainly it is not opposition to helping families and children who \nhave cancer. I think it is caught up in other issues. We would like to \ndisentangle those issues and focus on what we can for children who have \ncancer.\n  I think that is one of Boey's works.\n  Mr. WYDEN. One of her many, and you can see her enthusiasm literally \npopping out of the drawing. She was an incredibly passionate woman. You \nhave stated it well. I know of no Members of the Senate who get up in \nthe morning and say they want to be hostile to children who are \nsuffering this way. I think a piece of legislation such as this gets \nlost in the clutter of the Senate calendar and the business of the \nSenate.\n  All of us have staffers who handle health legislation and staffers \nwho are serving as legislative directors. I think for purposes of \ntonight, particularly given your eloquent remarks, I hope the phone \nwill ring off the hook in your office tomorrow with Senators and \nstaffers calling and making clear they want to know more about this \nlegislation and hopefully be cosponsors so we can get it passed.\n  Mr. REED. I am encouraged also. It is incumbent upon supporters like \nmyself and yourself to begin to reach out, which I think we are both \ncommitted to doing, and doing it personally to try to get through. I \nthink my sense is a lot like yours. It is not an issue that people are \nobjecting to; it is caught up in bigger issues. And sometimes we just \nhave to step back and understand that the big issues will still be \nthere and the points can still be made, but we can get this bill done.\n  I noticed the warriors in Boey's drawing at the White House. My hope \nis one day the President in the White House is going to sign this bill. \nShe will be there, and Ben will be there in spirit because they are the \nwarriors, and the young men and women who are helping us in our \nmission.\n  So that is my hope. I think we can do that. We are going to try. If \nit is because we have not been as explicit or as communicative as we \nshould have been with all of our colleagues, that is something we will \ncorrect very quickly.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will do everything I can to help. I think the Senator \nhas said it well. In a sense, his work acknowledges something we all \nsee every time we are home, and that is that health care has always \nbeen the biggest issue here at home.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is someone I admire in so many areas, \nrelating to international affairs, with great expertise, and obviously \nthere are many pressing concerns around the world. But the reality is, \nhere at home, if our loved ones and our families do not have their \nhealth, it is hard to do anything else. I know in the case of Boey and \nthe wonderful family, Rob and Rachel and her brothers, they were \nconsumed by this. They all threw everything they had into trying to be \nthere to comfort Boey, to get her the treatment she needed. So we ought \nto do this for the kids, and we ought to do this for the families. \nThere are a lot of other issues we will be tackling both in health care \nand around the Senate schedule. This is something we ought to do now.\n\n  Mr. REED. I agree. I think it is something we can do. The effort is \nto bring people together and move from 51 to 61 to 71 to 100. I think \nwe can.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Well said.\n  Mr. REED. We have begun in earnest months ago, and we are picking up \nthe pace. I thank the Senator for his wise and kind words.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask consent to speak for 10 minutes \nin support of the Vitter amendment. I believe there is a time agreement \nfor 30 minutes on each side of the Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if my colleagues need to interrupt, I \nwould be happy to yield to them.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3896\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I rise to discuss the Vitter amendment to the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act No. 3896. It is an important amendment. I \nam a cosponsor.\n  I want to give a bit of outline on this provision. This codified \nwithin the Indian Health Care Improvement Act a provision that is \nreferred to as the Hyde amendment that has been public law for some 25 \nyears. Congressman Henry Hyde, whom both the Presiding Officer and \nmyself served with in the House of Representatives, who passed away \nlast year, was a giant on the issue, bringing the issue of life to the \nCongress, to the country.\n  The so-called Hyde amendment prohibits taxpayer funding for abortions \nother than in case of rape, incest, and the life of the mother. This is \na provision which has really not been contested for some period of the \ntime because while we have a contentious debate about abortion in the \nUnited States, the level of the contention of the debate is much lower \nregarding taxpayer funding of abortion when it involves anything other \nthan rape, incest, life of the mother. That has generally been agreed \nto in this body, that we should not use taxpayer money in those \nparticular situations.\n  What the Vitter amendment does is take that particular provision and \nputs it in the Indian health care bill and says that we should not fund \nabortions through the Indian health care provisions or Indian health \ncare facilities other than in cases of rape, incest, or the health of \nthe mother. Federal taxpayer dollars should not be used. Most people \nagree. They may be pro-choice, they may be pro-life, but they are \nsaying still--most people in this country do not want their Federal \ntaxpayer dollars used for this purpose. And what we are doing in this \nparticular provision is codifying within the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act this provision. The Hyde amendment is normally put in \nthe Labor-HHS appropriations bill. It has typically not been put within \nthe Interior appropriations bill where Indian health care is normally \nfunded.\n  Indian health care legislation being an authorizing piece of \nlegislation, I think it is important that we codify this particular \nprovision. This will be a key vote. It will be a key vote on people's \nviews toward taxpayer funding of these types of abortions other than in \ncases of rape, incest and the life of the mother. I would hope that \nmost of our colleagues would say, even if they are pro-choice: Well, I \ndo not think that is something we should be doing with Federal taxpayer \ndollars. I would hope a number of people would look and say: This is \nsuch a contentious debate and so many people in the country do not \nagree with abortion and particularly do not want their dollars, their \ntaxpayer dollars used to fund selective abortions, that people say: \nOkay, you are right, an individual may be pro-choice, but I do not \nthink we ought to do that in this particular situation, and would then \nvote for the Vitter amendment.\n  It is very carefully drafted. It is narrowly cast. It is a policy \nissue where there has been agreement between the House, the Senate, and \nthe President. There has been agreement on the Hyde amendment provision \nfor over 20 years, particularly cast on this contentious issue.\n\n  That is why I hope colleagues will look at this carefully and say: I \nhave supported Hyde amendment-type language in the past. This makes \nsense. It is a commonsense provision.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the Vitter amendment because of \nthis particular provision and will agree that it makes sense to them as \nwell.\n  Overall, it is a contentious issue, but this particular provision \nshould not be. I urge my colleagues to look at it carefully and see if \nthey could not support the Vitter amendment. I strongly urge its \npassage.\n\n[[Page S1114]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that any time I did not use be kept on the \nVitter amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I am pleased we are making headway and are \napproaching finality and conclusion in regard to the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act. I give great credit to Senator Dorgan from North \nDakota and Senator Murkowski from Alaska for their persistence in \nworking with the leaders on both sides to get this legislation moved \nand ultimately adopted.\n  It has been a long time since we have had the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act reauthorized. I think it goes back to about 2001. So \nthis is a long overdue step toward attempting to improve health care \nthroughout Indian Country, and I applaud the work that has been done. I \nhope tomorrow we can dispose of the final amendments that remain and \nget to a final vote on this legislation so we can begin to address what \nare some very serious needs regarding Indian Country and health care.\n  I wish to specifically acknowledge a couple of amendments--one that \nis still pending and one that has been adopted.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3896\n\n  First, Mr. President, I wish to speak to the Vitter amendment, which \nis going to be voted on tomorrow. If adopted, this amendment would \ncodify longstanding policy against the funding of abortions with \nFederal Indian Health Service funds.\n  Senator Vitter's amendment would permanently apply to the IHS the \npolicy set forth by the Hyde amendment, which prohibits the Federal \nfunding of abortions and has been national policy since 1976. For over \n30 years, Democratic and Republican administrations, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, and bipartisan Congresses have all upheld and affirmed this \nessential policy. In addition to maintaining this legislative \nprecedent, amendment No. 3896 includes important exceptions to save the \nlife of the mother or in cases of rape or incest.\n  Now, some of my colleagues may ask why statutory codification of this \npolicy is necessary. Let me assure them it is necessary to ensure this \ndecades-long legislative precedent does not fall needlessly through \nprocedural and political cracks.\n  Without this amendment, there is no true assurance that Federal IHS \nfunds will not be used to pay for abortions on demand in the future. As \neveryone in this Chamber knows, the language of future HHS \nappropriations bills depends upon a host of political and legislative \ncontingencies which can shift suddenly and unpredictably.\n  This amendment would extend and codify good policy--policy that \nprotects the vulnerable rather than restricting rights. The Federal \nRegister contains scores of national policies that are in place to \nprotect women, young children, and citizens of minority status from \nharm.\n  Abortion is a practice that can harm women physically, emotionally, \nand spiritually. Statistics clearly demonstrate that abortion in this \ncountry falls disproportionately on minority populations, including \nNative Americans.\n  By supporting this amendment, we affirm life. As a nation we have \ncome a long way in protecting the unborn since the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Roe v. Wade. However, we still have a long way to go in the \nfight to protect life in this country. I believe there is an essential \nhuman dignity attached to all persons, including the unborn, and I will \ncontinue working with my colleagues in the Congress to promote a \nculture of life in this Nation.\n  As a cosponsor of this amendment, I offer my strong support of \namendment No. 3896, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I hope when the vote comes up tomorrow, we will have a good, strong \nbipartisan vote in support of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I see the majority leader has come on the floor. I \nyield to him at this time. I assume he has some business to dispose of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I very much thank my distinguished friend \nfrom the State of South Dakota who has, certainly, intimate knowledge \nof Native Americans. His State, I think, has one of the largest \nreservations in the country and one of the poorest all at the same \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1114-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition and support of \none of the most important months of the year that should be celebrated \nyear round: Black History Month.\n  Dr. Carter G. Woodson, a prominent African-American historian, \nauthor, and journalist, founded ``Negro History Week'' in 1926 to \nestablish a sense of pride in African Americans who had been ignored or \nmisrepresented in traditional American History lessons. ``Negro History \nWeek'' later evolved into Black History Month, a celebration of the \npeople, history, culture, and contributions of persons with African \nheritage.\n  In part because of Black History Month, many are familiar with \nprominent African Americans who have changed the course of history: \nMartin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks were at the forefront of the \ncivil rights movement, Shirley Chisholm was the first African-American \nwoman elected to Congress, and Jackie Robinson was the first African \nAmerican to play major league baseball. But let's not overlook people \nsuch as the Golden Thirteen, the first African Americans to receive \nofficer's training by the U.S. Navy.\n  At the Great Lakes Naval Training Station in my home State of \nIllinois, these young men worked and studied together for the \ncomprehensive exam that would allow them entry into Officer Candidate \nSchool. Not only did they pass the exam and go on to become \ncommissioned officers in the Navy, they earned the highest grades ever \nrecorded in Navy history. In fact, their record has yet to be broken. \nThough they were often denied the privilege and respect afforded White \nnaval officers, they served with distinction in World War II and \nknocked down the walls of Jim Crow in the process.\n  Illinois, in fact, has produced some of the greatest contributors to \nBlack history, including jazz musician Miles Davis, Olympic track and \nfield runner Jackie Joyner Kersee, famed composer Quincy Jones, and \ncountless others. Illinois also has the unique distinction of electing \ntwo of the five African Americans who have served in the U.S. Senate: \nour very own Senator Barack Obama and former Senator Carol Moseley-\nBraun.\n  During the past 400 years, against all odds and in spite of numerous \nroadblocks, African Americans have woven themselves into the fabric of \nthis country. Through academics, government, music, art, food, sports, \nAmerica would not be what she is without the contributions of her \nAfrican-American population.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1114-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1114-S1115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Specialist Chad D. Groepper\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an American hero \nwho was killed on February 17, 2008, in Diyala Province, Iraq, while \nsupporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. His bravery and selflessness will \nnot be forgotten. I extend my thoughts and prayers to his wife \nStephanie, his daughter Clarissa, and all his family and friends.\n  Chad Groepper was raised in Kingsley, IA, and graduated from \nKingsley-Pierson Community High School in 2004. He enlisted shortly \nafter his graduation. Chad was known for his ability to put smiles on \nfaces, make people laugh, and for being involved with outside sports \nsuch as dirt biking and\n\n[[Page S1115]]\n\nfour-wheeling. He met his wife while stationed at Fort Lewis, WA, and \ntheir daughter is only 4 months old.\n  Specialist Groepper was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters \nCompany, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division \nout of Fort Lewis, WA. He will be remembered for his courageous \nsacrifice and energetic personality. Kingsley mayor Wayne Plendl \ndescribes Groepper as ``a nice, nice young man who was highly thought \nof.'' He will be greatly missed. I ask my colleagues here in the Senate \nand all Americans to remember with gratitude and appreciation a heroic \nsoldier, SPC Chad D. Groepper.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1115-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ASSURED FUNDING FOR VETERANS HEALTH CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, on February 14, 2008, I was pleased to \nintroduce the Assured Funding for Veterans Health Care Act, along with \nmy colleague Senator Snowe. This legislation is the companion bill to \nlegislation introduced in the House by Representative Phil Hare, with a \nnumber of cosponsors.\n  This bill will make spending for the VA health care system mandatory, \nrather than discretionary. Under this legislation, the base-line \nfunding year would be 130 percent of the fiscal year 2006 VA health \ncare budget. This amount would be adjusted annually to reflect the \ntotal number of veterans participating in the VA health care system and \nwould account for the annual rise in the cost of providing health care \nservices.\n  From 1996 to 2003, the enrolled VA patient population increased 134 \npercent. Appropriated funding, however, only increased 44 percent. \nThese discrepancies are intolerable. We must give the VA the funding it \nneeds to provide our service men and women with the quality health care \nthey deserve and were promised.\n  As chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I was pleased to help secure full funding \nfor the VA for the first time in 21 years. The Assured Funding for \nVeterans Health Care Act is needed, however, to ensure that this is a \nregular occurrence. Our veterans deserve to know that Congress will \nprovide for their health care needs and will not subject them to the \nwhims of the annual appropriations process.\n  This legislation enjoys the support of every major military and \nveterans association, including the American Legion, the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of American, and the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars. I commend this legislation to the attention of my \ncolleagues and urge them to lend their support by cosponsoring this \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1115-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  On February 12, 2008, Lawrence King, an eighth grader in Ventura \nCounty, CA, was shot at school allegedly for being gay. He was known by \nclassmates as an outcast who often came to school in high heels, \njewelry, and makeup. He had come out just weeks before the shooting. \nKing was working in a computer lab along with 20 other students that \nday when, witnesses say, 14-year-old classmate Brandon McInerney \napproached Lawrence and shot him in the head with a handgun. King was \nrushed to a local hospital where he was later declared brain dead. Once \nthe victim died, prosecutors charged McInerney with murder as a \npremeditated hate crime and gun possession. He will be tried as an \nadult.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nprotecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens \nalready covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1115-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. ARMY RESERVE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to observe the \n100th anniversary of the U.S. Army Reserve and to recognize its \ninstallations in California that comprise the U.S. Army Combat Support \nTraining Center, CSTC.\n  Initially established by Congress in 1908 to provide a reserve force \nof medical officers, today's Army Reserve is a vital operational \ncomponent in the world's most powerful and sophisticated Army. The Army \nReserve provides the specialized skills and manpower the Army depends \non and currently assists the Army in locations worldwide, including \nIraq, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, the Philippines, and Latin \nAmerica. As a result of their extensive peacetime and wartime \naccomplishments over the last 100 years, the men and women who have \nserved and continue to volunteer to serve in the U.S. Army Reserve \ndeserve the greatest respect and admiration.\n  Established in June 2005, CSTC is the Army's newest training center \nand the first of its kind to serve as a premier training center for \nArmy Reserve soldiers in the Western United States. CSTC provides \nranges, training areas, and facilities to prepare and train Army \nReserve soldiers and encompasses four geographically separated \ninstallations throughout northern and central California: Moffett Field \nin the city of Mountain View, B.T. Collins Army Reserve Center in the \ncity of Sacramento, Camp Parks in the city of Dublin, and Fort Hunter \nLiggett in southern Monterey County.\n  Until 1993, Camp Parks and Fort Hunter Liggett were separate \ninstallations under the control of the U.S. Army Reserve Command, \nUSARC. However, in 1995, USARC placed these two posts under Fort McCoy, \nWI, which in turn developed the original CSTC concept. With \nheadquarters at Camp Parks, which oversees the base operations, \ntraining facilities, and housing assets of Fort Hunter Liggett and Camp \nParks, the CSTC also provides military housing at Moffett Field and \nlodging and dining facilities at the B.T. Collins Army Reserve Center.\n  I commend the CSTC for its success in providing the training grounds, \nfacilities, and support to Army Reserve soldiers. The world-class \nsupport and training reservists receive at CSTC is worthy of the utmost \npraise. I commend the U.S. Army Reserve for 100 years of stellar \nservice to our State and Nation. I will continue to support the Army \nReserve as a vital component of America's national defense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1115-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1115-S1116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING THE PEACE CORPS\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I wish to honor National Peace Corps \nWeek and the 47th anniversary of the Peace Corps. I add my voice to \ncelebrate the hard working men and women who volunteer for Peace Corps \nservice.\n  As an Arkansan and a believer in Senator J. William Fulbright's \nlegacy, I consider this program to be one of the most important \nmechanisms we have to encourage international cooperation, peace, and \nsecurity. I believe we are morally obliged to help those in need around \nthe world and work to reduce poverty in order to fight global \nepidemics, to enhance education, and to reduce hunger.\n  I am continually heartened by the good works of Arkansans in the \nState, Nation, and abroad. Our State has a storied history of service, \nand I am pleased that there are 36 Arkansans currently serving as Peace \nCorps volunteers in Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America. I \nam proud to say that Arkansas is also home to one of the pioneering \nfamilies of the Peace Corps, Carolyn and the late Bob Moffett. Inspired \nby President Kennedy's challenge to the American people, Bob entered \ninto service as a volunteer in the summer of 1962. Carolyn was with Bob \nevery step of the way and devoted her life to taking care of her family \nand the other volunteers; hosting holidays, weddings, and even \nfunerals.\n\n[[Page S1116]]\n\n  But Bob and Carolyn are just one story in the 47 years of Peace Corps \nhistory. Working in the fields of education, health and HIV/AIDS, the \nenvironment, youth, agriculture, information technology, and business \ndevelopment, 190,000 brave men and women, serving in 139 countries, \nhave dedicated over 2 years of their lives to make significant \nachievements, enriching the lives of others and serving their country.\n  In these uncertain times, Peace Corps volunteers remain committed to \nthe goals of international peace, friendship, and understanding by \nsharing their unparalleled experience to those back home. I pray that \nthe good work of these and other Peace Corps volunteers will raise \nawareness and that others will be called to follow their good example.\n  For the record, I would like to submit the names of the 36 Arkansans \ncurrently serving in the Peace Corps. They are John Armstrong, Amanda \nBarker, Anthony Barnum, Melanie Berman, Susan Boswell Pierce, Robert \nBryant, Allyson Carr, Adam Carson, Garrard Conley, Erin Gibbs, Jared \nGillis, Laurel Gladish, Allison Green, Rebecca Hedges, Cameron \nHighsmith, Brian Hilburn, Joseph Hill, James Hollins, Jenny Hurst, \nJulia Jones, Adelia Kittrell, Nicholas Klinger, Theodis Lever, Tara \nLoftis, Stanley Luker, Jennifer Lusk, Daniel McGinley, Joshua Mosley, \nDanielle Rinke, Mary Rinnert, Rebecca Robinson, Deborah Romes, Christin \nSpradley, Kristen Straw, Jackson Taylor, Nikolette Williams. I thank \nthem all for their devoted service to their country and steadfast \ndedication to improving the lives of the disadvantaged.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1116-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                      REMEMBERING DEAMONTE DRIVER\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to mark \nthe 1-year anniversary of Deamonte Driver's death.\n  Deamonte was a 12-year-old from Prince George's County, MD. He died \nat Children's Hospital here in Washington as the result of a brain \ninfection brought on by an untreated tooth abscess.\n  The Driver family, like many other families across the country, \nlacked dental insurance. At one point his family had Medicaid coverage, \nbut they lost it because they had moved into a temporary shelter and \ntheir paperwork fell through the cracks. When advocates for the family \ntried to help, it took more than 20 calls just to find a dentist who \nwould treat him.\n  Deamonte began to complain about a headache on January 11. But an \nevaluation at Children's Hospital led beyond basic dental care to \nemergency brain surgery. He later experienced seizures, and he then \nrequired a second operation.\n  Even though he received additional treatment and therapy, and he \nappeared to be recovering, medical intervention had come too late. \nDeamonte passed away on Sunday, February 25, 2007.\n  At the end, the total cost of his treatment exceeded a quarter of a \nmillion dollars--more than three thousand times the $80 it would have \ncost for a tooth extraction.\n  When his case was brought to light, I believe that it served as a \nwake-up call for our Nation. Many of my colleagues also came to the \nSenate floor to speak about the lessons of this case. Senators \nBingaman, Collins, Snowe, and Sanders, and many others, have been \noutspoken about these issues for years, and I want to acknowledge and \nthank them for their efforts.\n  We talked about the realities of access to dental care in this \ncountry. Here are some basic facts:\n  According to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, dental \ndecay is the most common chronic childhood disease among children in \nthe United States. It affects one in five children aged 2 to 4, half of \nthose aged 6 to 8, and nearly three-fifths of 15-year-olds. Tooth decay \nis five times more common than asthma among school-age children. \nChildren living in poverty suffer twice as much tooth decay as middle- \nand upper-income children; 39 percent of Black children have untreated \ntooth decay in their permanent teeth; 11 percent of the Nation's rural \npopulation have never visited a dentist; and an estimated 25 million \npeople live in areas that lack adequate dental care services.\n  Today the Senate is moving toward completion of the Indian Health \nCare Amendments Act of 2007, a bill that I support. According to a \nstudy released this week in the Journal of the American Academy of \nPediatrics, of all groups in this country, Native American children had \nthe worst access to dental care, and double the odds of White children \nof having their dental needs unmet.\n  At the end of January, a survey from the Maryland Department of \nHealth and Mental Hygiene showed that fewer than one-third of Maryland \nkindergarten and third grade students have dental sealants. This report \nalso shows that a third of these students also have untreated dental \ndisease. These results correspond with the findings of a Dental Action \nCommittee that our Health Secretary convened last year.\n  As we move forward, I want to emphasize that this is not just about \ndental care. This is a question of whether we are truly committed to \nimproving the overall health of our children. Our former Surgeon \nGeneral C. Everett Koop, once said, ``There is no health without oral \nhealth.''\n  Medical researchers have discovered the important linkage between \nplaque and heart disease; that chewing stimulates brain cell growth; \nand that gum disease can signal diabetes, liver ailments and hormone \nimbalances. They have learned the vital connection between oral \nresearch and advanced treatments like gene therapy, which can help \npatients with chronic renal failure. They determined that a pregnant \nwoman who has periodontal disease can be as much as seven times more \nlikely to give birth to a premature or low-birthweight baby.\n  We heard the call to action in the 110th Congress, and demonstrated \nstrong support for efforts to improve dental care for children in our \nNation.\n  One year ago, I said that I hoped that Congress would include a \ndental guarantee in the CHIP reauthorization bill. We did that in a \nfiscally responsible way with bipartisan support. We also added \nprovisions to improve the availability of information about dental \ncoverage and participating dentists. But the President chose to veto \nthat bill. We will keep trying because we know how important these \nprovisions are to the overall health of our Nation's children.\n  We will also continue to work to increase funding for grants to \nStates and expand training opportunities for pediatric dentists. We do \nnot have enough professionals who are trained and available to treat \nchildren with dental problems, and it is a Federal responsibility to \nfix that. And we must improve public reimbursements to dental providers \nin offices and clinics so that no child who needs treatment will be \nturned away.\n  February is National Children's Dental Health Month. And so, this is \na sad anniversary, but it is also our opportunity to recommit ourselves \nto addressing one of the most pressing health care issues facing our \nchildren. It is our duty to do so. We will never forget Deamonte Driver \nand we will never forget our responsibility to improving dental care \nfor America's children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1116-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1116-S1117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN MEMORY OF OFFICER RANDAL SIMMONS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the city of Los Angeles and the \nnationwide law enforcement community has lost an exemplary leader. \nOfficer Randal Simmons, a 27-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police \nDepartment and 20-year member of the department's elite Special Weapons \nand Tactics Team, SWAT, is the first officer in the team's four-decade \nhistory to die in the line of duty. I would like to take a few moments \nto recognize Officer Randal Simmons' many important accomplishments and \nthe tremendous impact he made as a leader in both his personal and \nprofessional life.\n  Originally from New York City, Simmons' family moved to southern \nCalifornia early in his life. He graduated from Fairfax High School in \n1974 and then attended Washington State University where he studied \ncriminology\n\n[[Page S1117]]\n\nand was a member of the University's football team.\n  After college, Simmons returned to the city of Los Angeles and became \na member of the Los Angeles Police Department. During his career, \nSimmons served in many high-crime areas where he worked to not only \nprotect the local community but also to combat gang activity. His \ndedication to serving the residents of Los Angeles was well recognized \nwhen he earned the distinction of becoming a member of the department's \nelite SWAT Team.\n  Simmons was not only a leader to his fellow officers but also a \nhighly respected leader in his community. Serving as an ordained \nminister, he was an active member of his church and helped to build a \ncommunity gymnasium. He volunteered much of his time to lead a group \nministry that served nearly 1,500 children and also found time to serve \nas coach for his son's football team. His presence in the community \nwill truly be missed.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing and honoring \nOfficer Randal Simmons for his guidance and leadership in fighting to \nimprove the lives of all Angelinos. He is survived by his wife Lisa and \ntheir two children, to whom I send my heartfelt condolence. Officer \nSimmons leaves a lasting legacy of caring and compassion that serves as \na model to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1117-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING VADA SHEID\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the life \nand accomplishments of a great Arkansan, Mrs. Vada Webb Sheid. Mrs. \nSheid was a civil servant; she was an entrepreneur; she was an \ninspiration. After a long battle with Alzheimer's, Vada Sheid passed \naway on February 11, 2008, at the age of 91. She will be sorely missed.\n  Born and raised in rural Arkansas near Calico Rock in the north \ncentral part of the State, she became known as one of the Twin Lakes \narea's biggest movers and shakers. She came from a rare breed of \npoliticians, one marked with sincere intentions and a sense of duty. \nStarting as the Izard County Welfare Director at the young age of 19, \nher public service career stretched across five decades. Her love of \npublic service, the area, and the people of her area was apparent in \nher work.\n  She understood the needs of her constituents and committed her time \nand efforts to addressing them. From the time she was first elected in \n1966, she set out to replace the ferry system on Norfork Lake by \nbuilding bridges across it. After nearly 20 years of unwavering \npursuit, the Norfork Lake bridges were constructed, an act credited as \nher crowning achievement.\n  Education was another cornerstone of her tenure. As a supporter of \nthe Arkansas Freedom of Information Act, Mrs. Sheid donated her papers \nto the University of Arkansas Special Collections in 1989 so that they \nmay be shared and studied for generations to come. North Central \nArkansas did not have much to offer as a means of college education \nprior to the work of Vada. During her tenure, she introduced a measure \nthat established the North Arkansas Community College in Harrison and \nwas a key factor to the creation of the Arkansas State University at \nMountain Home.\n  Vada and my father, David Pryor, were dear friends and had a close \nrelationship during their many years of public service in Arkansas. I \nhad the privilege of serving with her in the Arkansas House of \nRepresentatives. She had this calming influence about her that led her \nto become a mentor to many of us. Given her reputation, she was trusted \nas a sounding board across the State on key issues and new ideas. There \nis not really a story I could tell about Vada Sheid to encompass the \nperson she was. Her story was filled with a lifetime of integrity and a \nsteadfast passion for public service.\n  Her accomplishments and passion for public service continue to be an \ninspiration to me. I recognize the value and impact of her work in \nArkansas, and during my time in the Senate, I have worked to secure \nFederal funding for the Vada Sheid Community Center on the Arkansas \nState University at Mountain Home campus. With the groundbreaking set \nfor April 11, I am committed, now more than ever, to working with \nstakeholders to complete this project as a tribute to Mrs. Sheid.\n  Arkansas has a rich heritage of powerful, groundbreaking women. Vada \nSheid's accomplishments place her in the ranks of historic greats like \nHattie Caraway, Judge Elsijane Trimble Roy, my dear colleague, Senator \nBlanche Lambert Lincoln, and my grandmother, Susie Newton Pryor. This \nwoman rose above the times and crossed milestones in so many of her \nendeavors. She was the first woman to be elected in her own right to \nthe Arkansas Senate, and the first woman to serve in both Chambers of \nthe Arkansas General Assembly.\n  My heart goes out to her family, friends, and Arkansans alike as we \nmourn this loss. Vada left Arkansas and the world a better place than \nwhen she found it and her legacy will continue to live on for \ngenerations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1117-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING THE LADY BULLDOGS\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President today I wish to honor the Madison \nHigh School gymnastics team for winning their 14th consecutive South \nDakota State Gymnastics title and breaking the national record for most \nconsecutive State gymnastics team titles. This is truly an impressive \naccomplishment, and I am proud to have such fine athletes representing \nthe State of South Dakota.\n  Last year, the Madison High School Bulldogs were tied with Sehome \nHigh School from Bellingham, WA, for most consecutive championship \nwins. However, as a result of their countless hours of hard work and \ndedication, the Bulldogs have shown to the Nation their outstanding \nathletic talent and determination by winning the 2008 State \nChampionship and clinching the national record.\n  Not only did the Lady Bulldogs top the national record for most \nconsecutive State wins, they also beat their State-best score from last \nyear. Madison had four of the top scores in the vault, the top three in \nthe balance beam, three of the top five in the uneven bars, and two of \nthe top three in the floor exercise. This is evidence of the team's \nability to perform well and work together in all of the categories of \nthe championship.\n  The Lady Bulldogs sealed their 14th win with a final score of 141.896 \npoints. I would like to congratulate all the young women who have \nworked so hard this year to win the State championship. The gymnasts of \nthe Lady Bulldogs for the 2007-2008 season, in alphabetical order, are \nas follows: Laura Blom, Danielle Bloom, Katie Breuer, Kassie Finck, \nLexi Finck, Theresa Knapp, Katie Mackenzie, Heidi Mogck, Mara Riedel, \nSara Rogers, Jessica Strom, Kaitlyn Walker, and Heather Williams.\n  This remarkable accomplishment would not have been possible without \nthe guidance and encouragement of the team's excellent coaching staff, \nhead coach Maridee Dossett and assistant coach Kindra Wiese. Coach \nDossett has been a Lady Bulldog since 1995, first as an athlete and now \nas a coach. She was part of the team when they won their first State \ntitle in 1995. Upon graduation, she has continued to contribute to the \nteam and spur them on to continued success.\n  Bud Postma, the athletic director of the Lady Bulldogs, said the \nstreak was a testament to past gymnasts and coaches at Madison. Linda \nCollignon was the coach who started the recordbreaking streak 14 years \nago. This national record was made possible by the dedication of the \ngymnasts and coaching staff of the Madison High School gymnastics team \nthroughout the years.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the support and devotion of the \nfamilies of the Madison Gymnastics team members and the community of \nMadison. Without the encouragement and sacrifice from the gymnasts' \nfamilies and the dedicated support of the Madison community, this \namazing accomplishment would not have been possible.\n  On behalf of the State of South Dakota, I am pleased to congratulate \nthe Lady Bulldogs Gymnastics team on their recordbreaking national \naccomplishment and wish them the best of luck for their continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1117-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1118-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1118]]\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1118-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore (Mr. Byrd) reported that he had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bills, which were previously signed by the Speaker \npro tempore (Mr. Hoyer) of the House:\n\n       H.R. 1216.

A bill to prohibit the transport of hydrolysate from the \nPueblo Chemical Depot, Colorado, to an off-site location; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services under authority of the order of the Senate \nof 02/14/2008.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will help us achieve swift and safe destruction of the chemical \nweapons stored at the Pueblo Chemical Depot in Colorado. Congressman \nJohn Salazar and Congressman Mark Udall are introducing similar \nlegislation today in the House.\n  The Pueblo Chemical Depot is home to 780,000 munitions filled with \nover 2,600 tons of liquid mustard agent--around 8.5 percent of the \noriginal U.S. chemical stockpile. The munitions sit in 96 high security \nigloos as they await disassembly and destruction.\n  The congressionally ratified Chemical Weapons Convention mandates \nthat these munitions be destroyed by 2012. Unfortunately, the \nDepartment of Defense is woefully behind in fulfilling its \nresponsibilities because it consistently underfunds a program that is \nessential to our national security and to the safety of nearby \ncommunities.\n  Every year we have to fight to put money back into the Assembled \nChemical Weapons Alternatives, ACWA, program, the authority that is \noverseeing the destruction operation at Pueblo and at the Blue Grass \nArmy Depot, in Kentucky. But, thanks to Congressional intervention, we \nhave succeeded in getting the program moving. Last year Congress \nallocated over $400 million for weapons destruction at the Pueblo \nChemical Depot and the Blue Grass Army Depot. I want to thank Chairman \nLevin and Ranking Member McCain of the Armed Services Committee, \nChairman Inouye and Ranking Member Stevens of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and Chairman Dorgan and Ranking Member \nHutchison of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \nAppropriations Subcommittee for all their help.\n  If you visit the Pueblo Chemical Depot today, you will see that \ncontractors have begun to lay the utilities and foundations for the \nprocessing facility that will treat the agent. And you will see that \nthey have begun construction of the biotreatment facility, which will \ntreat the hydrolysate that is the byproduct of the mustard \nneutralization process. It is a welcome sight to finally see earth \nmoving. In addition to the funding that Congress restored in fiscal \nyear 2008 for chemical weapons destruction, we also passed legislation \nto set a hard deadline of 2017 for the Department of Defense to \ncomplete all chemical weapons destruction activities.\n  It is no secret that DOD is going to miss the 2012 treaty deadline \nfor weapons destruction at Pueblo. That's what happens when you drag \nyour feet and fail to put adequate resources behind a program. But the \nlaw we passed last year says that even if they miss the 2012 deadline, \nthe Department of Defense shall complete work on the destruction of the \nentire stockpile of lethal chemical agents and munitions absolutely no \nlater than 2017. Every six months, the department has to report to \nCongress on the progress they are making, what resources are needed, \nand how much funding is programmed to fulfill this requirement.\n  For those of us who have been fighting this fight for the Pueblo \nsite, the hard deadline of 2017 is a dramatic improvement. At the pace \nthat we were moving under administration's funding projections last \nyear, destruction activities there were expected to be completed \nsometime in 2021. 2021.\n  This is absurd, especially with DOD's own admission that with higher \nfunding levels they could complete destruction at Pueblo a full five \nyears earlier than that.\n  I am proud that this 2017 deadline has been signed into law and I \nlook forward to working with the Department of Defense to ensure that \nthe U.S. Government meets this legal obligation.\n  Unfortunately, we still have more work to do to see that these \nchemical weapons are destroyed as swiftly and safely as possible. For \none thing, we will have to continue to hold DOD's feet to the fire to \nensure that they are devoting adequate resources to chemical weapons \ndestruction.\n  We will also have to work to help make the chemical weapons \ndestruction process proceed as smoothly, safely, and expeditiously as \npossible. This means watching to make sure that DOD does not get bogged \ndown in bureaucracy or red tape that could cause delays.\n  There is a real danger of this at the Pueblo Site, where the \nDepartment of Defense is yet again studying whether it should ship \nhydrolysate, a byproduct of neutralizing mustard agent, to an off-site \nlocation for destruction. Hydrolysate is a hazardous waste that must be \nsubjected to a biotreatment process to make it non-hazardous.\n  At Pueblo, they have already begun construction of an on site \nbiotreatment facility to neutralize the hydrolysate. This is great \nnews. It is the simplest solution and, according to two recent studies, \nthe fastest way to treat all the hydrolysate.\n  These two studies, completed in 2007, both concluded that shipping \nhydrolysate off-site would yield few, if any, cost-savings and would \nlikely result in litigation, strong public opposition, and potential \ndelays to chemical weapons destruction. An analysis conducted by \nMitretek found that ``a decision for off-site treatment will probably \nresult in litigation of the CD at Pueblo, resulting in extensive \ndelays. Every month of delay costs roughly $15-$16 million. Any delay \nover 6 months, regardless of cause, would be expected to erase all \npossible savings, even under the most optimistic assumptions.''\n\n[[Page S1125]]\n\n  The report by Lean Six Sigma concluded that off-site destruction \nwould actually cost more and could result in as much as a five-year \ndelay in chemical weapons destruction at Pueblo.\n  Given the conclusions of these recent studies on hydrolysate \ndestruction, I am perplexed that the Department is conducting yet \nanother study on the potential cost savings of hydrolysate destruction. \nIt is unclear to me what questions remain unanswered. These studies \nclearly show that shipping hydrolysate off-site raises risks of \npermitting delays or litigation. With a 2017 deadline to meet, the \nDepartment of Defense can't afford a permitting delay that sets the \nproject off course.\n  The bill I am introducing today is very simple. It prohibits the \nSecretary of Defense from shipping hydrolysate at the Pueblo Chemical \nDepot off-site for treatment. This will ensure that DOD can continue to \nproceed on its current path toward treating hydrolysate on-site. It \nwill help the U.S. Government meet its legal obligation to complete \nchemical weapons destruction by 2017. And it will provide some \ncertainty to the communities that have waited so long for these \nchemical weapons to be safely destroyed.\n  We need to put this potentially costly and dilatory issue behind us \nand proceed with the safe and swift destruction of our Nation's \nstockpile of chemical weapons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1125-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1125-S1142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 2658. A bill to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to \nextend from 90 days to one year the period after release of a member \nfrom the Armed Forces from active duty during which the member is \nprotected from mortgage foreclosure; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in the Congress and in Washington these \nlast years, there has been a tragic disconnect between the words spoken \nabout keeping faith with those who wear the uniform of our country, and \nthe actions actually taken to make those words count.\n  From the tragic conditions at Walter Reed to the backlog of claims at \nthe Veterans Administration, there has been a long list of problems \nunaddressed--and of problems that arose because someone, somewhere \ndidn't plan ahead to prevent problems for those who sacrifice for all \nof us.\n  Today we know from VA estimates that nearly 200,000 veterans are \nhomeless on any given night and that nearly 400,000 veterans experience \nhomelessness over the course of a year--a national disgrace to consider \nthat in the richest country on the planet perhaps one out of every \nthree homeless men sleeping in a doorway, alley or box once wore the \nuniform of our country.\n  We also know from the Bush administration's own U.S. Labor \nDepartment, that, for example, in 2006, the unemployment rate for young \nveterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was 15 percent, more than \ntriple the national average back then. We know that too many unemployed \nveterans are National Guard or Reserve troops who were called to duty \nbut found when they came home that their old jobs were gone, that \nthey'd lost their place in line in the local economy, or that the small \nbusinesses they'd left behind to serve overseas were in dire straits \nwhen they came home.\n  We know these two challenges--the homeless rates for veterans and the \nunemployment numbers for veterans--demand big solutions, and we are \nworking to provide them.\n  But we should also know by now that the least we can do is stop these \nproblems from becoming worse. We have seen a wave of foreclosures send \na ripple effect across the economy. By late 2007, 2.5 million mortgages \nwere in default--a 40 percent increase from just 2 years earlier. Last \nmonth, foreclosures in Massachusetts alone were up 128 percent from the \nprevious January. In fact, in 2007 alone 1.6 million Americans \ndefaulted on their home loans, and as many as 3.5 million more are \nexpected to do the same by mid-2010.\n  Every U.S. Senator would agree that the thought of our men and women \nin uniform being thrown out of their homes because of mortgage \nforeclosures is miles beyond unacceptable. The question is, in the \nmiddle of a national housing crisis and a subprime mortgage collapse, \nwhat can be done--done at a minimum--to ensure that Washington acts to \nshield veterans from becoming the faces of the foreclosure crisis, and \nfrom making today's Iraq and Afghanistan veterans the faces of \ntomorrows' homeless and jobless populations.\n  We know that the soaring and staggering foreclosure statistics are \ndirectly affecting Americans from all walks of life, and our military \nis not exempt from the pain. The least we can do today is make it clear \nthat we will pay some small measure of respect to veterans by helping \nthem avoid foreclosure. They need more time and greater flexibility as \nthey return to civilian life. The Commission on the National Guard and \nReserves has urged us to take preventative action. The Commission found \nthat the transition from military to civilian life extends well beyond \nthe current timelines which forces many service members to focus their \nattention on imminent foreclosure instead of first locating a \ncompetitive job or addressing any mental or physical health concerns \nthat they may be facing.\n\n  That is why today I am introducing commonsense legislation that would \nprotect servicemembers and veterans involved in the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan by securing a longer grace period for payment. My bill \nwould extend the time from 90 days to 1 year the time period that a \nservicemember is protected from foreclosure. By extending the deadline \nto 1 year, I hope we can take one small step to prevent future \nhomelessness throughout the veteran's community.\n  If America's leaders truly support our troops, we owe them more than \na polite thank you and best wishes. We owe them action. We cannot \ntolerate a pattern in Washington that has persisted for too long--\nprovide lip service about supporting the troops but not the lifesaving \nbody armor they need; talk a good game about veterans but cut funding \nfor their healthcare. It is wrong, and it is time for it to end. We \nshould act now to ensure that those saddled with the burden of the \nmortgage crisis are not those who have carried the greatest \nresponsibility for America overseas in the fight for freedom. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2658\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to ensure that the \nmission and functions of Regional Transmission Organizations and \nIndependent System Operators include keeping energy costs as low as \nreasonably possible for consumers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nhelp protect consumers from high electricity prices that have followed \nderegulation of electricity markets. I am honored to have many of my \ncolleagues joining me in offering this legislation--Senator Snowe, \nSenator Kerry, Senator Collins, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Leahy.\n  Market pricing of electricity promised to bring lower costs to \nconsumers. Unfortunately, consumers in organized market regions--those \nthat have a Regional Transmission Organization or\n\n[[Page S1126]]\n\nIndependent System Operator, RTOs or ISOs as they are called--are \nexperiencing just the opposite: substantial, across-the-board problems \nwith spiraling costs, unaccountable governance, and a chronic lack of \noversight. Increasingly, RTOs/ISOs are adopting questionable, unproven, \nand expensive market mechanisms, and there seems to be little interest \nat the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, or the RTOs/ISOs to \nquestion any of the economic theories behind these mechanisms. I note \nthat on February 21, 2008, FERC finally took a step toward \nacknowledging that the markets are not working by issuing a proposed \nrule that would address some concerns. I believe, however, that the \nlegislation I am introducing today will focus FERC on consumer issues, \nwhich were not adequately addressed in the proposed rule.\n  The goal of lowering costs to consumers has been lost in the race to \ncreate competitive electricity markets. In fact, something as simple as \nkeeping costs to consumers as low as reasonably possible is not even \npart of the mandate, or mission statement, of any of the Nation's ISOs \nor RTOs! In New England, we have seen what can happen--there have been \nseveral instances in which ISO-New England has implemented expensive \nmarket mechanisms, over the objection of significant segments of \nelectric stakeholders, without either conducting a cost-benefit \nanalysis or comparing the costs of the proposed initiative with \nalternative means of achieving the desired results.\n  Showing the strong interest in this issue in the New England region, \nthe legislation is supported by the Northeast Public Power Association, \nthe Vermont Public Power Supply Authority, the Burlington Electric \nDepartment, Kennebunk Light & Power District, the Massachusetts \nMunicipal Wholesale Electric Company, Connecticut Municipal Electric \nEnergy Cooperative, the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel, and the \nPascoag Utility District. The Ohio Consumers' Counsel, the Maryland \nOffice of People's Counsel, Electricity Consumers Resource Council, and \nthe Utility Consumers' Action Network support the legislation as well.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would refocus FERC on the \nconsumer cost impacts of RTO/ISO actions. Consistent with existing law, \nthe bill makes explicit that, when FERC considers the lawfulness of \nRTO/ISO rates, it must assess whether those rates will ensure that \nconsumer costs are as low as reasonably possible consistent with the \nprovision of reliable service. Also, in recognition of the uniquely \nimportant roles played by RTOs and ISOs, this bill requires FERC to \nmake both goals--cost minimization and reliability--a part of each RTO \nor ISO's mission. These changes clarify and amplify existing law as \napplied to these important organizations, but do not alter, diminish, \nor imply an absence of similar requirements with respect to other \npublic utilities regulated by FERC.\n  I believe these simple, commonsense issues, when posed by FERC to an \nRTO/ISO that is seeking approval for a rate, charge, or rule, will \ninstill a much stronger sense of cost accountability. The bottom line, \nas I see it, is that this simple bill will likely yield substantial \nbenefits for consumers and for many regional economies.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in pushing for adoption of the \nConsumer Protection and Cost Accountability Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2660\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer Protection and Cost \n     Accountability Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to prohibit the collection of identifying information \non individuals by false, fraudulent, or deceptive means through the \nInternet, a practice known as ``phishing'', to provide the Federal \nTrade Commission the necessary authority to enforce such prohibition, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nfocuses on eliminating online fraud and identity theft that is \nfacilitated through the use of phishing schemes, as well as deceptive \nand misleading domain names. Phishing is a method of online identity \ntheft that takes the form of fraudulent e-mails or fake Web sites in \norder to deceive the recipient into giving personal or financial \naccount information. In addition to victimizing unsuspecting consumers, \nphishing scams maliciously exploit the trust that legitimate businesses \nhave worked so hard to establish with consumers.\n  The Anti-Phishing Consumer Protection Act of 2008 would prohibit the \npractice of phishing--the deceptive solicitation of a consumer's \npersonal information through the use of e-mails, instant messages, and \nmisleading Web sites that trick recipients into divulging their \ninformation to identity thieves. The legislation would also prohibit \nrelated abuses, such as the practice of using fraudulent or misleading \ndomain names, by defining them as deceptive practices under the FTC \nAct.\n  Additionally, the legislation seeks to solidify the integrity of \ndomain name registration, a longtime goal for the Federal Trade \nCommission, by making it illegal for a domain name registrant to \nprovide false or misleading identifying contact information in a WHOIS \ndatabase when registering a domain name. Too often law enforcement \nofficials have been hindered in their pursuit of phishers and other \nonline scams\n\n[[Page S1127]]\n\nbecause the person responsible is hiding behind the anonymity of false \nregistration information--this legislation would put an end to that \npractice by requiring accurate registration information about those \nthat own Web sites and domain names that are used to harm consumers.\n  The reason it is imperative to address this through legislation is \nbecause online fraud and, more specifically, phishing scams are running \nrampant. A December 2007 New York Times article reported that more than \n3.5 million Americans lost money to phishing schemes and online \nidentity theft over a 12-month period ending in August 2007--this is a \n57-percent increase over the previous year. The total amount lost by \nthe victims, $3.2 billion dollars. The Anti-Phishing Working Group \nfound, in November 2007, that 178 corporate identities and brands were \nhijacked and used for phishing scams, which is the highest number ever \nreported. All of these figures are very disconcerting and will only \nincrease if we don't put greater effort on curtailing this online \nfraud.\n  Phishing and other forms of identity theft continue to have a \ndetrimental effect on e-commerce by eroding consumers' confidence in \nonline transactions. According to a 2007 Javelin Strategy & Research \nstudy, 80 percent of Internet users are concerned about being victims \nof online identity theft. What is more, a 2006 Zogby Interactive poll \nfound that 78 percent of small business owners polled stated that a \nless reliable Internet would damage their business. While consumer \nconfidence is critical in any commerce activity, it is paramount for \nonline transactions. Phishing and other online fraud activities \ndirectly undermine that vital trust.\n  Phishing schemes aren't just isolated to individuals and e-commerce. \nCompanies, organizations, and government agencies are also targets. A \nform of phishing known as spear phishing targets these entities to gain \nunauthorized access to the organization's computer system in order to \nsteal financial information, trade secrets, or even top-secret military \ninformation. The security risks that phishing poses in the world of \ncyberterrorism is very significant.\n  But one doesn't have to look to some distant country to find the \norigin of traditional phishing schemes. The United States only until \nrecently was consistently the top country that hosted the most phishing \nWeb sites. While China now holds that claim, the United States is a \nvery close second--hosting approximately 24 percent of phishing Web \nsites. So we can definitively do more within our borders to make the \nInternet notably safer.\n  Since President Bush signed the stimulus package into law earlier \nthis month, millions of Americans will be expecting to receive tax \nrebate checks this May. But before those checks arrive, taxpayers \nshould also expect to be targets of numerous phishing schemes between \nnow and then. Many of these scams involve official-looking e-mail \nmessages that try to trick the recipient into entering their personal \ninformation at a fake IRS Web site by stating in the e-mail that they \nare eligible for a refund check. This is not the first time the IRS \nidentity has been misused for phishing scams, and it will continue if \nwe don't do more to go after phishers.\n  And this is what the Anti-Phishing Consumer Protection Act of 2008 \ndoes. It looks to make the Internet safer and more reliable. It also \nfacilitates the restoration of trust and consumer confidence that has \nbeen eroded by the prevalence of deceptive e-mails and Web sites, which \nhas, in part, mired the Internet from achieving its full potential. \nThat is why I sincerely hope that my colleagues join Senators Bill \nNelson, Stevens, and me in supporting the critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Gregg) (by request):\n  S. 2662. a bill to respond to a Medicare funding warning; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n   Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, under a provision of the 2003 Medicare \nbill, the Medicare trustees are required to determine the point at \nwhich general revenues will finance at least 45 percent of Medicare's \ntotal outlays. If for 2 consecutive years, the trustees predict that \nthis 45 percent threshold will be exceeded in the next 6 years, they \nare required to issue a ``Medicare Funding Warning,'' which they did \nlast April. As a result, the law requires the President to submit and \nCongress to receive a legislative proposal to reduce general revenues \nas a share of total Medicare spending.\n   The President has now submitted proposed legislation to Congress in \nresponse to the funding warning, and I am therefore required to \nintroduce the President's proposal. So today, Senator Gregg and I will \nintroduce a bill to respond to a Medicare funding warning. But I do so \nwhile emphasizing that the President's proposal, contained in this very \nbill, is not the answer to the Medicare program's problems.\n   Everyone agrees that Medicare faces a serious long-term financing \nproblem that must be addressed. But the challenge facing Medicare is \nnot what share of its funding comes from general revenues--the problem \nis rising health care costs in the health care system as a whole. \nMedicare's costs are increasing because costs throughout the health \ncare system are skyrocketing. Addressing the causes of these system-\nwide costs will be the key to addressing Medicare's long-term \nfinancing.\n   With health care costs increasing much faster than wages and \ninflation, Congress must find ways to control these rising costs in \norder to ensure the long-term financial viability of the Medicare \nprogram. We must also address current Medicare policies--such as \noverpayments in the Medicare Advantage program--that exacerbate the \nproblem.\n   While I am statutorily required to introduce the President's \nMedicare bill at this time, I still fully intend to pursue real \nMedicare reform legislation in the coming weeks. That bill will \nincrease access to preventive benefits and primary care, and will \nimprove the quality of care delivered under the program. I will also \nseek to help low-income seniors with the costs of rising Medicare \npremiums, and to offer timely, appropriate improvements for the \nprescription drug benefit.\n   Beyond advancing a more realistic Medicare reform bill this year, I \nalso intend for the Finance Committee to launch an aggressive look at \ncomprehensive health care reform. Working together, my colleagues and I \nwill examine the underlying causes of rising health care costs in the \nentire health care system and explore solutions that can be the \nfoundation for system-wide reform--the only way truly to control costs \nin the Medicare program.\n   I am required by law to introduce the White House's legislation on \nMedicare today, but I am compelled by my commitment to America's \nseniors to insist on better solutions. Where the President's bill \ncobbles together ill-conceived or premature proposals to check the box \non curbing Medicare costs, I intend for the Senate to consider a \ncarefully crafted, thoughtful package of real improvements to the \nMedicare program overall--and to spend the rest of this year preparing \nfor a time when real health reform is within our grasp. Working \ntogether, we can do better by America's seniors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRYOR (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Inouye, Ms. Collins, \n        Mr. Nelson of Florida, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 2663.

BAN ON CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS CONTAINING LEAD; LEAD \n                   PAINT RULE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Beginning on the date that is 1 year after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, any children's product (as \n     defined in section 14(e) of the Consumer Product Safety Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 2063(e))) that contains lead shall be treated as a \n     banned hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous \n     Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 et seq.).\n       (b) Trace Amounts of Lead.--\n       (1) Initial standard.--For purposes of subsection (a), a \n     children's product shall be considered to contain lead if any \n     part of the product contains lead or lead compounds and the \n     lead content of such part (calculated as lead metal) is \n     greater than 0.03 percent by weight of the total weight of \n     such part (or such lesser amount as may be established by the \n     Commission by regulation).\n       (2) Reduced threshold.--\n       (A) In general.--Beginning on the date that is 3 years \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, paragraph (1) shall \n     be applied by substituting ``0.01 percent'' for ``0.03 \n     percent'' unless the Consumer Product Safety Commission \n     determines that a standard of 0.01 percent is not \n     technologically feasible. The Commission may make such a \n     determination only after notice and a hearing and after \n     analyzing the public health protections associated with \n     substantially reducing lead in children's products.\n       (B) Alternative reduction.--If the Commission determines \n     under subparagraph (A) that the 0.01 percent standard is not \n     technologically feasible, the Commission shall, by \n     regulation, establish a lesser amount that is the lowest \n     amount of lead, lower than 0.03 percent by weight, the \n     Commission determines to be technologically feasible to \n     achieve. The amount of lead established by the Commission \n     under the preceding sentence shall be substituted for the \n     0.03 percent standard under paragraph (1) beginning on the \n     date that is 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Exceptions.--\n       (1) Inaccessible components.--After notice and a hearing, \n     the Commission may determine that subsection (a) does not \n     apply to a component of a children's product that is not \n     accessible to a child because it is not physically exposed by \n     reason of a sealed covering or casing and will not become \n     physically exposed through normal and reasonably foreseeable \n     use and abuse of the product. In making its determination \n     under this paragraph, the Commission may not consider paint, \n     coatings, or electroplating to be a barrier that would render \n     lead in the substrate inaccessible to a child through normal \n     and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.\n       (2) Electronics.--If the Commission determines that it is \n     not feasible for certain electronic devices, including \n     batteries, to comply with subsection (a) at the time the \n     regulations take effect, the Commission shall, by \n     regulation--\n       (A) issue standards to reduce the exposure of and \n     accessibility to lead in such electronic devices; and\n       (B) establish a schedule by which such electronic devices \n     shall be in full compliance with the regulations prescribed \n     under subsection (a).\n       (d) Regulations.--Notwithstanding the provisions of \n     subsection (b), the Commission may by regulation establish \n     such lower thresholds for lead content in children's products \n     than those set forth in subsection (b) as the Commission \n     finds to be technologically feasible.\n       (e) Paint Standard for All Products.--Effective on the date \n     that is 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Consumer Product Safety Commission shall modify section \n     1303.1 of its regulations (16 C.F.R. 1303.1) by substituting \n     ``0.009 percent'' for ``0.06 percent'' in subsection (a) of \n     that section.\n       (f) Application With ASTM F963.--To the extent that any \n     standard or rule promulgated by the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission under this section (or any section of the Consumer \n     Product Safety Act or any other Act enforced by the \n     Commission, as such Acts are affected by this section) is \n     inconsistent with the ASTM F963 standard, such promulgated \n     standard or rule shall supersede the ASTM F963 standard to \n     the extent of the inconsistency.\n\n     SEC. 23. ALTERNATIVE MEASURES OF LEAD CONTENT.\n\n       The Consumer Product Safety Commission, in cooperation with \n     the National Academy of Sciences and the National Institute \n     of Standards and Technology, shall study the feasibility of \n     establishing a measurement standard based on a units-of-mass-\n     per-area standard (similar to existing measurement standards \n     used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and \n     the Environmental Protection Agency to measure for metals in \n     household paint and soil, respectively) that is statistically \n     comparable to the parts-per-million measurement standard \n     currently used in laboratory analysis.\n\n     SEC. 24. STUDY OF PREVENTABLE INJURIES AND DEATHS OF MINORITY \n                   CHILDREN RELATED TO CERTAIN CONSUMER PRODUCTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Within 90 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, the Government Accountability Office shall \n     initiate a study to assess disparities in the risks and \n     incidence of preventable injuries and deaths among children \n     of minority populations, including Black, Hispanic, American \n     Indian, Alaskan Native, and Asian/Pacific Islander children \n     in the United States.\n       (b) Requirements.--The study shall examine the racial \n     disparities of the rates of preventable injuries and deaths \n     related to suffocation, poisonings, and drowning including \n     those associated with the use of cribs, mattresses and \n     bedding materials, swimming pools and spas, and toys and \n     other products intended for use by children.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Commission shall report its \n     findings to the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     Committee and the House of Representatives Energy and \n     Commerce Committee. The report shall include--\n       (1) the Commission's findings on the incidence of \n     preventable risks of injury and death among children of \n     minority populations and recommendations for minimizing such \n     increased risks;\n       (2) recommendations for public outreach, awareness, and \n     prevention campaigns specifically aimed at racial minority \n     populations; and\n       (3) recommendations for education initiatives that may \n     reduce current statistical disparities.\n       (d) Authorization.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     to the Commission $500,000 for purposes of carrying out this \n     section for fiscal year 2009.\n\n     SEC. 25.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage investment in affordable housing, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n   Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the issues of housing are very much on \nthe minds of the American people and those of us in Congress. While we \nfocus on the challenges that homeowners currently are facing, we must \nnot fail to recognize that there are a lot of families that dare not \ndream of owning their own home; they dream simply of having access to \nsafe, affordable rental housing in our communities.\n   Today, I am pleased to introduce the Affordable Housing Investment \nAct, a bill that will update and modernize the low-income housing tax \ncredit program--a program that we all know has been tremendously \nsuccessful in helping construct needed affordable housing in \ncommunities across our country.\n   We often find ourselves reacting to Government programs that are \nbroken; this bill is about a Government program that works but can be \nimproved upon. The low-income housing tax credit program was created as \npart of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and made permanent in 1993. Designed \nas a public/private funding partnership, largely administered by the \nStates, this program has become the most successful housing production \nprogram in existence.\n   These tax credits make it attractive for investors to forego highly \nprofitable luxury residences, in order to provide housing for those \nmost in need. Without affordable housing, many low-income Americans \nwould find themselves on the street. Instead, these families can \nprovide shelter to their children and have a secure place to live near \nwhere they work and go to school.\n   State agencies award housing tax credits to housing developers, who \nturn the credits into construction funds by selling them to investors. \nThere funds allow developers to borrow less money and pass through the \nsavings in lower rental rates for low-income tenants. Investors, in \nturn, receive a 10-year tax credit based on the cost of constructing or \nrehabilitating apartments that cannot be rented to anyone whose median \nincome is higher than 60 percent of the median income in the area.\n   Each State's annual housing credit allocation is capped. In 2007, \nthe cap is $1.95 per capita, with a minimum of $2.275 million. States \nput each development through three separate, rigorous evaluations to \nmake sure it receives only enough housing credits to make it viable as \nlow-income housing for the long term.\n   Since its inception, this program has created nearly 2 million homes \nfor low-income families at restricted rents for terms of at least 30 \nyears--housing that would not have occurred without the tax credit.\n   The credit is responsive to the needs of local communities. It works \nfor new construction, rehabilitation, and preservation of affordable \nhousing. It works in cities, suburbs, and rural areas. It revitalizes \nlow-income communities. It serves families, the elderly, the disabled, \nand the homeless. Each State sets its own housing priorities, and \ndevelopers compete aggressively to meet these priorities.\n   The program is cost efficient and has a high compliance rate. The \nmarketplace imposes discipline on the program so that taxpayers' \ndollars are well-spent. Investors receive their tax credits only if \nhousing is built on time and on budget, operates successfully within \nlocal housing markets, and is well maintained over time. The annual \nfailure rate for housing credit properties is 0.02 percent annually, \nwell below that for other housing or commercial real estate.\n   As successful as the housing tax credit program is, it could benefit \nsignificantly from updating.\n   The Affordable Housing Investment Act of 2008, which I am \nintroducing with Senators Smith, Kerry, Coleman and Salazar, modernizes \nthe tax credit rules in order to make it even more useful.\n   First, it eliminates the penalties for combining housing credits \nwith other Federal housing programs. The bill proposes to remove \nvarious restrictions that make it hard to coordinate housing credits \nwith other Federal policies and programs. These restrictions frustrate \nefforts to address local needs and add unnecessary legal and accounting \ncosts. In some cases, these restrictions were set many years ago to \nprevent properties from receiving excessive subsidies. Such \nrestrictions are no longer needed because States examine each project \nat three points to ensure that it needs the amount of housing credits \nallocated to it. In addition, the high demand for housing credits and \nother subsidies motivates all subsidy providers to limit subsidies to \nthe minimum amount necessary.\n   Second, the bill helps foster low-income community revitalization by \nfacilitating the construction of child care, primary health care, \nrecreation and other community service facilities and aiding with the \nspecific needs for housing in rural areas.\n   Third, the bill preserves existing affordable housing by easing \nrestrictions on rehabilitation of older properties.\n   Finally, the bill eliminates unneeded inefficiencies in the tax laws \nthat serve no public policy purpose.\n   The legislation has been endorsed by the National Council of State \nHousing Agencies, the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Coalition, the \nHousing Development Consortium, Local Initiatives Support Corporation \nand Impact Capital, National Association of State and Local Equity \nFunds, Seattle Housing Authority, and the Washington State Housing \nFinance Commission.\n   The tax credit program may be invisible to the people that now have \na roof over their head, but it is indispensable to our ability to meet \nthe growing demand--and diminishing supply--for affordable housing.\n   For example, Port Orchard Vista--a 42-unit apartment building for \nlow-income seniors--would not have been built without the tax credit \nprogram. One resident, a 62-year-old grandmother named Jackie, would be \nhomeless if this project had not been built. Jackie's Social Security \ncheck is $600 per month. Her rent was $605, not including utilities--or \ngroceries! She was selling her furniture and her mom's old\n\n[[Page S1140]]\n\ncookbooks to make up the difference. She was just a few months away \nfrom being homeless.\n   Thanks to the tax credits, the Kitsap County Consolidated Housing \nAuthority was able to get this project built and keep Jackie off the \nstreet. Today, Jackie's rent is $200--including utilities.\n   The Village at Overlake Station in Redmond, Washington, was built in \n2001 and offers beautiful public spaces and apartment homes. Sarah, a \nsingle mother, came to Overlake Station in late 2005 after spending \nthat summer and fall living out of her vehicle with her two children. \nShe was extremely grateful to find a suitable, affordable apartment \nbefore the cold weather came. She and her children were forced to \nhuddle together in the backseat of her car to stay warm as they slept \nand she was concerned about their safety. Though she tried to be \ncautious, she just knew she should find a better way to take care of \nher children.\n   Sarah and her children have proudly lived at Overlake for 2 years. \nSoon they will move into a new house, thanks to Habitat for Humanity. \nIn two years, Sarah has gone from homelessness to homeownership--thanks \nto the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program.\n   These stories can be replicated in every community in my State and \nacross the country.\n   In 2002, the Millennial Housing Commission said in its final report \nto the Congress:\n\n        Securing access to decent, affordable housing is \n     fundamental to the American Dream. All Americans want to live \n     in good-quality homes they can afford without sacrificing \n     other basic needs. All Americans want to live in safe \n     communities with ready access to job opportunities, good \n     schools, and amenities. All parents want their children to \n     grow up with positive role models and peer influences nearby. \n     And the overwhelming majority of Americans want to purchase a \n     home as a way to build wealth.\n\n   By leveraging private capital to build affordable housing units, we \nare also helping our local communities. People left with no affordable \nhousing options join the ranks of the homeless and then become the \nresponsibility of our cash-strapped communities. We can alleviate some \nof the community responsibilities of caring for the homeless, the \ndisabled, and other vulnerable low-income families by helping to \nprovide these people an affordable place to call home. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2666\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nexpressing the strong support of the Senate for the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization to extend invitations for membership to Albania, \nCroatia, and Macedonia at the April 2008 Bucharest Summit.\n  The goal of this legislation is to reaffirm United States support for \ncontinued enlargement of NATO to democracies that are able and willing \nto meet the responsibilities of membership. In addition, it represents \na call to the administration to provide leadership at the upcoming \nsummit to secure this important step in the development of the NATO \nAlliance. Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia have clearly stated their \ndesire to join NATO and are working hard to meet the specified \nrequirements for membership.\n  The Governments in Tirana, Zagreb, and Skopje have been preparing for \nNATO membership for more then 8 years. Each of them is undergoing a \nhistoric process of democratic and free market transformation after \nemerging from decades of occupation. They have made important progress \nin establishing civilian control of their militaries and demonstrating \ntheir ability to operate with the military forces of NATO nations at \nalliance standards. Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia continue to make \nimportant contributions to the United Nations-mandated International \nSecurity Assistance Force, ISAF, operating under NATO leadership to \nassist the Government of Afghanistan in extending and exercising its \nauthority and influence across the country and creating the conditions \nfor stabilization and reconstruction. In addition the three candidates \nhave made\n\n[[Page S1144]]\n\nimportant improvements in their democratic processes; toleration of \nethnic diversity; respect for human rights; building a free market \neconomy; and promotion of good neighborly relations.\n  On February 18, 2008, the United States and many of our European \nallies diplomatically recognized the independence of Kosovo. This was \nan important step in putting the bloody history of the Balkans in the \npast, but our work there is not done. The United States and our allies \nmust support the integration of Kosovo into international and Euro-\nAtlantic institutions. We must also be prepared to work closely with \nSerbia and assist with their goals of joining the European Union and \nengaging European institutions. In my view, lasting stability and \nsecurity in southeastern Europe requires the military, economic, and \npolitical integration of emerging democracies into existing European \nstructures.\n  Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia can play important roles in NATO \nefforts in Southeastern Europe. These three countries occupy critical \ngeostrategic locations and are best situated to deter and disrupt any \nefforts by any party to destabilize the region through violence. NATO \nmembership for these countries would be a success for Europe, NATO, and \nthe United States by continuing to extend the zone of peace and \nsecurity into a region that produced a world war and numerous regional \nconflicts that have cost the lives of hundreds of thousands, including \nAmericans.\n  Bruce Jackson, president of the Project on Transitional Democracies, \nwrote in the Washington Post on February 4 that ``the transatlantic \nallies face two critical questions when they gather for their summit in \nBucharest in April. The first is whether to invite Albania, Croatia and \nMacedonia to join NATO, a decision that is the culmination of a 15-year \neffort to end the wars that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia.'' Mr. \nJackson points out that ``critics say that Albania, Croatia and \nMacedonia are not ready for NATO membership . . . But the fact is that \nAlbania, Croatia and Macedonia have spent more than eight years in \nrigorous preparation for NATO membership.''\n  Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia are not perfect, and there is more \neach of them needs to do economically and politically. Nevertheless, \nall three countries bring important backgrounds to the table: ``Croatia \nhas the most impressive economic performance, and real estate prices, \nof any country in southern Europe. In recent years, Albania has \ncontributed more soldiers to missions in Iraq, Afghanistan and \ninternational peacekeeping than most NATO allies. And since the end of \nthe Balkan wars in 1999, Macedonia has covered more ground in building \nan integrated, multi-ethnic society in a short time than any other \nEuropean nation. We now have a chance to bring Catholic Croatia, \nsecular-Islamic Albania and multi-ethnic, Orthodox Macedonia into the \nEuro-Atlantic community of democracies. Not bad.''\n  Mr. Jackson concludes by asking an important question. ``Imagine if \n[the Alliance] had waited until Greece and Turkey had completed their \ninternal debates before inviting them to join NATO. Any further delay \non the candidacies of Albania, Croatia and Macedonia will diminish \nregional stability just as Kosovo begins its extended period of \nsupervised independence, and will confuse and undercut the European \nUnion as it takes over chief security responsibilities from the United \nStates and NATO throughout the region. An inability to close this \nchapter in the Balkans would also dangerously slow our engagement with \nEurope's East.''\n  Now is the time for NATO to invite these three important Balkan \nleaders to join the alliance. If NATO is to continue to be the \npreeminent security alliance and serve the defense interests of its \nmembership, it must continue to evolve and that evolution must include \nenlargement. Potential NATO membership motivates emerging democracies \nto make important advances in areas such as the rule of law and civil \nsociety. A closer relationship with NATO will promote these values in \nAlbania, Croatia, and Macedonia and contribute to our mutual security.\n  Five years ago, the U.S. Senate unanimously voted to invite seven \ncountries to join NATO. Today, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \nRomania, Slovakia, and Slovenia are making significant contributions to \nNATO and are among our closest allies in the global war on terrorism. \nIt is time again for the United States to take the lead in urging its \nallies to bring in new members and to offer timely admission of \nAlbania, Croatia, and Macedonia to NATO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1144-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 460--TO AUTHORIZE REPRESENTATION BY THE SENATE LEGAL \nCOUNSEL IN THE CASE OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS V.

Mr. President, there are three bills at the desk, and I ask \nfor their first reading en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bills by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2663) to reform the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission to provide greater protection for children's \n     products, to improve the effectiveness of consumer product \n     recall programs, and for other purposes.\n       A bill (S. 2664) to extend the provisions of the Protect \n     America Act of 2007.\n       A bill (S. 2665) to extend the provisions of the Protect \n     America Act of 2007 until July 1, 2009.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now ask for the second reading en bloc and \nobject to my own request en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say that S. 2663 is a bipartisan \npiece of legislation, the Consumer Product Safety Act. We have been \nworking for months to get this going. It is my understanding now that \nSenators Pryor and Stevens asked that this matter move forward.\n  The other matter related to the FISA bill, we are trying to work \nsomething out with the House, and hopefully we can get something done \non that soon.\n  Mr. President, tonight I am introducing and beginning the rule XIV \nprocess on two bills related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct. One bill would extend the Protect America Act, the PAA, for 30 \ndays, while the other would extend that law until July 1, 2009.\n  Earlier this year I introduced S. 2556 which would have extended the \nPAA for 30 days, and S. 2257, which would have extended the PAA until \nJuly 1, 2009. The bills I am introducing tonight would extend the PAA \nfor the same periods of time, but they are drafted to take account of \nthe fact that the PAA has expired. In addition, they contain a post hoc \neffective date that is intended to eliminate any potentially adverse \nlegal effect resulting from the expiration of the PAA.\n  My purpose in introducing bills with two different extension lengths \nis to demonstrate once again that I am willing to extend the PAA for as \nlong a time, or as short a time, as is needed to finalize a strong \nfinal bill.\n  Now that the House and Senate have both passed bills--H.R. 3773 and \nS. 2248--to strengthen the PAA, the right way to get to a final bill is \nthrough bipartisan negotiations. Unfortunately, my Republican friends \nappear unwilling to negotiate. We convened two negotiating sessions \nlast week, but Republican staff members and administration lawyers \ndeclined to attend.\n  Meanwhile, President Bush says that the expiration of the Protect \nAmerica Act has made America less safe, but he threatened to veto a \nbill extending that law while negotiators work on a final bill. The \nPresident's position is inexplicable and reckless.\n  The bottom line for Senate Democrats is clear: We want to give our \nintelligence professionals all needed tools while protecting the \nprivacy of law-abiding Americans. We are willing to extend the Protect \nAmerica Act for as long as it takes to get a final bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1145-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 2008\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I want to pick up where I left off \nregarding the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, which is the pending \nbusiness before the Senate. As I stated earlier, we will be having a \nseries of votes tomorrow on a number of amendments. One, I think, \nimproves this bill and addresses an issue which is important to me and \na number of my colleagues. The amendment is offered by our colleague \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Vitter, amendment No. 3896.\n  If the amendment is adopted, it would codify Federal Indian health \ncare service funds. I hope that is an amendment that will be adopted to \nthe bill. I think that is important to have.\n  Also, as we consider these final amendments, I hope we can also see \naction in the other body, the House of Representatives, because the \nSenate acting on this is long overdue. It is critically important to \nthe tribes I represent that we get an Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct reauthorization in place. But the fact that the Senate has acted \nwon't amount to much if in fact the other body doesn't also take up \nthis legislation and pass it and enable us to go into conference and \nget a bill we can put on the President's desk that he can sign into \nlaw.\n  I wish to speak specifically to one amendment that was adopted. \nAgain, I thank my colleagues Senators Murkowski and Dorgan for working \nwith me to have it adopted. It has to do with tribal justice in the \nDakotas.\n  One of the amendments I offered to this bill, No. 4021, goes a long \nway toward attempting to improve the issue that, in my view, is at the \ncore fundamentally to a lot of issues we are having in Indian country, \nand that is law enforcement. The amendment simply attempts to help with \nthe process, the analysis of what is happening with regard to justice \nand law enforcement in Indian Country by having the GAO complete a \nstudy within 1 year of the tribal justice systems within North Dakota \nand South Dakota, two States that have a high incidence of crime on our \nreservations.\n  Specifically, I am asking the study to focus, one, on how tribal \ncourts currently function and how they are supposed to function; \nsecond, an analysis of the components of tribal justice systems; third, \na review of the origins and development of tribal justice systems; \nfourth, an analysis of the weakness of the tribal justice systems; \nfive, an analysis of tribal leader suggestions to the current problems.\n  This is where I think it is important that we listen to the elected \nleadership on the reservations. Last week during the congressional \nbreak, I happened to have had the opportunity to travel across my \nState. I stopped at a couple different reservations. I was up on the \nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation and also at the Sisseton-\nWahpeton Oyate reservation with the tribal chairmen. The chairman of \nthe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is Ron His Horse Is Thunder, and the \nchairman of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate tribe is Michael Selvage.\n  One of the issues that came up in the meetings was this issue of law \nenforcement. There is, of course, in the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe a \ngood example of what I am talking about in terms of the dimensions of \nthis problem. You have 2.4 million acres of land on the Standing Rock \nSioux Tribe reservation. Yet you have about 10,000 people and you only \nhave about 9 policemen, law enforcement personnel out there, who are \ncommitted to that large geographic area. At any given time, you are \nonly going to have a couple of them on duty. So you have all kinds of \nissues that come up relating to being able to respond in a timely way \nto calls and to make arrests. I think it is a very difficult challenge \nthat we face on the reservations partly because of the geography but \nalso because of the sparsity that we have today of law enforcement \npersonnel.\n  I think the GAO study will look at a lot of issues and that will be \none component. It will look at the tribal court system, which is also \nsomething we need to look at and determine what, if anything, can be \ndone to improve the workings of the system. We clearly have a problem \nthat, if you look at the data, needs to be addressed.\n  If you don't contemplate or understand the need for this amendment, \nlet me give you a couple of pieces of information. Studies show that \none out of every three Native American women will be raped in their \nlifetime. The Department of Justice has found that American Indian \nwomen are 2\\1/2\\ times more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted \nthan women throughout the rest of the country. Remote reservations in \nNorth Dakota and South Dakota have an average of 10 times as much crime \nas the rest of the Nation.\n  What this GAO study would do is it would assist the tribes not only \nin North Dakota and South Dakota but I think assist policymakers in \nCongress concerning possible solutions that could be used to reduce the \nhigher rates of crime on reservations. Having met numerous times with \nmembers of the tribal government, tribal councils, and the chairmen on \nthese reservations, and having listened to the stories of people who \nlive there, there isn't anything we can do that is more important, in \nmy view, than to provide security.\n  We are talking about the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. This is \na health and public safety issue. If you don't have that, you cannot \nhave economic development; you cannot have kids learning in a safe and \nsecure environment. They are not going to be able to learn at the very \nfastest rate possible if they are worried about their security. This is \nan important issue, one that I think needs to be addressed.\n  Again, I appreciate the willingness on behalf of the managers of the \nbill to accept this amendment. I hope as the process moves forward, we \nwill see action by the House of Representatives that will allow us to \nget a bill passed through the Congress and on the President's desk, \nsigned into law, which will address the serious health care needs on \nthe reservations, but also this important amendment, the GAO study, \nwill allow us to take a close look--for the first time, a sort of \noutside objective third-party look at tribal justice in the Dakotas.\n  As I mentioned, it is a very serious need and challenge we face. I \ngot lots of good information during my visit last week from members of \nthe tribal council and the chairmen regarding that subject. I think \nthey are all anxious to get the study under way and anxious to get the \nresults so we can move forward with policies that make sense and that \nwill keep our reservations safe for young people to learn and for those \nwho want to come there and start businesses and have a safe environment \nin which to do that.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/25/senate-section/article/S1146-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
