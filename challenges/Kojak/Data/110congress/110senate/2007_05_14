Mr. President, this weekend I had the good fortune of \nhaving my brother in town. My brother Don is the oldest of four boys. \nHe is 12 years older than I. He served in the Marine Corps, and during \nthe Korean War he served in the Army. It was a wonderful time we had \nyesterday. Among other things, we went to Arlington National Cemetery. \nHe wanted to go there.\n  I have been here a long time. I went to law school here, and I now \nhave been in Congress for about 25 years. You don't often take the \nopportunity--because you are busy doing other things--to visit the \nwonderful attractions there are in the District of Columbia area.\n  Arlington Cemetery is a place that every Member of Congress should go \nonce in a while. It is amazing to see all those graves. I went, as I \nhave on a number of occasions, to President Kennedy's grave site. We \nsaw the eternal flame. He is there with his two babies and his \nwonderful wife.\n  We watched the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown \nSoldier. We visited the Iwo Jima memorial--it is called the Marine \nCorps Memorial. Iwo Jima is mentioned there. I have been reading a lot \nabout that lately. There are some books, such as Flags of Our Fathers--\nI don't want to hurt Clint Eastwood's feelings, but\n\n[[Page S6034]]\n\nthe book is much better than his movie. It is a wonderful book about \nthe people who raised the flag over Iwo Jima. That was quite a battle \non that little island. The fighting lasted 40 days. Seven thousand \nAmericans were killed and 20,000 wounded. During the first few days, \nhundreds were being killed every day. Even though that battle lasted a \nlittle over a month, a significant percentage of all of the Medals of \nHonor that were awarded during that war were awarded to the Battle of \nIwo Jima.\n\n  So, Mr. President, for me to go yesterday to the cemetery at \nArlington and see the eternal flame at President Kennedy's grave, to go \nto the Iwo Jima monument speaks in words that cannot be described in \njust the setting rather than the actual words you are hearing of the \nuncommon valor of the courageous American men and women in uniform \nserving overseas.\n  On Saturday, we also visited the World War II monument, the \nrelatively new monument in the area. We went to the FDR Memorial, \nLincoln's monument. These are things I enjoyed doing, but I especially \nenjoyed them because my brother was there with me.\n  Our troops serve as we speak with great valor overseas. Thousands and \nthousands more do the same for us here at home.\n  Last night, National Police Week kicked off with a candlelight vigil \nat the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. President Kennedy \nactually designated May 15 of every year as the ``National Peace \nOfficers Memorial Day'' and the week surrounding it ``Police Week.'' \nForty-five years later, our commitment to honor the memories of \nofficers lost in the line of duty, police officers lost in the line of \nduty, as well as those who continue to serve us, remains as strong as \never.\n  At last night's candlelight vigil, the names of all 145 officers \nkilled in the line of duty in 2006 were read. One of those names was \nSgt. Henry Prendes of Las Vegas. He was a member of the Las Vegas \nMetropolitan Police Department.\n  On February 1, 2006, Sergeant Prendes was the first to respond to a \ndomestic violence call involving a man brutally beating a woman. As \nSergeant Prendes approached the suspect, he was fatally shot and killed \nby a semiautomatic rifle.\n  Sergeant Prendes had spent 14 years on the force protecting the \npeople of Las Vegas.\n  His wife Dawn and daughters Brooke and Kylee are in Washington this \nweek to honor their husband and father.\n  It is impossible to imagine the void left in Dawn, Brooke, and \nKylee's hearts. Perhaps that void will be eased in some small way by \nthe pride in knowing that their father and husband served his community \nand our country with extraordinary courage and uncommon valor.\n  During this National Police Week, the memory of Sergeant Prendes and \nall those who have likewise fallen in the line of duty this year and in \nyears past are foremost in our thoughts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/14/senate-section/article/S6034-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I announced today the kickoff of \nwhistleblower week in Washington. This week, and the events surrounding \nit, are designed to promote, to celebrate, and to educate Congress and \nthe public about the courage and the patriotism of our whistleblowers. \nThese individuals often risk their careers to expose fraud, waste, and \nabuse in an effort to protect not only the health and safety of the \nAmerican people but also the Federal Treasury and taxpayer dollars.\n  This week's events promoting and celebrating whistleblowers are \nimportant for all Members of Congress and for the public as well. By \nhighlighting what whistleblowers do, we provide insight into what it \nmeans to be a whistleblower and the important role they play in \nGovernment and society.\n  For over two decades, I have learned from, appreciated, and honored \nwhistleblowers. Congress needs to make a special note of the role that \nwhistleblowers play in helping us to fulfill our constitutional duty of \nconducting oversight of the executive branch of Government or what we \nlearn in high school government classes called checks and balances.\n  As a Senator, I have conducted extensive oversight into virtually all \naspects of the Federal bureaucracy. Despite the differences in cases \nfrom agency to agency and from department to department, one constant \nremains: the need for information and the need for insight from \nwhistleblowers. This information is vital to effective congressional \noversight, the constitutional responsibility of Congress, in addition \nto legislating.\n  Documents alone are insufficient when it comes to understanding a \ndysfunctional bureaucracy. Only whistleblowers can explain why \nsomething is wrong and provide the best evidence to prove it. Moreover, \nonly whistleblowers can help us truly understand problems with the \nculture of Government agencies, because without changing the culture, \nbusiness as usual is the rule.\n  Whistleblowers have been instrumental in uncovering $700 being spent \non toilet seats in the Department of Defense. These American heroes \nwere also critical in our learning about how the Food and Drug \nAdministration missed the boat and approved Vioxx, how Government \ncontracts were inappropriately steered at the General Services \nAdministration, and how the corporation Enron was cooking the books and \nripping off investors. Courageous employees blew the whistle and shed \nmuch needed sunlight on the problems that would otherwise never see the \nlight of day.\n  Similar to all whistleblowers, each whistleblower in these cases \ndemonstrated tremendous courage. They stuck their neck out for the good \nof all of us. They spoke the truth. They didn't take the easy way out \nby going along to get along or by looking the other way when they saw \nthat things were wrong and that there was wrongdoing.\n  The whistleblower whom I call the grandfather of all whistleblowers, \nErnie Fitzgerald, of about 30 years of Department of Defense fame as an \nauditor, says that the only thing that whistleblowers commit--let me \nsay it this way: The only thing that whistleblowers do, and it ends up \ngetting them in trouble is, in his words, ``commit truth.'' For \ncommitting truth, then, they are about as welcome as a skunk at a \nSunday afternoon picnic with the bureaucracies they are within.\n  I have said it for many years without avail, and it probably will not \nbe of avail, that I would like to see the President of the United \nStates--and I have said this to four different Presidents--have a Rose \nGarden ceremony honoring whistleblowers. This would send a message from \nthe very top of the bureaucracy, which is the Presidency of the United \nStates, and to the bottom of the bureaucracy about the importance and \nvalue of whistleblowers.\n  They deserve this attention, and we all ought to be grateful for what \nthey do and appreciate the very difficult circumstances they often have \nto endure to do whistleblowing--or as Fitzgerald says, ``committing \ntruth''--because in the end they sacrifice their family's finances, \noftentimes their employability, and the attempts by powerful interest \ngroups to actually smear their good names and good intentions.\n  Earlier today, I had the opportunity to speak at a panel that \ngathered to discuss the plight of whistleblowers at the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation. These individuals discussed the hurdles they face in \nexposing the truth--or, according to Fitzgerald, ``committing truth.'' \nFurther, they discussed the lengths at which some bureaucrats will go \nto prevent the truth from getting out.\n  Unfortunately, these former agents also discussed a culture that \nkeeps problems internal and the circling of wagons within the \nbureaucracy when\n\n[[Page S6035]]\n\nthings go wrong. Oftentimes, this culture ``shoots'' the whistleblower \ninstead of addressing the problem.\n  Mr. President, retaliation against whistleblowers should not be \ntolerated. We have an obligation to ensure that those who retaliate are \npunished. Congress has recognized the need to protect whistleblowers, \nand I have used my experience working with whistleblowers to promote \nlegislation that protects them from retaliation--legislation such as \nthe Whistleblower Protection Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the False \nClaims Act.\n  These acts all recognize the benefits of whistleblowers and offer \nprotection to those seeking to uncover the truth. For example, \nwhistleblowers have used the False Claims Act to help the Federal \nGovernment recover nearly $20 billion since Congress passed my \namendments in 1986. I think the deterrent effect--if you can quantify \nit--would be many times the $20 billion of hard cash that has actually \ncome back into the Federal Treasury. These laws I gave are a good step. \nHowever, our work in this field is unfinished and more can be done.\n  The next step in protecting whistleblowers was filed in January and \nis currently pending before this body. It is S. 274, the Federal \nEmployee Protection of Disclosures Act, which will provide much needed \nupdates to Federal whistleblower protections. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of S. 274 and believe the Senate should move this \nimportant legislation. Unfortunately, this bill was introduced but not \naddressed in the last Congress. It is my hope this Chamber will act on \nS. 274 and improve the protections for whistleblowers.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join in support of S. 274 and swiftly \nmove this important legislation to help protect whistleblowers further \nthan present law does. I also urge all of my colleagues to attend the \nevents that are occurring all week to help celebrate whistleblowers, \npoint out that this is an important tool in the checks and balances of \nour Government, and all that whistleblowers have done to benefit the \nwork of Congress and, more important, all they have done to make \nAmerica safer, stronger, a better nation, and to make sure we get our \ndollars' worth for the taxpayers' dollars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/14/senate-section/article/S6035-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6035-S6036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have addressed my colleagues many \ntimes over the past few months to advocate for the American families \nwho will pay the alternative minimum tax in 2007. You have all heard me \nsay the AMT is an absolutely maddening tax that has insidiously crept \ninto the homes of more and more families each year and that it should \nbe repealed.\n  The AMT was first installed by Congress in 1969. It created a two-\ntiered tax system, and that tax system still exists. It essentially \npieced together a backup tax to ensure that the wealthiest taxpayers \namong us did not evade income taxes altogether through the use of tax \nshelters, loopholes, and deductions--albeit all legal--in the labyrinth \nof the Federal Tax Code.\n  The road to tax fairness is paved with good intentions, but this \none--the AMT--has created a giant-sized pothole that is going to drive \nmiddle-income taxpayers batty. Unlike the Federal income tax, the AMT \nis not indexed for inflation. That means more and more middle-income \ntaxpayers are being slapped with higher tax rates and fewer exemptions, \ncredits, and deductions as they fall under the creeping shadow of this \n36-year-old stealth tax.\n  On top of the unfair tax burden is its mind-boggling complexity. No \nwonder the AMT is causing major heartburn among more and more families \nacross America, especially those who live in high-tax States and have \nthree or four children. That is because the AMT causes taxpayers to \nlose standard deductions for State and local tax payments and for \npersonal exemptions, even including spouses and children.\n  In 2004, about 3 million taxpayers--about 2 percent of all \ntaxpayers--were subject to the AMT. But without congressional action, \nup to 23 million taxpayers are, right now, subjected to the AMT during \nthis 2007 tax year. In order to prevent this, my friend and chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, Max Baucus, and I introduced legislation on the \nfirst day of the 110th Congress to repeal the individual alternative \nminimum tax beginning in the 2007 tax year.\n  My colleagues have also heard me say the AMT has expanded beyond its \noriginal intent and that it is now a tax that Congress never intended \nto collect--meaning they never intended to collect it from 23 million \ntaxpayers who are right now hit with it, who would not have been hit \nwith it before, and were never intended to be hit with it.\n  Over the past 6 years, Congress has had to enact a series of what I \ncall ``patches'' to prevent the AMT from hitting more and more middle-\nclass Americans--a class of taxpayers never intended to be taxed by it. \nMore recently, Congress acted to prevent millions of taxpayers from \nreceiving this surprise on their 2006 tax returns by including an \nextension of AMT relief in the Tax Increase Prevention and \nReconciliation Act of 2005. This provision extended the AMT exemption \nthat was initiated in the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act \nof 2003 through the year 2006 but at a higher level. The exemption for \nmarried couples filing jointly was increased from $58,000 to $62,550.\n  This week, in fact, marks the 1-year anniversary of the enactment of \nthe conference agreement of that last act. That act contained the AMT \n``patch'' for 2006. Nearly 20 million American families who were exempt \nfrom the AMT before that because of the 2006 patch knew at this time \nlast year that Congress was moving to relieve the AMT burden for the \nwhole year of 2006. This year, those very families, plus several \nmillion more, have no such assurance by this Congress.\n\n  Now, to the contrary, the Democratic leadership, now the majority in \nthis Congress, doesn't appear to be moving any legislation to address \nthe AMT. I would be happy for them to move the Baucus-Grassley repeal \nbill. I know our chairman, Senator Baucus, is like me, concerned about \nthe uncertainty caused by the inaction of the leadership.\n  The Tax Code has a thicket of problems requiring attention. But this \none--the AMT--is the thorniest and must be addressed not later, but we \nmust address it right now. Some of you may wonder why this is a \npressing issue. Why can this not wait for an AMT patch at the end of \nthe year? This is the reason: It is because 23 million American \nfamilies who are subjected to the AMT in 2007 are dealing now with the \nuncertainty of whether, by hook or by crook, they must come up with the \nmoney to set aside to pay that tax in April of next year. Many of \nthem--just check the instructions from the 2007 estimated tax payment \nforms--don't have the option of waiting until next April because they \nhave to file their estimated tax payments quarterly this very year.\n  So some of them filing, on April 15, a quarterly report had to figure \nin that alternative minimum tax and set money aside and send it into \nthe Treasury because the here and now is here and now for those 23 \nmillion people, or the ones who have to file quarterly returns.\n  Those families have already seen that first estimated tax payment \ncome and go. Hopefully, they had some refund coming to them from last \nyear they were able to offset against a portion of that first payment. \nOf course, we know many of them had to shell out the tax and send the \nFederal Government more of their hard-earned money with that first \nestimated tax payment last month.\n  Unfortunately, as unpopular as the AMT is among taxpayers and \npolicymakers, it is not easy to simply erase it from the books because \nof the massive amount of revenue that it is set to raise over the next \ndecade. That is funny because this is coming from taxpayers never \nintended to be taxed by it in the first place. That is how idiotic this \ncan get.\n  Until recently, I had hoped the Senate was unified in not wanting to \ncollect the AMT for this year or any future year. On March 23, I \noffered an amendment to the 2008 Senate budget resolution that would \nhave required Congress to stop spending amounts that are scheduled to \ncome into the Federal coffers through the AMT--from middle-income \ntaxpayers who were never intended to pay it in the first place. This \nwould have put some honesty back into our budgeting process.\n\n[[Page S6036]]\n\n  However, not a single colleague on the other side of the aisle voted \nin its favor. Repealing the AMT would put lawmakers on notice to either \ntrim Federal spending by a like amount or be transparent about the \nrevenue base.\n  On the House side, we hear that the Ways and Means Committee is doing \na lot of talking about the AMT, but they have yet to move to action. We \nare forced to wonder what their plans may be. To do that, we need only \nread what they have been saying and think through the conclusions on \nsuch proposals.\n  It has been reported that some in the other body--the majority party, \nthe Democrats--plan to exempt everybody who earns less than $250,000 a \nyear from the AMT. It sounds to me as if they might be on the right \ntrack to full repeal when I hear that. However, we need to follow \nthrough on what exactly they would do if they insist on providing pay-\nfors to cover the lost revenue under the new pay-go rules that are \nbeing adopted.\n  One option is reportedly being floated on the House side which is to \npay for a $250,000 AMT exclusion by raising the top marginal income tax \nrate. Well, we have found some shocking numbers when we examine that \nissue further. In order to exempt folks who earn less than $250,000 \nfrom the AMT, if you insist on raising taxes to offset it, you would \nhave to raise the top marginal tax rate to over 46 percent.\n  Now, we have a chart showing the top marginal tax rate. Back in the \n1970s, it was 70 percent, and it gradually went down to a low of 28 \npercent. Now it is back at 35 percent, and the red mark would have the \nhighest marginal tax rates that we have had since 1980. I will take a \nfew minutes to put that regular income tax rate into a historical \nperspective.\n\n  In 1913, when less than 1 percent of the population was subject to \nthe income tax, the rate ranged from 1 percent to 7 percent. Rates \nincreased significantly during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, up to a top \nmarginal tax rate of over 90 percent. The concept of deduction for home \nmortgages, interest, charitable contributions, State and local taxes, \nto name a few, became ingrained in the code during that period of \nstifling high tax rates.\n  During the President Kennedy administration, tax rates were reduced \nfrom 91 percent to 70 percent on the highest income levels, and rates \nfell again during the Reagan administration, first from 70 percent to \n50 percent, and then again the top marginal tax rate was 28 percent by \nthe 1986 Tax Act. The top rate now stands at 35 percent.\n  It is important to remember that when we look at those historical \nrates, the tax base was narrower prior to 1986 than it is today. Many \nphaseout and phasein concepts took hold in 1986, such as PEP and Pease \nlimits. Today, substantially all individual tax incentives are phased \nout and capped, and the result of this base broadening is that if the \nTax Code were to approach a tax rate similar to the highest marginal \nrate under the more narrow pre-1986 tax base, it would result in \nsubstantially higher effective tax rates than in the pre-1986 tax \nrates. A marginal regular income tax rate of over 46 percent may \nactually exceed the top effective rate that was in place before 1986 \nbecause of the increase in the tax base.\n  Another option that may be working its way through the mill on the \nHouse side is to pay for that exemption by raising the top alternative \nminimum tax rate. Again, with that option, the tax rate increase is \nstaggering. The top AMT rate would go up to nearly 37 percent.\n  There is a popular misconception that Congress can sit on its hands \non tax policy before the next election and that there will be no tax \nincrease until 2011. While that view is comforting, it is uninformed. \nJust enacting the alternative minimum tax patch for 2007 will cost over \n$50 billion. That also means that without doing the patch, Americans \nthen will pay the $50 billion higher alternative minimum tax, and it is \ncoming from middle-income taxpayers who were never intended to be taxed \nwhen the alternative minimum tax was put in place back in 1969. So we \nmust act to prevent such an unfair tax increase.\n  The folks who voted against my amendment to take the AMT revenue off \nthe table for the tax and spenders have some real explaining to do \nsoon. It is possible that they will do nothing on the tax side. The \nresult is a $50 billion tax increase on families, middle-income-tax \nfamilies, who are going to be subject to the AMT for the first time and \nare subject to it right now, or they may propose some sort of exemption \nor relief that is paid for by other tax increases and face the music on \nproposing a massive tax increase on the neighbors of those who have \nbeen paying the AMT, or perhaps they may provide AMT relief but fiddle \naway the money in the budget anyway and increase the deficit.\n  I suggest that the tax and spenders consider learning to hum a \ndifferent tune and spend within their means soon or folks may just \nfigure out that they planned to raise their tax rates all along. So the \nsad reality is that while it is the new congressional majority that \nneeds to face the music, it is likely to be the American taxpayers who \nwill end up singing the blues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. WEBB).

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1097\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the manager of the bill, the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from California, allowing me to obtain the floor.\n  We all know 2 weeks ago President Bush vetoed the supplemental \nappropriations bill, a bill to fully fund the troops in Iraq and change \nthe course of\n\n[[Page S6037]]\n\nthat conflict in Iraq. Late last week, the House sent a new bill to the \nSenate. We received that within the past hour. The ball is now in our \ncourt, the Senate's court. Democrats and Republicans agree the Senate \nneeds to get a bill in conference as soon as possible and we need to \nwork together to make that happen.\n  I have had a number of conversations with Senator McConnell the last \nseveral days. I spoke to him earlier today at some length. As much as \nwe all recognize how badly we need to get a bill to conference, we have \nnot, on this side of the aisle, lost sight of the fact that the \nAmerican people have concluded the President's Iraq policy has failed \nand we are now demanding a new way forward on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  In an effort to ensure quick Senate passage of our conference vehicle \nlater this week, as well as to give Senators an opportunity to express \ntheir views on the President's Iraq policy, I will offer two important \namendments. The first amendment is Feingold-Reid, to safely redeploy \nUnited States troops from Iraq by March 31 of next year, and transition \nthe mission to fighting al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations, \nproviding security for United States infrastructure and personnel, and \ntraining Iraqi forces.\n  Of course, after the 1st of April of next year, our troops will be in \nIraq for counterterrorism, force protection--that is to protect \nAmerican assets in Iraq--and to help train the Iraqis.\n  I will also offer a Levin-Reid amendment which is consistent with the \nbipartisan legislation approved by Congress with one change: It permits \nthe President to waive the timeline for redeployments. It has in it \nsome things some Members want very badly, including the Presiding \nOfficer, to deal with how our troops are taken care of, how often they \nhave to go back to battle, how much time they have to have before being \nreturned to the battlefield after having been deployed. We will have \nvotes on these two amendments at the earliest possible date. I will \nwork with the distinguished Republican leader to see when that will \nhappen. These votes represent an opportunity for the Senate to shape \nthe important conference we hope will begin this week upon passage of \nthe Senate version of the supplemental.\n  There is probably no end of amendments that could be offered, as I \nhave here today, but on our side of the aisle, Democrats believe we \nshould do something very close to what was done in the bill we sent to \nthe President which he vetoed.\n  Basically that is what we have here--except getting the President the \nability to waive the timelines we have in the legislation.\n  Finally, there are those on this side who believe there should be \nsome end in sight. That is why I indicated that as of April 1 of next \nyear, the funding would still go on but it would be limited to the \ncounterterrorism, force protection, and training Iraqis.\n  It is very important to understand that transitioning this mission to \nfighting al-Qaida is a part of the recognition of what we and the \nAmerican people believe is important. At present, as you know, American \ntroops are over there protecting the Shias, protecting the Sunnis, \nprotecting the Kurds, and at all times all these different elements are \nshooting at the Americans. We should limit our focus to al-Qaida.\n  Mr. President, I call up the Levin-Reid amendment first.\n  That is No. 1097.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Levin, for \n     himself and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 1097 to \n     the language proposed to be stricken by amendment No. 1065.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1097\n\n     SEC. 1.

Mr. President, on these amendments, I am a cosponsor of \nboth.\n  I thank the manager very much. I hope she and Senator Inhofe can move \nthe WRDA amendment along. It is an important piece of legislation for \nthe whole country and it is way past due when we should have had this \ncompleted.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before the leader leaves, I hope I can get the attention \nof the floor staff, to make sure--my understanding is you have now \noffered the amendments on Iraq to the underlying bill, but the text \nthat is before us is clean of the Iraq amendments? I think it is a good \nthing to do because we can move on here with WRDA, as the amendments \nwere applied to the underlying text, not to the amendment we are \nworking on.\n  I thank my colleague for thinking it through. I am proud he is with \nus in wanting to move this WRDA bill forward.\n  Let a message go out we are going to move this bill forward. One of \nthe reasons I say to my friend, thank you--I don't want to keep him \nhere, I just want to thank him.\n  We have received a letter from the National Construction Alliance. It \nis the Laborers International Union of North America, the International \nUnion of Operating Engineers, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters & \nJoiners of America.\n  The reason I am bringing this up is they are very strong supporters \nof WRDA. I think their letter lays out why, so I am actually going to \nread it so it goes into the Record at this point. It says:\n\n       Dear Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe:\n       The National Construction Alliance, representing the three \n     leading construction unions advocating for robust federal \n     infrastructure investment, endorses the Senate version of the \n     Water Resources Development Act reauthorization. This vital \n     Federal infrastructure legislation should be considered and \n     passed by the United States Senate. Our three constituent \n     unions, the Laborers, Operating Engineers and the Carpenters, \n     commend you both for your strong, bipartisan leadership on \n     this legislation.\n\n  This gets to the heart of why Senator Inhofe and I and all on the \ncommittee believe so strongly about the bill.\n\n       The $13.9 billion authorization of Corps of Engineers \n     projects is an important and necessary step in addressing our \n     country's serious backlog of water projects. From harbor \n     improvement to flood protection, to lock and dam \n     construction, dredging and environmental infrastructure, your \n     bill will immeasurably strengthen America's water resources. \n     As labor unions representing nearly one million skilled \n     construction workers, we recognize that this WRDA \n     reauthorization will create tens of thousands of good paying \n     construction jobs.\n       We strongly urge the Senate to pass your legislation in an \n     expeditious manner so that America's critical water \n     infrastructure needs can be addressed.\n\n  I say to the President--who is sitting in the chair today, as opposed \nto the President of the United States--he has so long been speaking \nabout the problem of our loss of middle-class jobs. What is so \nimportant about this particular bill is that while we are doing things \nthe Nation must have in order to grow and in order to protect itself \nfrom the ravages of Mother Nature, as we saw in Katrina--in the course \nof doing the right thing we are creating good jobs. It is a wonderful \nwinner for everybody.\n  That is why we have more letters I want to share with colleagues. The \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers has added its voice to all these \nunions, to both Senator Inhofe and myself, saying they are very pleased \nwith this bill, they are very pleased with the levee system fixes; they \nbelieve this is\n\n[[Page S6039]]\n\noverdue legislation and that it ensures we have learned the lessons \nfrom Hurricane Katrina. It ``goes far toward protecting human life and \nproperty in flood-prone areas.''\n  They ask us if the American Society of Civil Engineers can be of more \nassistance, please call them. We may, because we want everybody to \nweigh in here and help us.\n  We have a letter from the Audubon Society. You have heard from the \nbusiness side, the union side, now the environmental side. They have a \nmillion members. They say, please, let's have prompt consideration of \nWRDA because it restores America's natural resources. It includes:\n\n       . . . Corps modernization provisions, including independent \n     review of costly or controversial Corps projects and ensuring \n     that mitigation for Corps projects is consistent with \n     stricter State laws.\n\n  This refers to the Corps' formula in the last bill which is embedded \nin this bill.\n  Audubon also talks about:\n\n       . . . two crucial Everglades restoration projects--Indian \n     River lagoon and Picayune Strand--that would mitigate harmful \n     federal drainage projects, restore more than 160,000 acres of \n     wetlands and significant estuarine habitat, and help secure \n     Florida's tourism and outdoor recreation economy.\n\n  They also cite the upper Mississippi River restoration program, in \nits first 15-year increment, will preserve 105,000 acres of habitat; \nprotect 35,000 acres of floodplain habitat in five States along the \nriver.\n  The Coastal Louisiana restoration program will begin to reverse the \ndevastating pattern of land loss, protecting important habitat for \nbirds and fish and other wildlife as well as the region's economy and \nquality of life.\n  The bill permanently authorizes the Asian Carp Barrier to protect the \nGreat Lakes from this looming threat. The Audubon Society, which is so \nwell respected on both sides of the aisle, closes and says that \necosystem restoration projects for the Everglades, the Mississippi, \nLouisiana's coastal wetlands, and the Great Lakes are overdue, as is \nCorps modernization.\n  Then I will add to these letters, Mr. President, a letter from the \nNational Association of Manufacturers. I mean, this is one of those \nbills that gets everybody's support. It is something that is important \nfor everyone.\n  They say: On behalf of more than 14 million manufacturing employees \nin the U.S., they are thanking us for our leadership, and they are \nsaying: Let's move forward with WRDA. It is important. They say that: \nAmerica's water resources infrastructure needs to be reliable and \nproductive.\n  They applaud our efforts and they say how vitally needed WRDA is, \nincluding the modernization of locks, harbors, canals, and other key \ninfrastructure that is vital to America's competitiveness. They say: \nWRDA will authorize many of these needs. So that is the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers. So it goes on and on.\n  The Pacific Northwest Waterways Association has a similar letter that \nis very important to us. The American Farm Bureau. The American Farm \nBureau has entered this, and they have written us saying it is a good \nbill, urging us to support WRDA, and they oppose any amendment that \nwould hinder our progress in moving forward.\n  The corn growers of America, they have weighed in and they say: It is \nimportant. They have sent a letter to Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, \nour leaders, saying we need to have this bill. They need to have \nefficient transportation networks and so on. This is a very important \nletter, I think. They say that continued development of our water \nresources in an environmentally sound manner will contribute mightily \nto our Nation's well-being.\n  Congress needs to act now to address issues such as environmental \nrestoration, navigation, flood control, hurricane protection, water \nsupply, irrigation, beach nourishment, and recreation.\n  So that is yet another letter. The American Public Works Association \nhas sent us a letter. They have a similar message: With adequate \ndredging, our ports and waterways are the backbone of our \ntransportation system, ensuring domestic and international trade \nopportunities and low-cost, environmentally sensitive goods movements. \nIt goes on.\n  Now, I have already placed some of those letters in the Record, and I \nam going to do it again today because I think every day, as colleagues \nwill look at the Record, they will see their importance.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record \nat the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. The reason I like to share these letters is that it shows \nthe breadth of support this bill has. We know we come to the floor with \na lot of legislation that is contentious, that is contentious between \nthe parties, that is contentious with people throughout America, one \ngroup supports it. For example, the labor unions might but the bosses \ndo not. This is a place where everybody comes together. I think that is \nvery important.\n  So colleagues know what is happening today, you know we do not have \nvotes today. But we are going to try to debate some amendments today. \nWe have already debated the Feingold amendment, so that is ready to be \nvoted on tomorrow. I understand that Senator Coburn is on his way over \nto offer at least the one--we are hoping three amendments. He can \ndebate today, and then we can have votes on those as we agree between \nthe sides. The way we have decided to handle this bill, because it has \nbeen such a delicate balance, is the following: We are working across \nparty lines to come up with amendments we can agree to. We have taken \nthe amendments that have been submitted thus far, and we are sort of \ncategorizing those amendments in what is easy for us to agree to, what \nis more difficult. We are going to try to work through the easier \namendments, and the more contentious ones we will have to have votes.\n  Now, what we call the big four of the committee, the Chairman of the \nfull committee, the Chairman of the subcommittee, the ranking members \nof both the full committee and the subcommittee, we have made an \nagreement that we will oppose all amendments. Why are we doing this? \nBelieve me, that is not an easy thing for us to do. We feel we have \nworked so closely, in a bipartisan fashion, we want to keep this bill \ntotally bipartisan. We are trying to keep the most contentious items \nout of the bill to make sure it gets to the President's desk and he \nsigns it.\n  Now, the good news is we have a score on the bill. That means how \nmuch the bill is scored at. It is $13.9 billion. It makes it lower than \nthe House bill. This is very good news because we want to be fiscally \nresponsible.\n  We also want to make sure all the projects in this bill meet certain \ncriteria, that they have been studied, they have been looked at, that \nthere is a fair cost share, unless there is an usual circumstance.\n  So Senator Inhofe has been very strong on conditions. I expect him to \ncome to the floor very soon. He actually had a weekend trip to Iraq. I \ndo appreciate the fact that he has gone and that he is going to be \nhere, we believe, at about 3:30--as a matter of fact, in about 10 \nminutes--at which point I hope he will make some of his comments on \nthis bill.\n  But the way we have set the bill up is we now have the committee \nsubstitute pending in the form of an amendment. Leader Reid has sent \nforward two amendments, but they are not to the substitute bill, they \nare to the underlying bill about Iraq, as a way to expedite the \nconsideration of the Iraq supplemental. He has done that with the \nknowledge of Senator McConnell so there are no surprises here. We have \ndiscussed this with Senator Feingold in terms of offering his \namendment, which he already debated. That will be ready for a vote \nlater. I hope we can set aside all these amendments and vote on them \ntomorrow morning at such time as the leader agrees.\n  At this point, since I think I have laid out the reason why we so \nmuch need this bill, after 7 long years of not having a WRDA bill, we \nso much need this bill, and we are so proud of the committee that they \nvoted this bill out in a very harmonious way and that we are still \nworking side by side, the majority and minority side, on crafting the \namendments we need to push this over the finish line.\n  I look forward to the comments of Senator Inhofe. We also will, of \ncourse,\n\n[[Page S6040]]\n\nentertain the amendments of Senator Tom Coburn when he gets to the \nfloor. I urge anybody else who wants to lay down amendments, please, \nyou are absolutely welcome.\n  I understand Senator Landrieu would like the floor. So why don't I \nleave the floor with the understanding that if Senator Inhofe comes, \nwould you wind down within 10 minutes so he can have the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                 Pacific Northwest\n\n\n                                        Waterways Association,\n\n                                       Portland, OR, May 10, 2007.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, \n         Washington, DC\n     Hon. James Inhofe,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Environment and Public \n         Works, Washington, DC\n       Dear Chairman Boxer and Senator Inhofe, We write to urge \n     your support for the reauthorization of the Water Resources \n     Development Act in 2007.\n       WRDA is fundamentally important to the economic health of \n     our nation and particularly important to the states of \n     Oregon, Washington, Idaho and California. Our region depends \n     on international trade to a greater extent than any other \n     region in the United States. In Washington state, one in four \n     jobs are related to international trade. Cost-effective, \n     efficient, and environmentally sound trade and transportation \n     corridors are imperative to secure our place in the global \n     economy. Delay in WRDA means exacerbated backlogs which will \n     dull our competitive edge.\n       The Pacific Northwest Waterways Association (PNWA) \n     membership includes nearly 100 organizations in Oregon, \n     Washington, Idaho and California. PNWA represents public port \n     authorities on the Pacific Coast, Puget Sound, and Columbia \n     Snake River System; public utility districts, investor-owned \n     utilities, electric cooperatives and direct service \n     industries; irrigation districts, grain growers and upriver \n     and export elevator companies; major manufacturers in the \n     Pacific Northwest; forest products industry manufacturers and \n     shippers; and tug and barge operators, steamship operators, \n     consulting engieneers, and others involved in economic \n     development throughout the Pacific Northwest.\n       PNWA has a long history of working with the Committee and \n     the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on projects of regional and \n     national importance, sharing the challenge to maintain and \n     develop our transportation infrastructure. Our members wish \n     to thank the Committee for its support of Pacific Northwest \n     transportation programs and projects.\n       Issues of particular concern to the members of our \n     Association follow:\n\n\n                          minimum dredge fleet\n\n       The federally-owned hopper drege fleet and the Corps of \n     Engineers' dredges Essayons and Yaquina, are particularly \n     important to the maintenance of ports and harbors in the \n     Pacific Northwest. The goals of Congressional actions in \n     1978, 1993 and 1996, which limited the utilization of the of \n     the federal dredge fleet and provided increased opportunity \n     for industry, have been meet.\n       Since passage of the Energy and Water Appropriations Act of \n     1993, designed to increase competition in the dredge \n     industry, the number of private dredging contractors has \n     declined. This is of concern because the Northwest has unique \n     conditions such that, compared to other regions, Northwest \n     ports depend to a greater degree on hopper dredging and on \n     smaller class hopper dredges. The Government Accountability \n     Office found in a March 2003 to Congress (GAO-03-382) that \n     operating restrictions have imposed additional costs on the \n     Corps' dredging program, but have not resulted in proven \n     benefits to the taxpayer.\n       PNWA strongly supports the language included in your bill \n     to lift operating restrictions from the Essayons and Yaquina, \n     which will enable the Corps of Engineers to utilize the \n     Essayons and Yaquina to the maximum extent possible to \n     maintain Northwest ports, harbors and channels, consistent \n     with the safe and efficient performance of their missions.\n\n\n                      making section 214 permanent\n\n       Section 214 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 \n     (P.L. 106-541) provides the authority to the Secretary of the \n     Army to accept and expend funds contributed by non-Federal \n     public entities and to expedite the processing of permits. \n     Section 214 has allowed local governments to move forward \n     with vital infrastructure projects. By funding additional \n     staff to work on specific, time-intensive permits, existing \n     Corps staff members are able to process the significant \n     permit application backlog much more quickly. Funding for \n     additional Corps staff has resulted in a reduction of permit \n     wait times not only for the funding entity, but for any \n     individual or organization that makes an application with \n     that District of the Corps.\n       This authority is currently scheduled to sunset on December \n     31, 2008. Though PNWA has been successful in working with \n     Congress to secure short-term extensions for several years \n     now, the time has come to give Corps regulatory offices as \n     well as the contributing entities the predictability that \n     would come with a permanent authority. PNWA strongly supports \n     language in your bill that would make Section 214 permanent.\n       These provisions are strongly supported by PNWA's \n     membership, and are important to improve the efficiency and \n     cost competitiveness of Northwest ports engaging in \n     international trade. Additional provisions that are supported \n     by PNWA are included in the attached document, PNWA WRDA \n     Requests. We appreciate the Committee's and Congress' \n     attention to these important matters.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Kristin Meira,\n     Government Relations Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                         pnwa member directory\n\n       Alaska Assoc. of Port Managers & Harbormasters; Almota \n     Elevator Company; Anderson-Perry & Associates, Inc.; Ball \n     Janik LLP; Bell Buoy Crab Co.; Benton County PUD #1; Boise \n     Cascade LLC; BST Associates; Central Washingotn Grain \n     Growers, Inc.; CH2M Hill; Clark Public Utilities; Columbia \n     Basin Development League; Columbia County Grain Growers, Inc; \n     Columbia River Bar Pilots; Columbia River Pilots; Columbia \n     River Steamship Operators Assoc.; Cowlitz County Board of \n     Commissioners; David B.

Barbara Boxer,\n     Chairwoman, Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairwoman: On behalf of more than 4 million \n     manufacturing employees in the U.S., we would like to thank \n     you for your leadership in moving forward with the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 2007 (WRDA). It is vitally \n     important that America's water resources infrastructure be \n     reliable and productive. Therefore we applaud your efforts to \n     end the stalemate over water resources project authorization \n     by bringing H.R. 1495, WRDA, to the Senate floor. We firmly \n     believe that it is time to end the impasse over passage of \n     WRDA.\n       A Water Resources Development Act is vitally needed to \n     accommodate the many important projects awaiting \n     authorization, including the modernization of the locks, \n     harbors, canals and other key infrastructure that are vital \n     to the competitiveness of the U.S. economy. A sound national \n     transportation system for the 21st century needs modern water \n     projects, and WRDA will authorize many of those needs.\n       We look forward to working with you and your staff and \n     issues of importance to the nation's economy and environment. \n     Again, thank you for your leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          The National Association\n     of Manufacturers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                      Audubon,\n\n                                                     May 10, 2007.\n     Re Act now to Restore America's Natural Treasures.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Audubon Society and \n     our more than one million members and supporters, I urge you \n     to help restore America's natural resources by advocating for \n     prompt consideration and passage of the Water Resources \n     Development Act of 2007 (S. 1248). WRDA 2007 would authorize \n     unprecedented spending for ecosystem restoration projects, \n     including Everglades, upper Mississippi River, coastal \n     Louisiana, and Great Lakes.\n\n[[Page S6041]]\n\n       The bill should include Corps modernization provisions, \n     including independent review of costly or controversial Corps \n     projects and ensuring that mitigation for Corps projects is \n     consistent with stricter State laws.\n       WRDA 2007 contains two crucial Everglades restoration \n     projects--Indian River Lagoon and Picayune Strand--that would \n     mitigate harmful federal drainage projects, restore more than \n     160,000 acres of wetlands and significant estuarine habitat, \n     and help secure Florida's tourism and outdoor recreation \n     economy. The Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program, in \n     its first 15-year increment, will restore 105,000 acres of \n     habitat, protect 35,000 acres of floodplain habitat in five \n     States along the river, and will include a significant \n     monitoring program. The Coastal Louisiana Restoration program \n     will begin to reverse this devastating pattern of land loss, \n     protecting important habitat for birds, fish, and other \n     wildlife, as well as the region's economy and quality of \n     life. The bill would also permanently authorize the Asian \n     Carp Barrier to protect the Great Lakes from this looming \n     threat.\n       Ecosystem restoration projects for the Everglades, the \n     Mississippi River, Louisiana's coastal wetlands, and the \n     Great Lakes are overdue, as is Corps modernization. Thank you \n     for helping to restore some of America's greatest natural \n     treasures.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                     John Flicker,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             National Construction\n\n\n                                                     Alliance,\n\n                                      Washington DC, May 10, 2007.\n     Hon.

Inhofe,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Environment and Public Works \n         Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe: The National \n     Construction A11iance, representing the three leading \n     construction unions advocating for robust federal \n     infrastructure investment, endorses the Senate version of the \n     Water Resource Development Act reauthorization. This vital \n     federal infrastructure legislation should be. considered and \n     passed by the United States Senate. Our three constituent \n     unions, the Laborers. Operating Engineers and the Carpenters, \n     commend you both for your strong, bipartisan leadership on \n     this legislation.\n       The $13.9 billion authorization of Corps of Engineers \n     projects is an important and necessary step in addressing our \n     country's serious backlog of water projects. From harbor \n     improvement, to flood protection, to lock and dam \n     construction, dredging and environmental infrastructure. your \n     bill will immeasurably strengthen America's water resources. \n     As labor unions representing nearly one million skilled \n     construction workers, we recognize that this WRDA \n     reauthorization will create tens of thousands of good paying \n     construction jobs.\n       We strongly urge the Senate to pass your legislation in an \n     expeditious manner so that America's critical water \n     infrastructure needs can be addressed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Raymond J.

James Inhofe,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Environment and Public Works, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairwoman and Senator Inhofe: As the Senate \n     begins its consideration of the Water Resources Development \n     Act (WRDA) of 2007 this week, the American Society of Civil \n     Engineers (ASCE) commends your efforts to bring a bipartisan \n     bill to the floor. We appreciate your commitment to moving \n     forward with responsible legislation to authorize much-needed \n     improvements to the nation's water resources and public works \n     infrastructure. We support WRDA's speedy passage into law.\n       ASCE is especially pleased to champion enactment of \n     subtitle C of the Senate bill, which would require the U.S. \n     Army Corps of Engineers to establish a national levee safety \n     program. Subtitle C would authorize the Secretary to spend \n     $100 million to inspect and inventory the nation's levee \n     systems and fund state levee safety programs. This long \n     overdue legislation ensures that we have learned the lessons \n     from Hurricane Katrina and goes far toward protecting human \n     life and property in flood-prone areas.\n       If ASCE can be of further assistance as this important \n     legislation advances, please do not hesitate to contact Brian \n     Pallasch of our Washington office.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Patrick J. Natale,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak for a few \nmoments about probably one of the most important bills that this \nCongress will consider relative to Louisiana and our ongoing attempt to \nprotect the 3 million people who live in south Louisiana and also to \nprotect the great infrastructure we have in this country, in a vast and \nbroad way, not just from the energy sector but the fisheries but, most \nimportantly, transportation and commerce.\n  There was an excellent article in the Post this weekend that I would \nlike to have printed for the Record, written by one of the most \ndistinguished citizens of our State, John Barry, who is a renowned \nauthor who wrote the book ``Rising Tide,'' also a recent book about the \ninfluenza of 1917.\n  But he writes, in reference to the WRDA bill and to the amendments I \nam going to be offering to this bill, about the importance of acting \nnow to save this great region of the Southern part of the United \nStates, and the fact that this delta that we are attempting to save by \nbuilding the right kind of levees, the right kind of gates and locks, \nthe right kind of navigation channels, correcting some of our past \nmistakes that we made before we realized the damage that would occur by \nsome of our own actions.\n  He writes about the importance of this Delta, that at one time it \nreached from Cape Girardeau, MO, all the way up the Mississippi River, \ndown to the present mouth of the river, that the entire delta, that it \nwas created over thousands of years, and it was maintained as the river \noverflowed its banks. As the river overflowed, it carried silt. It \nbuilt the Delta.\n  But as we have channeled the delta, channeled the river and built \nlevees up along the river, we have caused the natural building up of \nthe delta to stop.\n  Then as we cut channels through this great and amazing land, that \nreaches from the east of New Orleans all the way to the Texas-Louisiana \nborder, as we crisscross it with pipelines and navigation channels to \ntap into the extraordinary oil and gas reserves both on land and \noffshore, it exacerbates an already tough situation.\n  Then to level on top of that the dredging of the Mississippi River, \nto keep the sandbars out of the mouth, the channel as we have made the \nwater move faster, that has an impact on the way this delta is now \nlowering itself, if you will, into the water.\n  There are other contributing factors, but the bottom line is we have \nto take corrective action to reverse this. We cannot correct everything \nthat we did, but we most certainly can pass this bill, the WRDA bill, \nthe Water Resources Development Act, which has--about 22 percent of the \nentire bill is dedicated basically to this purpose\n  It is right that a large portion of this bill be dedicated to this \npurpose because this delta, this Mississippi River, does not just serve \nthe 4.5 million people who call Louisiana home but it literally serves \nthe 360 million people who call the United States of America home. It \nserves Canada and Mexico as well, as well as ports around the world. So \nit is not just for the people of Louisiana whom we act today, it is in \nthe national interest to do so.\n  In the underlying bill, which Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe have \nso carefully crafted, the Louisiana Coastal Area Ecosystem Restoration \nsystem has $1.133 billion. Morganza to the Gulf, a very important \naspect of our protection of south Louisiana, is included in this bill \nat $841 million.\n  Some port work at the Port of New Iberia for Vermilion and Iberia \nParishes, which are two of our larger southern parishes, has an \nauthorization that is overdue and most certainly timely. There is an \namount of money to help relocate facilities from the Mississippi River \nGulf Outlet, both private and public, so we can close the Mississippi \nRiver Gulf Outlet, which is also, hopefully, going to be part of this \nbill, some work on the western side of our State, the Calcasieu River \nand Pass and rock bank protection, and there is a lock project around \nthe capital city, to mention a few.\n  The bottom line is, there is about $2.5 billion in this bill for \nLouisiana projects. It sounds like a lot, and it is. We are proud of \nthe 8 years of work that have gone into building this WRDA bill, \nthrough past Congresses\n\n[[Page S6042]]\n\nand now this one. Under the leadership of Senator Boxer, she has \ncommitted to work with her colleague, Mr. Oberstar, on the House side \nto get a WRDA bill to the President's desk for him to sign. It doesn't \ndo us any good to keep talking about a WRDA bill.\n  The only good that will come of this bill is if we can actually get \nit to the President's desk, get him to sign it, and get these projects \nunderway. The people of Louisiana have waited for 8 years through any \nnumber of hurricanes, not the least of which in the last 2 years, we \nhave had the unbelievable challenge of dealing with Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita, the first and third largest hurricanes in terms of disaster \nand impact to ever hit this country. We are still fighting to rebuild \nand reeling from the damage of those storms. As I have said many times, \nit wasn't just the multiple levees that collapsed, it was really a \nFederal flood more than a hurricane that did us in. It was the multiple \nfailure of levees that should have been maintained, should have been \nstronger, should have been higher, and were not.\n  It is also because of the loss of great wetlands. I would like to \nshare what a healthy wetland looks like, with cyprus trees and land \nwhere you can do a little swimming and boating and fishing--not, of \ncourse, a lot of walking and building. This wetland stretches from east \nof New Orleans to the Sabine River pass, which separates Louisiana and \nTexas. This is a lot of what our coast looks like. This doesn't look \nlike a Florida beach or the Biloxi beach or the North Carolina beach. \nWe actually don't have any beaches in Louisiana. We actually only have \ntwo. That is a little bit of a fib. We do have two. One is 7 miles \nlong, and it is called Grand Isle, and the other one is Holly Beach. \nThe rest of our coast basically looks like this. You can't even get to \nit because there are only two roads, two lanes each. We don't have any \ninterstate highways on our coast. We have two two-lane roads, one down \nthe east side of our State and one down the west. They basically dead-\nend into swampland. This is not wasteland. This is beautiful land. It \nnurtures migratory birds. It is 40 percent of the nurseries of the gulf \ncoast, extraordinary wetlands we are trying to preserve. Without this \nbill, it will be impossible.\n  I would like to show a poster. I see Senator Coburn here, and I will \nfinish in just a moment. I will resume after his comments.\n  As Senator Boxer knows, because she came down and flew over these \nwetlands--I am so grateful to my colleague from California, the \nchairman of this committee, for coming to fly over these wetlands--we \nflew over New Orleans, which is right here, and out to the coast. We \ngot to see some of these wetlands. This is the coast of Louisiana. The \nred spots are land loss just since Katrina and Rita, the land loss from \nthe storm. A lot of it is St. Bernard Parish, lower Plaquemine Parish, \nand then over this way, which is where Hurricane Rita made landfall. So \nhurricanes exacerbate an already difficult situation. But because we \nhave been putting navigation channels through these wetlands, we have \nbeen allowing for shipping, which is appropriate, but you have to have \nthe right locks and dams and water control structures. Because mostly \nwe have blocked the great Mississippi River, which is the largest river \nsystem on our continent, from naturally overflowing so that we could \nship the grain out of the Midwest, so we could ship products from \nCanada down to the midsection of our country, this delta is starved for \nsediment. We don't have a choice.\n  I am going to end now by saying that this WRDA bill, as far as \nLouisiana is concerned, is the bill that is going to reverse this \ndecline and start us on a path of safety for the residents, of \nprotection for the environment, and of laying down the foundation for a \ngreat economy, which we need to do. We can't shut off this part of the \nNation and call it quits. We can't shut down the refining capacity and \noil and gas. We have to make it work. We can. It is going to take good \nscience, long commitments, and more than this WRDA bill. But this \nlegislation is a start.\n  In a few minutes, after Senator Coburn speaks, I will lay down an \namendment that will lay the foundation for the category 5 protection we \nneed. We do not expect, in Louisiana, this Congress to pick up the \nwhole tab. We most certainly do not expect this Congress to pick up the \ntab in this bill. But we would like to lay the beginning foundation, \nknowing the people of Louisiana and Mississippi and Texas will pay our \nown way as well. The independent stream of revenue we now have from \noffshore oil and gas revenues can contribute to this project which is \ngoing to be several decades, and it will take anywhere from $30 to $50 \nbillion. But there is no alternative. It is expensive, but the cost of \ndoing nothing is even more.\n  Let me yield the floor for the Senator from Oklahoma who was \nscheduled before me. I will return to the debate at a later time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have a couple amendments I will be \noffering in a few minutes. I wanted to spend a moment or two talking \nabout priorities.\n  The work on the WRDA bill has been very important. I am supportive of \nus keeping our obligations, especially in Louisiana for the tremendous \nproblems they have encountered. There is a legitimate role for the \nFederal Government as a partner with the people of Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Texas in terms of restoration and also prevention so \nthat we don't see the same things again. The WRDA bill is an important \nbill for a lot of States on a lot of projects, many of which have come \nabout because the Federal Government has overreached in some of its \nauthority and demanded things of States they can no longer afford to \ndo. That is where we sit today. That is the consequence sometimes of \nhaving a Federal Government that is a little bit bigger than what the \nConstitution envisioned and what our Forefathers envisioned as \nappropriate.\n  Let me talk about the process for a minute. The chairman asked me a \nmoment ago if I was going to offer any other amendments other than \namendments on this bill. I told her no, and I will not. But I think it \nis important for the American people to consider what we are doing here \ntoday. It is important work, but it certainly is not as important as \nfunding our troops. We have asked American families and their children \nwho are serving in the armed services to do a very difficult job. It is \nvery controversial at this time. But regardless of where you are on \nthat job, the fact that we continue to produce bills and not address \ntheir needs seems somewhat out of context for where we should be. It \nhas been almost 60 days since the President asked for the additional \nfunding. We have passed the COMPETES Act, spending money on the future, \nbut we can't seem to pass the money for our troops in harm's way. We \npassed an FDA reauthorization with PDUFA for making sure drugs get \ncleared, but we can't seem to produce a consensus that our troops will \nbe funded with the necessities they require since they are in harm's \nway. I find it ironic that we would do anything other than that.\n  When I look at the Constitution, our No. 1 priority is defense. \nWhether or not we agree with the foreign policy ongoing today, we all \nagree we don't want our troops to be in any way placed in harm's way \nbecause of our lack of action. That is a justified criticism today \nwhich may come true, that American troops are hampered because we \ncannot pass a bill. I won't offer that amendment, although I think that \nis what we should be discussing, rather than the WRDA bill.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Inhofe and Boxer, for their work on \nthis bill. I know it means a lot to a lot of communities that don't \nhave the resources to accomplish the things they need to. However, one \nof the things I am concerned about is priorities. Last year, we had a \ndebate on the emergency status of funding the levees in Sacramento. I \nhad offered an amendment. I talked with the Governor of California, \nwith the two Senators from California. Ultimately, I withdrew that \nbecause I became convinced that, in fact, it was an emergency. It still \nis. Sacramento is the largest town in this country that is at major \nrisk for a flood. The Corps of Engineers uses years for an event, and \nSacramento sits at 85 years, the likelihood that 1 out of the next 85 \nyears, Sacramento will be flooded, whereas New Orleans today, even \npost-Katrina, has a 1-in-250-year risk of being flooded again.\n\n[[Page S6043]]\n\n  As we look at the WRDA bill, one of the things we ought to think \nabout is how do we prioritize to make sure that where there is a \nlegitimate Government role, we actually spend the money on that role. \nThere is a lot of money in this bill. Granted, this is an authorization \nbill which will put forward a lot of new projects, some of which we \nknow the cost and some we don't.\n  I remind my colleagues, right now we have enough work for the Corps \nof Engineers for the next 50 years, if we don't give them another job \nto do on their budget. In this bill, we are going to give them several \nmore major projects and not the appropriate funding to do them. One of \nthe reasons we will not give them the appropriate funding is because we \ndon't have the money because, No. 1, we have $200 billion a year in \nwaste, fraud, and duplication in the money we appropriate presently, \nwhich the Senate and the Congress refuse to look at, and No. 2, because \nof the limitations we have in terms of the magnitude of the jobs we put \nbefore the Corps.\n  If you look at priorities in terms of what is important, California \nhas several projects in this, as do several other States. You ask: What \nare the priorities? You say: We as a family have so many things we have \nto do. Should we do the most important ones first? If families have a \nroof they need to put on the house, it is highly unlikely they will \nbuild a swimming pool. They are going to fix the roof first and then \nsave for the swimming pool. We don't do that in terms of many of the \npriorities in this bill.\n  Myself and seven other Members voted against going ahead with this \nbill for two reasons. No. 1 is the intent, although the details were \nnot followed in terms of the new earmark proposals in the bill. No. 2 \nis that we think the priorities are out of whack.\n  I do have a couple of amendments I will offer.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1089 to Amendment No. 1065\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and \namendment 1089 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1089 to amendment No. 1065\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prioritize Federal spending to ensure the needs of \n  Louisiana residents who lost their homes as a result of Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita are met before spending money to design or construct a \n                     nonessential visitors center)\n\n       On page 209, line 1, strike ``The'' and insert ``Subject to \n     paragraph (5), the''.\n       On page 210, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       (5) Requirement.--No Federal funds shall be used to conduct \n     any study, or to carry out any activity relating to the \n     design or construction, of the visitors center under this \n     subsection until the date on which the Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency, the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development, and the State of Louisiana, certifies to \n     Congress that all residents of the State of Louisiana who \n     were displaced as a result of Hurricane Katrina or Rita in \n     2005 are no longer living in temporary housing.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This is a simple amendment. It says that there are \n100,000 people from Louisiana today in temporary housing. We have \nfailed to move them from temporary housing into other housing.\n  There are, in this bill, plans and studies for a new visitor center \nto be set up in Morgan City, which will be a great thing for the area \nof Louisiana. I do not doubt that. The purpose of this amendment is to \nsay we should not spend any money on that until we get the people \naffected by Katrina back into housing instead of temporary housing.\n  So it is not necessarily a criticism, although I generally have \ncriticisms of the Federal Government's role in providing visitor \ncenters for tourism, et cetera, in the States. More importantly, it is \nabout priorities, of whether we ought to take care of those people who \nhave been markedly impaired in their housing opportunities, which \nultimately affects their ability to earn a living in Louisiana, before \nwe build another visitor center, before we spend any money on it. We \nattempted to try to find out how much this visitor center would cost, \nand nobody could tell us. But the point is, we probably should not \nspend a penny on that until we have taken care of the people in \nLouisiana.\n  If you look at the stories that continue to come out--and Senator \nLandrieu has been a champion in this body of making sure the rest of \nthe Members of this body are aware of the continuing needs of Louisiana \nfor housing--we should not spend any money on anything other than those \ncritical needs for the people of Louisiana. When those are met, then we \ngo and build a visitor center. We do not do it at the same time. To do \nit at the same time says there is no limit on the amount of funds we \nhave, and we know there are. So we should not put this forward.\n  This amendment does not take away the visitor center, it does not \neliminate the visitor center; it just says you cannot spend any money \non it until we have taken care of people in Louisiana and their \nhousing. It is very simple, very straightforward, but puts a priority, \nmuch like you and I put a priority on what our needs are. One of our \nbig failures in this body is picking priorities. If we had unlimited \nfunds, we would not need to do that, but we do not have unlimited \nfunds. Our true deficit was far in excess of $300 billion last year, \nalthough we claimed it was under $200 billion by Enron-style \naccounting. But, in fact, we added $300 billion to our children's and \ngrandchildren's debt.\n  So this is just a little, small amendment that says we should not do \nthis until we have taken care of the obligations that are in front of \nus in terms of people's lives. When we have done that, then go for it, \ngo do it, but do not do it ahead of those people. When people cannot \nhave services, cannot have what they need, who have been displaced by a \nnatural disaster the likes of which we have never seen before in this \ncountry, we should not spend one penny on thing other than taking care \nof them. Once they are taken care of--a legitimate Federal role, to \nmake sure the environment for housing has been created so Louisiana can \nget back on its feet--then we ought to do that. So we are not \neliminating it. We are just saying, do not spend the money, there is no \nauthorization until you have met and it has been certified that the \nhousing needs of those who are in temporary housing today--trailers, \ntens and tens of thousands of people are still living in trailers, who \nstill do not have access to housing--do not do that until you have met \nthat need. It is very simple.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator to yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. COBURN. Certainly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, is the Senator now going to go to the \nsecond amendment?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I plan on it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, would it be wise to have the Senator from \nLouisiana respond now, and then the floor would go back to the Senator \nfor the next amendment?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would be fine with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me respond to my colleague. I want \nto begin by first thanking my colleague from Oklahoma for his time and \nfocus. He has come down to our State. He has viewed the damage. As you \ncan tell, Mr. President, he is most familiar with our situation. He is \nabsolutely correct, we have a great deal of work to do.\n  This particular visitor center, like several others, is not just for \nextra recreation, I say to my colleague. This is the heart and soul of \ntourism in this region. We do not have big cities like New York and \nChicago in this region. Maybe they are somewhat like the Senator's \ncities in Oklahoma. They are small communities, but they are important \ncommunities. Throughout the southern part of our State, as I have shown \non the maps, we do not have large communities but communities of 15,000 \nor 10,000, for example, high up on a ridge, surrounded by levees.\n  We are proud of these great wetlands. We want people to come see \nthem. So it is not just saving them for the birds and the fish, which \nis very important, but it is actually saving them for the benefit of \nthe people who live there, who want to be able to recreate on them, and \nwe want to share them with the world.\n\n[[Page S6044]]\n\n  I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, we think the more people can \nactually get their eyes on this problem, the more support we can get \nfor doing the right things to preserve them, to taper down on \nunnecessary and unwanted development, to scale up the investments in \nthe right kinds of levees and structures, that will help us preserve it \nover time.\n  So while I know on first blush it may seem to the Senator as if this \nis a frivolous expenditure, I would say this is part of a very \ncomprehensive approach Louisiana has to save the wetlands. I do not \nthink--I will be happy to submit for the Record the total cost because \nI most certainly can get that for the Senator--it is going to amount to \nvery much money, but it is an important aspect of our redevelopment \nthat has to do with science, with engineering, with the environment, \nwith the basic industries, and with tourism and the education of people \nabout what wetlands are.\n  I say to the Senator, as I said, one of the difficulties Senator \nVitter and I are having in trying to explain this to the Nation is \nthere are virtually no other shores in the country like this. There are \nlow-lying areas, of course, in South Carolina and North Carolina, and \nmarshes, but there is virtually no other delta like this in the \ncountry. So people literally have not been able to see it.\n  When you see something like a beach in Florida, the wonderful coast \nin California, which many of us have been to, or to Long Island in the \nHamptons, in New York, when you have seen that with your own eyes, you \ncan appreciate it, and you can understand it. The only way to get to \nthe coast of Louisiana is literally by boat or by air, except for those \ntwo little highways I spoke about: LA1 on the east side and Holly Beach \nRoad on the west side.\n  So having this center--I would like to show you where it might be, if \nI can find a picture of the Atchafalaya. I am not sure I have one. Let \nme show you the original picture I started with. I will show it, not to \nmake too much of this because it is just a small education center. The \ncenter would allow people to come down into this wetlands area and see \nsome of the great Atchafalaya Basin that is sort of the last standing \nCyprus swamp in the country. So again, it is a small item.\n  I object to the Senator taking it out of this bill, but I want him to \nknow this is not because we do not think it is important to put people \nin housing and to build levees. We are doing all that and doing it as \nfast as we can, trying to reduce redtape, but we do think these \neducational centers which we are building serve a significant and \nimportant purpose. I do believe the State has already contributed in \nkind, as well as the local parish.\n  So I will leave my argument there and at the appropriate time come \nback to this subject.\n  I yield the floor, but I would like to speak sometime later this \nafternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I would like to make some comments. First of all, we do not take this \nout. We do not eliminate it. We just say there ought to be a priority \non the funds, and the funds for housing ought to come ahead of this. \nNo. 2 is, 3 years ago, a new visitor center was opened for this very \npurpose for the Atchafalaya Basin, which is the focus of the new \nvisitor center. This just opened 3 years ago.\n  Again, in a quote from it: Smack dab in the center of the Atchafalaya \nBasin is a very welcoming site for those traveling on Interstate 10. \nThe Atchafalaya Welcome Center is open seven days a week from 8:30 to \n5. The center is located off Interstate 10 at exit 121. It is a first \nclass facility, quite impressive, with historical information within \nthe walls. It is an Acadian-style cottage museum. Outside, wildlife and \nnature will take you back in time.\n  It was completed in June 2004. It has many of the same things the \nSenator wants to support. There are also two other visitor centers in \nMorgan City, so it is not that there is not some process out there \nalready to do that.\n  Again, the point is not to eliminate this visitor center. The point \nis to say, shouldn't we have a priority--before we allow money to go \nfor another visitor center where there is already one that has just \nopened 3 years ago, shouldn't we have the people who need housing taken \ncare of? So I will stand with that and will not continue the debate on \nthat.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1090 to Amendment No. 1065\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and call up amendment No. 1090.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1090 to amendment No. 1065.\n\n  Mr. Coburn. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prioritize Federal spending to ensure the residents of the \n   city of Sacramento are protected from the threat of floods before \n          spending money to add sand to beaches in San Diego)\n\n       On page 11, strike line 5 and insert the following:\n       (6) Imperial beach, California.--\n       (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the\n       On page 11, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       (B) Requirement.--No Federal funds shall be used for beach \n     nourishment for Imperial Beach, California, until the date on \n     which the Secretary certifies to Congress that the Sacramento \n     River Bank Protection Project has been completed.\n  Mr. COBURN. This, again, is for the restoration of beaches. It is a \n30- or 40-year project, which I do not object to on its face. I love \nbeaches. I take my family to Florida. I noticed recently they restored \nbeaches down there. Again, the question is priorities. We have a tough \ntime setting priorities. We take authorizations bills, we don't look at \nthem. What we do is we get them authorized and then we fight like heck \nwhen the appropriations time comes around to get our projects funded.\n  The Sacramento levee system, according to the Corps of Engineers, is \none of the most important projects they have in terms of reducing risk \nfor people at risk of flood. We had a debate on this floor less than a \nyear ago with the Senators from California. I talked to the Governor of \nCalifornia. I had attempted to strip out some of the funding of an \nemergency bill for emergency funds for the Corps of Engineers for this \nbasin and for these levees. They convinced me with their argument that \nwas a high priority. I actually withdrew my amendment. I did not ask \nfor a vote on it.\n  We have a WRDA bill that has this in it, and then we have a beach \nrestoration project, over which there is some significant debate in \nterms of Imperial Beach in southern California, restoring that beach \nover the next 40 to 50 years, with intermittent projects every 4 to 5 \nyears, pumping sand to restore the beach. I am not against that, \neither. But what I think we have to do is set a priority.\n  Why shouldn't the priority be that we protect the people of \nSacramento and finish the levee system? The answer will be: We can do \nboth. Well, we really cannot do both. We will do both probably, but we \ncannot do both. We cannot do both with the money we have. So then it \ncomes to: Where are the priorities? We will have this debate again when \nthe bills come forward in the appropriations process, of where the \npriority is. We will probably fund both these projects. But when the \nAmerican taxpayers ask: Now, which one is most important, which one is \na true Federal responsibility, which one is a State responsibility, \nthey are going to want some answers. When asked about protecting a \nmajor city such as Sacramento with a levee system that the Corps of \nEngineers designed, which was substandard to begin with, and redoing \nthat to make sure we protect all these people, or letting the State of \nCalifornia restore its own beaches from sand erosion, I believe the \nvast majority of Americans will say: As to the beach, probably the \nlocal community can afford to do that. They get the benefits off of it. \nThey get the property taxes off of it. They get the tourism off of it. \nBut Sacramento is a different story. It is something the Federal \nGovernment started. It is something the Federal Government is \nresponsible for, and something the Federal Government should respond to \nand finish.\n\n[[Page S6045]]\n\n  Senator Feinstein, in our debate last year, noted that the bottom \nline is that human life and property hangs in the balance based on the \nsustainability of these levees. I think that is right. I do not think \nhuman life stands in the balance on restoring the beaches, which is \nreally a State responsibility.\n  What we are going to do in this bill is we are going to take taxpayer \nmoney. We are actually going to borrow the money to do it. We are not \ngoing to do it out of the regular budget. We are going to pay for \nsomething that is a State responsibility. The other factor that comes \ninto it is that every State in the Union, save one, has a surplus this \nyear. We have a $300 billion deficit, if we are honest. So, again, it \ncomes back: is it great if we have extra money, if we aren't borrowing \nthe money for the future? Should we do this at the same time? I would \nagree.\n\n  The fact is, we don't want to make the hard choices. We don't want to \ntell anybody no, not now. What we want to do is be able to have both. \nWe can satisfy people today, but the people who will be dissatisfied \nwith the generational collar that we put around them will be our kids \nand grandkids as they repay the cost of out not prioritizing things, \nnot looking at things that are most important, and otherwise not \nstanding up to the line and doing what we should be doing, which is \nmaking the hard choices of priorities.\n  One of the things I think the American citizenry is upset with, as \nmuch as the war or more, is the fact that it seems as if we don't care \nabout the future. We will throw money at anything, money we don't have.\n  So these two amendments I bring to the floor today are not big. They \nmay not pass, but they are based on a principle. The principle is to be \na good steward. We all, in our own personal lives, with our own money, \nhave to make priorities. We have to put that roof on before we do \nsomething else to the house. We have to make a choice about where the \nfirst dollar should go. Unfortunately, sometimes we do a poor job of \nthat in the Congress.\n  I believe, from the way this Senator sees it, securing the levees \nought to be a much higher priority than restoring beach that can be \nrestored by a local community or the State of California. It is not \ntruly a Federal responsibility.\n  I have studied a great deal about the beach restoration project. They \nhave a general plan. What has happened to them has been out of their \ncontrol, the Tijuana River in terms of how it has been blockaded and \ndammed and the amount of sand that filters in and that is available for \nthe beach. Several attempts at growing structures had been made in \n1978. A plan was put forth that would have restored it. It did not meet \nthe environmental impact statement. It was abandoned at that time.\n  What we know and what is predicted by those who have watched this--\nespecially Orrin Pikley, the director of the program for the State \nDevelopmental Shorelines at Duke University--is that we shouldn't be \nnourishing the beaches. President Clinton, much to his credit, saw the \nneed for the States to take a greater burden in financing beach \nnourishment, and he proposed eliminating all funding for nourishment \nprojects and studies, and he reduced the Federal share to 35 percent on \nany projects that weren't ongoing.\n  Where is the responsibility? Who is going to pay for it? It is easy \nto spend your money. It is easy to not tell anybody no. But the fact \nis, when we get down to the long and the short of it, we can't do \neverything everybody wants to do. I know a lot of people were told no \nin this bill about things they want to do, but we do some of it, to be \nfair. But in the long run, lives, safety, and housing have to take \nprecedence over convenience and recreation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment. I would like to lay down the reasons why.\n  First, I do want to thank Senator Coburn because he was very \naccommodating to both Senator Inhofe and me by coming here on a Monday \nafternoon and putting these amendments down so we could begin the \ndebate and hopefully vote on them tomorrow. I do appreciate that. It \nmeans a lot to us as managers because we worked long and hard on this \nbill.\n  Before I tell my colleagues why I call this amendment the Russian \nroulette amendment, let me just say I have supported Senator Coburn on \nmany of his amendments where he is looking at the fiscally responsible \nthing to do, and I will continue to do so when I think those amendments \nmake sense, and I am sure there will be more. But I do want to call to \nthe Senator's attention, if you step back from this particular \namendment, which I strongly disagree with--I think it is dangerous, and \nI will go into that in a minute. If you step back and look at the whole \npicture of this bill, we should be very proud that working together, \nRepublicans and Democrats, we took a bill that was scored at about $31 \nbillion down to a bill that is about $13.9 billion because we really \ndid apply some strict standards to this bill.\n  There are no projects in this bill that are giveaways or handouts or \nmake somebody's beachfront pretty. That is nonsense because neither \nside would approve of that.\n  I also want to make a point--because I think Senator Feingold made \nthis point very well, although I disagreed with him and we had a bit of \na debate on it last week--that when colleagues use the word \n``prioritize,'' that we should ``prioritize,'' and then they offer \nthese amendments, they are putting out their priorities. That is not \nsubjective. It is not subjective if I put out my priorities next to \nSenator Coburn's, next to Senator Feingold's, next to Senator Inhofe's. \nThat is objective. I think the Presiding Officer who is now sitting in \nthe chair knows because she sits on the committee that has jurisdiction \nover this bill. It is hard. We battle it out for what the right \npriorities should be.\n  Now, as I told Senator Feingold last week when we had a debate, \nbecause he is offering an amendment dealing with prioritization and \nsetting up a whole new way to prioritize this project, let's look at \nthis process in which we are engaged because I think the Senator--the \nreason I believe the Senator is on weak ground is because he seems to \nbe ignoring what has gone on before he got involved.\n  First of all, these projects start from the local governments up, and \nthe local governments and the communities get together and say: We have \na very rough situation and we pay Federal taxes and we would like to \nmake a partnership to protect lives and property and businesses. From \nthere, they put up their fair share. They have to be willing to put up \ntheir fair share. So this isn't Uncle Sam paying for all this. This is \na joint effort, and they have to come forward and the various \ncommittees of jurisdiction approve a study.\n  Now, when these studies are looked at, I say to my friend, there is a \ncost-benefit ratio involved, and sometimes it is very tough on \ncolleagues because they think they are going to get a project and \nrealize it just doesn't add up. So everything before us that has passed \nmuster, the local government, the local people, they pick up the share, \nand it has to be funded with a study. And that study, as I said, has to \ncome in and show that this makes sense, and then it goes to the various \ncommittees or the administration will fund it. There is an \nenvironmental impact statement that goes along with all this. They are \nconsidered again in WRDA. I guess this is the chance for colleagues to \nsay: We don't like this project or that, and we are having this debate. \nIt is the Senator's absolute right to choose and pick what he thinks \nare not priorities. I understand. So after we pass it here, it then has \nto go forward and get appropriated as well.\n\n  This bill has been 7 years in the making. We have cut it more than in \nhalf. I think it is a proud product.\n  I would say to my colleague, the reason I say the amendment is \nplaying Russian roulette is this: We don't know when a hurricane, a \nstorm, is going to come up and hit us in the face. It may come in the \nnorthern part of my State, I say to my friend. I have a coastal State. \nI have a State that is beautiful. We have more beauty per square inch--\nof course, I am not subjective on the point--than I think any other \nState. We have 37 million people. We have a real problem. The fact is, \nwe can't just do one thing--Sacramento--and not take care of all the \nother things.\n  I so appreciate my friend's coming around with us on the Sacramento\n\n[[Page S6046]]\n\nissue. I cannot tell my colleagues what it means to me because, as he \nnow knows, we have to take care of Sacramento. It is low lying. It is a \npotential catastrophe. He is absolutely right to call attention to the \nlevees. We have to do all that.\n  But the reason I say his amendment is Russian roulette is because it \nis essentially counting on the fact that we are not going to have this \nproblem in Imperial Beach. I want to say this is not a beach project; \nthis is a hurricane and storm damage reduction project. This is not \nabout making somebody's property pretty to look at. This is serious \nbusiness.\n  And speaking of business, if we don't do this work--the locals are \ngoing to pay, in the beginning, 30 percent and then 50 percent. If we \ndon't take care of it, business is going to get the floods and it is \ngoing to be wiped out. So I wish I could say to my friend all I need is \none flood control project in Sacramento and be done with it, but with \n37 million people and an economy that if we were a separate Nation \nwould be the fifth or sixth largest in the world, obviously California \nneeds so much.\n  Now, we have stressed Louisiana and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. \nSenator Inhofe and I pulled aside a lot of people and said: Look, we \nhave to come together to help that region. But we also have a backlog \nof 7 years' worth of work. In the case of Imperial Beach, this project \ngot started in 2007, and the people are waiting. The city of Imperial \nBeach is home to 26,000 people. Four thousand of its residents live \nwithin two to three blocks of the shoreline. It is located near San \nDiego, just to give everybody a picture, and the beaches and the sand \ndunes act as a buffer to protect residential and commercial properties. \nIt is a defense. It is a defense against storms and storm surge. If we \ndon't do that, we would be building walls, a very expensive way to get \nthat hurricane damage reduction.\n  So nature provides our coastal communities with natural protection \nfrom violent storms and the waves they produce. In the Northeast it is \nthe high rocky cliffs. From the Mid-Atlantic around the Gulf of Mexico, \nit is the wide, sandy beaches. In Louisiana, it is miles of wetlands. \nThat is why both our colleagues, Senators Vitter and Landrieu, talk a \nlot about wetlands restoration, which we do in this, because that is \nthe natural flood control, just as the beaches and the bluffs are \nnatural flood control that God gave us.\n  The coast of my State is particularly prone to strong winter storms \nthat blow in from the Pacific. During the El Nino years, storms can be \nespecially dangerous. That is why I say Russian roulette. We are \nplaying Russian roulette. This is not some project that sprung up \nbecause some individual looked out and said: You know, I want more \nbeach in front of my house. No. It has nothing to do with that. It is a \ndangerous situation. The public is going to be paying for half of this.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers said 100,000 cubic yards per year is \neroding from the beach, corresponding to a shoreline retreat rate of 6 \nfeet per year. There is adequate protection from winter coastal storms. \nThat is what the Army Corps of Engineers said. That is not me speaking. \nI am not an engineer. I respect what they say.\n  I know my friend says he is not striking this, he is just saying it \nis more important to do Sacramento first. We need to do all of it. We \nneed to do this bill. We need to take care of our people in this bill \nwherever they live--east, west, the north of my State, the South, East \nor West of the country, Midwest--wherever they are, wherever they need \nhelp.\n  At the current retreat rate, the shoreline in the northern portion of \nthe area could reach the first line of development this year--this \nyear. That is why this bill is so needed. It is needed now--not next \nyear, not after they finish Sacramento or after they finish Hurricane \nKatrina. We shouldn't be picking and choosing. We should be having an \nabsolutely firm commitment to making sure every one of these projects \nfits the benchmarks we have set in a bipartisan way, meet the \nbenchmarks, meet the criteria, and not punish people and say, gee, you \npeople in Imperial Beach, you are paying and we are going to pay 50 \npercent out, but we are stopping because a lot of miles away in another \npart of the country, or this State, other people need help and they are \nmore important than you. I don't think that is right.\n\n  We are Senators. We are Senators of all the people. We have to look \nat their needs. Absolutely, prioritizing is key. I have shown my \ncolleague how we prioritize through this process and how we cut back \nthe costs of this bill. The beaches, the coastline, the protective \nbuffer is literally washing away.\n  (Ms. Klobuchar assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the restoration project in this bill solve the \nproblem of Imperial Beach?\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is considered a 50-year fix.\n  Mr. COBURN. It is a 50-year fix only if they continue to do the work \nevery 5 years, correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, of course, all projects have to be maintained.\n  Mr. COBURN. According to the Corps, every 5 years we will pump the \nsame amount of sand up there, and in 50 years we will be doing the same \nthing again. This isn't a long-term fix; this is a short-term fix, \naccording to the Corps, not according to anybody else. They have to do \nthe same thing every 5 years to maintain the status quo; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No. The initial project consists of 1.214 million cubic \nmeters of sand, resulting in a total beach with 32 meters beyond the \nexisting beach line. That is the first phase. To get to your point, it \nis estimated that once every 10 years, over the 50-year life of the \nproject, they would replenish, not every 5 years.\n  Mr. COBURN. Every 10 years, they are going to have to bring back the \nsand the ocean naturally washes away from the beach because we have not \ndone what needs to be done, which is a long, extended growing, to help \nthe beach replenish itself.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me say, we continue to maintain the dams in Oklahoma, \ntoo. So whether you are maintaining a dam or maintaining this kind of \nproject, yes, you have to take care of your house, your home, your \nproject. This isn't a free lunch for anybody. The local people have to \npay for that as well.\n  So the reason the Corps recommended this particular project is they \nsay it is very cost effective, it provides a lot of protection for \nthese people, and it has a very high cost benefit. For every dollar put \nin, the American people get $1.70 in return, and few projects can claim \nsuch a return.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would not know how to argue with that. Would the \nSenator yield for a moment, and I will finish up?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I am delighted.\n  Mr. COBURN. The difference between this and a dam is a dam is put \nthere to control water or generate power. They have to be maintained. \nThe way to fix this, according to the people we have talked to, is the \noriginal Corps plan is to put the money into an extended growing until \nthe beach redevelops and replenishes itself. We will continue to do \nthis every 10 years. I am not saying that is not a good priority, but \nit is not a priority like many of the other things.\n  I have a letter that I received from Dr. Serge Dedina, executive \ndirector of WiLDCOAST, supporting our amendment and asking that this \nmoney be placed secondary to the efforts in Sacramento because their \nstudies show one winter storm will wash away what this money was spent \nfor. In fact, this isn't the best plan, although it is a plan and--\nagain, if I was there, I would want this beach maintained and restored. \nBut I understand the desire for it. I understand the priorities for it. \nI understand the decisions that have been made in terms of lessening \npriorities that weren't included in that bill.\n  I appreciate the time the chairman of the committee has given me to \noffer these amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 14, 2007.\n       Dear Senator Coburn: Please accept this endorsement for \n     your amendment to the WRDA that would require that residents \n     of Sacramento be protected from the threat of floods by the \n     completion of the Sacramento River Bank Protection Program \n     before federal funds are spent to add sand to beaches in San \n     Diego (Imperial Beach) .\n\n[[Page S6047]]\n\n       WiLDCOAST represents the interests of Imperial Beach \n     taxpayers who are solidly opposed to any public expenditures \n     on beach replenishment projects in Imperial Beach. We have \n     been informed by City of Imperial Beach staff that federally \n     funded beach sand projects are designed to ``enhance private \n     property.''\n       Our Beach Sand Stakeholder Advisory Group is formed of \n     local Imperial Beach business owners and coastal engineering \n     technical experts who all agree that the effort to have U.S. \n     Taxpayers fund Imperial Beach sand replenishment is an \n     absolute waste of scarce federal dollars. It has been \n     scientifically proven that millions of dollars of sand that \n     would be dumped on the beach of Imperial Beach would wash \n     away in a single winter storm.\n       We appreciate your support for stopping wasteful \n     expenditures of scarce federal dollars through badly planned \n     and flawed sand replenishment projects in Imperial Beach, \n     California.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Serge Dedina,\n                                    Executive Director, WiLDCOAST.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask where we are now. Senator Coburn \nhas two pending amendments; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We now have Senator Feingold's amendment pending on \nprioritization and two Coburn amendments; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. I feel like I want to respond for a couple of minutes \nmore to this amendment and say that my colleague says: Oh, my goodness, \nevery 10 years you have to do more work. As I say, the Corps found that \nthis is the most economical and sustainable way to resolve this \nproblem. He talks about beaches--what were his words--being washed \naway. Yes, beaches will be washed away. We expect that, and every 10 \nyears we will restore the beach. But it is better that that happens \nthan houses washing away, businesses washing away or people washing \naway. So we have looked at the other options, such as concrete \nstructures, walls--all very expensive and requiring a lot of \nmaintenance and so on.\n  So we have a situation where the city is paying for 35 percent of the \ninitial part of the project, 50 percent for the rest of the project. \nThe city of Imperial Beach is not looking for a handout, but it is \nsharing the burden of protecting its people.\n  Again, I don't quite understand the prioritization of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, or why he picks on this particular project. This is a \nproject that is more cost effective than any other alternative. It is \none of the most cost effective in the Nation. We feel very good about \nit. But just as Louisiana's wetlands restoration will lessen impacts of \nhurricanes, because the wetlands are that natural absorber of the water \nand they also lessen the power of the hurricane, we are here using the \nGod-given beaches as a way to do this flood control or, better said, \nhurricane impact reduction. So we learned from Hurricane Katrina that \nwe should address our flood threats before they materialize.\n  We are worried about this particular community. I am very pleased \nthat this particular project certainly wasn't even controversial when \nwe put together our package because it so clearly fits all the criteria \nwe had in place. My colleague is saying don't do this until you do \nSacramento, and it doesn't make any sense to me because we need to do \nit all. That is the point of the WRDA bill--to take care of as many \npeople as we can, and that we can project with the most stringent \ncriteria that we have. So this ``Russian roulette'' amendment plays \nwith the fate of my community. I think Senator Coburn's other \namendment, which would strike a blow at the tourism revival in \nLouisiana, is also an ill-fated amendment.\n  The reason I was so glad he came over this afternoon is I am hoping \nwe can have votes on these three amendments tomorrow. If we send a \nsignal that the members of the committee are sticking together on this \nin a bipartisan way and we are going to move this forward, I think it \nwould be very good for the bill.\n  I look forward to Senator Inhofe's arrival. He has had a very \ngrueling weekend in Iraq. I don't know exactly when he will arrive. At \nthis point, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          National Police Week\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, this week, the week of May 14, is \nNational Police Week, and the streets here in Washington, DC are filled \nwith tens of thousands of law enforcement officers, their families, and \ntheir children. This is the week we recognize 17,917 officers whose \nnames are inscribed on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial \nhere on Judiciary Square, all of them people who gave their lives to \nmake our communities a safer place.\n  It is the week we recognize 145 fallen heroes of our Nation lost this \npast year. The people of Alaska give thanks that we did not lose a law \nenforcement officer in the line of duty during 2006. This is also the \nweek we add the names of 237 additional law enforcement officers to the \nmemorial. These are officers who lost their lives in the line of duty \nin generations past but whose stories did not come to light until now. \nOne of those 237 officers is William George Pfalmer, Jr.\n  Officer Pfalmer's career with the Anchorage Police Department came to \nan end on June 9, 1953, when he was shot following a traffic stop of a \nstolen vehicle. He was shot in the left arm and the right shoulder, \nshattering his spine and causing him to spend the remainder of his life \nin a wheelchair. Officer Pfalmer lost his battle to survive those \nwounds on December 26, 1970, at the age of 45, after undergoing one of \nmany corrective surgeries.\n  I rise today in tribute to Officer Pfalmer and I rise to share the \nremarkable story of a present-day Anchorage officer, Officer Cathy \nDiehl Robbins, who made sure Officer Pfalmer's contributions were not \nlost to history. But for Cathy's determined research, the name of \nWilliam George Pfalmer, Jr. might never have been inscribed on the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.\n  When Officer Pfalmer was shot on June 9, 1953, the city of Anchorage \ndid not even pay him a full day's pay. At the time, the city did not \noffer a pension to police officers, nor did it compensate them for \ntheir injuries. Officer Pfalmer, who was 27 years old at the time, \nturned in his badge--which so happened to be badge No. 13--and was left \nto fend for himself. Anchorage is a city well known for its community \nspirit. This was true in 1953, it is true today. Officer Pfalmer was \nnamed Anchorage's Father of the Year, and the community helped to raise \n$13,000 to help the family through their difficult time. But that was \nnot enough to enable the Pfalmer family to remain in Alaska.\n  A World War II Coast Guard veteran, Officer Pfalmer moved his family \nto California where he could receive medical treatment without charge \nfrom the VA. The officer's wife Eleanor was his full-time caregiver. \nThey were tough years financially, but love and commitment held the \nfamily together. Officer Pfalmer kept his family afloat for most of \nthose 17 years by purchasing cars at auto auctions, reconditioning \nthem, and reselling them. His three sons, Glenn, Garry, and Greg, \nhelped out after school repairing the cars under their dad's \nsupervision. The three sons were literally their dad's arms and legs. \nThey all became mechanics, a trade their father taught them.\n  The Pfalmer family assumed that their father's service with the \nAnchorage Police Department was long forgotten, until one day, out of \nthe blue, son Greg received a call from Cathy Diehl Robbins. Cathy, who \nhad been researching the history of the Anchorage Police Department in \nher own time, came across an article of some 10 years earlier. That \narticle led Cathy to believe there was a hero who somehow had fallen \nthrough the cracks. Cathy would not let go and was determined to run \nthe story to the ground. After diligent research, she discovered the \nstory was true. She tracked Greg down on the Internet and learned that \nhis father was the Anchorage police officer\n\n[[Page S6048]]\n\nshe had read about. She wondered whether the officer was still alive \nand, sadly, learned he was not. Cathy then made it her mission to \nensure that Officer Pfalmer's contributions were not forgotten.\n  On June 9, 2006, 53 years after the fateful incident that cost the \nofficer his career, the Anchorage Police Department acknowledged \nOfficer Pfalmer's loss as a line-of-duty death. He was subsequently \nrecognized by the Alaska Peace Officers Memorial, and this year his \nname is inscribed on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.\n  It is fitting that Cathy Diehl Robbins was invited by the National \nLaw Enforcement Officers Fund to read Officer Pfalmer's name at the \nannual candlelight ceremony, which was held last night, Sunday, May 13. \nI am pleased that Garry Pfalmer, one of Officer Pfalmer's three sons, \nwas able to travel from Fairbanks to witness the ceremony.\n  During this National Police Week, we remember fallen officers for the \nway they lived their lives, not the way they gave them. Today, we \nremember Officer Pfalmer not only for the events of June 9, 1953, but \nalso for the support and the inspiration he provided to his family \nduring the next 17 years: a hero at home and a hero in the service of \nour community.\n  During this National Police Week, we recite again and again the \nphrase that ``heroes never die.'' So let us spend a moment to reflect \nupon the life of Officer Pfalmer, and as we do, let us acknowledge the \nefforts of an angel named Cathy Diehl Robbins, who brought the story of \nOfficer Pfalmer back to life.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, it took me a few minutes to get the \ndetails I needed to respond to Senator Coburn. I am sorry for the \ndelay. But I want to continue the debate we had just about 45 minutes \nago on his amendment No. 1089 about which he spoke earlier, and we are \nprepared, I think, to vote on in the morning.\n  I am hoping my good colleague from Oklahoma will think about the \npossibility of withdrawing his amendment because I am going to submit \nsome things for the Record that I think might have a bearing.\n  First of all, I think he offered his amendment in a way to be \nsomewhat critical--although he was very respectful--somewhat critical \nthat the Federal Government would be funding visitors centers before we \nbuild our levees and protections that we need for south Louisiana. I \nwas a little puzzled by that. I went and found the facts.\n  Actually, we are not asking the Federal Government to spend a dime. \nWhat we are asking the Federal Government to do is simply to authorize \na visitors center, type A as opposed to B, so we can be, as I said in \nthe earlier debate, more interpretive--to have a real place where \npeople can come and learn about the wetlands and the entire delta. The \ncost difference between B and A would be absorbed by Louisiana. So the \nSenator's main argument that it would cost the taxpayers of the United \nStates, out of our budget, out of our money, is not accurate. I am not \nsure he understood that, but I think it has real bearing on the debate.\n  Again, in reference to Coburn amendment No. 1089, which is the \nAtchafalaya Basin Project, Eagle Point and Fosse Point Visitors Center, \nit is to simply authorize a larger type, more robust center, if you \nwould, so we can have a kind of interpretive visitors center and \neducation to go on in this part of the State, teaching not only \nourselves in our State and the region but the country about the \nbenefits and really extraordinary value of the wetlands.\n  Madam President, 8,000 visitors a month visit this center, which is \nalready established. Again, it is at no cost to the Federal Government. \nI will speak with Senator Coburn in an effort to see if he can withdraw \nhis amendment. If not, we will continue this debate tomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this document printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Louisiana Atchafalaya Basin Program Project Profiles\n\n       The ultimate goal at Eagle Point Park is to enhance, \n     promote, preserve and protect the ecosystem of the lake and \n     the precious resources of the Atchafalaya Basin.\n       The development of Eagle Point Park will provide a \n     sustainable recreation park facility designed to fulfill the \n     needs of eco-tourism and become a welcomed regional and state \n     amenity. The park's exceptional location near the Atchafalaya \n     Basin will continue to remind visitors of what Louisiana once \n     looked like in its pristine splendor of unbroken forests and \n     swamps. Ultimately, Eagle Point Park will preserve the \n     precious resources of the basin, recover the basin's majesty \n     while managing the human impact, and enhance economic \n     development to surrounding communities and the entire state.\n       The Corps of Engineers is developing a scope of work to \n     produce Plans and Specifications for the Phase I analysis \n     currently underway with the Team of the Corps of Engineers, \n     URS, GSA, Wayne Labiche Engineering, and Sidney Bourgeouis \n     Architects. After completion of this work the Parish will be \n     in a position to advertise and award a construction \n     contract(s) for the Phase I development.\n       Additionally, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is currently \n     considering an aquatic restoration project in Lake Fausse \n     Pointe. The lake has filled in to a depth of 1.5 feet in many \n     places and the warm shallow water is not conducive to fish \n     life. Plans are being considered for dredging a series of \n     sink holes and using the dredge material to build small \n     islands which will provide animal and bird habitat and should \n     eventually provide shade along the banks.\n       Aside from the Educational Value of facilities: State and \n     Federal Agencies would be housed at Morgan City Interpretive \n     Center; LSD will put research lab at the Morgan City \n     Facility; and discussion is ongoing with other agencies for \n     location.\n       It is important to note that Morgan City was the host of a \n     FEMA trailer site, but the site has been closed.\n       8,000 visitors visit the Atchafalaya Basin Floodway each \n     month.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. In addition, Madam President, I referred earlier to a \nWashington Post article, an article written by John Barry. It was an \nopinion piece in Saturday's paper, May 12. I referred to it, but I am \nnot sure that I technically asked for it to be printed in the Record. \nAt this point I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Washington Post, Saturday, May 12, 2007.]\n\n                       Our Coast To Fix--or Lose\n\n                           (By John M. Barry)\n\n       There has been much debate in the past 20 months over \n     protecting Louisiana from another lethal hurricane, but \n     nearly all of it has been conducted without any real \n     understanding of the geological context. Congress and the \n     Bush administration need to recognize six facts that define \n     the national interest.\n       Fact 1: The Gulf of Mexico once reached north to Cape \n     Girardeau, Mo. But the Mississippi River carries such an \n     enormous sediment load that, combined with a falling sea \n     level, it deposited enough sediment to create 35,000 square \n     miles of land from Cape Girardeau to the present mouth of the \n     river.\n       This river-created land includes the entire coast, complete \n     with barrier islands, stretching from Mississippi to Texas. \n     But four human interventions have interfered with this \n     natural process; three of them that benefit the rest of the \n     country have dramatically increased the hurricane threat to \n     the Gulf Coast.\n       Fact 2: Acres of riverbank at a time used to collapse into \n     the river system providing a main source of sediment. To \n     prevent this and to protect lives and property, engineers \n     stopped such collapses by paving hundreds of miles of the \n     river with riprap and even concrete, beginning more than \n     1,000 miles upriver--including on the Ohio, Missouri and \n     other tributaries--from New Orleans. Reservoirs for flood \n     protection also impound sediment. These and other actions \n     deprive the Mississippi of 60 to 70 percent of its natural \n     sediment load, starving the coast.\n       Fact 3: To stop sandbars from blocking shipping at the \n     mouth of the Mississippi, engineers built jetties extending \n     more than two miles out into the Gulf of Mexico. This \n     engineering makes Tulsa, Kansas City, Minneapolis, \n     Cincinnati, Pittsburgh and other cities into ports with \n     direct access to the ocean, greatly enhancing the nation's \n     economy. The river carries 20 percent of the nation's \n     exports, including 60 percent of its grain exports, and the \n     river at New Orleans is the busiest port in the world. But \n     the jetties prevent any of the sediment remaining in the \n     river from replenishing the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts \n     and barrier islands; instead, the jetties drop the sediment \n     off the continental shelf.\n       Fact 4: Levees that prevent river flooding in Louisiana and \n     Mississippi interfere with the replenishment of the land \n     locally as well.\n\n[[Page S6049]]\n\n       Fact 5: Roughly 30 percent of the country's domestic oil \n     and gas production comes from offshore Louisiana, and to \n     service that production the industry created more than 10,000 \n     miles of canals and pipelines through the marsh.\n       Every inch of those 10,000-plus miles lets saltwater \n     penetrate, and eat away at, the coast. So energy production \n     has enormously accelerated what was a slow degradation, \n     transforming a long-term problem into an immediate crisis. \n     The deprivation of sediment is like moving a block of ice \n     from the freezer to the sink, where it begins to melt; the \n     effect of the canals and pipelines is like attacking that ice \n     with an ice pick, breaking it up.\n       As a result, 2,100 square miles of coastal land and barrier \n     islands have melted into the Gulf of Mexico. This land once \n     served as a buffer between the ocean and populated areas in \n     Louisiana and part of Mississippi, protecting them during \n     hurricanes. Each land mile over which a hurricane travels \n     absorbs roughly a foot of storm surge.\n       The nation as a whole gets nearly all the benefits of \n     engineering the river. Louisiana and some of coastal \n     Mississippi get 100 percent of the costs. Eastern New Orleans \n     (including the lower Ninth Ward) and St. Bernard Parish--\n     nearly all of which, incidentally, is at or above sea level--\n     exemplify this allocation of costs and benefits. Three man-\n     made shipping canals pass through them, creating almost no \n     jobs there but benefiting commerce throughout the country. \n     Yet nearly all the 175,000 people living there saw their \n     homes flooded not because of any natural vulnerability but \n     because of levee breaks.\n       Fact 6: Without action, land loss will continue, and it \n     will increasingly jeopardize populated areas, the port system \n     and energy production. This would be catastrophic for \n     America. Scientists say the problem can be solved, even with \n     rising sea levels, but that we have only a decade to begin \n     addressing it in a serious way or the damage may be \n     irreversible.\n       Despite all this and President Bush's pledge from New \n     Orleans in September 2005 that ``we will do what it takes'' \n     to help people rebuild, a draft White House cuts its own \n     recommendation of $2 billion for coastal restoration to $1 \n     billion while calling for an increase in the state's \n     contribution from the usual 35 percent to 50 percent. \n     Generating benefits to the nation is what created the \n     problem, and the nation needs to solve it. Put simply: Why \n     should a cab driver in Pittsburgh or Tulsa pay to fix \n     Louisiana's coast? Because he gets a stronger economy and \n     lower energy costs from it, and because his benefits created \n     the problem. The failure of Congress and the president to act \n     aggressively to repair the coastline at the mouth of the \n     Mississippi River could threaten the economic vitality of the \n     nation. Louisiana, one of the poorest states, can no longer \n     afford to underwrite benefits for the rest of the nation.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Finally, Madam President, I spoke earlier and read some \nitems into the Record. I perhaps read the wrong list. So I am going to \nresubmit this so the Record is clear. The $3.3 billion in the \nunderlying WRDA bill represents about 20 percent of the total bill. As \nI tried to explain to some of my constituents at home, if we were \ntalking about a desert bill we would probably have zero money in this \nbill. But we are talking about a water bill, and Louisiana most \ncertainly has a great deal of water--sometimes more than we need, more \nthan we asked for, and more than we want. But this is Congress's major \nwater development bill. Because we sit at the mouth of the greatest \nriver system in the country, which is the mouth of the Mississippi \nRiver, and because we have some of the greatest and last coastal \nwetlands in the country, of course, this would have a great many \nprojects for us.\n  We really appreciate, Senator Vitter and I, the cooperation of \nRepublicans and Democrats in being particularly supportive of us as we \nstruggle to get many of these protection projects in this bill \nauthorized because, of course, of our recent tragic experiences with \nthe storms.\n  The $3.3 billion in projects is significant, necessary, and essential \nto beginning to build a kind of barrier of protection that the people \nof south Louisiana, and I might add south Mississippi and part of south \nTexas, depend on to keep them safe.\n  We do not live right on the coast, as people do in Mississippi, \nAlabama, Florida, and actually in Texas. We are the only people \nactually moving from the coast. We are not moving to the beaches. There \nare no beaches to move to.\n  I ask unanimous consent the list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         WRDA 2007--Senate Floor Consideration (May 7-10, 2007)\n\n\n                        general overview of WRDA\n\n       WRDA 2007 authorizes more than an estimated $13.9 billion \n     of Corps projects.\n       In comparison--WRDA 2000 authorized $4.1 billion; WRDA 1999 \n     authorized $2.5 billion.\n       The major authorization components of WRDA 2006 are:\n       Louisiana: $3.336 billion--24%\n       Florida Everglades: $1.73 billion--12%\n       Upper Mississippi River--Illinois Waterway: $3.77 billion--\n     27%\n       All Other Authorizations: $5.064 billion--37%\n         Estimated Total: $13.90 billion--100%\n\n\n                           Louisiana Projects\n\n       Louisiana Coastal Area Ecosystem Restoration: $1.133 \n     million\n       Louisiana Coastal Ecosystem next wave: $728 million\n       Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico Hurricane Protection: $886 \n     million\n       Port of Iberia Navigation/Storm Surge Protection: $131 \n     million\n       Jefferson Parish Consolidation: $100 million\n       Larose to Golden Meadow certification up to 100 year level: \n     $90 million\n       MRGO Revolving Loan Fund for Private Facilities: $85 \n     million\n       MRGO Relocation Assistance for Public Facilities: $75 \n     million\n       Red River Waterway mitigation: $33 million\n       Southeast Louisiana development planning: $17 million\n       Calcasieu River and Pass Rock Bank Protection: $15 million\n       Various Louisiana Environmental Infrastructure: $13 million\n       Bayou Sorrel Lock: $10 million\n       MRGO de-authorization: $5 million\n         Total: $3.336 billion\n\n     BOLD Text represents changes from WRDA 2006\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. These are coastal wetlands. We are proud of that. It is \na totally different environment and topography than exists in many \nother places. But we do have some very special and extraordinary needs, \nand I would be doing a great disservice to the people of our State if \nwe didn't fight as hard as we could for the many projects in this \nbill--for the Louisiana Coastal Area Ecosystem Restoration; the \nMorganza to the Gulf of Mexico Hurricane Protection Project, which we \nliterally have been working on for 20 years; the Port of Iberia \nNavigation and Vermilion Parish Hurricane Protection Project; Jefferson \nParish consolidation; Larose to Golden Meadow, which is a little \ncommunity down here in Lafourche Parish, but it was the only authorized \nFederal levee that did not collapse in the last hurricane. But it has \nbeen shrinking. This will help us to build it up, to strengthen it, and \nto keep that wonderful community safe and dry, as the next storms \napproach.\n  We understand people cannot live in some areas. They are prohibited \nfrom development. We are doing much more strict zoning and planning and \ncommunity planning and design. In fact, some communities are picking up \nand moving north. Some communities are not building any more in flood \nzones. We are with the program when it comes to keeping our people \nsafe.\n  We can do more in that regard and we will. But without these \nfundamental earthen barriers and levees and locks, this job will never \nget done. It is not going to get done overnight, but it will be done, \nto protect the 3.5 million people who live in the southern part of \nLouisiana, as well as about 1.5 million people who live in Mississippi.\n  As you can see, these are the great wetlands of Saint Bernard and \nPlaquemines Parish Project, Gulfport, and some parts of Pascagoula, and \nPass Christian. The storms come from the west. It gives a tremendous \nbuffer to Gulfport and Pascagoula. Of course, if the storms come more \nfrom the east, they are more vulnerable as they lay bare to those storm \nsurges and high winds.\n  For these wetlands to stay and to be restored by the actions of this \nbill is incredibly important and actually essential to the preservation \nof this great metropolitan area. This is more than New Orleans, which \nis 450,000 people, or was before the storm. It is now down to about \n200,000. Jefferson Parish, which is part of the metropolitan area, our \nsuburban sister parish, is 450,000. That parish could have just as \neasily gone under 4 to 12 feet of water had the levees broken on the \nother side of the canal that sits about right here.\n  In addition, north of the lake--this is Lake Pontchartrain--we have \n700,000 people ringing the north side of this lake, and hundreds of \nthousands of people who are living down in these ridges.\n  There is a tremendous amount of population that needs to be saved and \nprotected and sustained. But as I said earlier, it is not just the \npeople who\n\n[[Page S6050]]\n\nare there, it is the economy, the infrastructure of the economy we are \nprotecting and supporting. Whether it is fisheries, transportation, \nnavigation, 10,000 miles of pipeline, to keep the lights on and provide \ngas and electricity and fuel to the rest of this country--that comes \nfrom here, as do petrochemicals that help to make many of the products \nthat we manufacture in this country better and safer for human use. \nThat happens along the southern part of this great delta.\n  That is why we fought so hard for this bill. I want to end by saying \nI commend Senator Boxer, my colleague from California, for making this \na priority. I thank our leader, Harry Reid. It has been 8 long years \nsince WRDA has passed and Louisiana cannot wait another month, let \nalone another year.\n  There is a hurricane season literally right around the corner in \nJune. This is the middle of May. People are still on pins and needles \nwondering whether the levees that we have reconstructed and fixed are \ngoing to hold for this next hurricane season. They are most certainly \nlooking with great anticipation, and some anxieties, too, if this \nCongress will act.\n  I know there are some amendments that are going to be laid down \ncomplaining about some aspects of this bill, but I thank Senator Boxer, \nand I thank Senator Inhofe for his attention to the needs of Louisiana, \nand I thank this Congress for responding so generously and so quickly. \nSenator Vitter and I do have several amendments we would like to \ndiscuss later tomorrow, which would improve some things from our \nperspective. But we most certainly understand and appreciate the great \nwork that has gone into this underlying bill.\n  This bill needs to pass now. It lays a foundation for the long-term \nrecovery and restoration of this great delta. Some expense will be \nborne by the Federal Government, which is absolutely appropriate since \nthe benefits go all over the Nation from the river systems and the \nother infrastructure, economic infrastructure that exists. And some of \nthe costs will be borne, as it should be, by the people who call \nLouisiana home and call Calcasieu Parish or Cameron or Vermilion or \nIberia, Orleans, Plaquemines, Saint Bernard, Saint Tammany, et cetera, \nhome.\n  We are happy to make our own contributions to this effort. We love \nour home. We love where we live. We have to make it safer, and we have \nto be able to restore these wetlands and build better levees that do \nnot fail and do not break in the middle of these storms.\n  We cannot stop the storms, but we most certainly can mitigate against \nthe damage and use better science, better engineering, and, frankly, \nbetter leadership in this Congress to make sure the tragedies that \nhappen in Katrina and Rita do not repeat themselves.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, Friday, May 11, 2007, was National \nMilitary Spouses Day. Oftentimes, those who are, as the saying goes, \n``married to the military'' are not recognized for the support they \nprovide and sacrifice they endure during the time of their spouses' \nactive duty service. Certainly when a member is deployed, but \nthroughout a military member's career, the strength and support of a \nwife or husband can make the difference between success or failure for \nthat individual and that family. Military spouses endure the hardship \nof separation from loved ones, frequently take on the role of a single \nparent, and move more often than most civilians throughout the course \nof a military career. They receive no commendation medals and few \naccolades, save the gratitude of an exhausted spouse who comes home to \na warm embrace and nurturing bond after a long deployment or simply \nanother late night at work. Military spouses are truly war's unsung \nheroes. In addition to a job they may have outside the home, they are \nteacher, chief consoler, housekeeper, accountant, taxi driver, cook, \nreferee and nurse. They encounter their own battles bravely, with \nefficiency, expertise and stubborn persistence supporting our Nation in \ntheir daily challenges every bit as valiantly as our military members \ndo.\n  I commend the over 1,000 military spouses in or from Idaho and U.S. \nmilitary spouses worldwide and thank them for their service to our \nNation, sacrifice and patriotism. Our country, but most importantly \ntheir families, need their strength. We all depend on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/14/senate-section/article/S6050-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CLAUD R. JUDD\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, on April 13, 2007, Idaho grieved \nat the passing of one of her great men, Claud R. Judd. Claud lived most \nall of his life in Fraser, ID, and left behind his wife Elvita, 2 \nsisters, 3 sons, 1 daughter, 12 grandchildren and 11 great-\ngrandchildren. A lifelong farmer, Claud is perhaps best known to \nIdahoans for his many years of public service. From local cemetery, \npark, school, hospital and county fair boards to Clearwater County \ncommissioner and member of the Idaho State Legislature in both houses, \nhe exemplified public service. His legacy is a model of civic duty and \ncommitment to family and community.\n  Claud found the time in his busy schedule to write a book about his \nfamily, and compile a scrapbook about the Clearwater County Extension \nand 4-H spanning seven decades. He was a hard, honest worker, and \ncommitted himself fully to whatever endeavor he undertook. I had the \nhonor and privilege of serving in the Idaho State Legislature with \nClaud. Fellow lawmakers and staff could always count on him to be \nhonest, kind and thorough. Claud was known as a consensus-builder who \nput the needs of his constituents first. He focused on results and was \nknown to care little for the politics that cause party line divisions. \nHe represented the Idahoans of Clearwater County with integrity and \ncommon sense, reflecting his deep Idaho agriculture roots.\n  My wife and I join other Idahoans in mourning this great loss to our \nState, and we offer our most sincere condolences to Elvita and the \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/14/senate-section/article/S6050-4", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6050-S6051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2082.

A joint resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Maine \n     urging Congress to increase funding for Community Development \n     Block Grants; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the primary objective of the Community Development \n     Block Grant program is the development of viable communities \n     by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment \n     and expanding economic opportunities, principally for persons \n     of low income and moderate income; and\n       Whereas, the State of Maine and the Maine entitlement \n     communities receive direct allocations from the Community \n     Development Block Grant program annually for a wide variety \n     of community and economic development activities that \n     principally benefit low-income and moderate-income persons, \n     including the elderly, children and those who are at risk; \n     and\n       Whereas, in Maine and in communities throughout the nation, \n     33 years of Community Development Block Grant program funding \n     has developed a strong network of relationships among local \n     governments, residents, businesses and nonprofit \n     organizations; and\n       Whereas, the Community Development Block Grant program has \n     been cut every year since fiscal year 2001, and President \n     Bush has released his fiscal year 2008 federal budget to \n     Congress proposing only $2,986,000,000 in formula funding for \n     the Community Development Block Grant program, a reduction of \n     $736,000,000 from last year that would present a severe \n     hardship to Maine communities; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That we, your Memorialists, on behalf of the \n     people we represent, take this opportunity to indicate that \n     this valuable program has made a tremendous contribution to \n     the viability of the housing stock, infrastructure, public \n     services and economic vitality of the State and that we \n     respectfully urge and request that the President of the \n     United States and the Congress of the United States recognize \n     the outstanding work being done locally and nationally by the \n     Community Development Block Grant program by supporting \n     increased funding for the program in fiscal year 2008; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the United States, \n     to the President of the Senate of the United States, to the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States \n     and to each Member of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-84. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan expressing \n     opposition to Norfolk Southern Corporation's proposed sale of \n     its rail lines from Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids \n     to Kalamazoo and continuing to the Indiana border; to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 56\n\n       Whereas, the Norfolk Southern Corporation is considering \n     the sale of its Michigan lines from Grand Rapids to Kalamazoo \n     and from Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo. The Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo \n     line carries the state's busiest high-speed Amtrak train, the \n     Wolverine, which travels from Detroit to Chicago. The \n     Wolverine travels on the Norfolk Southern Railroad's rail \n     corridor from Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo until it connects with \n     Amtrak's own line. Ridership on this line increased six \n     percent in 2006 to 142,185 passengers; and\n       Whereas, the Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo portion of the Norfolk \n     Southern line is a vital link between Detroit and Chicago. \n     Expanding the high-speed rail capacity on this line is vital \n     to the future development of this area. New industry, \n     including coal energy, bio-diesel, and ethanol fuel plants \n     are proposed for Michigan and specifically along the I-94 \n     corridor located near the Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo rail line. \n     Continued operation of this line by Norfolk Southern is \n     essential to expansion of new industry in this area. Over 150 \n     railroad employees' jobs are associated with the rail traffic \n     along this line; and\n       Whereas, Norfolk Southern is a Class One railroad operator, \n     earning revenue in excess of $250 million annually. As a \n     Class One operator, Norfolk Southern has the capacity to \n     maintain and promote the use of these lines. The proposed \n     sale of the Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids to \n     Kalamazoo lines will almost certainly place the lines under \n     the management of a Class Three operator, a rail company \n     earning revenue of $20 million of less annually. A Class \n     Three operator will be far less likely to have the means to \n     maintain the lines, thus increasing the chance of accidents. \n     Class Three operators also rely on federal grants for line \n     and equipment maintenance, grants that are not always \n     guaranteed; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we express \n     opposition to Norfolk Southern's proposed sale of its rail \n     lines from Ypsilanti to Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids to \n     Kalamazoo and continuing to the Indiana border; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate; the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representative; members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation; the United States \n     Department of Transportation, Surface Transportation Board; \n     the Norfolk Southern Corporation; AMTRAK; and the Michigan \n     Department of Transportation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-85. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging Congress to restore funding for the \n     Weatherization Assistance Program in fiscal year 2008 and to \n     consider increasing future funding for this important federal \n     program; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 36\n\n       Whereas, the Federal Weatherization Assistance Program \n     (WAP), created in 1976 during the nation's oil crisis and \n     administered by the United States Department of Energy (DOE), \n     provides funding to states to operate programs that pay for \n     weatherization improvements for low-income homes. \n     Weatherization refers to a wide variety of measures and \n     technologies, such as weather stripping, caulking, \n     insulation, and energy-efficient appliances that reduce a \n     building's energy consumption. The WAP is the country's \n     longest running and perhaps most successful energy-efficiency \n     program. During the last 30 years, the WAP has provided \n     weatherization services to more than 5.5 million low-income \n     families; and\n       Whereas, the WAP is a proven and effective program that \n     helps not only low-income households, but the nation as a \n     whole. The WAP empowers low-income families by enabling them \n     to reduce energy costs and take responsibility for their \n     energy bills. Weatherization reduces heating bills by an \n     average of 31 percent. Low-income families receiving WAP \n     retrofits commonly save about $200 to $300 each year in \n     energy costs. In addition to the direct benefits that low-\n     income families receive, a recent study by Oak Ridge National \n     Laboratory (ORNL) documents a multitude of indirect benefits \n     to local economies, the nation's energy security, and the \n     environment. These benefits include job creation, increased \n     property values, reduced national energy consumption, and a \n     reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by an average of one \n     ton per weatherized house. The ORNL study concludes that for \n     each $1 of investment in the WAP program, the nation receives \n     $3.71 worth of benefits. Surely, no other program receives \n     such bang for its buck; and\n       Whereas, the effectiveness of the WAP program is threatened \n     by recent DOE funding decisions. The DOE recently cut the \n     Fiscal Year 2007 budget for the WAP by about 16 percent or \n     about $38 million less than it was a year ago. Local \n     communities and state weatherization directors throughout the \n     nation were dismayed by this decision; and\n       Whereas, under the Fiscal Year 2007 budget, Michigan is \n     receiving almost $2 million less then it did a year ago, and \n     it could not have come at a worse time. The state is \n     suffering through disturbingly high unemployment rates and a \n     weakened economy and is in the midst of its most devastating \n     and prolonged economic downturn since the Great Depression. \n     Losing about $1.9 million in WAP funds and the associated job \n     stimulus that WAP generally provides is a hard pill for the \n     state to swallow; and\n       Whereas, as the Fiscal Year 2008 federal budget is hammered \n     out, the WAP program should be recognized and celebrated for \n     its immense effectiveness rather than having its budget \n     slashed. Clearly, it is fiscally wise to invest in the \n     energy-saving WAP program; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the President of the \n     United States, the United States Congress, and the United \n     States Department of Energy to restore funding for\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\n     the Weatherization Assistance Program in Fiscal Year 2008 and \n     to consider increasing future funding for this important \n     federal program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the Secretary of the \n     United States Department of Energy.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-86. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Montana urging Congress to reauthorize the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act and \n     work toward a permanent solution to compensate states and \n     local governments for lost tax revenue on federal land within \n     Montana; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, the stability of Montana's economy has \n     historically been dependent on use of our abundant natural \n     resources; and\n       Whereas, the natural resource harvest has historically \n     contributed billions of dollars to Montana's economy by \n     providing employment opportunities to members of our \n     communities, supporting our business communities, and \n     contributing to the health of our schools; and\n       Whereas, revenue from industries related to the natural \n     resource harvest has produced taxes for the support of local \n     and state governments; and\n       Whereas, the amount of money generated by national forests \n     has dropped more than 85% between 1986 and 2005, creating a \n     financial crisis for rural forest communities in Montana and \n     around the country; and\n       Whereas, Congress passed the Secure Rural Schools and \n     Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 to provide a safety \n     net for these communities, and the purpose of the Act was to \n     stabilize payments to states and counties to help support \n     roads and schools, provide projects that enhance forest \n     ecosystem health, provide employment opportunities, and \n     improve cooperative relationships among federal land \n     management agencies and those who use and care about the \n     lands that the agencies manage; and\n       Whereas, counties in Montana received more than $14 million \n     in the last year to maintain schools and roads; and\n       Whereas, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\n     Determination Act has expired; and\n       Whereas, if the Act is not reauthorized, many counties will \n     suffer severe financial impacts resulting in significant \n     reduction in services, including but not limited to public \n     safety and education: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana:\n       (1) That the Legislature of the State of Montana urge the \n     U.S. Congress to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and \n     Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 and work toward a \n     permanent solution to compensate states and local governments \n     for lost tax revenue on federal land within Montana.\n       (2) That the Secretary of State send copies of this \n     resolution to the President of the United States, the \n     Secretary of State of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the Western Governors' Association, and \n     the Montana Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-87. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     establish a ``Marshall Plan'' for the United States \n     automotive industry; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 31\n\n       Whereas, at a time when our country's auto sector is facing \n     untold, and often unfair, challenges, it is in our national \n     interest to establish a ``Marshall Plan,'' similar to the \n     plan instituted to jump-start the decimated post-WWII \n     European economy, to help accelerate the domestic production \n     of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles. \n     Providing assistance to the automobile manufacturers and auto \n     parts suppliers to dramatically accelerate the domestic \n     production of alternative fuel and advanced technology \n     (hybrid, clean diesel, and fuel cell) vehicles and their key \n     components is of paramount importance to our entire economy; \n     and\n       Whereas, only through action of the federal government \n     could a comprehensive plan be developed to help retain and \n     crate tens of thousands of jobs for American workers, and \n     assure that American companies are producing the cars and \n     trucks of the future right here in the United States. \n     Providing the opportunity for the automotive sector to retool \n     and expand existing facilities, and helping to make sure that \n     there is a level playing field among all automotive companies \n     with respect to corporate taxes and health care costs, will \n     produce tremendous benefits for years to come; and\n       Whereas, indeed, a Marshall Plan would have any number of \n     direct and indirect benefits. It would reduce our dependence \n     on foreign oil, thereby reducing our dangerous reliance on \n     foreign oil and increasing our energy security. It would also \n     improve the environment by reducing global warming emissions. \n     The plan would further generate additional revenue for \n     federal, state, and local governments because of the jobs \n     that would be created for American workers. Moreover, it \n     would benefit consumers through lower costs for flex fuel and \n     advanced technology vehicles, and lower overall fuel costs. \n     Finally, the plan would help corporate profitability and help \n     ensure that workers and retirees receive the health care and \n     retirement benefits they have earned; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to establish a \n     ``Marshall Plan'' for the United States automotive industry; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-88. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program for \n     the State of Michigan; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 50\n\n       Whereas, the House of Representatives regard the health of \n     our children to be of paramount importance to families in our \n     state. Poor child health is a threat to educational \n     achievement as well as the social and psychological well-\n     being of the children of our state; and\n       Whereas, the members of the Michigan Legislature consider \n     protecting the health of our children to be essential to \n     improving the lives of our youngest citizens and the quality \n     of life in this state. The Michigan SCHIP program, which has \n     enrolled uninsured children since its inception, is an \n     integral part of the arrangements for health benefits for the \n     children of the State of Michigan. We recognize the value of \n     the Michigan SCHIP in preserving child wellness, preventing \n     and treating childhood disease, and improving health \n     outcomes, including overall health costs; and\n       Whereas, the federal funding available to the State of \n     Michigan through SCHIP is an invaluable source of funding to \n     provide health benefits for children of modest means. \n     Furthermore, we encourage all components of state government \n     to work with educators, health care providers, social \n     workers, and parents to ensure that all available public and \n     private assistance to provide health benefits for uninsured \n     children be garnered and used to the maximum extent; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the United States Congress to ensure timely \n     reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (SCHIP) to assure federal funding for Michigan SCHIP; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-89.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Montana opposing the relaxation of mail delivery \n     standards under consideration by the President's Commission \n     on the U.S. Postal Service; requesting that the U.S. Postal \n     Service maintain current levels of service; and requesting \n     that the U.S. Postal Service maintain current overnight \n     delivery standards and not centralize Montana's mail sorting \n     operations; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs.\n\n                      House Joint Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, the United States Postal Service, founded in 1775, \n     provides dependable, affordable mail service to Montana \n     communities; and\n       Whereas, the United States Postal Service remains an \n     important part of the nation's economic infrastructure \n     through which nearly $1 trillion of economic activity is \n     conducted each year and in which 9 million people are \n     employed; and\n       Whereas, many Montanans, especially in rural areas, do not \n     have easy access to the Internet or to electronic banking and \n     bill paying and are heavily dependent on the United States \n     Postal Service for communication and conducting business \n     transactions; and\n       Whereas, Americans currently enjoy the most extensive \n     postal service at the lowest postage rates of any major \n     industrialized nation in the world; and\n       Whereas, the President's Commission on the United States \n     Postal Service has recommended changes to postal operations \n     that could sever postal employees from federal employee \n     health, retirement, and workers' compensation programs and \n     has recommended repeal of laws that could pave the\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\n     way toward reducing rank-and-file wages and benefits while \n     simultaneously eliminating the current salary cap on \n     executive level postal positions; and\n       Whereas, the Commission has recommended a new \n     Presidentially appointed, corporate-style board of directors \n     and a new postal regulatory board and has proposed giving \n     these new politically appointed governing bodies broad \n     authority to set rates; and\n       Whereas, the Commission has proposed to refine the scope of \n     the United States Postal Service's ``universal service'' \n     obligation and uniform rate structure and change and restrict \n     the scope of services currently protected under postal \n     monopoly regulations; and\n       Whereas, the new board's broad authority could allow post \n     offices to be closed and prices to be set with a complicated \n     postage rate structure or could turn over postal operations \n     to private, for-profit enterprises; and\n       Whereas, replacing the United States Postal Service's \n     public service obligation with a profit-seeking mandate would \n     undermine the United States Postal Service's historical \n     ``universal service'' obligation and weaken its national \n     infrastructure; and\n       Whereas, in the interim period prior to legislated postal \n     reform, the United States Postal Service may move forward \n     with initiatives to close postal facilities in Montana; and\n       Whereas, the United States Postal Service is requesting \n     that the United States Postal Rate Commission investigate \n     relaxation of overnight delivery standards; and\n       Whereas, the United States Postal Service could consolidate \n     the processing of mail in Montana, including moving all \n     Helena outgoing mail-sorting operatios to Great Falls; and\n       Whereas, this consolidation would not serve the public's \n     best interest because of the decrease in productivity \n     compared to the current processing of mail in Helena; and\n       Whereas, the consolidation could result in the elimination \n     of the agency's current obligation to deliver local mail \n     overnight and could relax other mail delivery standards \n     across Montana; and\n       Whereas, the economy of the Helena area would be negatively \n     impacted as a result of the relaxation of overnight delivery \n     standards; and\n       Whereas, the public health and the public services provided \n     by state agencies would be negatively impacted as a result of \n     the relaxation of overnight delivery standards: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana, That the Montana Legislature urges the \n     President, the Congress of the United States, and the United \n     States Postal Service to continue to maintain affordable, \n     dependable mail service at current levels because of its \n     social and economic importance to our nation; and Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That any recommendation from the President's \n     Commission on the United States Postal Service or the United \n     States Postal Rate Commission that curtails public services \n     in the current postal service be rejected; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of Montana \n     opposes any changes that would harm the public and workers of \n     the United States Postal Service, including legislated or \n     United States Postal Service initiatives to close or \n     consolidate postal facilities, relax overnight delivery \n     standards, centralize mail-sorting operations, take away or \n     modify the collective bargaining system of postal workers, or \n     change the current bargaining system for employee benefits;

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging Congress to enact the Second Chance Act to \n     help juvenile and adult ex-offenders to successfully reenter \n     their communities; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 45\n\n       Whereas, the transition from confinement to release \n     presents both great risks and opportunities for young ex-\n     offenders and the communities in which they live. \n     Unsuccessful transitions into the community can result in an \n     alarmingly high recidivism rate for offenders. Effective \n     reentry programs can reduce recidivism rates by providing the \n     necessary support and resources to guide ex-offenders through \n     a successful transition from confinement to community life; \n     and\n       Whereas, comprehensive reentry programs are especially \n     effective among young people. With their development still in \n     progress, young ex-offenders are more amenable to effective \n     behavior modification interventions, thus saving lives, \n     anguish, and public tax dollars. An example of an effective \n     program that reduces recidivism is Multidimensional Treatment \n     Foster Care (MTFC). This program provides services to youth \n     and their families to assist in the transition from \n     confinement to reentry into the community. MTFC includes \n     ongoing supervision, frequent contact, and coordination of \n     services with the youth's probation officer, teachers, and \n     other involved adults. Studies show that youths in MTFC were \n     less likely to turn back to crime compared to ex-offenders in \n     residential group homes; and\n       Whereas, research-based reentry programs such as MTFC not \n     only reduce crime, but they are also cost effective. \n     Currently, many young people are released unconditionally \n     when they ``age-out'' of juvenile court jurisdiction and are \n     not provided access to family reunification or aftercare \n     services. Such unconditional releases increase the likelihood \n     that ex-offenders will return to crime. MTFC and similar \n     programs could save taxpayers thousands of dollars and could \n     save innocent people the heartache of suffering from a \n     criminal attack; and\n       Whereas, the Second Chance Act calls for an authorization \n     of around $200 million over two years to assist ex-offenders \n     in making a successful transition from confinement to release \n     into the community. The United States Department of Justice \n     would administer demonstration grants to states and local \n     governments to provide and coordinate reentry programs for \n     juvenile and adult offenders. This legislation includes \n     family reunification services, job training, education, \n     housing, and substance abuse and mental health services. This \n     legislation would establish a federal interagency task force \n     on offender reentry, provide research on reentry, and create \n     a national resource center to collect and disseminate \n     information on best practices in offender reentry: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the United \n     States Congress to enact the Second Chance Act to help \n     juvenile and adult ex-offenders to successfully reenter their \n     communities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/14/senate-section/article/S6054-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6054-S6055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Thune):\n       S. 1376.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise and \nexpand the drug discount program under section 340B of such Act to \nimprove the provision of discounts on drug purchases for certain safety \nnet providers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my colleague from South Dakota, Senator Thune, designed to address \nthe growing burden faced by this Nation's health care safety net \ninstitutions in being able to provide adequate pharmaceutical care to \nthe most vulnerable patient populations.\n  Communities across the country rely on public and nonprofit hospitals \nto serve as the health care ``safety net'' for low-income, uninsured, \nand underinsured patients. With the ever-increasing cost of \npharmaceuticals, these institutions are struggling more and more to \nprovide basic pharmaceutical care to those least able to afford it.\n  Fortunately, many safety net hospitals are currently able to \nparticipate in the Federal 340B Drug Discount Program, which enables \nthem to purchase outpatient drugs for their patients at discounted \nprices. These hospitals, known as ``covered entities'' under the 340B \nstatute, include high-Medicaid disproportionate share hospitals, DSH, \nlarge and small urban hospitals, and certain rural hospitals.\n  I am introducing legislation today, the 340B Program Improvement and \nIntegrity Act of 2007, which would extend discounted drug prices \ncurrently mandated only for outpatient drugs to inpatient drugs \npurchased by covered entities under the 340B program. Although the \nMedicare Modernization Act, MMA, of 2003 permitted pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers to offer 340B drug discounts to covered entities, this \nlegislation did not include a mandate. Without a mandate we have seen \nvery little willingness on the part of manufactures to offer 340B drug \ndiscounts for inpatient drugs. As the prices of pharmaceutical drugs \ncontinue to increase sharply, the need for these inpatient discounts \ngrows more and more acute.\n  My legislation would also expand participation in the program to a \nsubset of rural hospitals that, for a variety of reasons, cannot \ncurrently access 340B discounts. These newly eligible rural hospitals \ninclude critical access hospitals, sole community hospitals, and rural \nreferral centers. In proposing this modest expansion to the program, we \nhave struck an important balance between ensuring a close nexus with \nlow-income and indigent care, ensured that a significant portion of \nsavings is passed on to the Medicaid Program, and strengthened the \nintegrity of the program.\n  Specifically, newly eligible rural hospitals would have to meet \nappropriate standards demonstrating their ``safety net'' status, as do \nall hospitals that currently participate in the program. For example, \nsole community hospitals and rural referral centers, all of which are \npaid under the prospective payment system, would be required under this \nlegislation to serve a significant percentage of low-income and \nindigent patients, have public or nonprofit status, and, if privately \nowned and operated, to have a contract with State or local government \nto provide a significant level of indigent care. All standards are \ndesigned to reinforce the obligation of these covered entities to \ncontinue serving low-income and uninsured patients.\n  This legislation would also generate savings for the Medicaid Program \nby requiring participating hospitals to credit to their Medicaid \nagencies a significant percentage of their savings on inpatient drugs. \nIt would address the overall efficiency and integrity of the 340B \nprogram through improved enforcement and compliance measures with \nrespect to manufacturers and covered entities. This is designed to \nimprove program administration and to prevent and remedy instances of \nprogram abuse.\n  In the end, this legislation would accomplish several important \ngoals. It would help safety net providers stretch their already limited \nresources through increased access to discounted pharmaceuticals; it \nwould enhance 340B program integrity by making sure participants are \ncomplying with program rules; and it would help to improve the care \nprovided to this Nation's most vulnerable populations.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1376\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey to \nthe City of Henderson, Nevada, certain Federal land located in the \nCity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and Senator Ensign \nto introduce the Southern Nevada Limited Transition Area Act. This bill \nwill allow one of Nevada's fastest growing communities to diversify its \neconomy, to create space for important small businesses and parks, and \nto encourage appropriate development around an urban airport.\n  This legislation was first introduced in the 108th Congress. Its \npurpose is to convey approximately 502 acres of land from the Bureau of \nLand Management to the city of Henderson, NV, for the development of an \nemployment and business center and urban green spaces. The parcels are \nlocated just west and south of the Henderson Executive Airport.\n  The Bureau of Land Management has designated these parcels for \ndisposal because of the urban surroundings, which renders them \ndifficult for the agency to manage.\n  This legislation will enhance the ability of a rapidly growing \ncommunity to diversify its economy, gainfully employ its residents, and \nencourage proper land use. The parcels are located in a fast growing \narea of the city, but are impacted by aircraft noise and overflights \nfrom the nearby Henderson Executive Airport. This makes the property \nunsuitable for residential use. But rather than shying away from it \nbecause of the limitations on its use, the city of Henderson has put \ntogether a forward-looking plan that will turn the area into a bustling \nbusiness center.\n  Once the Bureau of Land Management conveys the land to Henderson, the \ncity would then sell, lease or otherwise convey subdivided lots at fair \nmarket value. Consistent with the Southern Nevada Public Land \nManagement Act, 85 percent of the proceeds would then return to the \nBLM's Special Account for a variety of conservation purposes in Nevada, \n10 percent will go towards community water developments, and 5 percent \nwill support the State of Nevada's general education program.\n  The city of Henderson's leaders are dedicated to making the city a \nnational model of logical development, diversified employment, and \nfiscal sustainability. This bill helps establish the conditions needed \nto realize that vision. In addition to productively diversifying the \nland use pattern in the Las Vegas Valley, the proposed development of \nthis land will encourage a broad range of employment opportunities for \nthe region, while also helping to pay for public infrastructure in \nnearby residential areas.\n  I greatly appreciated the hearing that the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee had on this bill last Congress. At that hearing, \nthe Department of the Interior and others expressed strong support for \nour legislation. A few minor revisions were requested by the \nadministration, and I have incorporated those changes into the bill we \nare introducing today. I look forward to working with the committee to \nmove this legislation in an expeditious manner during this Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1377\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 35 of title 28, United States Code, \nto strike the exception to the residency requirements for United States \nattorneys; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the U.S. \nAttorney Local Residency Restoration Act along with Senators Schumer, \nBaucus, and Tester.\n  Simply put, this legislation would eliminate the other language that \nthe Department of Justice had inserted into the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization dealing with U.S. attorneys.\n  The first provision added allowed the Attorney General to appoint \ninterim U.S. attorneys to vacancies indefinitely without Senate \nconfirmation, and I authored a bill to restore the law to require \ninterim appointments by the Attorney General for only 120 days, and \nthen the district courts can appoint the interim U.S. attorney if a \npermanent replacement has not been nominated and confirmed.\n  This bill has passed this body, and I hope will be signed into law \nsoon.\n  Today, I am offering this legislation to restore the residency \nrequirement for sitting U.S. attorneys.\n  Before the change, the law required that U.S. attorneys live within \nhis district while serving. It seems logical that the U.S. attorney \nshould live in the district that he is heading.\n  However, the Department of Justice added language in the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization that allows a U.S. attorney to live outside of his \ndistrict if the Attorney General assigns dual or additional \nresponsibilities to him.\n  While U.S. attorneys in both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations have served dual roles in the past, this administration \nhas once again abused its new authority--this time by placing numerous \nU.S. attorneys in full-time positions throughout the Department of \nJustice, at times in a manner that allows the Department to avoid \nSenate confirmation.\n  In fact, Dennis Boyd, executive director of the National Association \nof Assistant U.S. Attorneys, which represents current Federal \nprosecutors, has said, ``I can't think of a time when there's been this \nmany U.S. attorneys doing double duty at one time.''\n  Currently, there are several U.S. attorneys, that we know about, who \nare serving in a second full-time position here in Washington, while \nstill retaining their responsibilities back in their districts. For \nexample, Michael J. Sullivan, the U.S. attorney in Boston, has been \nserving as the Acting Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms and Explosives in Washington for the past 6 months, a position \nthat requires Senate confirmation;\n  Mary Beth Buchanan, U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh, is also the acting \ndirector of the Office of Violence Against Women, a position that \nrequires Senate confirmation, and prior to that she served as Director \nof the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys; and Kevin O'Connor, U.S. \nattorney in Connecticut, is also serving as an Associate Deputy \nAttorney General coordinating antigang policies.\n  Of course, the most well-known example is William Mercer, U.S. \nattorney in Montana. Mr. Mercer has been effectively absent for nearly \n2 years from his State. First, serving as Principal Associate Deputy \nAttorney General, and now working as Acting Associate Attorney General, \nanother position that requires Senate confirmation. In fact, through \nstaff interviews we have learned that he is only in his State 3 or 4 \ndays a month.\n  Moreover, his consistent absenteeism was having such a negative \neffect on the district that it led to the point where U.S. District \nChief Judge Donald Molloy of Billings, MT, felt compelled to write to \nthe Attorney General on October 20, 2005, to complain. In that letter, \nChief Judge Molloy wrote that Mr. Mercer's dual roles have led to ``a \nlack of leadership'' in the Montana office and created ``untoward \ndifficulties for the court'' and for career prosecutors. Chief Judge \nMolloy also wrote that Mr. Mercer was violating Federal law because he \n``no longer resides in Montana'' and instead was living with his family \nin the Washington, DC, area.\n  These facts on their own are cause for alarm.\n  However, what is even more disconcerting is the way that Mr. Mercer \nand the Department of Justice have handled this situation.\n  We know that the Attorney General responded to Chief Judge Molloy in \na letter on November 10, 2005, stating that Mr. Mercer ``is in \ncompliance with the residency requirement'' under Federal law because \nhe ``is domiciled in Montana, returns there on a regular basis, and \nwill live there full-time as soon as his temporary assignment is \ncompleted.''\n  We also know through interviews of DOJ staff that Mr. Mercer worked \nwith Will Moschella and Senate staff during November 2005 to insert the \nresidency exemption language into the PATRIOT Act reauthorization.\n  In fact, according to the Washington Post, the response from the \nAttorney General to Chief Judge Molloy occurred on the very same day \nthat DOJ asked for the language to be inserted into the PATRIOT Act.\n  All this resulted in a change in the law, thus eviscerating the \nconflict.\n  However, even beyond this turn of events, what is truly breathtaking \nabout this administration's actions with regard to Mr. Mercer is that \nin trying to defend its actions to force numerous U.S. attorneys to \nresign from office, this same Justice Department criticized David \nIglesias for being ``an absentee landlord.''\n  I firmly believe, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the \ngander. You can't one day try to change the law to make it easier for \nU.S. attorneys to serve in 2 full-time jobs at the same time and then \nthe next day fire someone for not being fully present in his job, \nespecially when the absence is much more limited and based on service \nto the country in the naval reserves.\n  While there are times when U.S. attorneys may be relied upon to fill \nin temporarily, changing the law to ensure that they can hold two full-\ntime jobs is unacceptable.\n  Serving as U.S. attorney is a full-time job, and each district \nthroughout this country deserves to have the best qualified person in \nthe district focused on the tasks at hand.\n  I am quite certain that there are many fine first assistant U.S. \nattorneys capable of stepping up to fill the shoes of an absent U.S. \nattorney; however, these are not the individuals the President has \nnominated and the Senate has confirmed to serve those positions.\n  These districts deserve nothing less than the undivided attention of \ntheir Senate-confirmed U.S. attorneys.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1379\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate as wilderness certain land within the \nRocky Mountain National Park and to adjust the boundaries of the Indian \nPeaks Wilderness and the Arapaho National Recreation Area of the \nArapaho National Forest in the State of Colorado; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am proud to co-sponsor legislation \nthat\n\n[[Page S6062]]\n\nwill designate Rocky Mountain National Park as ``wilderness.''\n  This legislation will protect an area that was formed millions of \nyears ago when massive glaciers carved an impressive landscape. The \nRocky Mountain National Park Wilderness Act will ensure that it remains \nunchanged in years to come.\n  Today marks the beginning of a new chapter in the long history of the \nPark. As a fifth generation Coloradan and someone who grew up in the \nshadow of Rocky Mountain National Park, it is an honor to have worked \non this bill. With the introduction of this legislation we continue to \nfollow an important wilderness tradition in Colorado.\n  Colorado and its representatives have long played an important role \nin the development of Wilderness in our Nation. This dates back to the \noriginal Wilderness Act. Congressman Wayne Aspinall, who represented \nColorado's 4th Congressional District and chaired the Committee on \nInterior and Insular Affairs, played a pivotal role in creating the \nNation's wilderness system with the 1964 Wilderness Act. From the \ninception of the original Wilderness Act through the continued \ndevelopment of wilderness in Colorado one thing has remained the same: \na commitment to working together to find compromise and solutions that \nwork for everyone.\n  The principle of compromise has held true from the Colorado National \nForest Wilderness Act of 1980 to the Spanish Peaks Wilderness Act in \n2000, and it is now true with the Rocky Mountain National Park \nWilderness Act. I am especially proud of the legislation that my \ncolleagues and I have introduced because it will preserve the natural \nelements of the Park while protecting water, the West's most valuable \nresource.\n  In a time when wells are being shut down just east of the park, the \nprotection of water is more important than ever, and it is vital to \npreserving the agricultural heritage of this area. I am extremely \npleased that we have been able protect both wilderness and water.\n  I would like to thank everyone that has been involved in the \ndevelopment of this bill, my colleagues in the United States Congress, \nthe local officials that communicated with our offices, and the private \ncitizens that shared their thoughts with us on the creation of this \nbill. I would specifically like to recognize former Senators Bill \nArmstrong and Hank Brown, and former Representatives Joe Johnson and \nDavid Skaggs. We would not be introducing this legislation today \nwithout these efforts.\n  The Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness Act will ensure that \nAmericans, now and in the future, have the ability to enjoy the Park.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 1382. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide the \nestablishment of an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Registry; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ALS Registry Act.\n  Lou Gehrig brought Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, ALS, to the \npublic's attention more than 65 years ago and his courage put a human \nface' on this terrible disease. Each of us has a Lou Gehrig back in our \nhome State, someone who shows great tremendous courage and grace as \nthey wrestle with ALS.\n  Over the years, I have worked closely with the Nevada ALS Association \nand have met with many Nevadans who have been touched by this \ndevastating illness. One of these Nevadans was a man by the name of \nSteve Rigazio who was invited to testify before the Labor/HHS/Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee in May of 2000. Steve was at the height of \nhis career when he was diagnosed with ALS. He worked through the ranks \nof the Nevada Power Company, the largest utility company in the State, \nfor 16 years until he became president. He played semi-professional \nbaseball. He also played and coached recreational hockey.\n  After his diagnosis, Steve continued to show up for work at 6 a.m. \nfor as long as he could. Sadly just 20 months after he testified so \nmovingly before Congress, Steve Rigazio died of ALS on December 27, \n2001 at the age of 47. He left behind a family that included a wife, \ntwo children and hundreds of friends. The ALS Steve Rigazio Voice of \nCourage Award was named in his honor as a living testimony to the life \nof this special man.\n  Every year approximately 5,600 Americans will learn they have ALS. \nThere is no cure for ALS and there is only one FDA approved drug to \nspecifically treat ALS. That drug only works for 20 percent of \npatients, and even for them, it merely extends life for a few months.\n  ALS has proven particularly hard for scientists and doctors to tackle \nfor a number of reasons. One of those reasons is there is not a \ncentralized place where data on the disease is collected. Currently, \nthere is only a patchwork of data about ALS that does not include the \nentire U.S. population and only includes limited data for specific \npurposes, such as to determine the relationship between military \nservice and the disease. Perhaps the most obvious example of the \nlimitations of current surveillance systems and registries is that we \ndo not know with certainty how many people are living with ALS in the \nUnited States today. Over 136 years after the discovery of ALS, \nestimates on its prevalence still vary by as much as 100 percent, from \na low of about 15,000 patients to as many as thirty 30,000.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would create an ALS registry \nat the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, and will aid in \nthe search for a cure to this devastating disease. The registry will \ncollect data concerning: the incidence and prevalence of ALS in the \nU.S.; the environmental and occupational factors that may contribute to \nthe disease; the age, race or ethnicity, gender and family history of \nindividuals diagnosed; and other information essential to the study of \nALS.\n\n  A national registry will help arm our Nation's researchers and \nclinicians with the tools and information they need to make progress in \nthe fight against ALS. The data made available by a registry will \npotentially allow scientists to identify causes of the disease, and \nmaybe even lead to the discovery of new treatment, a cure for ALS, or \neven a way to prevent the disease in the first place.\n  I first introduced this legislation in 2005. Since that time, we have \nappropriated funding to begin work on the development of a National ALS \nRegistry at the CDC. As a result, the CDC has begun pilot proams that \nwill: Develop and test strategies to efficiently identify ALS patients, \nand (2) determine how to obtain data from existing registries and \ndatabases. These pilot programs will help to expedite the development \nof the registry established by this legislation. This is especially \nimportant considering the life expectancy for a person with ALS is 2 to \n5 years from the time of diagnosis.\n  The establishment of a registry will bring new hope to tens of \nthousands of patients and their families that ALS will no longer be a \ndeath sentence. No one wants to wait another 136 years before a cure is \nfound. I urge my colleagues to support the swift passage of the ALS \nRegistry Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1382\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``ALS Registry Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (referred to in this \n     section as ``ALS'') is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative \n     disease that affects motor nerve cells in the brain and the \n     spinal cord.\n       (2) The average life expectancy for a person with ALS is 2 \n     to 5 years from the time of diagnosis.\n       (3) The cause of ALS is not well understood.\n       (4) There is only one drug currently approved by the Food \n     and Drug Administration for the treatment of ALS, which has \n     thus far shown only modest effects, prolonging life by just a \n     few months.\n       (5) There is no known cure for ALS.\n       (6) More than 5,000 individuals in the United States are \n     diagnosed with ALS annually and as many as 30,000 individuals \n     may be living with ALS in the United States today.\n       (7) Studies have found relationships between ALS and \n     environmental and genetic\n\n[[Page S6063]]\n\n     factors, but those relationships are not well understood.\n       (8) Scientists believe that there are significant ties \n     between ALS and other motor neuron diseases.\n       (9) Several ALS disease registries and databases exist in \n     the United States and throughout the world, including the \n     SOD1 database, the National Institute of Neurological \n     Disorders and Stroke repository, and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs ALS Registry.\n       (10) A single national system to collect and store \n     information on the prevalence and incidence of ALS in the \n     United States does not exist.\n       (11) In each of fiscal years 2006 and 2007, Congress \n     directed $887,000 to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention to begin a nationwide ALS registry.\n       (12) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the \n     Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has \n     established three pilot projects, beginning in fiscal year \n     2006, to evaluate the science to guide the creation of a \n     national ALS registry.\n       (13) The establishment of a national registry will help--\n       (A) to identify the incidence and prevalence of ALS in the \n     United States;\n       (B) to collect data important to the study of ALS;\n       (C) to promote a better understanding of ALS;\n       (D) to collect information that is important for research \n     into the genetic and environmental factors that cause ALS;\n       (E) to strengthen the ability of a clearinghouse--\n       (i) to collect and disseminate research findings on \n     environmental, genetic and other causes of ALS and other \n     motor neuron disorders that can be confused with ALS, \n     misdiagnosed as ALS, and in some cases progress to ALS;\n       (ii) make available information to patients about research \n     studies for which they may be eligible; and\n       (iii) maintain information about clinical specialists and \n     clinical trials on therapies; and\n       (F) to enhance efforts to find treatments and a cure for \n     ALS.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n       Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 399R.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to repeal \nauthority for adjustments to per diem payments\n\n[[Page S6064]]\n\nto homeless veterans service centers for receipt of other sources of \nincome, to extend authorities for certain programs to benefit homeless \nveterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that would \nenhance and improve services for homeless veterans administered by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. This bill addresses a number of areas \nrelated to care and benefits for homeless veterans. It would modify the \nfunding mechanism for community-based services to homeless veterans, \nexpand capacity of services for women veterans, and improve outreach to \nservicemembers who are at risk of becoming homeless.\n  First, this legislation would lift a number of restrictions on VA's \ngrant and per diem program. This program compensates community shelters \nfor the services they provide to homeless veterans. VA currently pays \n$27 per day to community shelters for each veteran served. However, $27 \nis barely sufficient to cover existing costs, and rising energy prices \nare stretching resources even more.\n  To meet the needs of their clients, many shelters seek additional \nsources of funding, but their per diem payments from VA are in turn \noffset by the amount of this additional funding. By eliminating this \noffset, the bill would enable providers to expand their services to \nveterans, and to receive funding from other sources to accomplish these \nexpansions.\n  This legislation would also address the gap in domiciliary care for \nhomeless women veterans. Women veterans are a growing proportion of the \nactive duty force and overall veteran population. Homelessness among \nfemale veterans is a serious problem, and many facilities do not yet \nhave the capacity to meet this demand. Domiciliary care is an essential \ncomponent of treatment and rehabilitation, especially for mental health \nand substance abuse conditions which afflict many homeless veterans.\n  This bill would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure \nthat domiciliary programs have the capacity to accommodate women \nveterans, and that their specific safety and security concerns are \naddressed. As women become a larger proportion of the homeless veteran \npopulation, VA must have the capacity to meet their needs.\n  Finally, this legislation would increase efforts to identify and \nassist servicemembers who are at risk of becoming homeless. It would \nmake permanent an already established and successful program to aid \nincarcerated veterans in their transition back to civilian life. The \nprogram identifies at risk individuals and refers them to counseling \nand services, including health care, job training and placement, and \nhousing.\n  Building on the success of that program, the bill would also create a \nsimilar program to identify and support at risk individuals in their \ntransition from military to civilian life. It has been proven through \nsmaller scale efforts that this process can reduce the incidence of \nhomelessness and other problems among new veterans who are being \nseparated from military service.\n  Over 1 million servicemembers have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nand as they transition from military service to civilian life some will \nbe at risk of homelessness. Any effort VA can make to assist these \nservicemembers will improve lives and reduce the demand for VA homeless \nservices in the years to come. We have all heard the sad and shocking \nstatistic that one out of every three homeless persons on the street at \nany given time is a veteran. This bill is another step in attempting to \naddress and solve this shameful problem.\n  I believe that this bill adjusts existing programs to take full \nadvantage of existing resources and effective initiatives. I urge all \nof my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1384\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the United States courthouse facility \nlocated at 301 North Miami Avenue, Miami, Florida, as the ``C. Clyde \nAtkins United States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have introduced a bill that \nwill honor one of Florida's great jurists, the Honorable C. Clyde \nAtkins, by naming the Federal building at 301 North Miami Avenue in \nMiami, FL, the ``C. Clyde Atkins United States Courthouse.'' This is a \nfitting tribute to Judge Atkins. His public service provides a model \nfor members of the legal profession, indeed, for all Americans, who \nrespect the rule of law and believe in equal justice under law.\n  Before becoming a judge, Judge Atkins, who earned his law degree at \nthe University of Florida, already had distinguished himself in private \npractice. He served as the president of both the Florida bar and the \nDade County Bar Association. In 1966, President Johnson appointed Judge \nAtkins to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nFlorida. He served until his death in 1999 at the age of 84. From 1977 \nuntil 1982, Judge Atkins was the chief judge for the Southern District, \nand his leadership ensured that the court remained effective through a \nperiod when Miami confronted serious problems involving refugees, \nviolence, and drug smuggling.\n  Judge Atkins rendered important decisions in the areas of civil \nrights and civil liberties. By the luck of the draw, he was assigned to \nmany controversial cases, earning him the nickname ``Hard Luck Clyde,'' \nand it was for those rulings, often involving important civil rights \nand civil liberties issues, that he will be best remembered.\n  For example, in a decision involving Miami's homeless population, he \nordered the creation of ``safe zones'' where the homeless could \ncongregate without fear of arrest. This important decision had a ripple \neffect, helping to give rise to efforts throughout the Nation to \nrehabilitate the homeless through training and the creation of \nshelters. He also ruled in support of Cuban and Haitian refugees who \nwere held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and against the government's \nrepatriation policy. And finally, he presided over the desegregation of \nDade County's public schools for more than 20 years.\n  Judge Atkins was a person of faith. He was the first Catholic \nappointed to the bench in the Southern District, and Pope Benedict VI \nnamed him a Knight of St. Gregory. Judge Atkins also earned recognition \nfrom the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Anti-\nDefamation League, and the American Judicature Society, to name a few.\n  The proposal to name the courthouse in Miami after Judge Atkins has \nbeen supported by leaders of the bar in the Southern District, \nincluding the Dade County Bar Association. Passage of my bill will \nensure that the C. Clyde Atkins Courthouse will stand as an enduring \ntribute to an admired and respected Federal judge and the principles \nfor which he stood for generations to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1386. A bill to amend the Housing and Urban Development Act of \n1968, to provide better assistance to low- and moderate-income \nfamilies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Homeownership \nProtection and Enhancement Act of 2007, HOPE Act. This legislation \nwould reauthorize and amend Section 106 of the Housing and Urban \nDevelopment Act of 1968, so that we can improve on Federal efforts to \nsupport and sustain homeownership.\n  As we all know, during the past several years, housing prices in \ncities and States around the country have far outpaced any increase in \nwages. Families have been stretching themselves financially to get into \nhomeownership, and many families have started using alternative or \nexotic mortgages loan products to purchase their homes.\n  According to First American Loan Performance, in 2006, in my own \nState of Rhode Island, nearly 16 percent of all home-purchase loans \nwere ``interest only.'' However, as home prices have declined, many \npeople who took out these exotic loans are now finding they owe more \nthan the value of their property.\n  The Center for Responsible Lending estimates that nationally one in \nfive subprime loans originated during the prior 2 years will end in \nforeclosure, costing homeowners $164 billion, mostly in lost equity.\n  `It appears that we are just at the beginning of what could be a \nperfect storm, as many credit-stressed borrowers still face resets of \nthese exotic adjustable-rate and payment option loans. There were 1.2 \nmillion foreclosures reported nationwide last year, up 42 percent from \n2005, according to RealtyTrac, a database of foreclosed properties. \nRealtyTrac also reports 430,000 foreclosure filings in the first \nquarter of 2007, a 35 percent jump over the same period in 2006.\n  The increasing rate of foreclosures across the country is troubling. \nNot only are individual families losing their homes and their financial \nnest eggs, but there is a negative ripple effect across communities and \nthe economy. That is why I am introducing the Homeownership Protection \nand Enhancement Act, or HOPE Act.\n  This bill seeks to help States establish and enhance outreach \nprograms to proactively find homeowners at risk of losing their homes \nand help them avoid foreclosure. States will be rewarded for having set \nup effective programs to help curtail foreclosures with additional \nfunding and resources. An incentive is provided for more States to \nfollow suit and reach out to delinquent borrowers, offer them access to \nfinancial counseling, and, when appropriate, help them negotiate a plan \nto restructure their debt.\n  In particular, the HOPE Act provides $50 million for the creation and \noperation of State Homeownership Protection Centers. The centers can \nserve as a one-stop resource, offering consumers a broad range of \nservices and assistance, such as financial assessments, counseling, or \nreferrals to families in need. It authorizes $260 million in \ncompetitive grants to States who operate State Homeownership Protection \nCenters for revolving loan funds to offer one-time grants or subsidized \nloans to qualified families. It increases funding to $300 million for \neffective HUD-approved counseling agencies. Finally, it sets aside $5 \nmillion for the creation of a Federal database on defaults and \nforeclosures to improve oversight of public and private efforts to \nsustain homeownership.\n  In addition, to help prevent future borrowers from taking on \nunsustainable mortgages and falling into foreclosure, the HOPE Act \nwould create an affirmative duty for lenders and servicers to engage in \nreasonable loss mitigation prior to foreclosure. It would also require \nnotifications by lenders and servicers to borrowers regarding the full \narray of counseling services available in their State at every critical \nstep, at application, at closing, and upon delinquency. Finally, if a \nState has a State Homeownership Protection Center, lenders and \nservicers would be required to refer borrowers who are 60 days or more \ndelinquent to the center so that it can proactively attempt to reach \ndistressed borrowers.\n  I am introducing the HOPE Act because when homes get foreclosed on, \nit is not just the borrowers and lenders who pay the price, whole \nneighborhoods suffer. Housing industry experts estimate that for every \nforeclosure within an eighth of a mile of a house, two and a half city \nblocks in every direction, the property value of surrounding homes \ndrops by about 1 percent. I believe that the Federal Government has a \nresponsibility to step in and ensure that millions of Americans, \nincluding neighbors who never took out a risky loan and have scrimped \nand saved to pay their bills on time, are not adversely affected by the \nsubprime foreclosure crisis.\n  This legislation is targeted relief that will help more families keep \ntheir homes and save communities nationwide millions of dollars. We \nneed to act swiftly before personal financial tragedies turn into a \nfull blown national financial crisis.\n  The HOPE Act will set us on the path to meeting an important national \ngoal, creating sustainable homeownership. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in supporting this bill and other foreclosure prevention \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S6066]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1386\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill establish a commercial truck highway safety \ndemonstration program in the State of Maine, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nCollins, to introduce legislation that will rectify an impediment to \ninternational commerce flowing through Maine, but more importantly, \nwill offer a measure of protection that many of my constituents in \nMaine do not currently possess.\n  As many of our colleagues know, expanding upon the current Federal \ntruck weight limitation of 80,000 pounds is often looked upon as \ndangerous, flaunting the safety of drivers who may be faced with a \ntruck weighing as much as 143,000 pounds, the limit on Interstates in \nMassachusetts and New York. While I certainly concur that safety of \ndrivers is very important, and I have the record to prove it, I ask you \ndo not overlook the safety of pedestrians as well.\n  In Maine, where we currently have a limited exemption along the Maine \nTurnpike, many trucks traveling to or from the Canadian border or into \nupstate Maine are not able to travel on our Interstates as a result of \nthe 80,000 pound weight limit. This forces many of them onto secondary \nroads, many of which are two-lane roads running through small towns and \nvillages in Maine. Tanker trucks carrying fuel are passing elementary \nschools, libraries, and weaving through traffic to reach our Air \nNational Guard station. Not only is this an inefficient method of \nbringing necessary fuel guardsmen that provide our national security, \nbut imagine if you will one of those tanker trucks rupturing on Main \nStreet, potentially causing serious damage to property, causing traffic \nchaos, and most importantly, killing or injuring drivers and \npedestrians.\n  This is not a far-fetched scenario. In fact, two pedestrians were \nkilled in the past year in Maine as a result of overweight trucks on \nlocal roadways, one tragic instance occurring within sight of the \nnearby Interstate.\n  What is the result of such traffic? According to study conducted by \nthe Maine Department of Transportation, traffic fatalities involving \ntrucks weighing 100,000 pounds are 10 times greater on secondary roads \nin Maine than on the exempted interstates. Serious injuries are seven \ntimes more likely. Not to mention the exorbitant cost of maintaining \nthese secondary roads, forced to handle these massive trucks. These \nroads were not designed to handle this kind of traffic. Our interstates \nwere, yet these trucks are consistently prevented from traveling on \nthem.\n\n[[Page S6070]]\n\n  The argument against such trucks is that it is a ``slippery slope'' \nthat if you allow one State to have such an exemption, pretty soon \nyou'll have to give every State such an exemption. Well, I would like \nto remind the opponents of this amendment that we are halfway there \nalready. A total of 27 States already have some type of exemption, and \n47 States allow trucks weighing over 80,000 pounds on some roads within \ntheir State. To offer a clear picture of this, if you are driving a \ntruck weighing 100,000 pounds, you can leave Gary, IN, just outside of \nChicago, and can operate that vehicle all the way to Portland, ME. \nThere, of course, they have to unload the additional weight to continue \non the Interstate, or travel the remainder of the way through the State \non these local roads, endangering the populace and other drivers.\n  Conversely, you can operate a truck weighing 90,000 pounds from \nKansas City, MO, and travel to Seattle, WA. So I ask you, is this truly \na legitimate reason for opposition while my constituents are taking \ntheir lives in their hands when merely crossing Main Street?\n  I would especially like to thank Senator Collins for her steadfast \neffort as, side-by-side, we continue to seek a resolution to this \nissue.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to join with my senior colleague \nfrom Maine in sponsoring the Commercial Truck Highway Safety \nDemonstration Program Act, an important bill that addresses a \nsignificant safety problem in our State.\n  Under current law, trucks weighing 100,000 pounds are allowed to \ntravel on the portion of Interstate 95 designated as the Maine \nTurnpike, which runs from Maine's border with New Hampshire to Augusta, \nour capital city. At Augusta, the turnpike designation ends, but I-95 \nproceeds another 200 miles north to Houlton. At Augusta, however, heavy \ntrucks must exit the modern four-lane, limited-access highway and are \nforced onto smaller, two-lane secondary roads that pass through cities, \ntowns, and villages.\n  Trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds are permitted on interstate \nhighways in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York as well as the \nCanadian Provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec. The weight limit \ndisparity on various segments of Maine's Interstate Highway System is a \nsignificant impediment to commerce, increases wear-and-tear on our \nsecondary roads, and, most important, puts our people needlessly at \nrisk.\n  Senator Snowe and I have introduced this legislation several times in \nrecent years. We do so this year with a renewed sense of urgency, and \nin sorrow. Just last week, Susan Abraham, a bright and talented 17-\nyear-old high school student from Hampden, ME, lost her life when her \ncar was struck by a heavy truck on Route 9. The truck driver could not \nsee Susan's small car turning onto that two-lane road as he rounded a \ncorner. It was an accident but one that would have been avoided had the \ntruck remained on the interstate highway. Interstate 95 runs less than \nthree-quarters of a mile away, but Federal law prevented the truck from \nusing that modern, divided highway, a highway that was designed to \nprovide ample views of the road ahead.\n  That preventable tragedy took place almost 1 year to the day after \nLena Gray, an 80-year-old resident of Bangor, was struck and killed by \na tractor-trailer as she was crossing a downtown street. Again, that \naccident would not have occurred had that truck been allowed to use I-\n95, which runs directly through Bangor.\n  The problem Maine faces due to the disparity in truck weight limits \naffects many communities, but it is clearly evident in the eastern \nMaine cites of Bangor and Brewer. In this region, a 2-mile stretch of \nInterstate 395 connects two major state highways that carry significant \ntruck traffic across Maine. I-395 affords direct and safe access \nbetween these major corridors, but because of the existing Federal \ntruck weight limit, many heavy trucks are prohibited from using this \nmultilane, limited access highway.\n  Instead, these trucks, which sometimes carry hazardous materials, are \nrequired to maneuver through the downtown portions of Bangor and Brewer \non two-lane roadways. Truckers are faced with two options; the first is \na 3.5 mile diversion through downtown Bangor that requires several very \ndifficult and dangerous turns. The second route is a 7.5 mile diversion \nthat includes 20 traffic lights and requires travel through portions of \ndowntown Bangor as well. Congestion is a significant issue, and safety \nis seriously compromised as a result of these required diversions.\n  In June 2004, Wilbur Smiths Associates, a nationally recognized \ntransportation consulting firm, completed a study to examine the impact \na Federal weight exemption on nonexempt portions of Maine's Interstate \nHighway System would have on safety, pavement, and bridges. The study \nfound that extending the current truck weight exemption on the Maine \nTurnpike to all interstate highways in Maine would result in a decrease \nof 3.2 fatal crashes per year. A uniform truck weight limit of 100,000 \npounds on Maine's interstate highways would reduce highway miles, as \nwell as the travel times necessary to transport freight through Maine, \nresulting in safety, economic, and environmental benefits. Moreover, \nMaine's extensive network of local roads would be better preserved \nwithout the wear and tear of heavy truck traffic.\n  Most important, however, a uniform truck weight limit will keep \ntrucks on the interstate where they belong, rather than on roads and \nhighways that pass through Maine's cities, towns, and neighborhoods.\n  In addition to the safety of motorists and pedestrians, there is a \nhomeland security aspect to this as well. An accident or attack \ninvolving a heavy truck carrying explosive fuel or a hazardous chemical \non a congested city street would have devastating consequences. That \nrisk can be alleviated substantially by allowing those trucks to stay \non the open highway.\n  The legislation that Senator Snowe and I are introducing addresses \nthe safety issues we face in Maine because of the disparities in truck \nweight limits. The legislation directs the Secretary of Transportation \nto establish a commercial truck safety pilot program in Maine. Under \nthe pilot program, the truck weight limit on all Maine highways that \nare part of the interstate highway system would be set at 100,000 \npounds for three years. During the waiver period, the Secretary would \nstudy the impact of the pilot program on safety and would receive the \ninput of a panel on which State officials, and representatives from \nsafety organizations, municipalities, and the commercial trucking \nindustry would serve. The waiver would become permanent if the panel \ndetermined that motorists were safer as a result of a uniform truck \nweight limit on Maine's Interstate Highway System.\n  Maine's citizens and motorists are needlessly at risk because too \nmany heavy trucks are forced off the interstate and onto local roads. \nThe legislation Senator Snowe and I are introducing is a commonsense \napproach to a significant safety problem in my State. Our efforts are \nwidely supported by public officials throughout Maine, including the \nGovernor, the Maine Department of Transportation, the Maine Secretary \nof State, and the Maine State Police. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1389. A bill to authorize the National Science Foundation to \nestablish a Climate Change Education Program; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \ncosponsored by Ms. Snowe and Mr. Bingaman, to better educate Americans \nabout climate change. We are today introducing the Climate Change \nEducation Act, to broaden Americans' understanding of global warming.\n  There may still be disputes about exactly how much humans contribute \nto the warming of our atmosphere. But there is near certainty that the \nair we breathe is being changed by ever increased levels of greenhouse \ngases, with effects on climate, resources, and habitats.\n  Last week, I attended a hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nwhere the issue of climate change was shown to also affect our national \nsecurity. A report issued by a panel of distinguished military leaders \nconcluded that climate change will be globally\n\n[[Page S6071]]\n\ndestabilizing, leading to diminished access to fresh water, reduced \nfood production as India and sub-Saharan Africa become hotter and \ndrier, increased health crises as vector-borne diseases spread, and \ndisplacement of large populations as sea levels rise and coastal lands \nflood. As scarcities increase, conflicts over diminishing resources \nwill also increase. Governments in resource-stressed countries may \ncollapse. Environmental stresses may lead to human migration and \nrefugees.\n  I mention this to emphasize that climate change has surprising \nramifications, and that there is still much that we can all learn about \nthis issue, with effects that go well beyond traditional environmental \nconcerns. It is important that we all become better informed, that we \nanalyze the information about climate change, so that we can learn how \nto more rationally respond.\n  We believe it is important to educate our Nation about the causes and \neffects of climate change and about how we might effectively respond. \nReaching a solution to the challenge of climate change will require \nchanges in both national policy and in our use of energy and resources. \nAll of this will require a thoughtful understanding of the issue.\n  The Climate Change Education Act would create a program at the \nNational Science Foundation, which would provide opportunities for \nstudents and citizens to learn more about global warming. The program \nwould include a national information campaign to promote new approaches \nto addressing climate change and would also establish a competitive \nprogram to provide grants to develop education materials. Earlier this \nmonth, the House of Representatives passed the campanion, H.R. 1728, to \nthis bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/14/senate-section/article/S6071-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 196--COMMENDING IDAHO ON WINNING THE BID TO HOST THE \n                2009 SPECIAL OLYMPICS WORLD WINTER GAMES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Mr. Craig) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the AmeriCorps Week \nResolution, which designates May 13-20, 2007, as a time to salute \nAmeriCorps members for their work, thank community partners who make \nthe program possible, and encourage more people to join. I want to \nfirst say thank you to all the volunteers and service workers \neverywhere. They take time out of their lives to help their fellow \nAmericans in their time of need, and they do it out of the goodness of \ntheir hearts. I love AmeriCorps. I love what they do for communities, I \nlove what they do for America.\n  AmeriCorps is stronger than ever. Since its creation in 1994, 500,000 \npeople nationwide have joined the program and taken the AmeriCorps \npledge to ``get things done for America.'' AmeriCorps members have \nserved more than 630 million hours nationwide. To date, 9,310 Maryland \nresidents have earned education awards totaling over $30 million. These \nawards help volunteers pay for college, graduate school, vocational \ntraining, or to pay back student loans. The NCCC program, which has a \ncampus in Perry Point, MD, is a full-time residential program for 18- \nto 24-year-olds designed to strengthen communities and develop leaders \nthrough team-based service projects. Each year, approximately 1,100 \nparticipants reside in its 5 campuses nationwide. The Perry Point \ncampus houses 200 AmeriCorps members every year, and since 1994 its \nresidents have logged more than 400,000 service hours.\n  AmeriCorps is the embodiment of the spirit of volunteerism and \nservice to our country. They tackle the toughest problems in our \ncommunities: tutoring teens, starting neighborhood crime watches, \nturning vacant lots into neighborhoods, and helping communities clean \nup and rebuild after natural disasters. AmeriCorps volunteers are \nunflagging, unflinching and determined to make a difference. I know how \nimportant AmeriCorps is to communities across the country and to the\n\n[[Page S6072]]\n\nyoung people who want to serve.

Res. 198\n\n       Whereas mucopolysaccharidosis (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``MPS'') is a genetically determined lysosomal \n     storage disorder that renders the human body incapable of \n     producing certain enzymes needed to break down complex \n     carbohydrates;\n       Whereas complex carbohydrates are then stored in almost \n     every cell in the body and progressively cause damage to \n     those cells;\n       Whereas the cell damage adversely affects the human body by \n     damaging the heart, respiratory system, bones, internal \n     organs, and central nervous system;\n       Whereas the cellular damage caused by MPS often results in \n     mental retardation, short stature, corneal damage, joint \n     stiffness, loss of mobility, speech and hearing impairment, \n     heart disease, hyperactivity, chronic respiratory problems, \n     and, most importantly, a drastically shortened life span;\n       Whereas the nature of the disorder is usually not apparent \n     at birth;\n       Whereas, without treatment, the life expectancy of an \n     individual afflicted with MPS begins to decrease at a very \n     early stage in the life of the individual;\n       Whereas recent research developments have resulted in the \n     creation of limited treatments for some MPS disorders;\n       Whereas promising advancements in the pursuit of treatments \n     for additional MPS disorders are underway;\n       Whereas, despite the creation of newly developed remedies, \n     the blood brain barrier continues to be a significant \n     impediment to effectively treating the brain, thereby \n     preventing the treatment of many of the symptoms of MPS;\n       Whereas treatments for MPS will be greatly enhanced with \n     continued public funding;\n       Whereas the quality of life for individuals afflicted with \n     MPS, and the treatments available to them, will be enhanced \n     through the development of early detection techniques and \n     early intervention;\n       Whereas treatments and research advancements for MPS are \n     limited by a lack of awareness about MPS disorders;\n       Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS disorders extends \n     to those within the medical community;\n       Whereas the damage that is caused by MPS makes it a model \n     for study of many other degenerative genetic disorders;\n       Whereas the development of effective therapies and a \n     potential cure for MPS disorders can be accomplished by \n     increased awareness, research, data collection, and \n     information distribution;\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution than can raise public \n     awareness about MPS; and\n       Whereas the Senate is also an institution that can assist \n     in encouraging and facilitating increased public and private \n     sector research for early diagnosis and treatments of MPS \n     disorders: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 15, 2007, as ``National MPS Awareness \n     Day''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/14/senate-section/article/S6072-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1092.

Res. 198\n\n       Whereas mucopolysaccharidosis (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``MPS'') is a genetically determined lysosomal \n     storage disorder that renders the human body incapable of \n     producing certain enzymes needed to break down complex \n     carbohydrates;\n       Whereas complex carbohydrates are then stored in almost \n     every cell in the body and progressively cause damage to \n     those cells;\n       Whereas the cell damage adversely affects the human body by \n     damaging the heart, respiratory system, bones, internal \n     organs, and central nervous system;\n       Whereas the cellular damage caused by MPS often results in \n     mental retardation, short stature, corneal damage, joint \n     stiffness, loss of mobility, speech and hearing impairment, \n     heart disease, hyperactivity, chronic respiratory problems, \n     and, most importantly, a drastically shortened life span;\n       Whereas the nature of the disorder is usually not apparent \n     at birth;\n\n[[Page S6078]]\n\n       Whereas, without treatment, the life expectancy of an \n     individual afflicted with MPS begins to decrease at a very \n     early stage in the life of the individual;\n       Whereas recent research developments have resulted in the \n     creation of limited treatments for some MPS disorders;\n       Whereas promising advancements in the pursuit of treatments \n     for additional MPS disorders are underway;\n       Whereas, despite the creation of newly developed remedies, \n     the blood brain barrier continues to be a significant \n     impediment to effectively treating the brain, thereby \n     preventing the treatment of many of the symptoms of MPS;\n       Whereas treatments for MPS will be greatly enhanced with \n     continued public funding;\n       Whereas the quality of life for individuals afflicted with \n     MPS, and the treatments available to them, will be enhanced \n     through the development of early detection techniques and \n     early intervention;\n       Whereas treatments and research advancements for MPS are \n     limited by a lack of awareness about MPS disorders;\n       Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS disorders extends \n     to those within the medical community;\n       Whereas the damage that is caused by MPS makes it a model \n     for study of many other degenerative genetic disorders;\n       Whereas the development of effective therapies and a \n     potential cure for MPS disorders can be accomplished by \n     increased awareness, research, data collection, and \n     information distribution;\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution than can raise public \n     awareness about MPS; and\n       Whereas the Senate is also an institution that can assist \n     in encouraging and facilitating increased public and private \n     sector research for early diagnosis and treatments of MPS \n     disorders: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 15, 2007, as ``National MPS Awareness \n     Day''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/14/senate-section/article/S6078-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMEMORATING THE 85TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE AMERICAN \n              HELLENIC EDUCATIONAL PROGRESSIVE ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, we have so much to do the next 2 weeks. As \nindicated with what is going on here today, we have to do our very best \nto complete WRDA. We have the most important supplemental to take care \nof the funding of the operations in Iraq and other things. Senator \nMcConnell and I have spoken today about how to get from here to there. \nWe do not have that totally resolved yet, but we have moved the ball \ndown the road. We also have a budget conference to complete. That has \nnot been done yet. And we have immigration.\n  So, Madam President, I want this to be the first notice--and we have \ndone very well. We have not had to work many Fridays; certainly in the \nafternoons we have not had to. We have had a number of free Mondays, \nand we have had only one Saturday we have worked all year. But everyone \nshould be on notice the next two weekends and the next few days and \ncertainly next week, including Monday, people should understand--and \npeople, if they have arrangements they have made, if they have things \nto do for which they cannot be here until later Monday, change that \nbecause we have to have votes--unless something comes up we do not \nunderstand--Monday morning. We have too much to do. We must complete \nthe items I have talked about before we leave for our Memorial Day \nrecess or we will have to delay that recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/14/senate-section/article/S6078-4", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
