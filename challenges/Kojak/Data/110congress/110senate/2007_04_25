Mr. President, this morning there will be an hour of \nmorning business, with the first half controlled by the majority and \nthe second half controlled by the Republicans. Following morning \nbusiness, we will resume consideration of S. 761. Under an agreement \nentered last night, once we get back on the bill, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate with respect to the Sununu amendment, which is \nnumbered 938, which strikes a section of the bill seeking to strengthen \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics education at all \nschool levels. We expect the amendment will be voted on at a little \nafter 11 this morning. My understanding is once we dispose of the \nSununu amendment, then the Sanders amendment remains pending.\n  Mr. President, let me say to everyone, I have not had the opportunity \nto speak to the Republican leader today, but it would be my intention \nthat we would be in recess from 4 until 5:30 for the briefings by \nGeneral Petraeus, General Pace, and others up in room 407. But it would \nbe my intention to finish this bill after that.\n  It is my understanding there are some Coburn amendments--he has three \nof them--and we would like to get votes scheduled on those. If there \nare other amendments, let's bring them forward. But we will not get the \nbill from the House on the supplemental until tonight, anyway. We are \nnot going to be able to do anything on it tonight. I think it would be \na good step forward if we can finish this bill tonight. That means we \nwould work on it until late in the evening and finish this bill. That \nis my intention. I hope there are no efforts to delay this bill. If, in \nfact, that is the case, as I have said before, we would just back off \nthe bill. If we cannot pass, on a bipartisan basis, legislation that \nhas more than 50 cosponsors, I think it is not a good day for us. We \nshould be able to show the American people there are some things we can \ndo on a bipartisan basis.\n  I remind all Members that there will be a briefing today, as I have \nindicated, in 407 beginning at 4 p.m.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5013-7", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week our colleague, Senator Byron \nDorgan, chairman of the Commerce\n\n[[Page S5014]]\n\nCommittee's Subcommittee on Interstate Commerce, Trade, and Tourism, \nheld the first in a series of hearings on our U.S. trade policy. I was \nproud to join Chairman Dorgan as we asked the pivotal question on the \nminds of workers and small business owners across the country: Is free \ntrade working? Is it working for American communities? Is it working \nfor our families? Is it working for our workers?\n  For the majority of Americans and people worldwide, the answer is a \nresounding no. For a privileged few, yes, this model of trade has \nincreased the bottom lines. But the economic values embodied by this \nfree-trade model are skewed toward a very select few in our Nation. Not \nonly is our trade policy not working, it is worsening the problem of \nincome equality across the Nation.\n  From 1946 to 1973, economic opportunities for poor and working \nfamilies in this country grew. As you can see, that income, people's \nincome--they are divided into five groups--the lowest income, 20 \npercent, the middle groups, and then the wealthiest 20 percent.\n  Between 1947 and 1973 in this country, the 20 percent lowest income \nworkers actually saw their income rise the fastest. From 1947 to 1973, \nthat was a time of strong economic growth. It was a time of actual \ntrade surpluses during those years. It was a time of fairly stable \nenergy prices--all of that.\n  The lesson here: Families that worked hard, that played by the rules, \nhad a real chance of getting ahead.\n  Then the next, from 1973 to 2000, that economic opportunity began to \nflatten out for those families. We saw, in those years, from 1973 to \n2000--1973 was the year we went from a trade surplus to a trade \ndeficit. That was only one of the reasons. The lowest income workers \nsaw their income grow by the least. People whose income was in the top \n20 percent saw their income grow the fastest.\n  If we had a third chart here, income since 2000, since 2000, income \nhas gone up only for the wealthiest 20 percent in this country.\n  When Secretary Paulson came to the Banking Committee and spoke to us, \nhe bragged about 3\\1/2\\ percent economic growth for this country--a \ngood thing. The problem is, profits are up, productivity is up, but \nworkers are not sharing in the wealth they create. Profits are up, \nexecutive salaries are up, and almost everybody else's income in this \ncountry has been pretty stagnant.\n  Our economic house is not in order. It is not in order nationally, \nand it is not anywhere where it needs to be in my State of Ohio. When I \nfirst ran for Congress in 1992, our trade deficit was $38 billion. Our \ntrade deficit figures for 2006 topped $800 billion. That is from $38 \nbillion to $200 billion from 1992 to 2006. Our trade deficit with China \nwent from low double figures in 1992 to well over $200 billion--an \nincrease of almost 20 times in those 15 years or so. In fact, since \n1982, we have accumulated trade deficits of $4.3 trillion. The \naggregate trade deficit from 1982 to the present day is $4.3 trillion. \nThat is money which eventually will have to be paid. Put another way, \nwe have produced 4.3 trillion fewer manufactured goods, in most cases, \nthan we have purchased. Put another way, to understand what $4.3 \ntrillion of wealth transferred out of our country means, if you had \n$4.3 trillion and you spent $1,000 every second of every minute of \nevery hour of every day, to spend that $4.3 trillion trade debt, it \nwould take you 131 years.\n  We have lost more than 3 million manufacturing jobs across the \ncountry. Those are jobs which pay an average of 31 percent more than \nservice sector jobs. Service sector jobs, the ones that NAFTA and the \nWorld Trade Organization proponents said would replace manufacturing \njobs, they also are tradable and they are also moving offshore at a \nswift pace.\n  The trade policies we have set in Washington and negotiated across \nthe globe have a direct impact on places such as Toledo and Hamilton, \nOH, Cleveland and Steubenville, and Lime, OH, as well as in Mexico and \nKorea and Bangladesh.\n  We must shrink income equality, grow our business community, and \ncreate good-paying jobs. We must establish trade policy that builds our \neconomic security, not undermines it. Job loss does not just affect the \nworker or even just the worker's family. Job loss, especially job loss \nin the thousands, obviously devastates communities, layoffs of police \nand fire and teachers and all of that. It hurts local business owners, \nthe drugstore, the grocery store, the neighborhood restaurant.\n  This model of trade is also not winning us more friends abroad. Last \nmonth, tens of thousands of workers in Korea took to the streets \nprotesting a pending free-trade agreement with the United States, \nsimilar to the tens of thousands of protesters against the Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement in our country and in the six countries \nin Central America.\n  Much has been written and said about the waning enthusiasm for the \nfree trade area of the Americas, throughout Latin America, most notably \nbecause of what NAFTA has done to Mexico's rural population, with a \nmillion and a half small farmers' livelihoods devastated. It almost \ntoppled the favored Presidential candidate in Mexico last year, as the \nchallenger talked about NAFTA's negative impact on Mexico and who came \nwithin a hair of winning. In Brazil, in Bolivia, in Ecuador, and \nelsewhere, leaders are responding to the demand for a very different, \nmore equitable trading system, not one modeled after the North American \nFree Trade Agreement.\n  A few years ago, I traveled to McAllen, TX, where I crossed the \nborder with a couple of friends into Reynosa, Mexico. I met a husband \nand wife who worked for General Electric Mexico, 3 miles from the \nUnited States, and lived in a shack about 15 feet by 15 feet, no \nrunning water, no electricity, dirt floors. When it rained hard, the \nfloors turned to mud. Behind their little shack was a ditch maybe 4 \nfeet wide, human and industrial waste flowing through that ditch. The \nAmerican Medical Association said it is the most toxic place in the \nWestern Hemisphere.\n  As you walked through their neighborhood, you could tell where the \npeople living in each of those shacks worked because their homes were \nconstructed from the packing material, the boxes and the wooden crates \nand the pieces of cardboard and all, the packing material from the \ncompany for which they worked.\n  You could go nearby to an auto plant, nearby to these homes in this \nneighborhood, 3, 4 miles from the United States of America. The auto \nplant looked just like an auto plant in Lordstown, OH, or just like the \nauto plant in Avon Lake or just like the auto plant at Twinsburg, OH. \nThe auto plant was modern, the technology was up to date, the floors \nwere clean, the workers were productive, and the workers were working \nhard. The only difference between the Mexican auto plant and the \nAmerican auto plant is the Mexican auto plant did not have a parking \nlot because the workers are not paid enough to buy the cars they make.\n  You could go halfway around the world to a Motorola plant in \nMalaysia, and the workers are not paid enough to buy the cell phones \nthey make, or come back to our hemisphere, to Costa Rica, to a Disney \nplant, and the workers are not making enough at the Disney plant to buy \nthe toys for their children. You can go back halfway around the world \nto a Nike plant in China, and the workers are not making enough to buy \nthe shoes they make in their jobs.\n  Only when workers share in the wealth they create will we know our \ntrade policy is working. American workers are more and more productive \nevery year, an explosion in productivity in this country, yet workers' \nwages are flat, as we see, especially the bottom 60 or 80 percent, and \nespecially since 2000, where our trade policy is having a depressing \nimpact on wages.\n  Two years ago, thousands of workers in Central America took to the \nstreets protesting that failed trade policy. CAFTA still has not been \nimplemented in Coast Rica because it is so controversial. In fact, this \nweek in Costa Rica, there will be a public referendum on the Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement.\n  This shift in thinking about free trade, both in the Senate and the \nHouse, in this country among the public and abroad, presents all of us \ntoday with an opportunity, the challenge we face, which grows in \nurgency as to how we trade and take part in our global economy without \ncontinuing to destroy, to undermine the middle class. The current \nsystem is not sustainable.\n\n[[Page S5015]]\n\n  Those of us who support free trade--not fair trade but support free \ntrade--we want trade, we want plenty of it, but under new rules. We \nwant legitimate fair trade. It is considered protectionist by some to \nfight for labor and environmental standards, but they consider it free \ntrade to protect drug company patents and Hollywood DVDs. If we can \nprotect intellectual property rights with enforceable provisions in \ntrade agreements, as we should, we absolutely can do the same for labor \nstandards and environmental protections and food safety standards.\n  I am pleased to say this Congress is already hard at work in building \na better trade policy. Senator Dorgan and I have introduced \nantisweatshop legislation. We need more fair trade to build the middle \nclass and lift up American workers. There will be more of those \nproposals in the future. It is not a matter of if we trade but how we \ntrade and who benefits from that trade. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5015-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5015-S5017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am here to speak on the floor today \nbecause American lives, American security, and America's future are on \nthe line in Iraq. The American people know it. They sent a clear \nmessage last November. The Iraq Study Group has told us. They gave us \nhonest assessments and recommendations to move forward in Iraq.\n  Generals have spoken out. General Casey told us in January:\n\n       The longer we in the U.S. Forces continue to bear the main \n     burden of Iraq's security, it lengthens the time that the \n     government of Iraq has to make the hard decisions about \n     reconciliation and dealing with the militias.\n\n  General Abizaid told us in November:\n\n       I do not believe that more American troops right now is the \n     solution to the problem.\n\n  Colin Powell has talked about it. He said:\n\n       I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into \n     Baghdad for the purpose of suppressing this communitarian \n     violence, this civil war, will work.\n\n  The numbers speak for themselves. More than 3,300 Americans have died \nin Iraq and nearly 25,000 have been wounded. A few days ago, 9 more \nU.S. soldiers were killed in a bombing, and 20 more U.S. troops and an \nIraqi soldier were injured.\n  Americans have heard the military experts, they have heard the Iraq \nStudy Group, they have seen the sacrifice of our troops and their \nfamilies, and now they are demanding a change in course. But, sadly, \nthe President refuses to listen. He is ignoring the military experts, \nthe bipartisan Iraq Study Group, and the American people.\n  It is clear the Iraqi civil war requires a political solution, not a \nmilitary solution. Our servicemembers have done everything we have \nasked them to do. They deserve better than to be stuck in the middle of \na civil war.\n  Four years into this war--starting the fifth year--the President is \nstill tossing around heated rhetoric while trying to convince the \nAmerican people that Democrats do not support the troops. I reject that \nrhetoric, and I call on him to put politics aside and begin to put our \ntroops first. We can all agree, it is long past time for that.\n  Now is the time to show our troops we support them with the funds and \nsupplies and armor they need but that we also support them enough to \nchange direction when the current course simply is not working.\n  Now is the time to show our troops we respect our military, and we \nrefuse to decimate the world's finest fighting forces through extended \ndeployments, limited time at home, and the destruction of valuable \nequipment in another country's civil war.\n  Now is the time to show our troops their lives mean more than an \nopen-ended commitment to an Iraqi Government that has repeatedly failed \nto meet deadlines and take ownership for their own future.\n  Now is the time to show our troops we understand that America needs \nthem, not in the middle of an Iraqi civil war but in places such as \nAfghanistan, where al-Qaida is growing in strength.\n  And now is the time to show our troops their Government is about more \nthan promises and rhetoric. We must stand together to say we will meet \nthe needs of our injured servicemembers and our veterans who have paid \nthe price for this administration's failure to plan for the war and its \naftermath.\n  Congress is moving forward now to pass a supplemental bill that shows \nour troops they come first. All the President has to do is sign on the \ndotted line. Unfortunately, because the Bush administration failed to \nplan and failed to understand the centuries' old tensions in this \nregion, we now, more than ever, need a political and diplomatic \nsolution in Iraq.\n  As the past 2 months have brutally revealed, the escalation is not \nworking. The civil war has intensified and our troops are stuck in the \nmiddle of sectarian violence and find themselves the target of \ninsurgent attacks. It is hard to argue that the situation on the \nground--both for our troops and for Iraqis--has gotten better.\n  Last Wednesday, the New York Times reported:\n\n       Bombs ripped through the streets of Baghdad killing at \n     least 171 people in the deadliest day in the capital since \n     the American-led security plan for the city took effect two \n     months ago.\n\n  Two days ago, the Boston Globe noted:\n\n       The deaths raised to 85 the number of U.S. servicemembers \n     who died in Iraq in April, making it the deadliest month for \n     American troops since December, when 112 died.\n\n  According to the Associated Press:\n\n       Outside the capital, 1,504 civilians were killed between \n     Feb. 14 and Thursday, April 12 compared with 1,009 deaths \n     during the two previous months.\n  It is time to transition our mission in Iraq from that of policing a \ncivil war. Our troops are trained for combat, not for refereeing \nwarring factions with a long and complex history. It is time to focus \non strengthening America's security and bringing our troops home.\n  Transitioning the mission should center on three realistic and \nachievable goals for our military: Training and equipping Iraqi \nsecurity forces, conducting targeted counterterrorism operations, and \nprotecting our remaining U.S. forces and interests in Iraq.\n  The second part of the equation is a surge in diplomatic and \npolitical efforts. This is a necessary task the President has refused \nto undertake. America alone does not own the keys to Iraq's future. \nIraq's neighbors must help as well. They should play a larger role in \ntraining the Iraqi military and police and in reconstruction. They \nshould play a larger role in convincing Iraqis they must make \ncompromises and take responsibility for their future. Without a \ntargeted and serious regional effort to stabilize Iraq, the country's \nfuture will remain in question.\n  The cause of continued insecurity and destruction has not been our \nmilitary, but, rather, the political and policy failures of a President \nwho has hid in his bunker and stubbornly refused to pursue a strategy \nneeded to bring stability to Iraq.\n  As we all saw vividly in November, the American people have lost \npatience with the President's go-it-alone strategy. It is simply \nwrongheaded to continue on with an open-ended commitment to an Iraqi \nGovernment that has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines and to take \nresponsibility for their own country.\n  The supplemental bill we will send to the White House requires the \nPresident to send a report to Congress by July 1 of this year \ncertifying whether Iraq is meeting responsible benchmarks. The American \npeople deserve to know if the sacrifices made by our troops are being \nmet by the Iraqi Government.\n  Specifically, the American people deserve to know if the Iraqi \nGovernment has given U.S. and Iraqi security forces the authority to \npursue all extremists, including the Sunni insurgents and the Shia \nmilitias.\n  The American people deserve to know if Iraq is making substantial \nprogress in delivering necessary Iraqi security forces for Baghdad and \nprotecting those forces from political interference.\n  We deserve to know if Iraq is intensifying efforts to build balanced \nsecurity forces throughout Iraq that provide evenhanded security for \nall Iraqis.\n  Specifically, we deserve to know if the Iraqi Government is making \nsubstantial progress in meeting reconciliation initiatives, including \nenacting laws to equitably share oil revenue\n\n[[Page S5016]]\n\namong all Iraqi regions, whether they are adopting laws for provincial \nand local elections, whether they are reforming their laws banning \nmembers of the Baath party from public service, and whether they are \nshouldering the cost of reconstruction through allocation of oil \nrevenue.\n  Those are reasonable benchmarks Americans should require of Iraq if \nwe are asking our young Americans to put their lives on the line. That \nis why Congress is about to send this supplemental request to the White \nHouse with language that begins the phased redeployment of our troops \nno later than October 1 of this year, with a goal of removing all \ncombat forces by April 1, 2008--with the exception of those who will \nremain to train and equip Iraqi security forces, to continue targeted \ncounterterrorist operations, and to protect our remaining U.S. forces.\n  From sending our troops to war without critical armor, to housing \nthem in squalor at Walter Reid, to leaving them to fend for themselves \nwhen they need mental health care, the Bush administration has utterly \nfailed our servicemembers, our veterans, and their families.\n  As we rightfully change the mission of our troops in Iraq and prepare \nto redeploy, we cannot--and we must not--forget about our veterans when \nthey come home. Nowhere is that failure more apparent than in the \nhandling of what will one day become known as the signature wound of \nthis war: traumatic brain injury. It is now estimated that 10 percent \nof Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have suffered traumatic brain injury \nduring their service in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of the biggest \nproblems with traumatic brain injury, or TBI, is that it is an unseen \nwound. Often, because of that, it is misdiagnosed. In too many cases \ntoday, unless a servicemember is involved in an IED incident and is \nbleeding, he or she is not documented as even having been involved in \nthat explosion, if he was 100 yards away or 200 yards away. So as a \nresult, the actual number of OIF and OEF veterans with TBI could be \neven much higher than the statistics today even indicate.\n  Now, I know many of us are familiar with ABC News anchor Bob \nWoodruff's experience with traumatic brain injury. I personally was \nmoved by Bob's struggle with his injury. His family had unrelenting \nhope for his recovery, and their ongoing work toward triumph was so \napparent throughout this horrible situation. Bob Woodruff has seen a \ntremendous recovery from his horrendous injury, but I fear the care he \nreceived has not been duplicated today for thousands of other troops \nwith similar injuries when they have returned home.\n  He detailed for us several cases of soldiers who were suffering from \ninjuries, not unlike his own, and the lack of care they received when \nthey left flagship care centers for our smaller, local hospitals.\n  Our wounded warriors and our veterans have faced massive budget \nshortfalls. They have faced horribly long waiting lines and sickening \nhospital conditions. But this administration continues to be reactive \nto this problem to this day. It is time for that posture to end. Taking \ncare of our troops, taking care of our veterans, taking care of their \nfamilies has to be a part of the cost of this war.\n  When it comes to caring for our troops and our veterans, this \nadministration--from the White House, to the Pentagon, to the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs--has consistently waited until \nconditions reached a critical stage before taking action to remedy \nthem.\n  In this supplemental conference report we are sending to the \nPresident, Congress is saying: Enough is enough. We are finally \nproviding more funding for our troops than even the President himself \nhas sought. The bill we are sending includes over $100 billion for the \nDepartment of Defense, which I should note is nearly $4 billion more \nthan the President's request for our troops. We provide critical \nfunding for vehicles that will help our troops be protected from these \nhorrible IEDs.\n  This military has also been brought to the brink by a President who \nhas, time and again, extended their tours and called upon our National \nGuard and Reserve to join combat brigades in Iraq. This supplemental \nbill will rebuild our overburdened military and calls for an end to the \ndeployment of nonbattle-ready troops. It provides $1.8 billion for the \nVA to provide first class health care to our wounded and $2.5 billion \nfor military health care.\n  For the last 4 years, this administration has conducted this war with \nlittle regard for the tremendous strains it is placing on the VA, on \nour veterans, and their families. Today, we are putting an end to their \nneglect. The days of ignoring our wounded warriors as a cost of this \nwar are over.\n\n  As the President acknowledged in a speech last September, our \nterrorist enemies are more dangerous than ever. On that point, the \nPresident is correct. Unfortunately, he fails to acknowledge that \nterrorists are rapidly growing and gathering strength outside of Iraq, \nand he fails to acknowledge that having our forces in the middle of a \ncivil war is making Iraq sap our ability to combat terrorism in other \nparts of the globe. It is clear that terrorist cells with heavy anti-\nAmerican bents are gaining power and continue to grow in places such as \nAfghanistan and Pakistan. If we turn a blind eye to those anti-American \ncells and focus only on Iraq, the consequences for America's future \nsecurity are dire. By redeploying our forces, we can reconcentrate on \nthe war on terror. We can devote our resources toward pursuing those \nwho would do America harm.\n  As we deal with the situation overseas, we cannot neglect our needs \nat home. That is why the supplemental bill provides $1.8 billion for \nveterans health care; $20 million to repair Walter Reed Hospital; $6.9 \nbillion to repair the gulf coast after Hurricane Katrina, long past \ndue; $650 million for the SCHIP children's health program; and $2.25 \nbillion to secure our homeland, a vital need--securing our ports and \nborders, transit security, screening for explosives at airports--vital \nneeds that are included in this bill.\n  Somehow the White House is claiming that all of those investments are \nunnecessary. I think most Americans would disagree. I know most \nAmericans want us to take care of our citizens at home.\n  In recent weeks we have heard some false claims about the \nsupplemental that I want to take a moment to correct. First of all, we \nare moving this bill to the President at a rapid pace. In fact, we are \nmoving even faster than the Republicans did last year and the year \nbefore that.\n  Secondly, we are doing our job in meeting the needs at home. Anyone \nwho thinks that domestic needs should be ignored in an emergency \nsupplemental ought to look at the last four supplementals, all written \nand passed by a Republican Congress signed by a Republican President.\n  The emergency supplementals approved by Republican Congresses in \n2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 included funding for domestic needs. \nInterestingly, during those years, the President never complained about \ndomestic funding in supplementals.\n  As our Government spends billions in Iraq, I believe it is our job to \nalso meet our needs at home. If the President vetoes this bill, he is \ngoing to have to explain to the American people why he is delaying \nfunding to our troops overseas, why he is blocking funding to care for \nour injured troops, why he is ignoring the will of military experts, \nthe Iraq Study Group, and the American people. He is going to have to \nexplain why he is ignoring the needs of our hard-hit communities that \nare struggling to recover and why he is standing in the way of security \nneeds at home that are so critical.\n  Congress has agreed to a supplemental bill that shows our troops they \ncome first. The President has repeatedly reminded Congress that he is \nthe Commander in Chief and he is the one with the authority to make the \nmilitary and policy decisions that impact not only our troops and \nveterans but the well-being of our gulf coast, our borders, and the \nfuture of America's security. The President is alone in his bunker. If \nhe truly cares about getting this funding to our troops as soon as \npossible and providing them with the supplies and the health care and \ndirection they deserve, he will quickly sign this bipartisan \nsupplemental bill.\n  Mr. President, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is just a short distance from \nCapitol Hill, but if the President vetoes this sensible legislation to \ngive our troops a successful path forward in\n\n[[Page S5017]]\n\nIraq, then he is miles away from the will of the American people whom \nhe serves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I strongly oppose President Bush's \nstatements that the Democratic leaders are trying to use the current \nemergency supplemental bill to make a political statement. Congress is \nacting on its mandate from the American people, who used their votes \nlast November to register their opposition to the war in Iraq.\n  The President has repeatedly made it clear that nothing--not the \nwishes of the American people, not the advice of military foreign \npolicy experts, not the concerns of members of both parties--will \ndiscourage him from pursuing a war that has no end in sight and that \nhas no military solution. With our heroic troops stuck in an Iraqi \ncivil war, Congress cannot wait for the President to change course. We \nmust change the course ourselves.\n  Once again, President Bush is stalling for time as he threatens to \nveto a bipartisan bill that could finally change the course in Iraq.\n  Although the conference report does not go as far or move as quickly \nas I would like, it is an important step toward ending the President's \nmisguided policies in Iraq. It requires the President to begin \nredeploying U.S. troops from Iraq, while permitting troops to remain in \nIraq for defined and narrow purposes: To protect U.S. personnel and \nfacilities, to engage in ``targeted special actions'' against al-Qaida \nand their affiliates and to train and equip Iraqi forces. The vast \nmajority of our troops would have to be redeployed, thus bringing to an \nend our current involvement in what may be the greatest foreign policy \nblunder in American history.\n  Some of my colleagues may still feel we should defer to the Commander \nin Chief. But these arguments disregard our congressional \nresponsibilities. Congress authorized this war and we have the power \nand the responsibility to bring it to a close.\n  We have a responsibility to end a war that is taking away resources \nfrom our top national security priority--the global fight against al-\nQaida and its affiliates. Let me remind my colleagues that this is \nindeed a global fight--focusing so much of our resources on one country \nagainst an enemy that operates around the world is shortsighted and \nself-defeating.\n  I am not suggesting that we leave the Iraqis to their own devices. \nThere are many serious and troubling political problems in Iraq that \nare driving the insurgency and sectarian struggle and they require the \nattention of U.S. policymakers. But they will not be solved by an open-\nended, massive military engagement.\n  Instead, we need a strategic approach to redeployment and a global \nstrategy to defeat the threats posed by terrorist networks. As long as \nthe President's Iraq policy goes unchecked, our military will continue \nto put their lives on the line unnecessarily, our constituents will \ncontinue to pour billions of their dollars into this war, our military \nreadiness will continue to erode, and we will be unable to develop a \nstrategy to truly confront al-Qaida.\n  If the President vetoes this bill, he will be rejecting the wishes of \nthe American people and the imperatives of our national security. I \nwill oppose any efforts to send a weaker bill to the President's desk \nand I will continue to speak out on this issue until the voices of the \nAmerican people are finally heard in Congress and the White House.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we have 30 minutes; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct, there is 30 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Presiding Officer let me know when 10 minutes \nhave passed?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The President will veto this measure. He should. It is \none of the worst ideas to ever come out of the Congress in the history \nof warfare that the United States has been engaged in. It sets a date \nfor withdrawal. I think it is October. It intrudes on the President's \nCommander in Chief role. It is letting the enemy know exactly what they \nhave to do in terms of date and time to win in Iraq. Everyone who dies \nwaiting on the time to pass, what have they died for? What have they \nbeen injured for?\n  What I would like to point out is that we should talk about those who \nhave lost their lives in Iraq wearing the uniform, and civilians \nincluded, who have been serving our country. But we shouldn't use their \ndeaths as a reason to withdraw from a war we can't afford to lose--and \nwe have not lost. We should be honoring their service and their \nsacrifice, their ultimate sacrifice, because they are standing for our \nnational security interests. Why do they serve? Why do they go to Iraq? \nWhy do they keep reenlisting in the Iraqi theater and the Afghan \ntheater at a higher rate than the military as a whole? What do they see \nabout Iraq that people here in the Senate are blinded to? Why would \nthey keep going back to a war they believe is lost? Why would they go \nthree and four times? Why would they enlist at levels beyond any other \ngroup in the military?\n  Because they know after having gone that if we win in Iraq, their \nchildren, their grandchildren, the Nation as a whole is more secure. \nAnd if we lose in Iraq, the war is not over, it just gets bigger, and \nthe likelihood of their children being involved in a war in the Middle \nEast goes up, not down. So that is why they go. That is why they are \nnot withdrawing. That is why enlistments are up, not down, because they \nget it.\n  The Senate doesn't get it. The Democratic leadership doesn't get it \nat all. Blinded by a dislike of this President, they can't see clearly \nwhat is going on in Iraq. Whether we should have gone or not is over; \nwe are there. There are other people who are there who would like to \nwin this war. Al-Qaida is there in large numbers, trying to kill this \ninfant democracy, because they know if a democracy can flourish in \nIraq, their agenda has taken a mighty blow.\n  How are they trying to drive us out? By killing civilians and \ncoalition forces in as large a number as they can muster.\n  So is it going to be the foreign policy of the United States when it \ncomes to fighting terrorism that if they can kill enough of us--\nwhatever that magic number is--we leave? You win? Do you think for one \nmoment declaring Iraq lost makes us safer? There is sectarian violence \nin Iraq, but there are plenty of people of the Shia, Sunni, and Kurdish \npersuasions that want the same thing for Iraq that we want. There are \nShia extremists who want to align with Iran. There are Sunni extremists \nwho want to come back in power and have the good old days of Saddam. \nThey are in the minority. There is not open civil war in this country. \nThere are extremists groups representing the Sunni and the Shia sects \nthat are trying to change Iraq for their purposes, bend Iraq to their \nwill, against the majority of Iraqis, and in the middle of these sects \nis al-Qaida. In the middle of these sects is Iran.\n  Why is Iran playing so hard in Iraq? The biggest nightmare to this \nIranian theocracy would be a democracy on their border, where different \ngroups would live together, where a woman could have a say about her \nchildren, where people could vote for their leaders, not be dictated to \nfrom on high. That is why they are playing in Iraq. That is why al-\nQaida is there.\n  The question is, Why do we want to leave? It is tough to watch young \nAmericans killed and maimed in war, but we didn't start this war. War \nis inevitably about young people getting hurt and getting killed. That \nis why the world--after so many thousands of years, it seems as if \nmankind would have learned that war is not the way, but we haven't \nlearned that lesson as mankind. The people who attacked us on September \n11, 2001, there will never be a surrender document negotiated with \nthem.\n  Iraq was about replacing a dictator who was trying to make a joke of \nU.N. inspections, trying to make the world and his neighbors believe \nthat he was acquiring weapons of mass destruction.\n\n[[Page S5018]]\n\nIt was a dictatorship that was sending money to suicide bomber families \nin Palestine. It was a dictatorship that was making everything in the \nMiddle East harder. It was a dictatorship that was shooting at American \nairplanes every day in violations of U.N. agreements. It was a \ndictatorship that is now in the ash dump of history. From this \ndictatorship we are trying to do something new and different for the \nMideast, and it will inure to our benefit greatly as a nation: create \nthe ability of different people from different backgrounds to vote for \ntheir leaders, to live under the rule of law, and not the rule of the \ngun. That makes us safer. It changes the Mideast, and it is a great \nblow to the terrorists. That is why they enlist. That is why they keep \nreenlisting. That is why they are dying.\n  Now, our majority leader, Senator Reid, who is a fine fellow, and I \nhave enjoyed working with him, has made a colossal mistake for the ages \nby declaring this war lost. Not only does it run against the grain of \nthe way Americans feel about combat when our Nation is at war, it runs \nagainst the reality of the consequences of having declared the war \nlost. To me, it shows a lack of understanding of what that statement \nmeans because when you say the war is lost, the next question to ask \nis, if we lost, who won? In war, there are winners and there are \nlosers, and if the majority leader has declared us the loser, then the \nquestion needs to be asked by the world and this country: Who won that \nwar in Iraq?\n  Well, I will tell you who will claim credit for winning the war in \nIraq--al-Qaida. They will put on their Web site and in their propaganda \nto anybody who will listen: We won in Iraq. I guarantee you, if we \nlost, they won. Do you feel comfortable with that as a Senator \nrepresenting the United States of America? I don't.\n  Who else won, if we lost? The Shia extremists who are trying to turn \nIraq into a theocracy aligned with Iran. Does that satisfy you as a \nUnited States Senator? Is that OK with you? It is certainly not OK with \nme. The Sunni extremists, they won, the ones who are trying to take \nIraq back to the good old days of Saddam.\n  Who are the biggest losers beyond us? We know who the winners are, \nthe extremists in Iraq and al-Qaida, the ultimate extreme group. If you \nbelieve giving these groups Iraq makes us safer, you know nothing about \nhuman behavior or history as a whole.\n  This is not Vietnam, I say to my colleagues. This is the 1930s all \nover again where we have world leaders trying to appease a tyrant--give \nhim Czechoslovakia, give him one more country, him being Hitler. Did \nthat satisfy his appetite? The moral of the story is that when we let \ntyranny go unchecked, when we give into the dark forces of humanity, \nwhen we allow people who slaughter the innocent to win wars, we don't \nend their desire, we whet their appetite.\n  We have not lost this war. We will never lose this war as long as we \nhave the will to win. If we have half the political courage as those \nwho reenlist and go back three and four times, or the physical courage, \nthere is nothing we can't accomplish in Iraq.\n  Some people worry about their next election, and they are trying to \nget right with the polls. My focus is on those who reenlist time and \nagain and who are literally sacrificing everything they have to offer \nto their family and to their country.\n  So when we mention the death of someone wearing the uniform in the \nservice of our Nation as a reason to withdraw from a war we cannot \nafford to lose, shame on this body. This bill will be vetoed. This new \ngeneral, General Petraeus, is committed to winning, has a plan to win, \nand the question is, Are we going to undercut him?\n  If you passed the legislation and this legislation went to the \nPresident's desk and he did not veto it, then you would be cutting the \nlegs out from under General Petraeus. You would be making everything \nthat he is doing impossible to accomplish because you would change the \ndynamics on the ground so he would have no chance. And, yes, it is \nworking. Violence is part of the 21st century. Israel lives with this \nevery day. They don't let suicide bombers define the fate of Israel.\n  Are we going to let suicide bombers define the foreign policy of the \nUnited States? If we give them Iraq, you better double the size of the \nmilitary because we are going to go back with a bigger war, not a \nsmaller war. So I hope once the President vetoes it, we will understand \nthat this new general with a new strategy is our best chance for \nsuccess--with no guarantee because we have made so many mistakes in the \npast.\n  The biggest mistake was not having enough people to secure the \ncountry. If we want political reconciliation, which we know we have to \nachieve to win in Iraq, how can we have it without security? Why don't \nwe have security? We let the country get out of control. We didn't have \nenough troops on the ground or enough capacity to train and fight.\n  We are doubling the size of the combat capability in Baghdad, and it \nis working. Mr. President, 16 of the 21 sheiks in Anbar Province have \nrejected al-Qaida and aligned with us. Six months ago, Al Anbar \nProvince, where the Sunnis live, I would have written off. But now it \nis the greatest success story of the new strategy. We are still losing \npeople in Anbar, but we are fighting along with the sheiks to combat \nal-Qaida because they have seen what al-Qaida holds for them and they \nhave said, no, they don't want to live under the al-Qaida banner. They \nhave tasted it and it doesn't taste well. They are coming our way.\n  Four thousand marines in Anbar province are making a huge difference. \nThe sheiks, the tribal leaders, called for the young people of Anbar \nProvince to join the police--before, we could not get anybody to join \nthe Iraqi police--and they came in such large numbers that hundreds \nwere turned away because we could not process them. Diyala is a result \nof success in Baghdad. Al-Sadr left Sadr City because we are in there \nnow and are going to places we have never gone before. The mayor of \nSadr City aligned with us, and they tried to kill him. He is in the \nhospital clinging to life. He tasted what the Shia extremists had for \nhis people, the Shia, and he said no.\n  The only people I know of right now who seem to believe walking away \nfrom the fight in Iraq doesn't have severe consequences for the world \nare the ones in this body. I cannot envision a failed state in Iraq \nleading to a more secure United States. I cannot envision walking away \nfrom Iraq, declaring the war lost, not empowering al-Qaida beyond any \nother single event that we have engaged in since 9/11. The consequences \nof destroying General Petraeus's chance to be successful are enormous \nfor the national security interests of this country.\n  Declaring a war lost by the Senate majority leader is unprecedented, \nill-advised, and it is something we need to quickly correct because if \nwe have lost, the people who will claim victory are our worst \nnightmare. We will be sending young men and women back to the Middle \nEast to fight extremism in other countries as far as the eye can see or \nwe can give this new general a chance to be successful, give him the \ntime, the money, and the resources he needs to be successful, honor \neach death as a noble sacrifice for the cause of our freedom--for our \nown freedom, for the alignment of moderation against extremism--or we \ncan let the car bomber and the suicide bomber drive us out of Iraq. We \ncan let them dictate our foreign policy.\n  If we do that, we can come back home thinking we are safe, but we \nwill have unleashed Pandora's box. The Gulf States are next if we lose \nin Iraq, and then eventually Israel. The consequences to our national \nsecurity interests could not be greater.\n  Americans understood what it was like to live without freedom 200 \nyears ago. That is why they died for it. There are people in the \nMideast getting a taste of it. Let's side with those who believe in \nfreedom against those who want to take us to the dark ages.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester).

Mr. President, I rise today not to speak about the Iraq \nwar or the supplemental, which has been the focus of this morning's \ndebate. I will return to the floor later to speak on both of those \nsubjects. I wanted to take a minute this morning, while we had some \ntime, to speak about a bill I intend to introduce later this week with \nmy cochair, the ranking member of our new Subcommittee on Disaster \nRecovery, Senator Ted Stevens from Alaska, and other members of my \nsubcommittee, Senators Carper and Pryor, as we begin to lay down pieces \nof legislation that are apparent and necessary to improve the general \ndisaster response for this country, which has been found to be severely \nlacking.\n  The bill I will introduce later today is called the First Response \nBroadcasters Act. It is a piece of legislation, as I said, I will be \nfiling with other members of my subcommittee.\n  As my State continues to rebuild out of the rubble and destruction \nand devastation of the first and third worst natural disasters to hit \nthe country, and the subsequent levee breaks that filled up a major \nAmerican city within 24 hours and continues to wreak havoc on those \nstruggling to get home and rebuild their lives, we learned one of the \nmost vital lessons was that information--good information, accurate \ninformation--was not only vital, but it was essential as the first \nbuilding block to our recovery. In providing it, all of our local \nmedia--broadcasters, Web sites and newspapers--did an amazing job to \nkeep the people of Louisiana and our region and the gulf coast \ninformed. Frankly, they also kept informed the Nation and world \ncommunity that was aghast at what was happening in south Louisiana and \nthe New Orleans region from Katrina, and in the Southwest region from \nRita 4 weeks later.\n\n  With phone lines down, cell phones out, and streets too flooded to \nmove around to get any kind of perspective about what was actually \nhappening, and where the 4 to 20 feet of water was coming from, when we \nhad never seen anything like that in the history of our city, the sound \nof local radio and television stations was what hundreds of thousands \nof my constituents relied on. It was the only voice for them in the \nfirst darkest days and nights, and it continued for weeks and months. \nActually, Mr. President, it continues to this day. And because of the \ncredibility of our local broadcasters at a time when the public needed \nthem, they were there. Our local broadcasters provided lifesaving \ninformation.\n  As you will recall, we have lost over 1,000 lives in Louisiana and \nover 200 lives in Mississippi. But many lives, I am convinced, were \nsaved because broadcasters, having lost their own stations, their own \nequipment, their own homes, and with their own loved ones missing, \nstayed on the job. More importantly, they stayed on the air so the \nreporters could report what was happening, and even those of us in \npowerful positions could get a better handle on the situation.\n  As local radio and television stations stand up, as so many did, and \nput commercial interests aside to serve the public interest, the \nFederal Government, in my opinion, should be ready to stand up with \nthem. That is what this bill is about. It is not a long or complicated \nbill. It really doesn't cost very much money. But it will have a major \nimpact as this Nation tries to fashion better responses for our \ncountry. We are in desperate need of new tools, new tool boxes, and \nthis is one of them.\n  In fact, for more than 50 years, we have required local broadcasters \nto be at the front line of sounding the alarm in a disaster. With the \nentire industry dependent upon public airwaves, broadcasters have a \nduty to serve the public in times of crisis. That is what so many of \nthem did.\n  This is why stations today are required by law to be part of the \nemergency alert system. At the system's core are 34 primary entry \npoints, radio stations with direct lines from emergency command centers \nin Washington and in their State. But half of our States don't even \nhave these entry points. To receive an alert in Mississippi, for \nexample, you needed to rely on the message being passed on from station \nto station from an entry point in Louisiana.\n  One of the several things this bill does is add primary entry points \nto every underserved State and region to make sure every State has an \nequal chance to be well prepared when disaster strikes and to try to \nput their best assets forward. I have said many times that all the \nassets in the world, all the plans in the world are not worth the paper \nthey are written on, or the text found on Internet Web sites, if you \ncannot communicate them at the appropriate time to the appropriate \npeople in the appropriate order.\n  What good is a successful emergency information chain if the last \nlink fails? By technical necessity, this last link is right in the \ndisaster's path. Simply put, a transmitter needs to be in the same area \nas the people in need of a warning.\n  Despite our Federal investment in emergency systems and entry point \nstations, there were several gulf coast broadcasters after the \nhurricanes who could not stay on the air simply because the Government, \nour Government, took their fuel away. Let me repeat this. The stations \nstruggling to stay on the air, to tell first responders and others what \nwas actually happening, to try to get their signals up, their \nelectricity up, so when people in Washington kept asking what is going \non, we could give some answers, the fuel was confiscated because some \nlow-level FEMA person decided they had higher priorities.\n  When this bill is passed, local broadcasters will be on the list as \nfirst responders, and their food, water, and fuel will not be allowed \nto be taken away, so that the public can get the information they are \ndesperate for in as independent and accurate way as possible.\n  It also creates a matching grant program. It also helps to bring \nbroadcast engineers back into the disaster zone more quickly to restore \ntransmitters and other key facilities.\n  No disaster warning evacuation plan or emergency instruction matters \nif it cannot get to the people who need to hear it. That is basically \nwhy this bill is so important.\n  Finally, the bill is very important for the journalists, who depend \non all of this equipment, technology and access to do their job, which \nis to report the story in as accurate a fashion as they can to the \npublic that needs to respond, as well as the first responders \nthemselves, and to Government leaders.\n  For journalists working to tell the story, newspapers and Web sites \nincluded, the bill makes sure that the local officials who know the \nlocal reporters best decide where the journalists can go, who can go \nand how long they can stay.\n  Again, there will be no longer a contract, part-time FEMA official \ndirecting the news media or the broadcasters. The law will govern their \nbasic rights, put them on the right list, make it clear they themselves \nare first responders and, in this Senator's view, extremely important \nfirst responders.\n  I am extremely pleased to have Senator Stevens join me. This is a \nbipartisan bill. It is not complicated, it is rather simple, but \ncritical as we begin to stand up a better disaster response this \ncountry is certainly most worthy of. The people of Louisiana, \nMississippi, Texas, Florida, and other parts of the country are still \nsuffering from disasters that in split seconds, in minutes, sometimes \nin a few hours, dash the hopes and dreams of millions of Americans.\n  We cannot prevent tornadoes. We most certainly cannot prevent \nhurricanes. We cannot prevent earthquakes. We can do a better job of \npredicting them. But the most important thing we can do is to warn \npeople and help people deal with these terrible tragedies that come \ntheir way.\n  In this Senator's view, we have a lot of work to do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5019-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 761, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 761) to invest in innovation and education to \n     improve the competitiveness of the United States in the \n     global economy.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Bingaman (for Sununu) amendment No. 938, to strike the \n     provisions regarding strengthening the education and human \n     resources directorate of the National Science Foundation.\n       Bingaman (for Sanders) amendment No. 936, to increase the \n     competitiveness of American workers through the expansion of \n     employee ownership.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 938\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes of debate with respect to amendment No. 938, with the time \nequally divided and controlled by the Senator from New Hampshire and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts or their designees.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I understand under the order that I will \ncontrol 15 minutes, and I believe Senator Bingaman will control 15 \nminutes in opposition.\n  This morning we have 30 minutes of debate on an amendment I offered \nyesterday afternoon. This amendment deals directly with the National \nScience Foundation, which I think many Members of Congress believe is \nthe crown jewel for Federal initiatives, investment, and funding of \nbasic scientific research--research in chemistry, mathematics, physics, \nmaterial science--that provides benefits that are spread over countless \nareas of our economy, provides benefits over very long time horizons. \nThis is basic research the markets don't invest in, venture capital \nfirms don't look at. It is fundamental science carried out at the best \nlaboratories and universities across America.\n  I worked at one time in my career as an engineer. I studied to be a \nmechanical engineer. I worked as an electrical engineer. I have a \nlittle bit of an understanding of some of the scientific principles \nthese laboratories, scientists, and graduate students work on every \nsingle day. I certainly have enough appreciation for these concepts to \nrecognize that no Member of Congress should be telling the professional \nleadership, the academic leadership at the National Science Foundation, \nwhich program should be funded on any given day, month, or year. That \nis why the National Science Foundation has a competitive process, a \npeer review process where ideas are submitted and approved by panels of \nexperts in each of these areas.\n  As I say, it is competitive, it is free from politics, free from \nearmarks, the pet projects and pet policies of legislators, whether \nthey are Democratic or Republican. They are insulated from those \nthings, and that is why it has been so successful.\n  Unfortunately, in the underlying bill before us, there is for the \nfirst time ever a provision to set aside some of that money for a \nspecific area of interest. It may be an interesting area and a very \nvaluable area--the area of human resources and education--but never \nbefore have we set aside in legislation funding in this way: over $1 \nbillion of the approximately $6.5 billion the National Science \nFoundation has to spend each year being set aside for this purpose. For \nthe first time, it guarantees a specific authorization. For the first \ntime, the legislation would guarantee a specific increase for this \nparticular area in outyears. For the first time, and maybe even what I \nthink is most fundamentally wrong, it says that because of these \nprotections, this is a more important area. We don't provide this \nprotection to chemistry or physics or computational mathematics. They \ndo not get a designated allocation in this bill. They do not get a \nspecific increase in funding year on year in this bill. But we give it \nto the area of human resources.\n\n  As I said, that is a worthwhile area for investment, the side of \neducation, it can certainly make a difference, but when we start \nsetting it ahead of, on top of, and at a higher priority than the \nphysics, chemistry, computational mathematics, for which the National \nScience Foundation is not just designed but for which it is world \nrenowned, we are making a huge mistake. We make a mistake not just \nbecause it is wrong to set it ahead of these other programs but it is a \nmistake because it sets us on the wrong path, because the next time we \ndo legislation such as this, someone else is going to want to set aside \nfunds for another initiative and someone else is going to want to \nguarantee an increase for another area of programming. Over time, we \nwill undermine, weaken, and perhaps even destroy the integrity of the \ncompetition and peer review process that is at the heart of the \nNational Science Foundation.\n  Those who will oppose this amendment will say this is about human \nresources and education and we care about those things. Well, I care \nabout those things also, but it is still wrong to carve up the National \nScience Foundation funding in this way. Moreover, if we care about the \neducation initiatives for science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics, we should be looking at the report of the Competitiveness \nCouncil that categorized over 106 different science, technology, \neducation, and math programs in 8 or 10 different agencies, and 34 of \nthem are within the National Science Foundation, but a dozen are within \nthe Department of Agriculture, 13 in the Department of Commerce, 9 in \nthe Department of Education, 9 in the Department of Defense, 6 in the \nDepartment of Transportation, and so on.\n  Where in this bill did we look at these 106 programs to make them \nwork better? Where in this legislation did we review which of these \nprograms is most effective and most focused on encouraging students to \npursue careers in science, technology, and mathematics? Rather than do \nthat, the authors of this particular provision, section 4002, say, \nwell, the National Science Foundation does work in these areas, so \nlet's make sure they are guaranteed $1 billion a year and guaranteed \nincreases over time.\n  I think that is the wrong approach to take. It is the wrong approach \nto take for the National Science Foundation. The scientists who are \nsupported by that foundation have visited me in my office--I am sure \nthey have visited with many other Members of Congress--and time and \ntime again they have said, protect the peer review process, protect the \ninvestment in basic science and mathematics. That is what I intend to \ndo as a Senator, and that is why I have offered this amendment to \nstrike that provision that sets aside funds, that guarantees an \nincrease, because it is not the right way to deal with the National \nScience Foundation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, obviously, I have great respect for my \ncolleague from New Hampshire, and particularly because he is, I \nbelieve, the only trained engineer in the Senate, I certainly pay \nattention when he speaks on issues related to engineering and science, \nand I think we all need to do that. But I think he is clearly wrong in \nthis circumstance, and let me explain why.\n  The Senator is offering an amendment to strike the provisions of this \nbill that provide for annual funding increases for education and human \nresource programs at the National Science Foundation. The purpose of \nthe provision that is in the bill he wants to strike is to ensure the \ncontinued involvement of experts at the National Science Foundation in \nimproving science, technology, engineering, and math education at the \nelementary, secondary, and the postsecondary level.\n  This underlying bill, S. 761, provides for substantial increases in \nfunding for the National Science Foundation, and the amount of those \nincreases is contained in section 401. You can see for the next 4 years \nthere are substantial increases. I would reiterate, as we have many \ntimes in this debate, these are authorizing levels. This is not actual \nappropriation of money. That is the heavy lifting which we are going to \nhave to do later on this year. This authorizes, however, significant \nincreases in funding for the National Science Foundation.\n  As appropriations for the National Science Foundation increase under \nthis legislation, under S. 761, funds for the education and human \nresources programs will also increase by a proportional amount. We are \nnot in any way\n\n[[Page S5021]]\n\ndiverting funds from basic research or other activities of the National \nScience Foundation, and we are not specifying that they do things they \nhave not traditionally done. The National Science Foundation has a very \nimpressive record of accomplishment in education at all levels with \nregard to science, engineering, and mathematics.\n  The National Science Foundation is the engine of innovation for K-12 \nscience, technology, engineering, and math education. Strengthening \nscience and math education is a core mission of the National Science \nFoundation. This is not a sideline, this is a core mission. When the \nagency was founded, Congress recognized the importance of involving \nscientists in the critical questions relating to science education, and \nthey made science education a key part of the agenda of that agency. \nThe National Science Foundation programs range from graduate \nfellowships to programs for secondary school teachers, to informal \nmuseum programs. They are designed to attract students to science, \nengineering, technology, and mathematics. They are designed to give \nthem the preparation and the fundamental knowledge they need to pursue \nundergraduate and graduate degrees, and they are designed to support \nthe completion of those degrees.\n  The EHR, which is the education and human resources directorate \nwithin the National Science Foundation, also pursues ways for advancing \nparticipation and equity in access for all who are interested in \npursuing careers in these fields. As a research and development \ninstitution, the National Science Foundation is uniquely situated to \nbring insights to science and math education, and that is the reason \nwhy we gave them that job.\n  The National Science Foundation education programs are a catalyst for \nchange in education, and they have been demonstrated to do that. Let me \ngive one example of a successful program, which is NSF's math and \nscience partnership program. An analysis of 123 schools that \nparticipated in that program shows improvements in student proficiency \nin math and science at the elementary, the middle, and high school \nlevels over a 3-year period. This year, the National Science \nFoundation's budget includes $30 million for these MSP, or math and \nscience partnership, awards.\n  A recent report by the Academic Competitiveness Council found that of \nthe 10 math and science education programs at various Federal agencies \nthey evaluated, all 4 of the programs they found to be effective were \nbeing run out of the National Science Foundation. So the authorization \nlevel for education and human resources in this bill reflects what the \nPresident asked for in fiscal 2008, plus an adjustment of $300 million \nto allow for the new programs authorized in the bill.\n  Let me directly respond to the main points I understood my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire to be making. He started by saying no Member of \nCongress should be telling NSF how to spend their money, basically. We \ndo that every time we pass an appropriations bill. We tell NSF how to \nspend their money. We also do it whenever we pass an authorization \nbill. The last time we passed the NSF reauthorization, which I think \nwas 2003, we specified there precisely how much would go into education \nversus into other types of activities. So this is not in any way a \nchange.\n  I think everyone in Congress knows the one thing we are good at is \nmicromanaging. We do not give tens of billions of dollars to any agency \nand say do what you want. We tell them we want this much spent on \nresearch and development, and we want this much spent on education.\n  The one other point my colleague from New Hampshire made is we should \nnot get into interfering with the peer review system, which is designed \nto ensure the best activities are chosen. We anticipated that problem \nand agree entirely with him. Section 4007 of this legislation, on page \n183, is entitled ``Reaffirmation of the Merit-Review Process of the \nNational Science Foundation,'' and it says:\n\n       Nothing in this division or division A, or the amendments \n     made by this division or division A, shall be interpreted to \n     require or recommend that the National Science Foundation (1) \n     alter or modify its merit-review system or peer-review \n     process; or, (2) exclude the awarding of any proposal by \n     means of the merit-review or peer-review process.\n\n  So there is nothing in the section the Senator would have us strike \nthat in any way undermines the peer review system. That is certainly \nsomething I would not support doing.\n  I believe very strongly this is not a good amendment; that deleting \nsection 4002, which is what the Senator's amendment would do, would be \na substantial mistake, and I urge my colleagues to resist the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minutes remaining in opposition.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if you would let me know when 3 minutes \nremain.\n  I am trying to respect Senator Sununu's amendment, because he is a \nvery careful student of these matters, and I am looking at the \nauthorization bill, and I want to ask the Senator a few questions in a \nmoment, if I may, and I will do it on my time.\n  I am looking at the authorization bills for fiscal years 2003, 2004, \nand 2005, which is the current authorization bill. In each of those \nyears--the authorization bill--there is a number for specific \nauthorized allocations for, first, research; next, for education and \nhuman resources, which is the area the Senator is objecting to; next, a \nspecific authorized allocation for research equipment; next, for \nsalaries; and next, for the Office of Inspector General. Then we go to \n2004 and it is the same there. In each year, there is a specific \nauthorized allocation for each area; one for research, one for \neducation, and one for each of the others.\n  The difference in this proposed authorization is that for education \nit says the number. The allocation for education shall go up as much as \nthe specific authorization for research. Would the Senator be more \ncomfortable--and this is my question, through the Chair, if I may ask \nthis--would the Senator be more comfortable if there were specific \nnumber allocations which are enacted now for future years? In other \nwords, if we turn the percentages or the suggestion that it ought to go \nup the same amount and say, instead of that, we will take a number and \ninsert it in there for each of those years? Because that is exactly the \nway it is done in the current bill.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I am happy to respond. First, I would \ncertainly be more comfortable if the guaranteed increases were struck \nfrom the bill, because that is a protection, a consideration for this \narea of funding that isn't given to other areas of funding. I would \nhave concern about that allocation in past years, again because it puts \nthis particular area in effect ahead of the different disciplines of \nchemistry, math, or physics. It treats it somewhat uniquely.\n  To the response on the point about appropriations, Senator Bingaman \nis absolutely right. Each year we do an appropriations bill that is \nmuch more specific than this, where, ultimately, allocations are made \nin the specific areas of research, chemistry, or physics. That is \nbased, however, on a request by the National Science Foundation itself \nin front of that Appropriations Committee. It is based on an exchange \nfor that given year.\n  I would agree with you, the peer review process needs to be \nprotected. We shouldn't be specifying in authorizing language--even if \nyou make the point it is not meaningful because it is only an \nauthorization--we shouldn't be specifying how much money we are going \nto allocate to superconducting materials in 2008 or how much funding we \nare going to authorize for plasma physics in 2009.\n  We should be much more responsive than that, not prejudge what the \nneeds of the National Science Foundation are going to be in the \noutyears.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I will take 30 seconds, if I may. I \nthink I am reading this differently than is the Senator. I am reading \nthe authorization language for the year 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006--the \nexisting law, there are specific authorization allocations for each \nyear, not just for education but for research and for research \nequipment and for salaries and expenses. It goes up each year in the \nauthorization language that exists today. So we are reading a different \nbill. I will be happy, if I am a part of any conference discussion, if \nit would help with his concerns,\n\n[[Page S5022]]\n\nto translate the ``as much as'' into specific numbers, if other \nSenators agree with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, let me use a portion of my time to address \na particular point; that is, equipment. I fully recognize that \nequipment is different from funding for specific research. Capital \nequipment, infrastructure, buildings--those are going to receive \nseparate allocations year on year, and they are going to receive \nseparate authorization numbers. But I come back to this issue of \nwhether we are going to treat the human resources area differently by \nprotecting annual increases and whether we are going to ensure that in \nthe future we maximize the resources available to the National Science \nFoundation for its core mission of research, of investment in math, \nscience, and engineering research projects. I understand the education \nrole. I understand that is part of the mission of the National Science \nFoundation, and I support that effort. But I think we need to be very \ncareful before creating long-term setasides for an area such as this.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time remains for the Senator from New \nHampshire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A little over 7 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me use the remaining 2 minutes in opposition to the \nSenator from New Hampshire, and then the Senator can obviously use as \nmuch time as he would like.\n  Let me just reiterate that I think this section which he is proposing \nthat we strike is an important section to retain in the legislation. \nThis is something which is a direct outgrowth of what the Augustine \nCommission recommended. They recommended that we increase funding for \nthe National Science Foundation and that we ensure that the National \nScience Foundation substantially increase its efforts with regard to \nscience education. That is what this provision does. That is what this \nsection of the bill does. It says we want to increase authorization for \nthe National Science Foundation, and as we are doing that, we want to \nbe sure there is adequate funding, there is adequate attention given to \nscience education.\n  I believe, if there were a single thing which the National Academy of \nSciences report concluded, it is that we are investing way too little \nas a country in science and engineering and math education across-the-\nboard--in the Department of Education, in the Department of Energy, in \nthe National Science Foundation, in our schools, elementary and \nsecondary and postsecondary and universities.\n  This is an important provision. We should keep this in the bill. I \nknow it is very important to Senator Kennedy. He was very involved in \nthe discussions that went into the drafting of this portion of the \nbill. As a member of his committee, I strongly object to us deleting \nthis section of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the distinguished Senator will yield?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 4 minutes to the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will ask that it be taken off the \nbill, not off his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That time has expired. Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Very briefly, I wish to say to the Senator that he has \nmade an eloquent presentation and he has certainly shown people that he \nunderstands what the National Science Foundation is supposed to do and \nwhat it does. But there is no question that it does two things at least \nand, in most cases, more. It does research, but it also does education. \nThat is enumerated in the year we are in and enumerated in the \noutyears. That, along with other activities, including research that \nthe Senator is worried about, is enumerated and protected by an actual \nappropriation; that is, the thing that worries him is the one that \nshould worry all of us, and that is the adequacy and assurance of \nresearch and that it will not be gobbled up or picked at as time \nchanges.\n  It seems to me we did it right here because we earmarked, in a sense, \nall the different areas and put the two worrying him the most--both of \nthese are there. Both research and education are there. It seems to me \nthat is what we want to do. I don't know how you could do it any other \nway and we be able to tell the Senators who helped us put this together \nthat they are protected for science research and for education. That is \nreally what we are trying to do because they worked hard on it. They \nthought this was an area of importance. We agreed with them. It turns \nout, as Senator Bingaman said just two moments ago, it is true, this \nbill is beginning to sound right because it is saying we were really \nhurting on basic science, and this is an area, the National Science \nFoundation, an instrumentation of our Government, which has been doing \nvery well and we want to give them a lot of extra money if we want to \ndo this, a bill like this, for our country.\n  I thank the Senator for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, in closing, let me thank the Senator from \nNew Mexico for his points. I certainly appreciate the commitment I have \nheard from everyone who has spoken this morning about the value of the \npeer-review process, the commitment to this critical role of research, \nbasic research within the National Science Foundation, the desire to \nmake sure we are not giving special treatment, unique treatment to any \nparticular area within the National Science Foundation, notwithstanding \nthe fact that in this legislation, there are guaranteed proportional \nincreases for human resources in the educational area. Of course, I \nhave to take every Senator at their word, but I very much appreciate \nthe word and commitment given here to continue to champion and protect \nthe integrity of the peer-review process moving forward.\n  Second, I reiterate that there is very little done that I can see in \nthe legislation to look at the existing science, technology, education, \nand math programs within our Government. There is support for those \nprograms and even creation of some new programs in this legislation, \nbut very little is done to follow up on findings we have in front of us \nabout weaknesses and duplication and overlap in these programs and the \nneed to make them work better for those math, science, and engineering \nstudents whom they are intended to benefit. I encourage my colleagues \nto continue to pursue these very questions as this bill moves off the \nfloor and into conference.\n  I understand there were a lot of sensitive issues and committee \njurisdictions and tradeoffs that had to be made in constructing the \nlegislation. I understand the managers of the bill are not going to \nsupport my amendment. But I think the message this amendment carries is \nan extremely important one. I hope it will be heeded, not just in \ndeliberations over the coming year when we are dealing with math and \nscience and the National Science Foundation, to protect what makes it \nwork, but also as this legislation moves to conference.\n  I yield any time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

We are anxious to \ntry to complete this bill before this briefing which is scheduled with \nGeneral Petraeus at 4 o'clock this afternoon, if we possibly can. So we \nwould be very appreciative if Members would come to the floor with any \namendments they have and offer those amendments and take a short time \nto explain them. For any of them it appears we can accept, we are glad \nto try to accept them. Some we will not be able to accept. But we are \nanxious to get any additional amendments any Senator wishes to have \nconsidered brought to the Senate floor as soon as possible.\n  I believe both Senator Domenici and Senator Alexander want to say a \nword, and then I believe Senator Sanders wishes to speak to his \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just want to second that motion as to \nwhat Senator Bingaman just said and ask Senators on my side of the \naisle to take a look, as soon as you can, with your staffs at this bill \nand tell us whether you have amendments. If we are going to finish at a \ntime certain, we do not want everybody to come down at 4 o'clock and \ncomplain. We have a lot of time, but it will be useless if Senators do \nnot bring their amendments down. We know there are some floating \naround, but we certainly do not have an adequate understanding of how \nmany Senators have. It would be helpful if Senators would send us a \nmessage that they have amendments and what they amount to. We will work \nwith Senators so we can get them done quickly.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 936 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I intended to have considered an \namendment I have offered, which is a very important amendment, which \nwould provide assistance from the Department of Commerce to workers, to \nemployees who want to move forward in terms of ESOPs, employee stock \nownership plans.\n  At a time when we are losing millions of good-paying blue-collar \nmanufacturing jobs, white-collar information technology jobs, it seems \nto me that the ESOP concept, the worker-ownership concept, is, in fact, \nan important model the U.S. Government should be exploring in terms of \nhow we help those workers purchase their own companies and keep jobs in \nthe United States of America.\n  I understand there is a problem with jurisdiction. The chairman and \nranking member of the Banking Committee would like to work with me on \nthis issue. I think we would like to go forward in terms of holding \nhearings and then coming forward with some legislation, which seems to \nme to be a sensible idea.\n  What I would like to do is, if I could, yield to the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, Mr. Dodd, and then maybe to Ranking Member Shelby.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. I thank \nmy colleague for his consideration.\n  For those of us who remember the days of Russell Long talking about \nthe employee stock option plans, we all were lectured considerably \nduring our tenure here with Russell Long, who was a strong advocate of \nthe idea of employees being able to have an invested ownership in \ncompanies.\n  I applaud my colleague from Vermont for this idea. It is one that \ncertainly deserves consideration. I have told my colleague from Vermont \nI will be happy to either conduct the hearing myself or have an \nappropriate subcommittee conduct it, and be involved with it, as well \nas the Banking Committee to look at this.\n  The jurisdiction may also be in the Finance Committee. I know Senator \nBaucus has an interest in this issue as well, so I want to be careful \nabout stepping on the toes of another committee that may have some \npiece of this as well as the Banking Committee. But it is an economic \ndevelopment issue, and I am sure, between Senator Baucus and myself, we \ncan conduct a hearing that will complement both committees' \njurisdictions.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, if my friend will yield briefly, Senator \nBaucus is a cosponsor of this legislation, along with Senator Leahy and \nSenator Lincoln.\n  Mr. President, I yield back to the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his observation. I \nsee my friend from Alabama is in the Chamber, the former chairman of \nthe committee, my ranking member, who cares about this issue as well. I \nknow of his interest in the subject matter.\n  So we will move forward on this issue in a timely fashion to see if \nwe can have a good hearing and develop further interest in this idea, \nwhich I think has great merit. I thank the Senator for raising it.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  As Senator Dodd said, we are all interested in promoting the economic \ninterests of our workers. The ESOP program, employee stock ownership \nprogram, has helped a lot of workers create wealth, save jobs, and save \ncompanies in this country.\n  I know this is probably a subject matter for a number of committees, \nbut Chairman Dodd said he would hold a hearing on this in the Banking \nCommittee. I join with him in working on this issue. If this or some \nother legislation like this will help people own companies where they \nwork, I think that is good for America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I very much thank my friend from Alabama \nand my friend from Connecticut. We look forward to working with you.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on \nWednesday, today, April 25, at 2 o'clock, the Senate proceed to debate \nconcurrently three Coburn amendments, Nos. 918, 921, and 922; that \nthere be a total of 60 minutes of debate, divided as follows: 40 \nminutes under the control of Senator Coburn and 20 minutes under the \ncontrol of myself or my designee; that upon the use or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to each amendment in the \norder listed in this agreement; that there be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided as specified above prior to the second and third votes; \nthat no amendments be in order to any of the amendments covered\n\n[[Page S5024]]\n\nunder this agreement prior to the vote; and that the second and third \nvotes in the series be 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am glad to accommodate the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. He asked if I would restate the unanimous consent \nrequest. I am glad to do that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday, April 25, \nat 2 p.m., the Senate proceed to debate concurrently three Coburn \namendments, Nos. 918, 921, and 922; that there be a total of 60 minutes \nof debate, divided as follows: 40 minutes under the control of Senator \nCoburn and 20 minutes under the control of Senator Bingaman or his \ndesignee; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to each amendment in the order listed in \nthis agreement; that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided as \nspecified above prior to the second and third votes; that no amendments \nbe in order to any of the amendments covered under this agreement prior \nto the vote; and that the second and third votes in this series be 10 \nminutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in Ecclesiastes, the Preacher warns:\n\n       The race is not to the swift, or the battle to the strong, \n     nor does food come to the wise, or wealth to the brilliant, \n     or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them \n     all.\n\n  America is used to being the swiftest. We are used to being the \nstrongest. America has become used to winning the race. We have become \nused to receiving the cream of the world's wealth. But we would do well \nto heed the warning of Ecclesiastes, for time and chance will happen to \nus, as well.\n  New global competitors have entered the race. Over time, they are \ngrowing stronger and more learned. America cannot leave winning the \nrace to chance. We must redouble our speed. We must redouble our \nlearning if we are not to fall behind.\n  That is why I started in June of 2005 delivering a series of \naddresses on America's economic leadership. That is why, during the \nlast Congress and this one as well, I have introduced a series of bills \naddressing American competitiveness. Those bills dealt with education, \nwith energy, with trade, research, and savings. That is why much of the \nwork of the Finance Committee this Congress this year will address \nAmerica's economic competitiveness.\n  The Finance Committee will shortly mark up education tax incentives. \nWe will follow with tax incentives for cleaner and more renewable \nenergy. This year we intend to extend trade adjustment assistance, and \nwe hope to address small business health concerns as well. Each of \nthese bills will help American businesses remain the world's leaders.\n  The bill before us will help, and it will help a lot. The bill before \nus will promote excellence in education, technology, and science. I \nhope to contribute a series of amendments to this bill. Each, I \nbelieve, will bolster America's economic competitiveness.\n  A noted MIT scholar once commented that:\n\n       The ability to learn faster than your competitors may be \n     the only sustainable competitive advantage.\n\n  Having an educated workforce able to learn and adapt is a cornerstone \nof a competitive agenda.\n  My first amendment thus encourages States to incorporate 21st century \nlearning skills into their curriculum. This amendment would help our \nschool systems teach skills to America's students that will best \nprepare them for tomorrow's economy.\n  America faces a world more integrated, more interdependent, and more \ncompetitive than ever. It is our challenge to succeed in this \nenvironment. It is our challenge to leave our children and \ngrandchildren with an economy that is better than the one which we \ninherited. We must meet this challenge.\n  Meeting this challenge starts with addressing education in a new way. \nThis bill is just a beginning.\n  We must change the way we look at education. As policymakers, we tend \nto look at our education challenge like a multiple choice test. We want \nto choose between a few simple options--more science and math classes, \nmore AP classes, or better teachers. But the answers are not as simple \nas ``A,'' ``B,'' or ``C.''\n  We must look at our challenge as if it were a math proof. We must \nthink through every step, to reach the end result. The process is as \nimportant as the outcome. The outcome must be appropriate for today's \nneeds, but the outcome must also be appropriate for the needs of the \nfuture.\n  One hundred years from now--even 10 years from now--our society will \nbe very different from what we see today.\n  If we find the right solution, our students will excel in school. If \nwe find the right solution, our graduates will be ready to enter the \nworkforce. If we find the right solution, America will retain its \neconomic leadership. But if we look only for simple options, we may \nnever reach a solution.\n  My first amendment will assist in the process of developing these \nsolutions. My amendment will encourage school systems to think first \nand plan early. My amendment will encourage States to look at the big \npicture. My amendment will encourage States to look at education \ncomprehensively.\n  My amendment encourages States to incorporate 21st century learning \nskills into the States' education plan.\n  Twenty-first century learning skills emphasize learning skills, \ncollaboration, and communication skills.\n  Our students must know science and math, but more importantly, our \nstudents must excel in problem-solving and critical thinking skills. \nOur students must excel in financial, economic, and business literacy. \nIt is these skills that students today will need to be successful \ntomorrow.\n  Our students must also be able to communicate effectively. Twenty-\nfirst century skills also include language learning.\n  This bill sets aside funding for foreign language programs, but in \nmany rural areas like Montana there are not enough teachers. The way to \nhelp solve this problem is through distance learning.\n  That is why I also worked hard to include in the bill a provision to \nallow language funds to go to programs that use distance learning.\n  I am proud of programs such as the U.S. Arabic Distance Learning \nNetwork out of Montana State University. This program uses interactive \nvideo classrooms to allow two-way communication between the professor \nand students. This innovative solution is helping students to acquire \nimportant language skills.\n  We must look for more ways to be creative in our education methods. \nOur schools must adapt to new challenges. Our students must begin to \nlearn the skills that companies need today, and students must learn the \nskills that companies anticipate needing tomorrow.\n  This bill is a piece of the process in solving the proof. I will \ncontinue working on this issue and I encourage my colleagues to do so \nas well.\n  Many of the proposals in these amendments and this legislation are \ngood solutions for serious problems, but addressing our problems is not \nenough. We must also improve the way we identify them. We must improve \nour diagnosis.\n  Getting the right diagnosis is especially important to the most \ndynamic sector of our economy--the services sector. Our economy has \nevolved from agriculture and manufacturing to services. Services \nindustries today comprise 80 percent of our economy. Since 1990, \nprivate services industries have added over 22 million jobs. In our \ninternational trade picture, services are a bright spot. Where we so \noften see deficits, America has a surplus in services exports.\n  To keep this sector vigorous in a global market, we must track its \nhealth and development. But we don't.\n\n[[Page S5025]]\n\n  Today, the Bureau of Economic Analysis does not produce annual, \nState-by-State, sector-specific services export data. Tracking this \nkind of export data is critical to knowing where our strengths and our \nweakness lie. These data are critical to knowing where jobs are being \ncreated and how to build on those successes. These data are equally \ncritical to knowing where jobs are being lost, and to how we can best \nhelp those workers.\n  That is why I am offering an amendment to fund a program in the \nBureau of Economic Analysis to study services exports in detail, \nannually, thoroughly, on a State-by-State basis. We know too little \nabout this sector of our economy and its standing internationally. This \namendment would remedy that.\n  I also have amendments to improve America's energy research. My \namendment would double funding for the Department of Energy's Office of \nScience. That office is the largest supporter of physical sciences \nresearch in America. It would provide more than 40 percent of total \nfunding in this area nationwide. The Office oversees a broad range of \nenergy-related research, including that related to renewable energy.\n  For example, the Office of Science funds research and development \nprojects at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, or NREL. NREL is \nthe Nation's primary lab for renewable energy and energy efficiency \nR The Finance Committee has heard testimony from two NREL \nrepresentatives this year--Dr. Dan Arvizu, director of the lab, and Dr. \nRobert Farrington, manager of the lab's research on advanced vehicles.\n  Both of these individuals are very impressive. I believe strongly \nthat we must support their work.\n  Unfortunately, that support has been lacking in recent years. In \nJanuary, the New York Times outlined NREL's budget challenges. The \nTimes pointed out that:\n\n     Money flowing into the nation's primary laboratory for \n     developing renewable fuels is actually less than it was at \n     the beginning of the Bush administration.\n\n  The lab got a bit of a boost after that story was published in \nJanuary, but the administration's 2008 budget still plans a 3 percent \ncut for the lab.\n  We can fix that by doubling the Office of Science's budget over the \nnext 5 years. This injection of resources would provide badly needed \nfunding for NREL and the other national labs. The Office of Science \nwould receive $3.8 billion for 2007, a small increase over last year's \namount. My amendment would increase the Federal commitment to DOE's \nOffice of Science to $8 billion by 2011. That is double what the office \nreceives now, and that is more than a 50 percent increase over what is \ncalled for in the underlying bill.\n  This amendment is consistent with a recommendation of the National \nCommission on Energy Policy, a bipartisan group of 20 of the Nation's \nleading energy experts. Last week, the commission recommended doubling \nFederal spending on energy-technology R\n  But simply increasing funds for DOE's Office of Science is not \nenough. We also need to establish a new office of research outside DOE. \nMy amendment to establish ARPA-E would do just that.\n  I am very pleased that the underlying bill proposes an Advanced \nResearch Projects Authority--Energy, or ARPA-E.\n  The National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of \nEngineering, and the Institute of Medicine joined to form the Committee \non Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century. Norm Augustine \nchaired the committee. The committee recommended creating an ARPA-E: \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency--Energy.\n  The new agency would be modeled on DARPA--the Defense Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency--in the Department of Defense. Among the \nrevolutionary technologies that DARPA has developed are the Internet \nand stealth technology for aircraft.\n  The Augustine Committee recommended that ARPA-E be designed to \nconduct transformative, out-of-the-box energy research.\n  In the last Congress, and earlier this year, I introduced legislation \nto create an ARPA-E.\n  The bill before us today proposes a variation on my legislation by \ncreating an ``authority'' within the Department of Energy, instead of \nan agency.\n  My amendment would move the ``authority'' out of the DOE and \nestablish it as an agency, and my amendment would flesh out some of the \ndetails of the office.\n  My amendment proposes that ARPA-E be a small agency with a total of \n250 people. A minimum of 180 of them would be technical staff. A \ndirector of the agency and four deputies would lead ARPA-E. My \namendment proposes that ARPA-E be funded at $300 million in fiscal year \n2008, ramping up to $2.0 billion in 2012.\n  With gasoline again rising to $3 a gallon and increased concerns \nabout global warming, I believe we need to establish the most muscular \nARPA-E possible. That is why my amendment frees the agency from the \nbureaucratic restrictions of the DOD, and that is why my amendment \nwould elevate the status of the agency by establishing a direct \nreporting link to the President.\n  The underlying bill has taken a critical step forward by proposing an \nARPA-E. It is now up to the Senate and House to make this terrific idea \na reality to address the issues of energy security, energy supply, and \nglobal warming.\n  By advancing amendments like these, we can help to ensure America's \neconomic leadership.\n  Let us thereby help to ensure that America's business remains the \nswiftest. Let us ensure that our economy remains strong. Let us not \nleave our economic future to time and chance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I am a proud cosponsor of the \nimportant legislation we have been debating this week in order to help \nAmerica compete, to put America in a competitive place with the rest of \nthe world on technology and engineering. I know how important it is \nthat we make smart investments right now. In a previously adopted \namendment I cosponsored along with Senator DeMint, we have adopted an \namendment I proposed, along with Senator DeMint, which is important to \nthis legislation.\n  While I support this legislation, while I think it is very important \nwe invest in technology and invest in the future of our economy in a \nnew, global, technology-driven marketplace, I also am very concerned \nabout the way we spend Federal money. I am very concerned about \nprograms that are put in place that we don't check back on to make sure \nthey are working the way they should and that we are spending money the \nway we should. The amendment that has been adopted--and I want to thank \nthe managers of the bill for accepting the amendment--simply says this: \nIn 3 years, the GAO has to take a look. The GAO has to come in and do a \nstudy on how we have spent all of these billions of dollars we are \ngoing to set aside--precious dollars--precious Federal tax dollars \nthat, frankly, have so many needs right now, including bringing our \ndeficit under control.\n  I understand sometimes you have to invest money in order to make our \neconomy thrive, and I am all for that investment, but it needs to be a \nwise investment. The GAO needs to come in in 3 years and look at the \nway this money has been spent and tell the American people--and, most \nimportantly, my colleagues in the Senate and our colleagues in the \nHouse--that this money is being used the way we want it to be used: \nefficiently and, most importantly, effectively. That will give us an \nopportunity to take the temperature of these programs to make sure we \nare not throwing money down a rat hole, that we are not coming up with \na good idea and never having the discipline to follow up and make sure \nthe money is wisely spent.\n  So I appreciate the acceptance of this amendment. I think it is \nimportant. I think doing the kind of followup scrutiny of Government \nprograms is something that has been woefully lacking in Washington, DC, \nand I look forward to continuing to mandate GAO studies at intervals in \nprograms such as this to make sure the money is being spent\n\n[[Page S5026]]\n\nthe way the taxpayers would want it to be spent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Iraq Supplemental Appropriations bill\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the next day or two, the House and \nSenate will consider the Iraq supplemental appropriations bill. This is \nthe fifth year of our war in Iraq. This is the seventh time the \nPresident has come to Congress for an emergency supplemental bill.\n  In the ordinary course of events, a President and administration will \nsubmit to Congress an appropriation. We carefully review it, consider \namendments, vote on it, and send it back to the President for \nsignature.\n  The exceptions to the rule I just gave are for emergency situations, \nunanticipated situations, such as natural disasters, situations that \ncame upon us so quickly that we could not have anticipated them. But \nfor 5 straight years now this administration has insisted that this \nongoing war is an unanticipated expenditure. I wish that were true, but \nwe have known now for more than 4 years that this war is costly; first, \nin terms of human life, and, second, in terms of the Treasury of this \ncountry. Despite that, the President continues to send us emergency \nbills, unanticipated appropriations.\n  This time, almost $100 billion is to be added to the expenses of the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The total cost to date is somewhere in \nthe range of $500 billion. We have appropriated that money. We have \ngiven the President every penny he has asked for and more. Members of \nCongress and the Senate with serious misgivings about this policy in \nIraq have said to the President as Commander in Chief responsible for \nour men and women in uniform: We never want to shortchange them in \nbattle. We want them to be safe. We want them to come home safe.\n  I was one of 23 Senators who voted against this invasion of Iraq. I \nthought this was a serious mistake from the start, but I have never \nsaid no to the President's request for the funds for those troops. As I \nhave said often, and I will repeat now, if it were my son or daughter \nin uniform, I would want them to have everything they need to come \nhome. I may think this is the worst foreign policy decision in our \ntime, but it is not to be taken out on our troops. They shouldn't be \nthe bargaining chip in this important debate which is going on in \nWashington.\n  Now comes the President with another supplemental, about $100 billion \nthat he wants for the troops to have in the months to come. He will \nreceive that money. There is no doubt that he will receive it. The \nDemocratic majority in the House and Senate has already pledged to \nprovide all the money our troops need. But we cannot ignore the \nobvious. It is time for us to have a serious discussion in this country \nabout this war.\n  The day before yesterday, nine American lives were given up in Iraq. \nNine soldiers and marines lost their lives while many of us were in the \nsafety of our homes or at our workplace.\n  Whether it is on Sunday with the Stephanopoulos show or every day in \nthe Washington Post, I try to make a point of reading the names and \nages and hometowns of these soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen who \nare casualties. I do that because I don't want their loss to become a \nnumbing statistic. I want to try to visualize that 19-year-old soldier, \nthat 23-year-old sergeant, that corporal in the Marine Corps who was 20 \nyears old. I want to try to visualize them in terms of my family and \nthe people I love. I think every Member of Congress needs to do the \nsame thing--and I hope they do the same thing--to remember that it \nisn't just 3,320 lives, these are 3,320 sons and daughters and husbands \nand fathers, mothers and wives, loved ones. These are real people and \nreal lives.\n  So now we are in this debate about how this war is going to end. It \nis well overdue that we have this debate.\n  When we went into this war, we were told by the President that there \nwere reasons for doing it. I think most Americans recall it. I recall \nthe litany very well.\n  First, the administration told us that Saddam Hussein and Iraq had \nweapons of mass destruction which could be used--chemical and \nbiological weapons--in a terrorist mode to kill innocent people in the \nMiddle East and around the world.\n  Second, we were told they were developing nuclear weapons in Iraq, \nnuclear weapons that could destabilize the Middle East and even attack \nAmerica. The leaders in this administration were giving speeches about \nmushroom clouds from these nuclear weapons.\n  Then we were told that Saddam Hussein had some connection to the al-\nQaida terrorists who caused the 9/11 tragedy in America.\n  Then we were told that this madman, this dictator, was so ruthless \nthat he even killed and gassed his own innocent civilians, his own \npeople in Kurdish regions.\n  The Senate came to debate this, listening to the speeches by \nPresident Bush, Vice President Cheney, Secretary Rumsfeld, Secretary \nColin Powell, and Condoleezza Rice, and the debate engaged. At the time \nof this debate, I was a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. I \nwould read the headlines in the paper in the morning and watch the \ntelevision newscasts and shake my head because, you see, just a few \nhundred feet away from here in a closed room, carefully guarded, the \nIntelligence Committee was meeting on a daily basis for top-secret \nbriefings about the information we were receiving, and the information \nwe had in the Intelligence Committee was not the same information being \ngiven to the American people. I couldn't believe it. Members of this \nadministration were in active, heated debate over whether aluminum \ntubes really meant that the Iraqis were developing nuclear weapons. \nSome in the administration were saying, of course, not, it is not the \nsame kind of aluminum tube; at the same time, members of the \nadministration were telling the American people to be fearful of \nmushroom-shaped clouds.\n  I was angry about it. Frankly, I couldn't do much about it because, \nin the Intelligence Committee, we are sworn to secrecy. We can't walk \noutside the door and say the statement made yesterday by the White \nHouse is in direct contradiction to classified information that is \nbeing given to this Congress. We can't do that. We couldn't make those \nstatements. So in my frustration, I sat on the floor of the Senate and \nlistened to this heated debate about invading Iraq thinking the \nAmerican people are being misled, they are not being told the truth. \nThat is why I joined 22 of my colleagues in voting no. I didn't believe \nat the time that the American people knew the real facts.\n  So what happened? We invaded, turned loose hundreds, if not thousands \nof people scouring Iraq for these weapons of mass destruction and never \nfound one of them. We looked for nuclear weapons. There was no evidence \nwhatsoever. We went into our intelligence files and said: OK, Saddam \nHussein and al-Qaida--let's get this linkage put together once and for \nall. There was no evidence at all of a linkage.\n  The American people were deceived into this war. That doesn't take a \nthing away from the men and women in uniform who answered the call. \nThey stand and fight. They don't make the policy. The policy is made in \nWashington. And they have shown extraordinary courage.\n  Now, in this supplemental appropriations bill for Iraq, we want to \nengage the White House and the American people in an active discussion \nabout where this war is going. I don't want to wake up every single day \nand read a headline about 5 more Americans, 9 more Americans, 10 more \nAmericans losing their lives in the middle of a civil war. We are \nsaying to the President: It is time for you to accept the reality of \nthe situation, and the reality is, as good as our military is--and it \nis the best in the world--it cannot win a civil war in Iraq. This war \ndates back 14 centuries. Two sects of the Islamic religion in pitched \nbattle for 1,400 years about who\n\n[[Page S5027]]\n\nis the legitimate heir of the great Prophet Muhammad, and our soldiers \nare in the middle of this fight? Is that what we bargained for? Had the \nPresident come to us and said: We want to send in 150,000 American \nsoldiers to risk their lives in the hopes that these two warring \nreligious sects will reach an agreement in Iraq, he wouldn't have had \ntwo votes in favor of that. But that is where we are today.\n\n  Meanwhile, this Iraqi Government, a Government which we have had a \ngreat deal to do with creating, continues to fail us.\n  The supplemental appropriation we will send to the President of the \nUnited States starts talking about bringing American troops home, not \nall at once, not immediate, not a hasty withdrawal that would be \ndangerous for everyone, but in a systematic way. Many of us believe \nthat is the only way to convince the Iraqis to stand up and take \nresponsibility for their own country, to make the important and tough \npolitical decisions for their own future. Unless and until we do that, \nI am afraid we will continue to see the casualties grow and we won't \nsee the stability we seek.\n  This congressional action which we are sending to the President with \nthis supplemental appropriation is not about really sending a message \nto the President, unfortunately. He is not listening. We know he has \nignored his generals, and they are lined up to say the policy and \nstrategy in Iraq is not succeeding. He has ignored the American people, \nwho overwhelmingly believe it is time for American soldiers to start \ncoming home. And he has refused to accept the realities of this war.\n  Sadly, this administration is the architect of the worst foreign \npolicy decision in recent memory. The President has led the best \nmilitary in the world into a desperate civil war. He has spent American \ntreasure at a record rate, driving us deeply into debt, and, \nunfortunately, there is no end in sight.\n  The poor judgment of this administration has led to the invasion of \nIraq, which has cost us over 3,300 American lives, over 25,000 injured, \nas many as 10,000 seriously injured with amputations and traumatic \nbrain injury. His failed leadership has sent too few soldiers into too \nmany battles without the training, the equipment, and the rest they \nneed. And now he is extending the tours of duty of these men and women. \nI can't imagine that family back home marking the days off the \ncalendar, reading the e-mails in anticipation of dad coming home, being \ntold: You have to stay 90 days longer.\n  Do you know, Mr. President, that this extension of the tour of duty \nfor National Guard members is the largest extension since World War II? \nWe are pushing these men and women to the limit. We are asking more of \nthem than has been asked in 40 or 50 years. It is obvious that this \nadministration had no idea at the time of this invasion of the extreme \ncost of ending this war, and frankly, they still don't.\n  This failed policy in Iraq may not change until this President has \nleft the White House, but that doesn't mean congressional action and \ncongressional debate are any less important. If President Bush is not \nlistening, then we trust that the Iraqis will listen. They should know \nthis Congress will continue to work to make one thing very clear: \nAmerican troops are coming home. The Iraqis have to stand up for their \nown country.\n  I commend to my colleagues and all those who follow this debate an \narticle from the New York Times of April 4 this year, just a few weeks \nago, written by Leon Panetta, a former colleague of mine in the House \nof Representatives--a great personal friend, I might add, a man who has \nserved this Government at the congressional level and then again in the \nClinton White House and most recently was a member of the Iraq Study \nGroup.\n  What he basically says in this article of April 4 is, What about \nthose other Iraq deadlines? What he does is he goes through and lists \nall of the deadlines the Iraqis agreed they would live by, the things \nthey said they would achieve. As you go through them, you can \nunderstand the frustration many of us have about the current situation.\n  The Iraqis promised to achieve by the end of 2006 or early 2007 the \napproval of a provincial election law. So far, no progress on that.\n  The approval of a law to regulate their oil industry and share \nrevenues--a very hot political topic, and while the Council of \nMinisters in Iraq has approved a draft, it has yet to be approved by \ntheir Parliament.\n  They agreed by the end of 2006 or early this year to approve the \ndebaathification law, to reintegrate officials of the former regime and \nArab nationalists into public life. No progress at all.\n  They agreed to approve a law to rein in sectarian militias. No \nprogress at all.\n  By March, the Government promised to hold a referendum on \nconstitutional amendments. No progress at all.\n  By May, the Prime Minister of Iraq committed to putting in place the \nlaw controlling militias. No progress at all. The approval of an \namnesty agreement--no progress at all. The completion of all \nreconciliation efforts--clearly no progress.\n  By June, the Iraqi Government promised to hold provincial elections. \nNo date has been set.\n  By April, the Iraqis want to take over total control of the Iraqi \nArmy. Not likely based on the current situation.\n  By September, the Iraqis want to be given full civil control of all \nthe provinces. Today, they control 3 out of the 18 provinces.\n  By December, the Iraqis, with U.S. support, want to achieve total \nsecurity self-reliance. It is too early to tell, but does anyone \nbelieve that will occur?\n  What Leon Panetta spelled out here is promises by Iraqis; that if we \ncontinue to risk American lives, if we continue to spend $8 billion to \n$10 billion a month, they will tackle the tough political issues in \ntheir country, and time and time again they have failed. How long will \nwe wait? How many American lives will we offer up while they twiddle \ntheir thumbs thinking about political possibilities?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe April 4 op-ed by Leon Panetta.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 4, 2007]\n\n                 What About Those Other Iraq Deadlines?\n\n                          (By Leon E. Panetta)\n\n       Seaside, CA.--What has been particularly frustrating about \n     the debate in Washington over Iraq is that everyone seems to \n     be fighting one another and forgetting the fundamental \n     mission of the war.\n       Whether one is for or against the war, the key to stability \n     is to have an Iraq that, in the words of the president \n     himself, can ``govern itself, sustain itself and defend \n     itself.'' Achieving that goal is largely dependent on the \n     political reforms that Iraqi leaders have promised but failed \n     to put in place in their country.\n       As a member of the Iraq Study Group, I found that every \n     military commander we talked to felt that the absence of \n     national reconciliation was the fundamental cause of violence \n     in Iraq. As one American general told us, if the Iraqi \n     government does not make political progress on reforms, ``all \n     the troops in the world will not provide security.''\n       Instead of dividing over the strategy on the war, the \n     president and the Congress should make very clear to the \n     Iraqis that there is no open-ended commitment to our \n     involvement. As the Iraq Study Group recommended, Iraqi \n     leaders must pay a price if they continue to fail to make \n     good on key reforms that they have promised the Iraqi people.\n       In calling for a specific withdrawal date, the House and \n     Senate versions of the supplemental spending bill send a \n     clear message to the Iraqis (even if they do face a certain \n     veto). The worst mistake now would be to provide money for \n     the war without sending the Iraqis any message at all about \n     their responsibility for reforms. Both the president and the \n     Congress at the very least must make the Iraqi government \n     understand that future financial and military support is \n     going to depend on Baghdad's making substantial progress \n     toward the milestones Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has \n     publicly committed to.\n       Unfortunately, with a few exceptions, little progress has \n     been made. Consider efforts toward stabilizing democracy and \n     achieving national reconciliation:\n       The Iraqis promised to achieve, by the end of 2006 or early \n     2007, the approval of a provincial election law (so far, no \n     progress); approval of a law to regulate the oil industry and \n     share revenues (while the Council of Ministers has approved a \n     draft, it has yet to be approved by the Parliament); approval \n     of the de-Baathification law to reintegrate officials of the \n     former regime and Arab nationalists into public life (no \n     progress); and approval of a law to rein in sectarian \n     militias (no progress).\n       By March, the government promised to hold a referendum on \n     constitutional amendments (no progress).\n       By May, the prime minister committed to putting in place \n     the law controlling militias\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\n     (no progress); the approval of the amnesty agreement (no \n     progress); and the completion of all reconciliation efforts.\n       By June, the Iraqi government promised to hold provincial \n     elections (no date has been set).\n       As for security issues, things are not going much better. \n     The Iraqis have increased security spending over 2006 levels \n     as promised, but they are falling behind on the number of \n     battle-ready Army units.\n       By April, the Iraqis want to take over total control of the \n     Iraq Army (not likely based on current progress).\n       By September, the Iraqis want to be given full civil \n     control of all provinces (to date they control 3 of 18 \n     provinces).\n       By December, the Iraqis, with United States support, want \n     to achieve total security self-reliance (too early to tell, \n     but does anyone really find this likely?).\n       Yes, there have been some notable successes. For example, \n     the Baghdad government has made good on its promise to \n     appreciate the Iraqi dinar to combat accelerating inflation, \n     and has increased domestic prices for refined petroleum \n     products.\n       But particularly in terms of reforms needed to reconcile \n     Sunnis and Shiites, progress has been minimal. And unless the \n     United States finds new ways to bring strong pressure on the \n     Iraqis, things are not likely to pick up any time soon.\n       In seeking support for the so-called surge and the \n     supplemental spending bill, the Bush administration argues \n     that American forces have to provide temporary stability to \n     enable the Iraqi leaders to negotiate political solutions. \n     True, but after a while this becomes an excuse for inaction \n     on the political reforms that are essential to stability \n     itself.\n       This is why the Iraq Study Group report made clear that \n     ``if the Iraqi government does not make substantial progress \n     toward the achievement of milestones on national \n     reconciliation, security and governance, the United States \n     should reduce its political, military or economic support for \n     the Iraqi government.''\n       Until the Bush administration and Congress can jointly \n     convince the Iraqi government that this threat is real, there \n     will be little chance of reaching the one goal on which \n     Republicans and Democrats can agree: a safe, stable and \n     prosperous Iraq.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this debate is long overdue. It is time \nfor us to let them know we are coming home. It is time for them to \nunderstand in Iraq that they have received more from the United States \nthan any nation should ever ask or hope for. We have offered up our \nbest and bravest men in uniform. We have brought home those broken in \nbody and spirit and said we will stand by them the rest of their lives, \nknowing in the process the sacrifices that have been made by them and \ntheir families.\n  We have spent $500 billion, which might have been spent in this \ncountry for a lot of things we desperately need--health care, paying \nfor No Child Left Behind, medical research, basic investments in this \ncountry's future. We have given up on them because we had to spend the \nmoney in Iraq, and we continue to.\n\n  When it comes to this bill, which we hope to send to the President, \nhe has already dismissed it with a wave of the hand. I am going to veto \nthis bill, he says. Well, he is going to be vetoing a bill which is \ncritically important. It is important to tell the Iraqis they have to \naccept responsibility for their own future. It is important because it \nadds billions of dollars for medical care for our veterans, billions of \ndollars we need so we don't face that shameful situation at Walter Reed \nthat was reported a few weeks ago, billions of dollars so our veterans \nhospitals can truly take care of these soldiers who are coming home \nwith injuries that were unimaginable just years ago; a billion dollars \nfor the National Guard to buy more equipment which has been destroyed \nor left behind in Iraq so they can keep America safe while they prepare \nfor their next redeployment.\n  These are dollars that are critically necessary for America. For the \nPresident to just, with the back of his hand, say: I'm going to veto \nthis because this is just a political game, is to ignore the obvious. \nThere is no political gamesmanship in this bill. This is a critical, \nlife-and-death debate about a lot of our brave Americans whose lives \nare on the line today.\n  I urge my colleagues, when this bill comes to the Senate, to search \ntheir hearts and ask, how many more days can we stand reading about \nnine Americans losing their lives? How many more funerals? How many \nmore broken bodies returning from Iraq? How many more families heart \nbroken that their soldiers are going to have to stay on and on and on \nin a war that has no end? This foreign policy decision is one that will \nhaunt America for a generation. We need to do our part to speak for \nAmerica, to speak for the families who have no other voice, and to \nspeak for those soldiers. If we truly support those soldiers, support \ntheir coming back home to the heroes' welcome they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Iraq Troop Withdrawal\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe it is appropriate to respond to \nthe assistant leader on the Democratic side relative to his commentary \nbecause this is obviously an issue of significance, probably the most \nsignificant issue we face as a nation today in the area of concern for \nour citizens who are carrying the burden of service and who wear the \nuniform of America.\n  I do think it is a touch cynical for the other side of the aisle to \ncome to the floor of the Senate and say they are going to support the \ntroops, when only 3 months into General Petraeus's leadership in Iraq \nthey are suggesting that the rug should be pulled out from underneath \nhis efforts. General Petraeus was sent there with an overwhelming vote \nof this body in support of his efforts to try to bring stability, \nspecifically to Baghdad, and to give the Government of Iraq, which was \nfreely elected--something which the other side of the aisle manages to \nignore with a fair amount of energy--to give them the breathing space \nthey need in order to be able to get going and to be able to create \nstability.\n  A stable Iraq is critical to our national defense, and it is critical \nto our ability to fight terrorism. A unilateral withdrawal forced upon \nus by the Democratic leadership of this Congress within the next 3 \nmonths--which is the proposal they put into the language of this bill--\nwill guarantee that Iraq goes into chaos. It will probably guarantee \nthat thousands, tens of thousands of Iraqis will die as a result of \ngenocidal activity or activity that will border on genocide, and that \nwill make the Balkans look like it was minor in comparison to Iraq as \nfar as chaos. It will establish without doubt a client state for Iran, \nprobably partitioned within Iraq. It will clearly create functioning \nsafe havens for al-Qaida, which has sworn, of course, to attack America \non American soil, and has already done so and has proven its ability to \ndo this.\n  The fact that after only 3 months of General Petraeus being in the \nfield we would pull from beneath him the ability to support the troops \nhe needs there is really, in my opinion, an act of cynicism. The plan \nis set up in a manner--the language which was put into this plan is set \nup in a manner so that the Iraqi Government must meet 16 major goals in \nrestructuring its Government within 2\\1/2\\ months. My goodness, the \nCongress of the United States, the Senate of the United States can't \npass anything in 2\\1/2\\ months. Yet we expect the Iraqi Government and \nLegislature to reorganize its entire structure within 2\\1/2\\ months?\n  That is the condition put in this bill in order to maintain funds for \nour troops who are in the field. If the Iraqi Government is unable to \nmeet those conditions, then within 3 months the money is withdrawn from \nthe troops in the field, General Petraeus's flexibility is removed, and \nhe is essentially handcuffed. The commanders in the field are no longer \nthe generals in the field. It is no longer General Petraeus and his \ncolonels and lieutenant colonels, his captains and his lieutenants. The \ncommanders become the leadership of the other side of the aisle. They \nmake the decisions on military action within Baghdad. General \nPetraeus's hands will be tied behind him, or at least one hand will be \ntied behind him.\n  Even if the Iraqi Government did the amazing thing of putting in \nplace all these, significant conditions--and there should be \nconditions, no question, benchmarks for Iraq--these fairly significant \nconditions in a compressed timeframe, which guarantees they will not be \naccomplished, but let's say even if that Government were able to \nsucceed in those conditions, then what is the reward for putting in \nplace that type of stability and that type of restructuring? The \nlanguage in the bill requires that the troops begin to be withdrawn and \nthe money start to be cut off 3 months later. They are giving them a 3-\nmonth breathing space of having the support they need and General \nPetraeus having the support he needs in order to accomplish his goals.\n  The other side of the aisle comes to the floor of the Senate and acts \nas if\n\n[[Page S5029]]\n\nthese are not significant; that we are not putting in place things \nwhich can't be accomplished; that we want to support the troops in the \nfield. Well, read the conditions. The conditions cannot be met, and \nthey are intentionally structured not to be met. Listen to the real \nlanguage from the other side of the aisle.\n  The majority leader says the war is lost. He wasn't talking just \nabout Iraq. It appears he was talking about the entire war against \nterrorism, which happens to be a fairly significant statement. It is \nalso obvious that when you make a statement like that, as the leader of \nthe Democratic Party, the most senior Democratic Member of the Senate, \none of the most senior Members of the Democratic leadership of the \nGovernment of this country, when you say the war is lost, you put your \ncredibility on the line.\n  Quite honestly, if we institute the language as proposed in this \nbill, which dramatically limits the capacity of General Petraeus and \nthe American troops to succeed in their mission, well, I guess that \nwill probably guarantee the war is lost, so they will have a self-\nfulfilling prophecy as relates to Iraq. The consequences of that will \nbe catastrophic in the area of death and destruction within Iraq.\n  For us, as a nation and for our national security, should a client \nstate be created for Iran within Iraq, should al-Qaida have free haven \nin Iraq, the consequences for us could be equally dramatic.\n  In addition, a little point should be made here. The language in this \nbill, as it is being brought forward, is blatantly unconstitutional. It \nessentially cedes responsibility for the management of the troops in \nthe field to the legislative branch. Nowhere in the Constitution did \nthe Founding Fathers believe there should be 435 people running \nmilitary decisions in the field. They had just been through a war. They \nhad been through the revolution, where they had one person running the \narmy in the field, George Washington. They understood that you either \nput one person in charge or you have chaos in any sort of military \naction. That is why the Constitution says the Commander in Chief shall \nbe the President, and that the military shall report to the Commander \nin Chief.\n  The language of this bill, on its face, is clearly unconstitutional \nbecause it essentially cedes responsibility for field command over our \ntroops to the leadership of the Senate, the Democratic leadership of \nthe Senate, ironically, which guarantees chaos in the area of order \nrelative to defining and executing the mission as assigned to the \ntroops in the field. You can't say to the American soldier, who is on \nthe ground in Iraq, who is in Baghdad, who is doing their mission, and \ndoing their mission well, very, very well--and General Petraeus has \nsaid there is progress occurring there--you can't say to that soldier: \nA, we are going to take the money away from you to support your \nmission; B, we are going to give your enemies a defined date when we \nare going to leave so that your enemies, our enemies, can wait you out \nand can basically harass you knowing that you are going to withdraw; \nand, C, that your new commander is the majority leader and the \nassistant leader of the Senate and the Speaker of the House.\n  We can't say: When General Petraeus gives you a command, you don't \nnecessarily have to listen to him because the people who are going to \nmake the decision as to how you execute your mission aren't in the line \nof authority of the military or the Commander in Chief; they have \nsuddenly become the legislative branch of the Government.\n  The language in this bill is structured to accomplish one thing, and \nthat is to assure defeat in our efforts to try to bring about a stable \nand responsible Government in Iraq. All you have to do to confirm the \nlogic of that view and the accuracy of that view is to return to the \nwords of the majority leader. The war is lost, he said. In order to \nassure that happens, they have brought forth the language in this bill \nwhich guarantees that our enemy will know when we are going to leave; \nthat the freely elected Government of Iraq will not get the support it \nneeds to survive as a stable and responsible Government; and that our \nsoldiers will not know who is commanding them, but they will know they \nare not going to get the necessary support to accomplish their mission. \nThat is defeat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I will yield to the chairman for a UC \nrequest before I bring up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator DeMint be \nrecognized to offer amendment No. 930; that there be 20 minutes of \ndebate prior to a vote in relation to the amendment, with the time \nequally divided and controlled between Senator DeMint and myself or our \ndesignees; that no amendments be in order to the amendment prior to the \nvote; that at the use or yielding back of time, the amendment be set \naside to recur at a time to be determined by the majority leader, \nfollowing consultation with the Republican leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 930\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, again, I ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment, and I call up amendment No. 930 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes \n     amendment No. 930.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit congressional earmarks of funds appropriated \n                pursuant to authorizations in the bill)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. EARMARKS.\n\n       (a) In General.--It shall not be in order to consider a \n     bill, resolution, amendment, or conference report that \n     proposes a congressional earmark of appropriated funds \n     authorized by this Act.\n       (b) Definitions.--For the purpose of this section, the term \n     ``congressional earmark'' means a provision or report \n     language included primarily at the request of a Member, \n     Delegate, Resident Commissioner, or Senator providing, \n     authorizing or recommending a specific amount of \n     discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other \n     spending authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, \n     grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to an \n     entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or \n     Congressional district, other than through a statutory or \n     administrative formula-driven or competitive award process.\n       (c) Supermajority Waiver and Appeal.--This section may be \n     waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote \n     of \\3/5\\ of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An \n     affirmative vote of \\3/5\\ of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required in the Senate to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under this section.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, my amendment provides what we call an \nearmark shield for the funds authorized in this bill, the America \nCOMPETES Act, S. 761.\n  Specifically, it establishes a 60-vote point of order against \nappropriations bills that contain congressional earmarks for the funds \nauthorized in this bill. Let me be very clear. This does not apply to \nall appropriations bills or to all appropriations earmarks. It simply \napplies to those bills that contain appropriations earmarks for the \nprograms authorized in the bill that we are considering today, the \nAmerica COMPETES Act.\n  What we are trying to avoid is setting up a new fund for new \nearmarks, so we are setting this bill aside and protecting it from \nearmarks. If an appropriations bill comes to the floor for funding of \nthese programs but without earmarks, no point of order would lie \nagainst the bill. In a similar way, if an appropriations bill comes to \nthe floor with earmarks for other programs outside of the programs \nfunded through the America COMPETES Act, then no point of order would \nlie against that bill either.\n  My amendment only creates an earmark shield for the program we are\n\n[[Page S5030]]\n\nfunding today. The goal of this amendment is to ensure the funds \nauthorized in this bill are allocated according to a competitive or \nmerit-based process.\n  As my colleagues know, congressional earmarks circumvent the normal \ncompetitive or merit-based process, and award funds based on politics. \nThis bill is focused on competition. Earmarking perverts the \ncompetitive process and substitutes the judgment of lawmakers and their \nstaff for professional scientists and engineers who truly recognize a \ncompetitive proposal that merits funding.\n  Congress has been able to keep earmarks out of the National Science \nFoundation and it has made that foundation one of the most successful \nFederal science agencies. The bill recognizes and affirms what is \nalready explicitly in the bill. Let me read a section from the America \nCOMPETES Act. My amendment is consistent with the stated intent of the \nbill, which says on page 183 that nothing in divisions A or D shall be \ninterpreted to require the National Science Foundation to ``alter or \nmodify its merit-based system or peer review process.''\n  Many of America's leading institutions oppose earmarks for research \nbecause they understand earmarks siphon funds away from the research \nprograms their talented researchers could compete for. Several \nuniversities have official policies in place opposing congressional \nearmarks. Let me read a few of their policies. I will start with the \nUniversity of Michigan and I will quote from their policy statement.\n\n       The University of Michigan supports competitive peer review \n     as the primary and best mechanism to allocate Federal \n     research funds. Consequently, it is the policy of the \n     university not to seek or accept government earmarks in \n     support of faculty research.\n\n  Here is a quote from Yale:\n\n       Yale University does not seek appropriations for individual \n     research projects that would circumvent existing merit-based \n     procedures of Federal agencies for selecting projects for \n     funding. The university has long held that evaluation of \n     proposed projects on the basis of merit as judged by peer \n     review is the best method of identifying the most promising \n     research or scholarly projects.\n\n  And a quote from MIT's policy:\n\n       MIT has a long-standing policy that prohibits the knowing \n     acceptance of grants and contracts funded via Congressional \n     action. Such awards are known as ``earmarks,'' and funding is \n     not generally the result of peer review. Earmarked funds are \n     often a way to secure funds for new buildings, and for major \n     equipment needed for cutting edge research, but \n     institutionally MIT avoids seeking or accepting earmarked \n     funds.\n\n  It seems the whole country is starting to realize that the earmarking \nprocess we have adopted in this Congress is wasteful and actually \nsubverts the goals we set for many of these bills. It is clear we do \nnot need to earmark funds in order for our funding programs to be \neffective. My amendment simply creates an earmark shield for funds \nauthorized in this bill to ensure they are allocated in the most \ncompetitive way.\n  It is important to recognize that a number of Members of this Senate \nfrom many different committees have placed the authorization of this \nmoney in very specific categories that we need to protect and not \nsubvert. It is time for the Senate to begin taking steps to discourage \nthe use of earmarks when appropriating funds for important programs and \nwe need to make sure this bill is not a new slush fund for Congress. My \namendment will not only preserve the integrity of the competitive \nallocation process, but it will also make America more competitive by \nmaking these programs more effective.\n  I thank the Senator for his courtesy in allowing me to bring up this \nbill. I understand we will be voting on it as part of a number of bills \nafter the lunch hour.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for coming to the \nfloor and making his argument for this amendment at this time. He is \nright, under this unanimous consent agreement the plan would be to add \nit to a package of other amendments we are voting on later this \nafternoon at a time chosen by the majority leader.\n  I will speak briefly in opposition to the amendment at this point. I \nknow the Senator from South Carolina has had to leave the floor, but I \ndo think it best in order that anyone who is following our discussions \nhere on the floor can know the problem I have with the amendment.\n  First, I agree with the concern about Congress stepping in and \ndiverting funds from the good purposes we lay out in this legislation \nand diverting those to other, more parochial applications. That is a \nvalid concern. I object to that and I hope we can prevent that from \nhappening in the future. But I would argue this amendment is not the \nway to keep that from happening.\n  This amendment sets up a unique process. It basically says you cannot \nbring an appropriations bill to the Senate floor unless you have 60 \nvotes. Any appropriations bill you try to bring to the floor is subject \nto a 60-vote point of order if it contains in it what is described as a \ncongressional earmark. You say, What is meant by a congressional \nearmark? It goes on to say that is any provision or report language--if \nyou have a report that accompanies the appropriations bill, that is \nreport language--that provides or authorizes or recommends a specific \namount of funding or discretionary authority or credit to an entity.\n\n  That is pretty broad. Essentially what we would be saying is the \nAppropriations Committee, for example, if they determine--one example \nthe Senator from Tennessee and I were talking about today as we were \ndiscussing this amendment was, if we said we want $60 million spent for \nthe supercomputing program and the Appropriations Committee said, no, \nit ought to be $80 million, an extra $20 million for the supercomputing \nprograms in a particular agency of the Federal Government, that is in \nfact within the definition of ``earmarked Congressional funding here,'' \nso a 60-vote point of order could be raised against that provision.\n  I don't think the Congress wants to go to that extreme in tying its \nown hands. You would have essentially two sets of rules: one set of \nrules that would apply to most appropriations bills and a different set \nof rules that would apply to appropriations bills that would cover the \nsubjects that are the subject of this legislation--that would be Health \nand Human Services, because there is a substantial amount in this \nlegislation that goes to the Department of Education; that would be the \nCommerce, Science and Justice legislation. Let's see, what is the \nother--the Energy and Water appropriations bill, of course. Those are \nappropriations bills that would be subject to this different and more \nstrenuous point of order requirement.\n  This is well intentioned, I am certain. I have no doubt about the \ngood intentions of the Senator from South Carolina. We have all been \nconcerned about the overuse of earmarks in the Congress in recent \nyears. I know there is a great deal going on to require more \ntransparency, to require that all these things be out in public so we \ncan know what is being voted on and we can object. That is the best \nshield. He talked about an earmark shield. That is the best shield. It \nis the eternal vigilance of people here in Congress, paying attention \nto what is in the bills and insisting only those things are in the \nbills that in fact further a good public purpose.\n  So I do object.\n  I yield the remainder of the time that is reserved in opposition to \nthis amendment. But before I yield the floor, let me do another consent \nagreement.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 931, As Modified; 923, As Modified; 941, and 960\n\n  There are four amendments that have been filed that relate to the \nCommerce Committee's jurisdiction and that have been cleared on both \nsides of the aisle. There is a modification at the desk to amendment \nNo. 931 by Senator McCaskill. She spoke to that amendment a few minutes \nago. There is a modification at the desk to amendment No. 923 by \nSenator Obama. There is an amendment No. 941 by Senators Snowe and \nKohl. There is an amendment No. 960 by Senators Levin and Voinovich.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these amendments, as modified if \nmodified, be agreed to and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                     AMENDMENT NO. 931, AS MODIFIED\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S5031]]\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, let me, to alert my colleagues as to the \nstate of activity here at the current time, say what it is, as I \nunderstand it.\n  We have a unanimous consent agreement to consider three amendments \nSenator Coburn of Oklahoma wishes to offer. That will begin at 2 \no'clock this afternoon. We are not certain if we will require a \nrollcall vote on all three of those amendments or only two of those \namendments, but that will be determined in the future.\n  We also, of course, now have a unanimous consent agreement to have a \nvote on the DeMint amendment we were discussing. That will be scheduled \npresumably after we have the votes on the Coburn amendments or in some \nsequence around that same time.\n  I am informed we also have an amendment Senator Inhofe wishes to \nbring to the floor and to discuss and offer, which I hope can be done \nbetween now and the 2 o'clock time for beginning the discussion on the \nCoburn amendments. I see Senator Inhofe is on the floor. If he is \nagreeable to going ahead with his amendment at this time, he could \nargue in favor of his amendment, and then I will have some arguments \nagainst his amendment, and there may be others also wishing to speak \nagainst his amendment, and we could hopefully schedule a vote on that \nas well.\n  That is a total of five amendments I am aware of that may require \nrollcall votes. I hope we can get all of those amendments debated and \nscheduled for votes and voted on before we have the briefing at 4 \no'clock, the briefing by General Petraeus. If we were able to do that, \nI don't know why we couldn't also go to final passage before 3 o'clock, \nor if there were a problem in doing that, of course, we could come back \nafter the briefing and have final passage. But I know of no other \namendments.\n  If Senators are sitting in their offices or their staffs are sitting \nin their offices with other amendments they intend to offer to this \nlegislation, we urge they come to the floor and offer those amendments \nin the very near future.\n  I will defer to my colleague from Tennessee for his observations, but \nas far as I am informed, once we have disposed of these five \namendments, we will have disposed of all of the amendments people have \ninsisted on having rollcall votes on.\n  With that, I yield the floor and I will allow my colleague from \nTennessee to speak.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is my understanding as well. Senator Grassley \nstill has an amendment about which he\n\n[[Page S5032]]\n\nwants us to talk. That is the only other amendment I know about, other \nthan the one you said. It is my hope we could follow the schedule the \nSenator from New Mexico suggested and finish the bill before 4 o'clock. \nI think that would be the sentiment of most Senators to whom I talked. \nIt will permit us to move promptly to the business before us concerning \nIraq.\n  I concur in the comments of Senator Bingaman. I hope by now we have \nhad such extensive participation in this legislation over the last 2 \nyears that everyone believes he or she has had a good hearing. The \nCoburn amendments and Inhofe amendment are the only ones I know about \nfor sure. They are scheduled, or will be, and we will have to talk with \nSenator Grassley about his proposal.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 955\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is going to be my intention in just a \nmoment to bring up and ask for the immediate consideration of my \namendment, No. 955.\n  We are working on a modification to make sure those on the Finance \nCommittee will find it to be acceptable. I have discussed this with the \nleadership and the minority. However, it will take a minute to get the \nlanguage up.\n  Essentially, what the amendment will say is, notwithstanding any \nother provision of the law, no Federal funds shall be provided to any \norganization or entity that advocates against tax competition or U.S. \ntax competitiveness.\n  Now, I cannot think of anything that would be more significant in a \ncompetitiveness bill than to have this language. There are several \norganizations, one of which is called the OECD, which is the \nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development. This organization \nactually was transformed back in 1961 after the Marshall Plan came into \neffect, and they have been, over a period of time, advocating increases \nin taxes for the United States. In fact, over the past fairly short \nperiod of time, 24 different times they have advocated increases in \nU.S. taxes. One was--I will just list them here--a value-added tax, a \n40-cent increase in the gas tax, a carbon tax, a fertilizer tax, ending \nthe deductibility of State and local taxes in the calculation of \nFederal taxes, new taxes at the State level, and a host of other new \nand innovative taxes on U.S. citizens.\n  They also have advocated for a period of time a global taxation \nscheme. It is very difficult to find anyone in this country who would \nsay this is in our best interest.\n  Now, in this particular organization there are some things they do \nthat I have found have been helpful. So the modifications I am making \nwill list three things that will not be considered under this act to be \nanticompetitive. That is the language I am waiting for right now, which \nwe should have in the next couple of minutes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong support \nfor the American COMPETES Act, legislation that will help to ensure \nthat our Nation remains competitive in today's increasingly global \neconomy. The basis of this bipartisan legislation was a report by Norm \nAugustine called ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' and a report by \nthe Council of Competitiveness titled ``Innovate America.''\n  I remember being at a dinner last year not too far from these \nChambers, and well over 30 Senators were there. It wasn't a fundraiser, \nwe were there to hear Norm Augustine--bipartisan, leadership, new \nMembers. I think it speaks to the importance of this issue.\n  Both of these reports assess the current situation. What they do is \nset out specific plans to get us where we need to be. The reports have \nserved to put us on notice that we cannot take our competitive \nleadership for granted in a world that, as Tom Friedman has put so \nwell, is increasingly flat.\n  For the American people following our deliberations on this \nlegislation, I hope you will take notice that this is one of those \nissues that rises above party politics, rises above partisan politics, \nlegislation that is about Republicans and Democrats coming together to \naddress fundamental challenges to our Nation's competitiveness.\n  I am proud to join in that effort. Keeping our country competitive is \nultimately about jobs. It is about ensuring that our future workforce \ncan compete in a global economy and that our current workforce remains \ncompetitive.\n  I was chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee the last 4 \nyears. I remember being at a conference in Mexico, with some Mexican \nacademics complaining about the impact of low-wage jobs in China on the \nMexican manufacturing economy.\n  When I was in China last year talking with some Chinese academics and \neconomists, they complained about the impact of low-wage jobs in \nVietnam on the Chinese manufacturing economy.\n  If we begin to lose ground, we are not going to win the race to low-\nwage jobs. Our ability to be the world's greatest economic power is \ngoing to depend on our creativity, our productivity, and our \ninnovation. If we begin to lose ground in the critical areas of math \nand science, we will also lose ground in the race for high-wage jobs, \nand that is the race we should be winning better trained workers, \ngreater opportunity.\n  Last month, Microsoft's Bill Gates came before the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee to talk about keeping our country \ncompetitive. One of his statements particularly stood out to me.\n  He said:\n\n       The U.S. cannot maintain its economic leadership unless our \n     workforce consists of people who have the knowledge and \n     skills needed to drive innovation.\n\n  He further said:\n\n       We simply cannot sustain an economy based on innovation \n     unless our citizens are educated in math, science and \n     engineering.\n\n  I could not agree more. The challenges we face are significant when \nit comes to the future competitiveness of our workforce. Today, China \ngraduates at least four times as many engineers as the United States. \nIn fact, I was told at one point the figure was 600,000 engineers in \nChina, 350,000 in India, and 70,000 in America.\n  The small nation of South Korea graduates just as many as we do. In 3 \nshort years, Asia will be home to more than 90 percent of the world's \nscientists and engineers.\n  According to a recent poll, 84 percent of middle school students \npreferred to clean their rooms, take out the garbage, go to their \ndentist, or eat their vegetables than to do homework, something we have \nto change.\n  As Tom Friedman wrote in his book ``The World is Flat,'' when he was \ngrowing up, his mother used to tell him to eat all his vegetables \nbecause kids in China were starving. Today, his mother would say: Do \nyour homework because the kids in China are starving to take your job.\n  Several reports have indicated that U.S. students do not perform at \nthe level of their international counterparts in math and science. \nAmerican high school students currently rank 24th out of 29 among \ndeveloped nations in math literacy and problem solving.\n  As if this were not worrisome enough, we also need to concern \nourselves with the coming retirement wave of high-skilled workers in \nthe fields of engineering, science and technology, and math.\n  According to the National Science Foundation, about one-third of \nAmerican scientists and engineers are over 50 years old. Tiger Woods \nsaid before a recent major tournament:\n\n       I can't win the Masters on Thursday, but I can lose it.\n\n  We can't win the global economic battle today, but we can lose it in \nour elementary school classrooms.\n  Mr. President, the legislation before us will help go a long way \ntoward preparing our future workers by improving K-12 education. For \ninstance, the\n\n[[Page S5033]]\n\nbill increases the offering of advanced placement and international \nbaccalaureate programs and expands math and science specialty schools.\n  While we are beginning to take action in Washington, I proudly note \nthat my State of Minnesota has been very active in ensuring the State's \nfuture workforce can compete with the best of them from around the \nworld. Our Governor is a leader in the development of the National \nGovernors Association Innovation America initiative. In Woodbury, a \nmath and science academy is developing a curriculum to meet the needs \nof the 21st century workplace. In Brainerd, the chamber of commerce is \ndeveloping an innovative program to transform education through five \nrural school districts by creating career pathways focusing on regional \nhigh-demand, high-pay occupations called Bridges Career Academies.\n  Minnesota is doing its part.\n  While the challenges to our leadership in the global economy are \nindeed significant, I am confident that through a bipartisan and \npublic-private partnership approach, we will meet those challenges.\n  I have a series of amendments that I anticipate and hope the body \nwill act upon before we conclude deliberation on this bill. One of them \nis a bonus grants program. Both of these I coauthored with Senator \nPryor. On the other one, he is the principal author. The bonus grants \nprovide math and science partnership grants to three elementary and \nthree secondary high schools in each State which make the largest year-\nto-year improvement in their efforts to score highly on the State's \nmath and science assessment test. This is about putting our money where \nour mouths are. This is about providing reward and incentive for \nschools to do better in these critical areas of math and science.\n  The other amendment, which is a Pryor-Coleman amendment, No. 966, \nestablishes a small business innovation, research, science, technology, \nengineering, and math workforce development grant program. This is a \nway to get leading small businesses to provide short-term workforce \ntraining opportunities for colleges in the field of science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math.\n  The one amendment I will not offer but I do want to bring to the \nattention of the Senate has to do with expediting the FBI background \ncheck on doctors and scientists. We have the world-renown Mayo Clinic \nin Rochester, MN, the greatest medical facility in the world. Some of \nthe doctors have been waiting years to get background checks cleared. \nWe are in danger of losing them. We need to move quickly.\n  I know the sense is that immigration issues will be dealt with at a \nlater time. We need to deal with the immigration issue. We need to deal \nwith it in the sense of stronger borders, guest worker programs, and we \nalso need to look at some of these smaller pieces that are important--\nexpediting the ability to get background checks so we keep the best and \nbrightest in this country. That debate will be for another day.\n  Today, the debate is to ensure that America can compete in a global \neconomy. This bill offers that opportunity. It is bipartisan. I am glad \nto be part of that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 955\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 955.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 955.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n             (Purpose: To protect American competitiveness)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROHIBITION AGAINST FUNDING ANTI-COMPETITIVENESS\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of the Law; no federal \n     funds shall be provided to any organization or entity that \n     advocates against tax competition or United States tax \n     competitiveness.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 955, As Modified\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we had some objection to this amendment. \nWe have been working with people from both tax committees and the \nForeign Relations Committee. I have agreed to some language. I will \nread the language, but first I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROHIBITION AGAINST FUNDING ANTI-COMPETITIVENESS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of the Law; no federal \n     funds shall be provided to any organization or entity that \n     advocates against tax competition or United States tax \n     competitiveness.\n       Provided, however, that advocating for effective tax \n     information exchange, advocating for effective transfer \n     pricing, and advocating for income tax treaties is not \n     considered to be advocating against the competition of United \n     States tax competitiveness.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have already stated what this amendment \ndoes. It does try to get some sense into some of these organizations \nadvocating noncompetitiveness or anticompetitiveness for the United \nStates. One such organization is called the OECD, Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development. This organization I have already \ntalked about, but one of the things they advocate is high taxes for the \nUnited States. In order to make sure we can still use this organization \nfor a function that seems to be desirable by the tax committee, I will \nread the modification. The amendment currently reads:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of the Law; no federal \n     funds shall be provided to any organization or entity that \n     advocates against tax competition or United States tax \n     competitiveness.\n\n  This is the modification:\n\n       Provided, however, that advocating for effective tax \n     information exchange, advocating for effective transfer \n     pricing, and advocating for income tax treaties is not \n     considered to be advocating against the competition of United \n     States tax competitiveness.\n\n  I think we have taken care of that need.\n  With that, I ask that we get into the mix here so we can get a vote \non this or else agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's willingness \nto consider modifications in the amendment. We are still checking with \nparticular Senators who have expressed an interest in this on our side. \nIt will still be a few minutes before we are in a position to say \nwhether this is still an amendment on which we would require a vote. I \nhope this is something on which we can agree not to have to have a \nrollcall vote. Perhaps we will know in the next few minutes.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 905, as Modified\n\n  While I have the floor, let me indicate there is an amendment which \nhas been filed which relates to the Energy Committee's jurisdiction. It \nhas been cleared on both sides. It is a modification that is at the \ndesk to amendment No. 905 by Senator Obama. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this amendment, as modified, be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 905), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 78, strike line 21 and insert the following:\n       ``(D) $27,500,000 for fiscal year 2011.\n\n                      ``CHAPTER 6--ADMINISTRATION\n\n     ``SEC. 3195.

Javits Gifted and \n     Talented Students Education Act of 2001 (20 U.S.C. 7253 et \n     seq.).''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in his bestselling book, ``The World is \nFlat,'' Thomas Friedman discusses the challenges of globalism using the \nmetaphor of the world getting flatter to describe how the breaking down \nof international barriers to the movement of goods, services, people, \nand ideas creates an intensely competitive global environment. I liked \nit so much, and it has so much wisdom in it.\n  In chapter 8, entitled ``This Is Not a Test,'' Friedman says, ``If \nthis moment has any parallel in American history, it is the height of \nthe cold war, around 1957, when the Soviet Union leaped ahead of \nAmerica in the space race by putting up the Sputnik satellite.''\n  Not coincidentally, the Congress passed the National Defense \nEducation Act the following year, 1958.\n  That act really started Federal Government involvement in education.\n  It was designed primarily to jumpstart education in math, science, \nand modern foreign languages so we would be able to match and exceed \nthe achievements of the Soviets and win the cold war.\n  According to Thomas Friedman, to meet the challenges of what he calls \n``flatism'' will require, ``as comprehensive, energetic, and focused a \nresponse as did meeting the challenge of communism.''\n  As I mentioned, Federal education policy started with an urgency to \nsupport and encourage students to excel in fields that were considered \nto be of major importance to national security during the cold war.\n  Subsequently, Federal education policy became concerned with equity \nbetween students of different socioeconomic classes as part of \nPresident Johnson's war on poverty.\n  Both of these dual focuses of Federal education policy, excellence \nand equity, are legitimate and important.\n  However, we sometimes seem to ping pong between the two, forgetting \nabout one in favor of the other.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 deepened the existing focus of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act on making sure that all \nstudents have an adequate education.\n  Now while we don't have a single event like Sputnik to bring home to \nus the current challenges we face, there is a growing recognition that, \nfor the sake of our future economic competitiveness, we cannot neglect \nthe importance of challenging and encouraging students to excel so that \nthey will some day be the scientists, engineers, and researchers that \nwill create the innovations that will drive our economy.\n  This means that we must not only help underachieving students to \nachieve at grade level, but we must encourage high ability students to \nachieve to their full potential.\n  For years, I have been leading the charge to do a better job \nunlocking the tremendous potential that lies in gifted and talented \nyoung Americans. They represent a national resource that, \nunfortunately, too often goes untapped.\n  Gifted students learn faster and to a greater depth than other \nstudents and often look at the world differently than other students. \nAs a result, it takes a great deal more to keep them challenged and \nstimulated.\n  If they are not sufficiently stimulated, they often learn to get by \nwith minimum effort and adopt poor learning habits that can prevent \nthem from achieving to their potential.\n  In fact, many gifted and talented students underachieve or even drop \nout of school.\n  Jan and Bob Davidson, from the majority leader's home State, wrote an \nimportant book called ``Genius Denied'' about how, nationwide, we are \nletting gifted students fall through the cracks and wasting their \npotential.\n  The Belin-Blank Center in my home State of Iowa produced a report \ntitled, ``A Nation Deceived: How Schools Hold Back America's Brightest \nStudents.''\n  This situation must be reversed if America is to retain its \ncompetitive edge which, obviously, is the purpose of the very good \nlegislation before us, led by Senators Bingaman and Alexander.\n  I am glad that the American competitiveness bill currently before the \nSenate recognizes the need to do a better job of helping students to \nexcel in fields like math, science, and critical foreign languages.\n  However, if we want to go toe to toe with countries that place a very \nhigh value on learning, we must do more to support and encourage the \nbest and brightest American students.\n  My amendment would increase the fee employers pay for H1-B visas for \nhighly skilled foreign workers to immigrate to the United States and to \nuse that additional funding for the Jacob Javits Gifted and Talented \nStudents Education Act.\n  This is the only Federal program that provides funding to support \nprogramming to meet the unique learning needs of our brightest, most \npromising students.\n  It funds a national research center that produces invaluable research \nin instructional strategies that can truly tap into the potential of \ngifted students as well as a small grant program to encourage such \nresearch nationwide.\n  The Javits Act also contains a grant program to encourage greater \nfocus in the States on meeting the needs of gifted learners, although \nit has been funded at levels that severely limit its effectiveness. The \nquality or even existence of services for gifted students varies widely \namong our 50 States.\n  While the Federal Government should not assume the primary \nresponsibility for funding gifted and talented education, just as \nCongress provides funding to augment State efforts to provide an \nequitable education for disadvantaged students and students with \ndisabilities, the Federal Government still has a vital national \ninterest in encouraging State efforts to fully develop the gifts and \ntalents of American youth.\n  The proposal that is in my amendment before the Senate would \nessentially charge a fee to those investing in talent from abroad and \nuse it to invest in talent for the future here at home.\n  Doesn't it make sense if we are using our educational system to bring \nstudents or workers over here to train them better--they take advantage \nof our higher education system; they take advantage of our educational \nsystem generally--wouldn't it be wise to use those resources so we can \nenhance the opportunity we have for our own gifted and talented \nstudents right here in the United States?\n  We have to put more attention on education. Now, I am offering a \nFederal program, I know, or the expansion of a Federal program, and \nfunding it in a\n\n[[Page S5035]]\n\nway that is not appreciated by those who will soon be involved in the \nimmigration bill that is going to be before us. They have asked I not \noffer this amendment, and that is why I said I would offer it and \nwithdraw it.\n  But I think this is a very important approach we must use if we are \ngoing to make adequate use of our own talented and our own gifted \nstudents right here at home--the homebred students whom we have--as \nopposed to thinking we have to rely, in the 21st century, in this great \ncountry of America, upon the talent of foreign lands.\n  Now, there is a lot of talent in foreign lands that if we can draw \nupon it, we ought to draw upon it. But the fact we have to do that, or \nwe think we are willing to submit to that sort of an approach, to \nadvance the competitiveness of our economy in this globalization we are \ninvolved in, is a sad commentary.\n  That is why I have offered this amendment. I want to say even though \nI am withdrawing it, I am doing it with the idea I am not giving up on \nthis effort. I am going to advance this effort in other appropriate \nplaces in the legislative process in the future.\n  Let me suggest, for those who maybe want to fight it, it is going to \nbe in the near future. For those who maybe like it, would they join me \nin this effort to get this job done?\n  Having emphasized competitiveness and everything involved in it, I \nwant to say my philosophy of improving education in this country is not \nrested only upon Federal programs. I think four basic things are at the \nbase of changing or improving our educational system, and they do not \ninvolve the expenditure of more money. It basically is a societal \nattitude that needs to be changed.\n  No. 1, we have to think in terms that there is nothing wrong with \nhomework. There are too many parents, too many teachers in this country \nwho think, somehow, we have to eliminate homework. Secondly, we have to \nhave the schools in this country and the parents involved think that \neducation and book learning is more important than sports; thirdly, \nthat weekends are not something just for leisure. Weekends have to be \nused for study as well. And lastly--and the one thing that is most \nimportant--parents, to a greater degree than they are presently, have \nto be involved and show interest in the education of their own kids, \nand supporting the great teachers of this country who are there doing \nboth the job of parenting as well as the job of teaching.\n  Those societal changes are going to do more to enhance education and \nthe competitiveness of our economic system than anything we can do by \npassing any Federal program. But I think we can enhance a lot of \nprograms, and this bill is a good step in that direction. I wish I had \nbeen able to convince the people on the Judiciary Committee that we \nought to advance this amendment here at this time because it is very \nassociated with the competitiveness of our society and the purposes of \nthis bill.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 914 Withdrawn\n\n  But I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, today, I join with over 60 of my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to support the prompt passage \nof the America COMPETES Act. Before I begin, I want to thank my \ncolleagues who have actively participated in developing and \ncosponsoring this legislation in the 109th Congress. In particular, I \nwish to acknowledge the work of Senator Joe Lieberman with whom I began \nthe task of developing competitiveness legislation over 2 years ago.\n  Last August, working together, in a bipartisan manner, we were able \nto bring together a bill that combined elements of the PACE Energy bill \nthat Senator Alexander, Senator Domenici, and Senator Bingaman had \nworked on, with the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act that \nSenators Stevens, Inouye, Hutchison, and I worked on. We also included \nimportant education provisions from Senator Kennedy, Senator Enzi, and \nmembers of the HELP Committee.\n  Today, I am very pleased to say the cooperative, bipartisan effort we \nundertook in the last Congress has led to the consideration of the \nAmerica COMPETES Act in this Congress. As other Members have noted, \nthis legislation focuses on three primary areas of importance: \nincreasing Federal investment in basic research; fostering science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics talent in the United States; \nand developing an innovation infrastructure. The bill reflects a good \nbalance of spending on key priorities, such as basic research and \neducation, while being sensitive to avoiding duplication among Federal \nagencies.\n  It was not easy, but we remained focused on the key recommendations \nin the ``Innovate America'' and the ``Rising Above the Gathering \nStorm'' reports. There are a lot of folks with plenty of good ideas out \nthere. By sticking to the recommendations in these two groundbreaking \nreports, however, we were able to safeguard this bill from becoming so \nlarge, unwieldy, and expensive that it could never pass the Senate. \nThis is why we have a good chance on this bill of actually passing it \nin a strong bipartisan way either today or tomorrow. One of the keys to \nthis process was getting the chairmen and ranking members of the \nCommerce Committee, Energy Committee, and HELP Committee to join the \nmajority leader and minority leader to introduce the final product.\n\n  The America COMPETES Act would double funding for the National \nScience Foundation by 2011, increase support for the National \nInstitutes of Standards and Technology, and the Department of Energy's \nOffice of Science. I am a fiscal conservative, but the dollars we \ninvest in basic research will come back to us in spades in terms of \nstimulating economic activity and helping the United States to remain \nat the forefront of global innovation.\n  Our continued investment in basic research is made more essential by \nthe actions of other nations such as China and India. Such countries \nare not sitting idly by waiting to see what we will do to remain \ncompetitive. Rather, they are undertaking ambitious efforts to expand \ntheir own research and development base at our expense. A study \nrecently highlighted by the Council on Competitiveness indicates that \nChina has surpassed the United States as the most attractive location \nfor the world's top corporate R investors to locate their R \nfacilities. Sadly, in 2006, the World Economic Forum announced our \ncountry had dropped from first to sixth place in its Global Competitive \nIndex.\n  We must address the long-term competitiveness challenges we face to \nmaintain our leadership in innovative research, and this bill will \nenable us to do so. In addition, the bill addresses the need to \nencourage more American students, from elementary school through \ngraduate school, to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, \nand mathematics.\n  Although estimates of the number of engineers, computer scientists, \nand information technology students who obtain 2-, 3-, and 4-year \ndegrees vary, there is no question that the increased focus in China \nand India on educating more of their population in these fields is \ncause for serious concern. One estimate indicates that in 2004, China \ngraduated about 350,000 engineers, computer scientists, and information \ntechnologists with 4-year degrees, while the United States graduated \nabout 140,000. Over the past 3 years, both China and India have doubled \ntheir production of 3- and 4-year degrees in the field of engineering, \nbut in the United States the production of engineers has stagnated. \nThis must change.\n  We need to aggressively encourage more American students to pursue \ncareers in these fields, especially as our current scientific workforce \nages. The America COMPETES Act would do this in part by expanding \nexisting graduate research programs and strengthening NSF's technology \ntalent program. The bill also strengthens the skills of thousands of \nmath and science teachers by establishing new undergraduate and \ngraduate training programs.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes competitive grants to States to promote \nbetter alignment of elementary and secondary education with the \nknowledge and skills needed to succeed in institutions of higher \neducation in the 21st century. It is very important we focus on \ntransforming our educational system to meet the workforce needs of \ntomorrow.\n\n[[Page S5036]]\n\nTechnological change and globalization have increased the need for our \nstudents to receive better education to remain competitive in the world \neconomy for high-skilled jobs that lead to innovative solutions, higher \nincomes, and better standards of living. This emphasis on quality \neducation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics needs to \nstart early in the course of a student's education.\n  Unfortunately, last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development released a study on education that highlights the fact \nthat while the United States invests significantly more per student on \neducation--with an $83,000 cumulative expenditure per student ages 6 \nthrough 15--than any other country in the world except for Switzerland, \nstudents from 16 other countries' students performed better, on \naverage, than American students in science. Sixteen other countries \nperformed better than American students in science. In mathematics, the \nnumbers are even more troubling. Students in 23 other nations performed \nbetter, on average, than American students did--23 other nations. This \nwas on an international standardized math exam.\n  Other countries have more scientists and mathematicians teaching \nscience and math. In the United States, we mostly have education majors \nteaching science and math. If you think about it, if your passion is \nscience and math, you have a better chance of translating that passion \nto your students. I have spoken with the presidents of our schools back \nin Nevada, at UNR and UNLV and our community college, about trying to \ntransform the way we teach our teachers in Nevada. The University of \nTexas at Austin has an innovative program called UTeach. They are \nactually taking science and math majors and teaching them to be \nteachers. The results so far have been very promising. The University \nof California system is pursuing a similar approach. Our country must \ntry to change the way we are educating science and math teachers so we \ncan inspire the next generation of Americans more effectively.\n  I am also reminded of the story the president of the Museum of \nScience in Boston, Dr. Yannis Miaoulis, shared with me last year when \ndiscussing how to foster innovation in math and science education. Dr. \nMiaoulis discussed how in school, at a young age, students learn about \nvolcanoes and make models to simulate how they work. While the \naccumulation of knowledge on volcanoes or other life science topics is \na very good thing, unfortunately, grade schools often do not dedicate \nas much time and attention to exploring science through practical \nexploration of engineering topics--for instance, how a car works. To \ndrive home his point on the need to focus more attention on engineering \nat an earlier stage in students' education, Dr. Miaoulis asked us a \nsimple question: Do we spend more time in a car or a volcano?\n  The answer is obvious, and his point is well taken. We need to think \nstrategically about how to educate and inspire the next generation of \nAmericans and increased focus on science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics is a very important part of maintaining our Nation's long-\nterm global competitiveness.\n  As the title of Thomas Friedman's popular book reminds us, in the \n21st century, the world is flat and the United States must adjust to \nthis reality in creative ways or suffer the consequences.\n  This bill before us today, the America COMPETES Act, will be a \ncritical first step forward to lay the groundwork for the kinds of \nchange and investments we need to make for our country to be \ncompetitive in this new century. The key to success on this issue is to \nmove the bipartisan bill before us, while resisting the urge to attach \nevery good idea that has come along in math, science, and technology \nareas. We were able to keep this work product fiscally responsible \nwhile addressing critical needs, and a big part of that was including \nmetrics to measure and reward successful efforts and to provide more \naccountability for existing governmental programs. As our citizens, \nbusinesses, universities, and scientists compete in the most \ninterconnected global economy in history, failure to pass a \ncompetitiveness bill now would seriously harm the economic and national \nsecurity of the United States.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will join with me in helping to pass this \ncritical bipartisan bill as soon as possible.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the importance of \nsupporting and passing the America COMPETES Act.\n  It has been 50 years since Sputnik was launched by the Soviet Union. \nThe United States was quick to react with a flurry of activity and \ninvestment to spur innovation. Its launch also had a dramatic impact on \neducation in this country. Students wanted to be the best and wanted to \nprove that the United States was a better and stronger country. Today \nthe need is just as great, but we don't have a catalyst, like Sputnik, \ndriving the need. The need is driven by our economy and companies that \nneed bright and innovative workers. This need is driven by the \ncompetition the United States now faces from across the globe.\n  Last year I was in India and saw firsthand what Thomas Friedman \ndiscusses in his book, ``The World is Flat''. It does not take long to \nfigure out that by numbers alone, India has to educate only 25 percent \nof its population to have more literate and educated people than the \ntotal population of the United States. This trip reinforced my belief \nthat we need to ramp up our efforts in the areas of education and labor \nto keep our country competitive.\n  Add to this perspective the fact that China has 20 percent of the \nworld's population and has sharply increased the proportion of its \ncollege-age population participating in higher education from 1.4 \npercent to over 20 percent in just a generation. It should not be \nsurprising that a substantial portion of our workforce now finds itself \nin direct competition for jobs with highly motivated and often well-\neducated people from around the world. Unless we pay attention to these \nfacts, this competition will only increase in the future.\n  Here are a few of the facts that I find paint a compelling picture \nand show why this legislation is needed: Business is spending billions \neach year to train new employees and remediate the educational skill \ngaps of those already in the workforce. The American workforce is \naging--77 million baby boomers are set to retire over the next several \ndecades.\n  Reading proficiency among 12th graders has declined to the point \nwhere just over one-third of them are even considered proficient \nreaders. In addition, 47 percent of those with a college degree are not \nconsidered proficient readers according to the most recent National \nAssessment of Adult Literacy. Only 68 of every 100 ninth grade students \ngraduate ``on time,'' in other words, within 4 years. America's high \nschool graduation rate is among the lowest in the industrialized world, \nand the impact on our minority students has been especially severe, \nwhere this rate hovers around 50 percent.\n  Nearly one-third of entering college freshmen need at least one \nremedial course. The United States has one of the highest college \nenrollment rates, but a college completion rate average to below \naverage among developed countries in the world.\n  Four out of every five jobs will require postsecondary education or \nthe equivalent, yet only 52 percent of Americans over the age of 25 \nhave achieved this level of education. Seventy-five percent of today's \nworkforce will need to be retrained just to keep their current jobs.\n\n  Median earnings of a high school graduate are 43 percent higher than \nthose of a nongraduate and those of a college graduate are 62 percent \nhigher than those of a high school graduate. Two-thirds of the 7 \nmillion worker gap in 2010 will be a skilled worker shortage.\n  If our students and workers are to have the best chance to succeed in \nlife and employers to remain competitive, we must ensure that everyone \nhas the opportunity to achieve academically and obtain the skills they \nneed to succeed, regardless of their background. To accomplish this, we \nneed to build, strengthen, and maintain our educational pipeline, \nbeginning in elementary school. We must also strengthen programs that \nencourage and enable citizens of all ages to enroll in postsecondary \neducation institutions and obtain or improve their knowledge and \nskills. The decisions we make about education and workforce development\n\n[[Page S5037]]\n\nwill have a dramatic impact on the economy and our society for \ngenerations to come.\n  This legislation is the product of bipartisan negotiations and input \nfrom members of 3 Senate committees--the Senate Commerce, Energy, and \nHELP Committees. Work on this legislation began last year in response \nto the ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report, the ``Innovate \nAmerica'' report, and the President's American Competitiveness \nInitiative. I want to thank all those who worked on this bill for their \nhard work and dedication and commend them for the collegial manner in \nwhich this bill was crafted.\n  This bill includes provisions that improve math, science, and \ncritical foreign language education in our Nation from elementary \nschool through graduate school. It supports improvements to teacher \npreparation, establishes stronger links between graduate schools and \nemployers, provides funding to support students trained at the doctoral \nlevel in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and \nenhances Federal programs that support students in graduate school.\n  It should come as no surprise that I particularly support the \neducation components of this bill. Education at all levels, including \nlifelong learning opportunities, is vital to ensuring that America \nretains its competitive edge in the global economy. In this global \neconomy, learning is never over and school is never out. Every American \ncan and should be part of our Nation's success. The education and \nskills of today and tomorrow's workforce were a high priority for me \neven before I became chairman and now the lead Republican of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  The America COMPETES Act is a good starting point, but we need to do \nmore. Maintaining America's competitiveness requires that all students \nhave the opportunity to continue to build their knowledge and skills. \nWe need to find ways to encourage high school students to stay in \nschool and prepare for and enter high-skill fields such as math, \nscience, engineering, health, technology, and critical foreign \nlanguages. For many, including those at the cutting-edge of science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics, acquiring a postsecondary \neducation or training will be the key to their success. Therefore, I \nremain committed to reauthorizing the Higher Education Act.\n  Individuals in the workforce often need retraining to keep up with \nour fast-paced economy. Businesses also need help in finding well-\nqualified individuals to meet their needs. The Workforce Investment Act \nand the system created to support it provide those needed services. We \nmust reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act this Congress.\n  Finally, our children need a strong foundation of knowledge to \nsucceed in both education and knowledge. The No Child Left Behind Act \nprovides funds to States and local school districts to support our \nneediest and most disadvantaged students. Those students need a hand up \nin order to succeed in the future. I look forward to working with \nChairman Kennedy to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act this year.\n  Fifty years after Sputnik, the United States is in another equally \nimportant race that will define our leadership. This race is fueled by \ninnovation, education, and skills. Its success is measured by jobs and \nprosperity for American families. It is a race we cannot afford to \nlose.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the passage of the America COMPETES \nAct.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the America \nCOMPETES Act. I am pleased to join Senators Reid and McConnell, \ntogether with Senators Bingaman, Alexander, Inouye, Stevens, Ensign, \nKennedy, Enzi and a majority of the Senate, in this bipartisan effort.\n  I particularly commend my colleague from Nevada, Senator Ensign, for \nhis foresight and leadership on innovation and competitiveness issues. \nBeginning in 2005, I started working together with Senator Ensign on \nthe National Innovation Act to build a new century of progress and \nprosperity for our Nation by spurring a new wave of American \ninnovation. With his leadership in the Commerce Committee, Senator \nEnsign and I supported a bipartisan approach, focused on talent, \ninvestment, and infrastructure, to sustain and enhance U.S. science and \ntechnology leadership for the future. The National Innovation Act \naddressed a number of the most critical issues involving technology \nleadership in the United States, realizing the critical need for \nincreased Federal support for basic research.\n  Senator Ensign and I also worked closely together on the National \nInnovation Education Act. The intent of that bill was to enhance our \nscience and technology talent base and to improve national \ncompetitiveness through strengthened education initiatives. Our bill \nproposed initiatives spanning across the science education spectrum to \nimprove quality instruction and access to learning for all students.\n  I am pleased that the America COMPETES Act addresses many of the \napproaches to science research and education proposed by Senator Ensign \nand I in these measures in addition to many of the initiatives put \nforth by Senators Bingaman, Alexander, and others in the PACE bills. In \nlarge part, these bills sought to incorporate recommendations from the \nNational Academies' report ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' and \n``Innovate America'' from the Council on Competitiveness.\n  In this bill we seek to address the challenge of keeping the United \nStates competitive in the global economy. Innovation, from the \ndevelopment of the Internet to the sequencing of the human genome, \nstimulates economic growth and improves the quality of life and health \nfor all Americans. Through our investments and leadership in basic \nresearch and innovation, we ensure that our children and grandchildren \nwill continue to have the unprecedented prosperity and opportunity that \nwe enjoy today. We also have high expectations that science and \nengineering will solve essential worldwide needs from the mitigation of \nnatural disasters to the development of alternative energy sources.\n  This act recognizes that the Nation depends upon the development and \nthe productivity of highly trained people to generate these \ninnovations. It is disconcerting that only 29 percent of Americans \nbelieve the United States has the most innovative economy in the world. \nNearly half choose China or Japan instead. Why? The No. 1 reason cited \nby Americans is their belief that other countries are more committed to \ntheir education, their youth, or their schools. In fact, tests show \nU.S. students are falling behind other developed nations in math and \nscience. We must restore confidence in our education system and ensure \nit is second to none.\n  For example, we need to engage the Nation's top universities to lead \nsome of their best and brightest students, especially in science, \ntechnology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, fields, into successful \nteaching careers. In this bill we stimulate partnerships for college \nmath, science, and engineering departments to work with teacher \ndevelopment programs. These programs will increase the supply of \ncertified, knowledgeable teachers in areas critical to meeting \nAmerica's needs, giving us a greater opportunity to improve student \ninterest and achievement in STEM areas.\n  We know that new teachers in STEM classrooms across the country need \nsupport and mentoring from knowledgeable, established teachers. This \nbill supports programs for existing teachers seeking to enhance their \ncontent knowledge, teaching skills, and leadership in STEM and foreign \nlanguages.\n  We cannot wait for students to reach college to ensure that they are \nprepared for the future. It is troubling that many students with their \nnewly obtained high school diplomas find themselves ill-equipped for \ncollege or the workforce. It is time to ensure that high schools \nprepare their students for the future. To do this right, States must \nstart aligning what children learn starting in kindergarten, or \nearlier, to meet the evolving higher education and business needs for \nthe 21st century and beyond.\n  High-quality data systems are also critical to improve schools and \nstudent outcomes. Accountability for high school graduation numbers and \ndropout rates is important to address education reform in our high \nschools. States and schools need data systems\n\n[[Page S5038]]\n\nto trace successful educational outcomes back to specific programs, \ncoursework, and interventions. They need to know what works and what \ndoesn't work. I am pleased that this legislation contains many of the \ncomponents of a bill I introduced last year, the College Pathways Act, \nto improve data systems and alignment.\n  The National Science Foundation is the principal agency sustaining \nbasic research across all science and engineering fields. Basic \nresearch outcomes have led to many important innovations, stimulating \neconomic growth and improving the quality of life for all Americans. \nNSF focuses on the areas of discovery, learning, and in building the \ncountry's research infrastructure and world-class facilities. These \nareas line up directly with our three primary areas in this act: \nincreased research investment, STEM education, and innovative \ninfrastructure. It is critical that we develop and support each of \nthese: the people, their ideas and the large-scale tools needed for \ndiscovery and innovation.\n\n  To encourage more students to enter technical professions, this \nlegislation increases Federal support for STEM graduate fellowships and \ntrainee programs by expanding the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship \nProgram and the Integrated Graduate Education and Research Traineeship \nProgram by a total of 2,500 students.\n  The America COMPETES Act further addresses the issue of improving \ntalent across scientific disciplines by expanding the existing STEM \nTalent Expansion Program, STEP, to the scope originally intended. The \nSTEP, or Tech Talent Program, which I first proposed in 2001 as part of \nthe Technology Talent Act, provides competitive grants to undergraduate \ninstitutions to develop new methods of increasing the number of \nstudents earning degrees in science, math, and engineering.\n  The Department of Energy's Office of Science is the principal Federal \nagency for research in high energy physics, nuclear physics, and fusion \nenergy sciences. This legislation puts the Office of Science on a \ndoubling track, over 10 years. We create important educational \nopportunities through Centers of Excellence in Mathematics and Science. \nThese centers bring together our premier National Laboratories as \npartners with high-need high schools. National Laboratories also will \nhost summer teacher institutes and will provide expert assistance to \nteachers at specialty schools in math and science.\n  The bill also creates an Innovation Acceleration Research Program to \nstimulate transformational research by setting a goal for Federal \nresearch agencies to allocate 8 percent of their current R budgets to \nbreakthrough research--the kind of research that gave us fiber optics, \nthe Internet, and countless other technologies relied on every day in \nthis country and around the world. We anticipate this funding will be \nused for ``grand challenges'' and other high-risk/high-reward research \nthat will expand the frontiers of discovery and innovation.\n  It is time once more for the Nation to focus on the health and \ndirection of scientific research. Late in 1944, President Roosevelt \ncalled on a leading science and engineering advocate, Vannevar Bush, to \nreport on how the Nation should prepare in the post-World War II era to \ndeal with the ``new frontiers of the mind [that] are before us'' and to \n``create a fuller and more fruitful employment and a fuller and more \nfruitful life.'' The report, ``Science--The Endless Frontier,'' led to \nthe development of the National Science Foundation. We call on the \nPresident to issue a new report on key research and technology \nchallenges based on a national science and technology summit of leaders \nfrom labor, industry, academia, government, and elsewhere. The \nPresident will also establish a Council on Innovation and \nCompetitiveness to, among other things, assess R investment and \naddress future areas needed to maintain the United States as a world \nleader in research and technological innovation.\n  We must continue to encourage the groundbreaking experimentation and \nlonger-term outlook that made this country great. I am pleased to join \nmy colleagues in this bipartisan effort to address the science, \ntechnology, and education needs that will fuel innovation and continue \nto drive American growth and prosperity. I urge my colleagues to join \nus and support passage of the America COMPETES Act.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, there is concern that America is losing its \ncompetitive leadership. I am proud to cosponsor the America COMPETES \nAct because it proposes a meaningful response to that loss of \nleadership, and I compliment the bill managers on the bipartisan manner \nin which the Senate is addressing this issue. America COMPETES is a \nstrong piece of legislation, but I wish to propose amendments that I \nbelieve will strengthen this legislation in several areas.\n  As our Nation becomes more diverse, scientists, engineers, and \ntechnology professionals continue to be recruited from a narrowing \nsegment of our population. If we were able to increase the \nparticipation of underrepreseneted groups, including women, to a level \nreflective of their representation in the population, we would diminish \nthe workforce issues that restrict our economic progress and generate a \npool of talent that could refresh our ability to innovate. If we do not \ntap the diversity of our Nation as a competitive strength, we will \ndiminish our capacity to innovate. Full participation by all segments \nof our populace would do more than just increase the number of workers \nin high technology fields; full participation would bring fresh \nperspectives and inventive solutions.\n  To increase participation, I have offered several amendments to \nAmerica COMPETES. The first establishes a mentoring program to support \nwomen and underrepresented groups as they progress through education \nprograms being proposed at the Department of Energy. Mentoring is an \neffective means for experienced scientists to provide professional \nassistance and advice to developing scientists, and such a program \nwould ensure the success of these education programs. I also propose \nthat women and minority scientists and engineers be represented and \nconsulted as strategies are developed to increase America's \ncompetitiveness. This inclusion should occur at the proposed National \nScience and Technology Summit, on the President's Council on Innovation \nand Competitiveness, and elsewhere. If the concerns of diverse groups \nof technology professionals are not heard, it will be too easy to \noverlook the advantages these groups can bring to the innovation \nlandscape.\n  I have also proposed that, to profit from the strength of our \ndiversity, we must start with America's young students. Summer is a \ntime when, as a result of summer learning loss, young students may lose \nseveral months in math skills. The summer learning loss is greatest for \nchildren living in poverty. Summer programs combat this loss, \naccelerate learning, and can serve to close the achievement gap in \nmathematics and problem-solving that currently robs us of the talents \nof too many children. I have introduced an amendment that supports \nsummer learning opportunities, with curricula that emphasize \nmathematics and problem solving, aligned to the standards of school-\nyear classes.\n  Finally, I propose that one of the major challenges facing us is an \nissue we understand on the basis of science; an issue that can be \nsolved, at least partially, through technology; an issue that has the \npotential to greatly affect our competitiveness. It is an issue \noffering both challenges and great opportunities. Therefore, I am \nproposing an amendment to create a Climate Change Education Program to \nbroaden our understanding of climate change. The program would \nemphasize information to help us comprehend climate change and to \npromote implementation of new technologies that would ensure our place \nas an international leader, willing to use science to understand our \nworld, willing to apply technologies to address the serious challenges \nfacing us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these amendments.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, at a moment of profound change for our \ncountry, as the global economy grows more interdependent, the reach of \ntechnology more vast, and the consequences more important for future \ngenerations of Americans, I am proud to support the America COMPETES \nAct as an original cosponsor and proud to have been able to include \nseveral of my proposals in the final bill. I am also\n\n[[Page S5039]]\n\npleased to see that partnership--not partisanship--ruled the day.\n  The challenge is to achieve the promise while avoiding the perils of \nthis moment.\n  Modern technology is making the American workforce more and more \nproductive--while making it increasingly possible for employers to hire \nthe most skilled workers no matter where in the world they live. Our \nyoung people see so many promising new fields and avenues--but too many \nAmerican students, even some graduates of college, are not equipped \nwith the skills to compete, especially when it comes to participation \nin challenging math and science fields.\n  That is why this bill is so important: education will help us \novercome these obstacles while opening the doors to new opportunities.\n  America's global economic competitiveness will rest more and more on \nthe back of our education system, and the scientists, engineers, and \ninventors that the system produces--but today that back is breaking.\n  The United States currently ranks 21st out of 40 industrialized \nnations in the largest and most comprehensive educational study to \ndate. China produces far more engineers than the United States each \nyear. Fewer well-educated scientists and engineers means fewer \ninventions, fewer high-tech exports, and fewer jobs for Americans.\n  And we are trying to compete with one hand behind our back: half our \npopulation disproportionately avoids math and science. Women and \nminorities are routinely underrepresented in these fields.\n  The National Academy of Sciences, NAS, outlined solutions to these \nand other challenges America will face as we contend with other \ncounties in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. \nTheir report, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and \nEmploying America for a Brighter Economic Future,'' gave us a roadmap \nto avoid this storm. The America COMPETES Act will implement these \nrecommendations.\n  For example, this legislation would provide funding to increase the \nnumber of teachers serving high-need schools who are qualified to teach \nadvanced, college level courses in math and science. It also supplies \ngrants to community colleges to offer training to allow women to enter \nhigher paying technical jobs.\n  This act also provides new incentives for math and science research. \nThe bill doubles the current funding for the National Science \nFoundation, NSF.\n  I am also pleased this legislation includes two of my amendments. The \nfirst asks the National Academy of Sciences to collect and disseminate \n``Promising Practices'' in the areas of math and science education, as \nwell as techniques proven to help teachers improve their instructional \nskills. Many States across the country are doing an amazing job of \nraising their State standards, while others are watering them down.\n  The NAS report outlined the need for consistency in math and science \neducation as one of the important recommendations in their report. That \nis why I introduced the Math and Science Consistency Act which \ninstructs the National Academy of Sciences to create voluntary goals \nfor learning in the areas of math and science education.\n  I thank everyone involved with this package, in particular Senator \nBingaman, for working with me to include elements of my legislation \ninto the America COMPETES Act.\n  If we want to truly prepare our students to compete, then it is \nespecially important to look at successful models of math and science \neducation and place this information in the hands of our math and \nscience teachers. These promising practices will help all States \nimprove their math and science education.\n  It is imperative that we figure out what is working and reproduce it. \nThe math and science education our children receive today is an \ninvestment in the economy of tomorrow.\n  I also worked alongside Senator Schumer to include a provision that \nwill create two new fellowship programs within the National Science \nFoundation. These new fellowship programs are modeled after the highly \nsuccessful Newton Fellowship and Newton Master Teacher Programs in New \nYork City.\n  Through Math for America, the Newton Fellowship Program has brought a \ncadre of talented professionals to teach math in NYC school. \nAdditionally, the Newton Master Teacher Program trains current math \nteachers who demonstrate solid math knowledge to become leaders in \ntheir schools through mentoring and professional development. I am \npleased our amendment will allow these successful models to be \nreplicated around the country.\n  Once implemented, the first fellowship program will be available for \nprofessionals who possess advanced math and science skills. It will \nallow professionals from the private and public sectors to apply to \nbecome ``NSF Teaching Fellows.'' If selected, these individuals would \nreceive a scholarship to attend a 1-year master's program that results \nin certification. The fellows would then commit to teach for 4 years in \na high-need school. This is the commonsense approach we need in order \nto build a pipeline of math and science teachers who are experts in \ntheir fields.\n  The second fellowship program entitled the ``NSF Master Teaching \nFellows'' Program, will allow current teachers who hold a master's in \nmath or science to apply and serve as leaders in a high-need school. In \nexchange for receiving a stipend, these fellows would commit to \nmentoring their peers, developing curricula, and assisting in \nprofessional development activities for 5 years.\n  I am pleased that we are making a commitment to expanding the \npipeline of math and science teachers, and this amendment is our first \nstep in that expansion. I thank Math for America and the Newton Fellows \nand Newton Master Teachers for all they do every day to improve math \neducation for students in New York City and around the country.\n  The America COMPETES Act is a comprehensive strategy to help America \ncompete and win in the global marketplace. As cochair of the Senate \nManufacturing Caucus, I am pleased that this legislation makes a \nsignificant investment in the Manufacturing Extension Partnership \nProgram that is critical to sustaining our nation's manufacturing base.\n  I am also pleased that this bill includes a new energy research \nproposal modeled on DARPA. This is an idea that I first put forward at \nthe Clinton Global Initiative in 2005, and introduced legislation on in \nJanuary of 2006. My legislation would create a new agency to sponsor a \ndiverse portfolio of projects that will: Increase national security by \nsignificantly reducing petroleum and imported fuels consumption; \nsignificantly improve the efficiency of electricity use and the \nreliability of the electricity system; and significantly reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Section 2005 of the America Competes Act \nmirrors many of these provisions. However, section 2005 does not \ninclude provisions from my legislation that provide additional \nmanagement flexibility, and that I believe are important to the success \nof this new agency. In addition, section 2005 does not authorize a \nspecific level of funding. I recognize that there are funding \nconstraints, but I think that a much bigger, bolder investment is \nneeded. So I am pleased that section 2005 is included in the bill, but \nI hope that we can make improvements during conference with the House.\n  We must do what is best for our children and their economic future. \nWhen Americans have the tools for success, America succeeds and that is \nwhat this bipartisan legislation can help us achieve.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to address S. 761, the \nAmerica COMPETES Act. This is an effort to help prepare our children to \nenter the fields of math, science, engineering, and technology and the \nultimate goal is to keep the United States at the forefront of these \nfields on the increasingly competitive global stage.\n  I congratulate Senators Lamar Alexander and Jeff Bingaman for posing \nthe questions they did to the National Academies of Sciences, \nEngineering, and Medicine and for working the panel's recommendations \ninto legislation. And I agree with the findings that basically say if \nwe don't do a better job of teaching our children in the areas of math, \nscience, and technology, other countries will surpass us in a way that \nwe might never overcome.\n\n[[Page S5040]]\n\n  I commend the Academies' full report to all of you, and I think they \nare on the right track. We need to take some significant and \ncomprehensive steps to better prepare our young people to enter the \nInformation Age workforce. It is critical to our Nation's future and it \nis critical that we approve this legislation and start preparing our \nchildren of today for the future of tomorrow.\n  And it is critically important we start preparing for tomorrow today.\n  In a 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, \nfourth graders in three countries--Chinese Taipei, Japan, and \nSingapore--outperformed U.S. fourth graders in both mathematics and \nscience. In the new world marketplace, the United States will have to \nmake an even greater effort to keep our high standard of living, to \nremain competitive.\n  People in India, China, Singapore, Finland, and Ireland know very \nwell that brainpower is universal, it is valuable, and it is the secret \nweapon to producing good jobs and a good quality of life.\n  Given that physical barriers such as distance have been torn down by \nthe World Wide Web and the benefits of free trade, our foreign \ncompetitors know there is no reason that they can't have a standard of \nliving more like the United States. So they are working hard to develop \nbetter trained citizens and create their own stream of discoveries.\n  The challenge of our generation is to change these troubling trends. \nOur commitment needs to be redoubled.\n  I am a great believer in the transforming power of education. Coming \nfrom Cuba at age 15, not knowing the language of this country, not \nknowing how my future would unfold, I relied heavily on the power of \neducation to survive.\n  My father was the first person in our family to earn a college \ndegree, and he would always remind us that the only thing the \nCommunists could not take from him was his education. That concept of \nan education became a valued treasure in our family. So that is why I \nworry so greatly about the education of our next generation.\n  According to recent statistics compiled by the U.S. Department of \nEducation, our nationwide graduation rate in public schools is about 74 \npercent. That means one out of every four children who starts out as a \nfreshman, does not get a high school degree. In Florida, the graduation \nrate drops to 71 percent. Nationally, if you look at young people \nbetween the ages of 16 and 24 who don't have a high school diploma, the \nnumbers are alarming: Hispanics, 25 percent, Blacks, 11 percent, \nWhites, 6 percent.\n  These are rates that have been virtually static over the last decade. \nThey forecast a tragic pattern that we must change, for the good of \nthese children, but also as a matter of national competitiveness in a \nshrinking but competitive world.\n  We as a country are falling behind. We are losing the opportunity to \nremain competitive on a global scale unless we address these \npercentages and change them.\n  So when we talk about improving education, we, as individuals, \nparents, community leaders and elected officials, need to focus on \nquality education.\n  We need to encourage our young people to seek that diploma and \ndegree, and we need to help those who might otherwise not have access \nto a higher education.\n  And we need to remember that America has been the global leader in \ninnovative technologies, and as those technologies grow and expand and \nproliferate throughout the world, we have to become even more prepared \nto compete in a global market.\n  All young Americans, no matter their race, creed, or ethnicity \ndeserve the opportunity to gain not just an education, but the best \nquality education. This is our obligation and our national imperative.\n  We are a great nation, but that greatness will not be enjoyed by the \nnext generations if we fail to properly educate that next generation. \nThat is why the America COMPETES Act is so very critical.\n  This bill will improve teacher training in math and science by \ncreating summer programs hosted by the National Science Foundation.\n  This bill will increase the support for Advanced Placement Programs \nto expand access for low income students so they might perform better \nin college preparatory courses.\n  Over the next decade, this bill doubles the investment in basic \nresearch at our Nation's leading Federal scientific research facilities \nso that we can take research out of the classrooms and put it into \nreal-world applications.\n  That last point is equally important as the previous two. Yes, we \nshould expand the math, science and engineering training for teachers, \nbut we also need to focus now on the kinds of research that will \nelevate the production of technological innovation.\n  I am certain all of us come into contact with a computer every day, \nand it is a safe bet that many of those computers have an Intel chip \ninside.\n  One of the people who worked on the Academies report, Craig Barrett, \nthe chairman of Intel, points out that 90 percent of the products his \ncompany delivers on December 31 did not even exist on January 1 of that \nsame year.\n  That is an amazing pace of change. Handheld computers, Blackberrys, \nflash drives, the iPhone--these kinds of advancements create \nopportunity and demand for human capital. Human capital can harness \nscience and opportunity--and keep our Nation at the cutting edge of \nglobal innovation.\n  So the challenge is clear we need to ensure our young people have the \ntools they need to harness their brainpower and keep up with the rate \nof innovation. That's going to take a greater commitment to public \neducation in the areas of math, science, and engineering.\n  And I can tell you that if our children can't, won't, or don't take \nadvantage of these opportunities, the children of other countries will. \nOur task is to commit to their success and this legislation does just \nthat.\n  To conclude, I will say that the Federal Government alone will not \nsolve these problems, and I don't believe Congress has a magic bullet \nto address all--or even most--of the challenges mentioned here today.\n  I do, however, believe we can all support the legislation before us \ntoday. The report by the National Academies panel is a fair and \nrealistic assessment of how we ought to proceed.\n  Who could argue that we shouldn't look at ways to increase the pool \nof qualified math and science teachers, strengthen the Nation's \ncommitment to research, make the United States the most attractive \nplace to the Nation's and world's brightest minds, and ensure we \nprotect intellectual property while allowing the freedom to innovate? \nThese issues deserve the attention of our Nation.\n  I know--working together--we can and will adopt initiatives that will \nprovide the best education for our future generations.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in today's global economy, continued \nprogress in math, science, and engineering, and the transfer of this \nknowledge, is vital if the U.S. is to maintain its competitiveness and \nkeep good-paying, cutting-edge jobs here at home. New products, \nprocesses, industries and future employment opportunities depend on the \nadvances in research and their movement into the marketplace.\n  Missouri is a leader in a field of science that hardly existed 20 \nyears ago--biotechnology. And I want Missouri to continue to be a \nleader in producing the best math and science minds in the country. How \ndo we do that? One of our toughest educational challenges is helping \nour young people perform better in science and math.\n  We know that America's fourth graders and eighth graders are \nperforming above the international average in math and science. But \nwhen they get to high school, they fall behind.\n  We need to do more. That is why I am pleased to support the America \nCOMPETES Act, which strengthens educational opportunities in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics from elementary through \ngraduate school, with a particular focus on math and science teachers. \nIn addition, this bill makes a bold Federal investment in basic science \nresearch at the National Science Foundation, the DOE Office of Science, \nNASA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n  As many of you know, I have been a strong supporter of NSF over the\n\n[[Page S5041]]\n\nyears. NSF plays a critical role in the economic, scientific and \nintellectual growth of this Nation. It is one of our primary tools in \nmeeting the global challenges of the 21st century by pushing the \nboundaries of scientific research and technology. NSF's work will give \nus a better insight into the world around us. This work will grow our \neconomy and speed innovation, improving the quality of life for all \npeople.\n  NSF's impact over the past half century has been monumental, \nespecially in the field of medical technologies and research. The \ninvestments have also spawned not only new products, but also entire \nindustries, such as biotechnology, Internet providers, e-commerce, and \ngeographic information systems. Medical technologies such as magnetic \nresonance imaging, ultrasound, digital mammography and genomic mapping \ncould not have occurred, and cannot now improve to the next level of \nproficiency, without underlying knowledge from NSF-supported work in \nbiology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, engineering, and computer \nsciences.\n  New NSF support for research in nanotechnology, high-speed computing, \nplant genome research, biocomplexity, and cognitive neuroscience will \nfurther advance the state of technological change and improve our \nquality of life through creation of new products, a better \nunderstanding of how humans behave, and how our ecological systems can \nsurvive.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Government has not always adequately \nsupported NSF and the physical sciences with the dollars it deserves. \nWhile the Congress and the current and past Administration has strongly \nsupported the life sciences, the physical sciences have been left \nbehind. This has resulted in a major funding disparity between the life \nsciences and the physical sciences. This funding imbalance is alarming \nbecause it directly jeopardizes our Nation's ability to lead the world \nin scientific innovation. Further, we jeopardize the work of the \nNational Institutes of Health because we are undermining the physical \nsciences, which provide the underpinning for medical technological \nadvances.\n  Inadequate funding for NSF also hurts our economy and the creation of \ngood jobs. In recent years, there has been an outcry of outsourcing \njobs to other countries. And, our high-tech industry has been \nstruggling to fill high-tech positions with American born workers. The \nbest remedy to this issue is not protectionism but investing in the \neducation and skills of our future workforce. This means better math \nand science education and technological skills, such as computer \nliteracy. This is also a major part of NSF's mission.\n  My good friend Senator Barbara Mikulski and I, along with many of my \nother colleagues, were pioneers in the fight to double the funding of \nNSF. Thanks to this effort we increased funding for NSF significantly; \nhowever, we fell short of our goal to double funding. The bill before \nus today provides an important opportunity to refocus attention on this \ncritical goal and I am pleased that this bill puts us on the path to \ndouble NSF funding. It is critical that doubling funding for NSF remain \none of our highest priorities and as a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I hope we can do our part.\n  Future job and economic growth in the areas of health care, life \nsciences, defense, agriculture and transportation is directly related \nto scientific advancement. For these reasons it is important to support \nthe America COMPETES Act and make an important investment in the \neconomic security and growth of our country.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 761, the America \nCOMPETES Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation, which takes important steps to make sure we are preparing \nour young people to be competitive and working to secure our Nation's \nfuture in a global economy.\n  That need has never been more urgent than today, when globalization \nand technology are tearing down the walls of geography, language, and \nincome. Globalization has brought increased educational, technological, \nand societal advances to regions that only once dreamed of innovation. \nToday, as nations abroad are gaining a competitive edge, our younger \ngenerations are at risk of falling behind.\n  For a nation with endless resources at its fingertips, it is \ninexplicable that the United States continues to fall far below other \nnations when it comes to higher achievement. Yet this is the reality. \nOn international assessments, our young people score below the average \ncompared to other developed nations on math tests. Even when we just \nlook at the highest achieving students, the United States still ranks \nnear the bottom.\n  In the global race to have the most trained, highly-skilled, best \nprepared workforce, we are losing ground. And we are especially losing \nground in fields that are the source of innovation and technology, \nwhich will increasingly become a key sector of the global economy.\n  Fewer of our college students are pursuing degrees in math, science \nand engineering, and if those trends continue, by 2010 more than 90 \npercent of all our world's scientists and engineers would be living \noutside the United States.\n  We cannot sit back and expect that we will continue to be at the top \nwhen it comes to global achievement. Where other countries are \nstrengthening their education systems, we are not keeping up. We must \nregain that ground by investing in our younger generations. We must \nprovide quality opportunities for young people now so that they can \ngain the science, math, and technological skills they need in an \nemerging global marketplace. We stand at a critical juncture, and how \nwe proceed will determine the future for generations to come.\n  That is why this legislation is so critical--it is a commitment that \nwe will do what is necessary to strengthen our Nation's future. This \nlegislation will both bolster our research and development capabilities \nand better equip our young people to become the future leaders that \nthis Nation needs. The America COMPETES Act will strengthen educational \nopportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics from \nelementary through graduate school. It will create grants for master's \ndegrees in math, science, and foreign language and establish programs \nto improve math instruction for elementary and secondary students. This \nlegislation also calls for substantially increasing funding for the \nNational Science Foundation, doubling basic research funding over the \nnext decade, and the creation of a national science and technology \nsummit.\n  I am pleased this bill includes provisions I introduced last year to \nincrease the participation of women and minorities in science. \nSpecifically, this bill directs the Energy Department to increase the \nnumbers of women and minorities in science and technology fields at all \neducation levels--from kindergarten through the graduate level--and \nestablishes a new outreach program for underrepresented minorities in \ngrades K-12 to encourage careers in science and technology. While \nopportunities in these fields are becoming more accessible to all \nstudents, women and minorities are still sorely underrepresented in the \nsciences. It is my hope this legislation will help us to close that gap \nand ensure that young people of all backgrounds have the opportunities \nthey deserve.\n  This bill also contains an initiative that would authorize \npartnerships between high-need or rural school districts, higher \neducation institutions and the private sector, with the goal of \nrevitalizing the high school science labs in those schools. This will \nhelp schools purchase scientific equipment, renovate laboratory space, \ndesign new experiments or methods of integrating the laboratory with \ntraditional lectures, and provide professional development for high \nschool lab teachers. This provision--which I introduced last year as a \nseparate bill--will improve the science learning experience for \nstudents in low-income and rural schools across the country.\n\n  As someone who was raised to believe there were no boundaries to what \nI could achieve, I know first hand that a strong education is the key \nto success. I was not constricted by the income my parents made, or by \nthe neighborhood I lived in, but only my ability and my determination. \nWith the assistance of the Federal Government, I graduated from college \nand law school, and had a world of opportunity open to me. I want every \nyoung person to have the\n\n[[Page S5042]]\n\nchance to achieve their dreams an fulfill their God-given potential. \nThis bill will undoubtedly help countless young people reach that goal.\n  The time has come to make a robust, national commitment to the \neducation of our youth at all levels, from kindergarten through \ngraduate school and beyond. We cannot expect our country to be \nadequately prepared unless we are making the necessary investments in \nall of our students.\n  Our Nation faces great challenges to meeting the demands of global \ninnovation and competition. A nation that is united in its purpose can \nanswer that challenge, as we have so many times throughout our history. \nJust as an entire generation was once inspired to dream new dreams of \nreaching space, and a nation launched a bold investment in science and \ntechnology that put a man on the Moon, so can we lead a generation to \nbe the next great leaders and innovators. This legislation will help \nachieve that goal. It will strengthen not only the competitive future \nof our young people but of our Nation. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for ensuring \nthe ongoing competitiveness of U.S. capital markets, our economy and \nAmerican workers. I have served on the Banking Committee since my first \nday in the Senate 26 years ago. During my tenure on the committee, and \nnow as its chairman, preserving and strengthening America's preeminent \nposition as the world's leading financial center has been among my \nprimary objectives.\n  Based on that experience, I would like to share what I believe are \nthree important considerations that should guide us in any discussion \nof how to make America's capital markets more competitive.\n  First, we must remain mindful that our markets remain the largest, \nmost liquid, and most transparent on the planet.\n  Second, the current and continued success of those markets depends on \nthe presence of effective, efficient legal rules that protect \ninvestors; as such, we should resist the temptation to engage in a \nregulatory race to the bottom as a rationale to stay on top. Members of \nthe Senate resisted that temptation yesterday when they voted, \noverwhelmingly, to defeat an amendment that would have significantly \nweakened a critical investor protection provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley \nAct. I want to thank the sponsors of this amendment, Senator Schumer \nand Senator Crapo, for their vote opposing yesterday's amendment. In \ndoing so, they affirmed their support for an efficient and effective \nregulatory structure and ongoing efforts at the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to lower the cost of compliance for small businesses.\n  Third the success of our markets also depends on our Nation's ability \nto educate, train, and recruit the kind of talented and driven people \nwho can compete and win in the global economy.\n  We should do all we can to promote the ongoing competitiveness of \nAmerica's capital markets. Our Nation's ability to strengthen security, \ncreate opportunity, and expand prosperity for every citizen depends in \nlarge part on the success of our capital markets and of our financial \nservices sector generally. Maintaining the preeminence of capital \nmarkets will not be easy. It will require honest and thoughtful \nleadership. As chairman of the Banking Committee, I look forward to \nfurthering the dialogue on this important issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the following remarks \non competitiveness that I recently delivered to the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce in March be inserted into the Record immediately following my \nstatement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[Prepared Remarks of Senator Dodd to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Mar. \n                               14, 2007]\n\nFirst Annual Capital Markets Summit: Securing America's Competitiveness\n\n       Thank you, Tom, for that kind introduction. And thank you \n     all for this opportunity to speak with you this morning. It's \n     hard to believe that ten years have passed since Tom became \n     President and CEO of the Chamber. He has done an outstanding \n     job of leading this remarkable organization.\n       I am proud to have had Tom's and the Chamber's support on \n     some of the most important pieces of legislation with which I \n     have been associated. Laws like the Private Securities \n     Litigation Reform Act; the Y2K litigation reform act; the \n     Class Action Fairness Act; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which \n     has helped bring our financial services sector into the 21st \n     century; and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, which in the \n     aftermath of 9/11 has played a crucial role in keeping our \n     economy strong.\n       In all seriousness, these pieces of legislation represent \n     hard-fought changes that have benefited the American economy \n     and in so doing have also made our Nation a more hopeful and \n     prosperous place for all.\n       They represent what can happen when people decide to reject \n     partisanship and embrace partnership to create positive \n     change for America. It is once again that sense of \n     partnership that has brought us together today.\n       America in these early years of the 21st century is by some \n     measures doing well. But I defy anyone to say that we cannot \n     do better. Wherever I go--from boardrooms to class rooms to \n     living rooms--Americans are deeply concerned about our \n     nation's future. And I share that concern.\n       We are at a critical moment in our nation's history. Our \n     leadership in the world has been achieved over a period of \n     two and a quarter centuries by the vision and sacrifice of \n     generations of patriots and statesmen. U.S. leadership is \n     today being questioned and in some ways squandered as it has \n     never been before. The stakes for all of us as Americans \n     could not, in my view, be higher.\n       The topic of today's gathering is the future of America's \n     capital markets. But in reality, we are all here out of a \n     shared concern about the future of America itself. The issue \n     before us today presents an opportunity for us all--Democrats \n     and Republicans, private entrepreneurs and public leaders--to \n     come together to have a serious discussion about ways to move \n     our country forward.\n       The Capital Markets Commission report is a thoughtful \n     document that makes an important contribution to the debate \n     about the future of our Nation's capital markets.\n       I commend the Chamber, the Commission and its co-chairs--my \n     good friend Bill Daley and Arthur Culvahouse--for \n     highlighting some of the key challenges facing our capital \n     markets. I look forward to analyzing the report's \n     recommendations in greater depth and examining them in the \n     Senate Banking Committee at a hearing I intend to hold in the \n     coming weeks.\n       I have served on the Banking Committee since my first day \n     in the Senate. No one now in the Senate has served there any \n     longer. As a member of that Committee, and now as its \n     Chairman, I have had one overarching objective: to preserve \n     and strengthen America's preeminent position as the world's \n     leading financial center.\n       That objective is so crucial because our nation's ability \n     to strengthen security, create opportunity, and expand \n     prosperity for every citizen depends in large part on the \n     success of our capital markets and of our financial services \n     sector generally.\n       My service on the Banking Committee has provided me with a \n     tremendous opportunity to observe, study, and, I hope, \n     strengthen our capital markets. Based on that experience, I \n     would like to share what I believe are three important \n     considerations that should guide us in any discussion of how \n     to make America's capital markets more competitive.\n       First, we should keep in mind that, as we speak, America's \n     capital markets remain the most dominant in the world. That \n     is not empty rhetoric. It is a demonstrable fact.\n       For example, the total amount of financial stock in the \n     U.S.--equities, bonds, loans, and deposits--is more than six \n     times the amount of the U.K.'s, more than double Japan's, and \n     four times that of the other Asian capital markets.\n       America's dominance is also proven by the market \n     capitalization of the major exchanges. Yes, IPO and trading \n     activity on overseas exchanges has been growing. I am very \n     aware of that, but the market capitalization of the major \n     U.S. exchanges dwarfs that of their overseas competitors. The \n     market cap of the New York Stock Exchange is $15 trillion \n     dollars. That is 15 times the value of the Shanghai Stock \n     Exchange, four times the value of the London Stock Exchange, \n     and three times the value of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n       Much of the growth in capital is coming from overseas \n     investors--and according to some measures, in record amounts. \n     The most recent Economic Report of the President found that \n     foreign investment in U.S. financial stock such as U.S. \n     Treasury securities, corporate stocks, and corporate and \n     other private bonds totaled $5.7 trillion in 2005--the \n     highest level in nearly thirty years.\n       In addition, 34 foreign IPOs listed on U.S. exchanges last \n     year--the highest percentage of foreign IPOs in the U.S. in \n     20 years.\n       It is worth pointing out that all of this growth has been \n     achieved despite the 2001 recession, the 9/11 terrorist \n     attacks, a string of corporate scandals, and the ongoing \n     lengthy, bloody, and costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       So, despite the bearishness of some, the United States \n     remains the preeminent destination for global capital.\n       We're hearing a lot these days about London, and Hong Kong, \n     and Shanghai. But the fact is, the U.S. capital markets \n     remain the largest, most liquid, most innovative, most \n     resilient, and most lucrative in the world.\n       And on my watch, as Chairman of the Senate Banking \n     Committee, I intend to keep them that way. Which leads me to \n     the second consideration that must guide us: our\n\n[[Page S5043]]\n\n     capital markets are strong precisely because of--not \n     despite--the legal architecture within which those markets \n     have been conceived and grown.\n       That is probably not a particularly surprising observation \n     from someone who has helped to build that architecture. But \n     lawmakers are not the only ones who understand the value of \n     our laws to our capital markets.\n       Three years ago, Alan Greenspan was asked to explain the \n     phenomenal size and strength of the American economy. He had \n     this to say: ``[A]rguably the most important factor is the \n     type of rule of law under which economic activity takes \n     place.''\n       Glenn Hubbard, the former chairman of President Bush's \n     Council of Economic Advisors, echoed those thoughts in a 2004 \n     report. He said: ``Effective capital markets require . . . \n     the enforcement of laws and property rights, transparency and \n     accuracy in accounting and financial reporting, and laws and \n     regulations that provide the proper incentives for good \n     corporate governance.''\n       More recently, last month, a Goldman Sachs study analyzed \n     the condition of America's capital markets. It found that the \n     strength and continued appeal of those markets could be \n     explained in no small part by what the report called: ``a \n     history of solid regulation.''\n       That ``history of solid regulation'' means that investors \n     know that they are reasonably certain to get a fair shake in \n     our markets. Win or lose, they invest with a high degree of \n     confidence that American balance sheets are accurate, that \n     investment products like securities and derivatives are \n     properly valued, and that the markets are well-policed \n     against those who would commit negligent, deceptive, or \n     fraudulent acts.\n       So the value of the laws and regulations within which our \n     markets operate can hardly be overstated.\n       Now, let me quickly add that is not to say that all \n     regulation is good--any more than it is accurate to say that \n     any regulation is bad. Our laws and regulations are not to be \n     entrenched--and attempts to revise them must not be resisted.\n       On the contrary, we write our laws on paper. We don't etch \n     them in stone. We should never be unwilling to revisit and \n     reexamine past assumptions, and we will do just that under my \n     Chairmanship.\n       That is why I also support the efforts of Chairman Cox and \n     Chairman Olson with regard to improving regulations \n     implementing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Sarbanes-Oxley was never \n     intended to handcuff companies that seek to innovate. It was \n     meant to improve accountability and transparency in our \n     public companies and restore confidence in the integrity of \n     the markets. The rulemaking currently underway will help \n     ensure that the core intent of Sarbanes-Oxley is upheld and \n     advanced.\n       That is also why I support the effort by the NASD and the \n     NYSE to consolidate into a single SRO for all broker-dealers. \n     This new self-regulatory organization holds the potential to \n     not only improve the efficiency and consistency of securities \n     industry oversight, but also to reduce costs to member firms.\n       I have always been open to new ideas and new approaches to \n     achieve important policy goals in new, more efficient, and \n     more effective ways. That kind of approach is more critical \n     today than ever. The stakes are simply too high for us to be \n     afraid to think innovatively and to act decisively.\n       I take a back seat to no one in my commitment to the \n     preeminent power of America's markets.\n       But we must resist the temptation to engage our \n     international competitors in a regulatory race to the bottom. \n     Our laws and rules to protect individual investors are a \n     crucial competitive advantage in the global marketplace. Our \n     competitors know that. If we jettison some of those legal \n     protections, we hand our competitors a victory greater than \n     any they could achieve on their own. And we would almost \n     certainly see the slow flow of capital out of our markets and \n     into those of our competitors.\n       The third and final thought I wish to make today is that \n     America's continued ability to attract financial capital \n     hinges on our ability to cultivate and attract intellectual \n     capital.\n       There is no question that the growth of capital markets in \n     Asia, Europe, and elsewhere merits our consideration--and in \n     certain respects, our concern. Without a doubt, the number \n     and size of IPOs in places like Moscow, London, and Hong Kong \n     is on the rise. I want you to know that I am not unmindful of \n     that.\n       But a closer examination of these foreign markets reveals \n     an interesting fact: American firms are leaders there, just \n     as they are leaders here. Consider America's leadership in \n     the European capital markets. According to the McKinsey \n     report commissioned by Mayor Bloomberg and Senator Schumer, \n     three of the top five firms in the European markets--be they \n     engaged in IPOs, mergers and acquisitions, or debt issuance--\n     are Americans.\n       Visit virtually any emerging market in the world today, and \n     you are almost certain to find American firms shaping, \n     guiding, and leading that market into the 21st century global \n     economy. American firms are providing the lawyers, \n     accountants, analysts, investors, and entrepreneurs who are \n     structuring deals, growing jobs, and creating new wealth.\n       In that regard, the growth of markets overseas is something \n     to embrace rather than fear. Because that growth is creating \n     new opportunities for American firms to earn new business.\n       However, our ability to tap and shape those markets depends \n     in large measure on our ability to educate, recruit, and \n     train the best talent in the world. Last week, I listened to \n     Bill Gates. He came to Washington to sound an alarm bell \n     about how the shortage of educated and skilled workers \n     threatens our Nation's overall economic competitiveness. It \n     was a sobering assessment.\n       Yet, a decline in the number of educated and skilled \n     American workers is by no means inevitable. On the contrary, \n     many of us in the Senate--Republicans as well as Democrats--\n     share a strong commitment to improving the educational \n     achievement of our students. That is particularly true of \n     math and science, where we continue to lag behind many other \n     industrialized nations.\n       In a global economy, we must realize that an American child \n     no longer competes for a job against the child from the next \n     town. Nor does he or she compete against a child from another \n     state or region ofthe country. No. Now our kids are competing \n     for jobs against kids from China and England and India. And \n     the best jobs will go to the kids who can think creatively, \n     can understand key mathematical and science concepts, and can \n     solve problems--regardless of where they live.\n       So we must work to increase the pool of home-grown \n     entrepreneurs and highly skilled workers. At the same time, \n     we must remain open to those from other nations who have the \n     talent and drive to succeed in America. Our immigration laws \n     necessarily should place a priority on homeland security \n     needs. But that can be done without erecting needless \n     barriers to those who can help America create new wealth and \n     new jobs.\n       In sum, then, when we discuss the competitiveness of \n     America's capital markets, I hope that we will keep these \n     thoughts in mind:\n       First, that our markets are still the largest, most liquid, \n     and most transparent on the planet.\n       Second, that the current and continued success of those \n     markets depends on the presence of effective, efficient legal \n     rules that protect investors.\n       And third, that the success of our markets also depends on \n     our nation's ability to educate, train, and recruit the kind \n     of talented and driven people who can compete and win in the \n     global economy.\n       Creating the change necessary to maintain the preeminence \n     of our capital markets will not be easy. It will require \n     leadership. But we dare not shrink from the challenge.\n       At the outset of these remarks, I said that while today's \n     meeting is about the future of our capital markets, in a \n     broader sense, it is about the future of our country.\n       I had an experience not long ago that I want to share with \n     you. My five year old daughter, Grace, was getting ready for \n     school one morning, when she looked up at me and said, ``I \n     wonder what my day is going to be like.'' It's not every day \n     that you get that question from a five year old.\n       A moment later, she looked up again and said these exact \n     words: ``I wonder what my life is going to be like.'' She had \n     just turned 5. How do you answer that? It's a question that I \n     would guess many of you have heard before. Because it's a \n     question that all parents often ask about their children or \n     grandchildren.\n       None of us can know with certainty the answer to that \n     question. But we do know that the lives all of our children \n     lead will depend in no small measure on the work that you and \n     I will accomplish in the next few years.\n       We gather today not as Republicans or Democrats, but as \n     Americans who are committed to the future success of the \n     greatest wealth generator of all time: American capitalism.\n       We all have a stake in creating hope and prosperity for \n     those who will come after us. I will work with you to build \n     on our legacy of the American dream and expand security and \n     opportunity for all Americans.\n       Because these urgent times demand nothing less than all of \n     us working together to create that change.\n       That is what I have been doing my entire life in public \n     service--reaching out and turning rhetoric into results, \n     ideals into initiatives, and principles into progress for our \n     country. Many talk about change. This is not a time for talk. \n     It's a time for action. Our challenges are too serious and \n     too urgent to merit anything less.\n       So let us join together once again to turn people's dreams \n     into realities. And let later generations say that, at the \n     beginning of the 21st Century, after an uncertain start, \n     America's leaders charted a new course that once again \n     matched America's progress to her promise.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, with this bill, we are taking a major \nstep forward to help America's workers compete and win in the global \neconomy.\n  I have been working on education, workforce and competitiveness \nissues for many years, and I will never forget a roundtable I held in \nWashington State a few years ago. Sitting around the table, we had \nbusiness owners, higher education officials and public school \neducators.\n  The big question was this--who is responsible for making sure our \nstudents get the skills they need? Businesses didn't want to hire \nsomebody and then have to train them in the basics. Higher education \nleaders wanted to be able\n\n[[Page S5044]]\n\nto focus on college-level material, not remediation. And high school \nleaders were working as hard as they could just to deal with the \ndemands on their plate.\n  So whose responsibility is it to make sure our students get the \nskills they need?\n  It is all of our responsibility, and that is what this bill finally \nrecognizes. It ensures that our Federal agencies--from Commerce to \nEducation to Energy to the National Science Foundation--take aggressive \nsteps to keep American workers ahead of the curve.\n  I am very proud that our country is home to some of the most \ninnovative workers, schools, and companies in the world. But I have \nbeen frustrated that for too long our government has not used all the \ntools available to strengthen the hand of American workers in the world \nmarketplace. This bill finally gets us on the right track, and that's \ngoing to pay dividends for generations.\n  I worked to strengthen this bill through my amendment to improve math \neducation in high school. Just yesterday, we had a hearing in the \nSenate HELP Committee, where education experts from across the country \ntold us that math instructional support does not extend as far as it \nneeds to in high school. That's why I offered an amendment to help \naddress this shortcoming. The Murray Math Skills Program offers \ncompetitive grants to help high schools hire math coaches to provide \ntargeted support for students and math teachers. It will ensure high \nschool students have the rigorous math materials, instruction, and \nsupport they need to pursue college and careers in engineering, \nscience, math and technology. I am excited that my amendment was \nincluded in this bill to make sure high school students get the math \nsupport they need.\n  I am pleased that this bill doubles funding for the National Science \nFoundation and the Energy Department's Office of Science over the next \n10 years. It also encourages high-risk research and supports research \nat NASA.\n  As I work on issues like this, I bring the perspective of not just a \nSenator, but a former educator and someone who represents one of the \nmost innovative regions of our country--the Pacific Northwest. I have \nseen firsthand the connection between what we do in our schools and \nwhat our businesses and economy are able to do. I am proud to represent \na state that is home to some of the most innovative workers and \ncompanies in the world in diverse fields like computers, software, \nbiotechnology, aerospace, and many more. So as I work on these issues, \nI know how important a skilled workforce is to our quality of life.\n  I also know that so much is at stake. Businesses spend about $60 \nbillion just to remediate new employees, and that doesn't include what \ncolleges have to spend to help incoming students catch up.\n  The statistics are troubling. According to a report called ``Tough \nChoices or Tough Times'' from the National Center on Education and the \nEconomy, the number of engineering degrees in the United States is down \n20 percent from its peak year in 1985. This is just one indicator of \nthe trouble ahead if we don't turn this ship around.\n  I have heard time and again from experts, including the ``Rising \nAbove the Gathering Storm'' report, that our economic future depends on \nour ability to innovate, think creatively, and create technological \nbreakthroughs.\n  Our students and workers need strong skills in math, science, \nengineering, technology, and problem solving to make these kinds of \ntechnological and scientific breakthroughs that help ensure our \nNation's place in the world. This bill moves us in the right direction \nby putting in place several key pieces of the puzzle.\n  Let me turn to the substance of the bill. The America COMPETES Act \nhelps increase our country's investment in research, including the type \nof higher risk research that can lead to major breakthroughs. It also \nhelps students get the skills and experiences they need from elementary \nschool through graduate school in science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics. I applaud the bill for also making great steps towards \nattracting women and minorities into these studies and careers; groups \nthat have been historically underrepresented in math and science. \nFinally, the bill helps bring an array of representatives to the table \nto develop a foundation for innovation and creativity, which is so \nimportant to our country's competitiveness.\n  When the HELP Committee first began to consider these issues in the \n110th Congress, we heard from Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft in my \nhome State, at a hearing titled ``Strengthening American \nCompetitiveness for the 21st Century.'' We all heard his urgent call \nfor our country to invest in education, healthcare, and basic science \nresearch. As Bill Gates put it:\n\n       The U.S. cannot maintain its economic leadership unless our \n     work force consists of people who have the knowledge and \n     skills needed to drive innovation.\n\n  This bill recognizes that truth and moves our country in the right \ndirection. It is not the final word. We still have a lot of work to do \nin areas like workforce investment--but it is a critical step forward, \nand I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the America COMPETES \nAct.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to join a number of my \ncolleagues in support of the America COMPETES Act, of which I am an \noriginal cosponsor.\n  Prior to the completion of the National Academy of Sciences' ``Rising \nAbove the Gathering Storm'' report more than a year ago, I joined my \ncolleagues, Senators Alexander and Bingaman, in a meeting with Norm \nAugustine, the lead author of the report and the former CEO of Lockheed \nMartin. It became clear to me then that Congress had to make the \nreport's recommendations a top priority in order to maintain our \nNation's competitive edge. I am proud to come to the floor today to say \nthat we are on our way toward meeting their challenge.\n  In the big picture of where the United States stands, it is clear \nthat the economic framework of our Nation needs to be renewed. I happen \nto believe that our Nation's health care system places our businesses \nat a disadvantage globally, and that we must build regimes globally to \nenforce intellectual property rights, which will be the currency from \nwhich our economies will grow. Most importantly, the time is now right \nfor a national commitment toward becoming more energy independent. I \ncall it a Second Declaration of Independence--this time from foreign \nsources of energy.\n  However, reaching these goals will be impossible without a workforce \nfull of educated and motivated young Americans. This means we must \nplace more emphasis on careers based in the fields of science, \nengineering and mathematics.\n  Right now, we are not getting the job done. Globally, the United \nStates ranks 17th in the proportion of the college-age population \nearning science and engineering degrees, falling from third place \nseveral decades ago. Countries including England, South Korea, Germany, \nAustralia, Singapore, Japan and Canada all produce a higher percentage \nof science and engineering graduates than the United States.\n  The America COMPETES Act will help us reverse these trends. The \nCOMPETES Act would strengthen mathematics, science and engineering \neducation and expand opportunities for students; it also would improve \nour science infrastructure and increase our investment in critical \nresearch.\n  Since the release of the NAS report, I have traveled throughout Ohio \nto discuss the recommendations with scientists from our State's top \nresearch institutions, elementary and secondary school teachers who are \npreparing tomorrow's workforce, business leaders and others. At \nYoungstown State University, I visited with local math and science \nteachers in grades 5-10 who had partnered with the University and the \nDepartment of Education to improve their skills and gain the tools \nnecessary to pique students' interests in the math and science fields. \nI also traveled to The Ohio State University in Columbus and spent time \nat the Future Engineers Summer Camp with Ohio eighth graders, and was \nbriefed on the collaboration among the University of Akron, Akron City \nSchools and the National Inventors Hall of Fame for a middle school \nfocused on math and science. These are the types of programs that will \nstrengthen our nation's competitiveness and these are\n\n[[Page S5045]]\n\nexactly the types of programs that the COMPETES Act aims to expand.\n  Again, I am encouraged that so many of my colleagues in Congress have \nrecognized the need to focus on these goals by sponsoring the \nbipartisan COMPETES Act. While this bill isn't perfect, it is certainly \na step in the right direction and a great example of what my colleagues \nand I can do by working together. Too often around here we get caught \nup in driving our own train and are too busy to realize that we don't \nhave any passengers. I am happy to be a passenger on this particular \n``train'' and am confident our action in the Senate this week on the \nCOMPETES Act is a step in the right direction for our country and our \nposition in today's global economy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, yesterday I voted to table Senator Coburn's \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment that would have called for a requirement \nthat all newly authorized programs be offset by deauthorizing something \nelse. I support eliminating programs which are wasteful or unneeded \nwhether or not we are authorizing a new program.\n  The Coburn amendment was offered to an authorization bill which \nspends no money. It targets the authorizing process, not the \nappropriations process by which Congress allocates funds and determines \npriorities among authorized programs. The Coburn amendment also fails \nto address tax cuts which dig us into a deeper and deeper deficit \nditch.\n  I support fiscal responsibility and have supported a number of strong \nbudget tools this year like the provision which reestablishes a strong \npay-go rule, which would require any new spending or tax cuts be paid \nfor elsewhere in the budget or receive a supermajority of at least 60 \nvotes in the Senate. The amendment offered by Senator Coburn takes the \nwrong approach.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 942\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside so I can call up my amendment, which is No. 942, \nfor consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for himself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Reed, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Brown, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 942.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Bayh, Menendez, and \nVoinovich as cosponsors to amendment No. 942.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase the amounts authorized to be appropriated for the \n              Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program)\n\n       On page 34, line 17, strike ``$120,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$122,005,000''.\n       On page 34, line 20, strike ``$125,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$131,766,000''.\n       On page 34, line 23, strike ``$130,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$142,300,000''.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer this amendment to the \nAmerica COMPETES Act which would authorize appropriations for the \nManufacturing Extension Partnership, known as MEP, through 2011. I am a \nlong-time supporter of the MEP program and believe a healthy \nmanufacturing sector is key to better jobs, rising productivity, and \nhigher standards of living in the United States.\n  Manufacturers today are seeking ways to level the playing field so \nthey can compete globally. One way to level the playing field and \nincrease competitiveness of manufacturers is through the MEP program. \nMEP streamlines operations, integrates new technologies, shortens \nproduction times, and lowers costs, which leads to improved efficiency, \nby offering resources to manufacturers, including organized workshops \nand consulting projects.\n  In Wisconsin, three of our largest corporations--John Deere, Harley-\nDavidson, and Oshkosh Truck--are working with MEP centers to develop \ndomestic supply chains. I am proud to say these companies found it more \nprofitable to work with small- and medium-sized Wisconsin firms than to \nlook overseas for cheap labor.\n  The amendment I am offering would increase the amount of funding \navailable to the MEP program by $19 million over 4 years, allowing MEP \ncenters to reach more manufacturers and to increase the services they \nprovide. I believe we would be hard-pressed to find another program \nthat has produced the results that MEP has on their limited budget. In \nfiscal year 2005, MEP clients reported over 53,000 new or retrained \nworkers, sales of $6.3 billion, and $1.3 billion in cost savings. This \nis the type of program in which we should be investing more, not less.\n  Unfortunately, the administration doesn't support this award-winning \nprogram. I believe MEP is one of the most valuable assets the \nGovernment gives manufacturers. The program has a proven record of \nsaving manufacturing jobs now, and it will strengthen the U.S. \nmanufacturing base for the future. I have written to Secretary \nGutierrez, and I have spoken to him about the need to save MEP. The MEP \nprogram has received wide bipartisan support in the Senate. This year, \n48 Senators signed a letter asking for increased funding for MEP, and \nthe amendment I am offering has 12 cosponsors from both sides of the \naisle.\n  Ten years ago, American manufacturers were not facing the competitive \nthreats they now face from low-cost producing countries such as China \nand India. The increase in competition from these countries has \nrequired our manufacturers to find better, cheaper, and other ways to \nproduce their products, which is where MEP directly comes in. MEP can \nhelp these companies reduce their costs and enter new markets, thus \nallowing them to be competitive in the global marketplace. With the \nincreased threats American manufacturers now face, there is more need \nthan ever to increase the funding for the MEP program. So I urge my \ncolleagues to support this program.\n  At this time I will avoid asking for the yeas and nays.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding \nadoption of Obama amendment No. 923, as modified, the previously agreed \nto DeMint amendment No. 929 still be in order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kohl amendment. I, \nfirst of all, appreciate the terrific work he has done in the \nManufacturing Extension Partnership.\n  I come from a State with many of the same problems the Senator from \nWisconsin faces, including a decline in our industrial base. In too \nmany cases, many of the 3 million manufacturing jobs our country has \nlost are in my State, and it especially hurts those small manufacturing \ncompanies, those small tool and dye makers, those small machine shops \nin Steubenville and Akron and Toledo. The work he has done on the \nManufacturing Extension Partnership has already helped turn around some \nof those businesses in my State, in Ohio, in the Miami Valley, and the \nMahoney Valley and everything in between.\n  The MEP allows small companies--the big companies don't need the help \nso much--similar to the Agriculture\n\n[[Page S5046]]\n\nExtension Service, which is so important throughout the world and \nAmerica--the Manufacturing Extension Partnership has really mattered in \nhelping these small companies, whether it is cutting energy costs, \nwhether it is learning how to export, working with the U.S. Export \nAssistance Center, whether it is dealing with some kind of trade \npolicy, perhaps, or tax policy, helping those small companies learn how \nto compete in this increasingly difficult and competitive global \nenvironment. The MEP has had strong support from both parties, so I \nstrongly urge my colleagues in both parties to support this amendment.\n  There is simply no reason the administration every year comes and \ntries to cut this, and every year we fight back and restore the \nfunding. I will be discussing later, either in this bill or sometime \nlater, legislation I have introduced to allow a revolving fund through \nthe Manufacturing Extension Program done locally. In Ohio I believe \nthere are 11 or 12 regions of the State under MEP that can help, that \nreally can help, help form MEP programs in working with these small \nbusinesses, these small manufacturers. In Cleveland there is a program \ncalled Magna, and in Kyoga County specifically they have had this \nrevolving loan program--sort of a pilot program--that has helped with \ninnovation and with the manufacturing, marketing, and with the \ndevelopment of new products. I think the Kohl amendment will go a long \nway in helping MEP help small businesses and help us compete globally. \nSo I ask my colleagues for support of the Kohl amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 955, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am informed by the chairman and \nranking member of the Finance Committee, whose jurisdiction this would \nbe under, that the amendment Senator Inhofe has offered, amendment No. \n955, as modified, which is now at the desk, is acceptable to both sides \nat this point.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be brought up, agreed \nto, and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 955) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Reid are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.''\n  Mr. REID. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, in consultation with the managers of the \nbill, they have granted me some time to bring up three additional \namendments that I believe are important as we look at the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 918\n\n  Mr. COBURN. First, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment \nbe set aside and that my amendment No. 918 be called up.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 918.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                  (Purpose: To provide a sunset date)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                     DIVISION E--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 5001. SUNSET.\n\n       The provisions of this Act, and the amendments made by this \n     Act, shall cease to have force or effect on and after October \n     1, 2011.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the order, the Senator is \nrecognized for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a sunset amendment. It is very \nplain, very straightforward. It says, can we be assured that we have, \nwith absolute certainty, all the wisdom, facts, and knowledge we will \nneed 4 years from now as to the viability of the programs expressed in \nthis bill?\n  It is one thing the American people would like to see us do--relook \nat, on a regular basis, what we authorize to make sure what we are \ndoing still has application. As a matter of fact, the biggest problem I \nhave noticed in our Government is that we don't do oversight, we don't \nreview and reassess, except in very rare instances.\n  This amendment is very simple. It just says that in 4 years, we are \ngoing to look at it again. We are going to sunset the bill, and \nprobably a year before that Senator Alexander and his companions will \ncome back, relook at it, tweak this, make the changes they need to \nmake, and then have the America COMPETES Act again 4 years from now. \nThe key component of what it does is it forces us to look at it because \nit is going to expire, it is going to run out of gas.\n  What happens now is that we pass things and don't ever look at them \nagain. I believe the Senator from Tennessee, as well as the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, would agree that we fail to do proper oversight in \nthis body. That is one of the very lacking components of the job. It is \nhard work, oftentimes not fun, but it is very important to the future \nof this country.\n  Some people will say that we should not sunset this, that the \nimplication is that we know now what we are going to need to know 4 \nyears from now. But, in fact, we sunset a lot of things, from the \nPATRIOT Act, to the tax bills, to the Ryan White health care bill, to \nDefense bills, to veterans bills. I put forward that we need more \nsunsets because of the discipline it will force on us as \nrepresentatives of the American people to do what is in their best \ninterest, with the knowledge we have on hand at that time.\n  I don't know whether this amendment will pass, but it is a great \njudgment for the American people to look at us and say are we serious \nabout doing the business or are we so arrogant or elitist that we think \nwe know now absolutely what we need to know 4 years from now.\n  I had a good debate with Senator Durbin on the previous bill the body \nconsidered. One of his suggestions was that I should have offered a \nsunset to that legislation. I think that is a great suggestion. I think \nit is equally apropos that we do it on this legislation. It gives us \nthe benefit of our experience over the next 3 years, it allows us to \nhave the hearings in the committee and the committee work we need to \ndo--as a parenthesis, this bill didn't go through any committees, \ndidn't have the pleasure of the Commerce or HELP Committee--and allows \nus to look at and see what we have been doing and whether it is \neffective, whether or not the American people actually get good value \nfor the money over what we intend them to do. That is our real \nobligation. It is not to create an America COMPETES Act, it is not to \npass a piece of legislation, but, in fact, it is to make sure that \nwhatever we do, the American taxpayer dollar gets a great \naccomplishment for that.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and will listen to the opposing \npoints of view on this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will speak briefly on the amendment. I \nknow the Senator has two other amendments he wants to also discuss, and \nthere may be others who want to come back and say something about this \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues not to support this amendment. Under the rules \nof procedure that we follow in the Senate, an appropriation can be \nobjected to if the underlying activity that the money is being \nappropriated for has not been authorized. So we try to pass authorizing \nbills. That is what this legislation is. This is authorizing \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S5047]]\n\n  If everything were perfect around this place, then we would always \nget our authorizing bills reauthorized in time so that there would \nnever be a lapse. Unfortunately, that is not the case. There are a lot \nof authorizing bills that we have allowed to lapse. That does not mean \nthat we quit funding those activities. We, in fact, continue funding \nthose activities through the appropriations process until Congress \norganizes itself and passes a new reauthorization. But the old \nreauthorization remains in place until there is something new to \nreplace it or until there is some conscious decision.\n  These are not new activities, by and large, we are talking about in \nthis legislation. A lot of this is activities that we have done for a \nlong time, and we are trying to, once again, authorize them. We are \ntrying to increase the amounts available for these different \nactivities, whether it is science education, scientific research--\nwhatever the issue is.\n  If the amendment of the Senator is adopted, my understanding is that \neffective on October 1, 2011, there is no authorization at that point \nfrom then on for any of this bill. Therefore, any Congress that tries \nto appropriate the funds, a point of order could be raised that this is \ntrying to appropriate money for an activity for which there has not \nbeen an authorization. I think that would be unwise. That is my basic \nview.\n  I certainly favor the Congress performing its appropriate job of \ncoming back by the time these authorizations are completed, the various \ndollar figures we have in this bill, and looking at this again and \ndoing a rewrite of the authorization. That is what we are trying to do \nwith No Child Left Behind right now. I can tell you that before No \nChild Left Behind was ever enacted, there was a year or 2 years where \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act essentially had expired by \nits language. There was no sunset such as the Senator is recommending \nhere, but the 5-year authorization had expired. Yet we could go ahead \nbecause the underlying language still had force and effect.\n  I also have great questions as to the legal effect of this amendment. \nHere we say the provisions of the act and the amendments made by the \nact shall cease to have force and effect on or after October 1, 2011.\n  Some of the provisions of the act are repeals of other acts or \nrepeals of other provisions. Are we saying that in one bill we would be \nsaying we are repealing this provision, but we are also saying as of \nOctober 1, 2011, the repeal no longer has any force and effect and the \nprovision comes back into effect?\n  I think there are all sorts of confusion that would be sown by trying \nto adopt this amendment. I oppose it myself. As I say, I think there \nare others who wish to speak on it before we get to a vote. I know the \nSenator has two other amendments he wishes to address.\n  I yield the floor, and yield to my colleague from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't want much time. How much time \ndoes the Senator have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 15\\1/2\\ minutes for \nall three amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hope I don't use over 3 minutes. Maybe \nthe Chair can notify me at 3 minutes.\n  I rise to indicate that I don't think we should adopt this amendment. \nFrankly, some of the provisions in this act are only authorized through \n2011. Now we come along and authorize them for that long, meaning we \nare going to probably work at redoing them, but we have hanging over \nour heads a sunset that came into existence just a couple of years \nafter we put the bill into play.\n  Here is the problem: If you want to go to a sunset approach to \nminimizing our Government, then why in the world would you start with \none of the best pieces of legislation we have adopted? This is good \nlaw. This is going to be doing great things. If you want to have a \nsunset provision, pick a bunch of these things you know aren't any good \nand sunset them, not sunset a bill that has some force and effect that \ncarries on much broader and has the chance of doing some real good.\n  This one in the end will be extremely mischievous at the most, and \nsome people will claim that it did great things. The truth is, this \nbill needs more than the time allowed by this amendment because it is \nnew ground, new approaches to putting more brain power into the brains \nof America's students as they go through school. You can't do that in a \nshort period of time.\n  This is the wrong bill, the wrong time to sunset, and it won't do any \ngood. Therefore, it should not be adopted. I thank the Senator for \nyielding me 3 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the claim of Senator Bingaman that a point \nof order will lie against this is wrong. Paragraph 7, rule XVI only \nrequires the Appropriations Committee to list the unauthorized \nprograms. He made my point: 20 percent of our appropriations are \nunauthorized from expired or sunsetted programs. It won't stop anything \nif it is a good program.\n  I contend with Senator Domenici that he thinks this is a great bill, \nbut the only way we are going to know is the results of the bill. So \nbased on what we think, not on what we know, is the reason this bill \nshould be sunsetted so that it forces us to go back and look at what we \nmight think we know today but didn't know and change it.\n  It is about putting discipline into our body. It is about forcing us \nto do the work the people told us they wanted done when we came here. \nIt requires us to not be fortune tellers, to not be seance dwellers, \nbut to, in fact, look at the facts after 3 years, see what it has \naccomplished, and forces us to make the changes.\n  The Senator knows quite well that on most of the programs we haven't \ndone that. That is one of the reasons we had a $350 billion deficit. \nThat is one of the reasons we had $200 billion that we spent on \nwasteful, duplicated, or fraudulent programs last year out of the $1 \ntrillion we spent in the discretionary budget.\n  What I am trying to do is force us to do the hard work of relooking. \nI agree, does that make it hard? Yes. Nobody said it was going to be \neasy. But I would want any Senator in this body who says they know the \noutcome of this bill to put something behind that and say we don't need \nto relook at it. That is the question. This is a disciplinary force \nthat says we have to come back and look at it.\n  Let me remind my colleagues again. There are great ideas in this \nlegislation. I don't doubt that for a minute. This didn't go through \nthe committee process. This wasn't made available for amendments. On an \n$80 billion authorization--which is what it is going to be if we guess \nat the sums that are authorized for this bill--to not have it go \nthrough either committees of jurisdiction and come to the floor, and we \nare going to spend this kind of money and we are going to think rather \nthan know it is going to work, and to say we should not look at it I \nfind really ironic, and I feel pretty sure most of the American people \nwould think we can't know for sure.\n  It is a commonsense amendment and will cause us to do what is \nnecessary.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 922\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending amendment \naside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I call up amendment No. 922.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 922.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To promote transparency at the National Oceanic and \n                      Atmospheric Administration)\n\n       At the end of title V of division A, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1503. NOAA ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY.\n\n       (a) Review of Activities Carried Out With NOAA Funds.--\n       (1) Requirement for review.--The Inspector General of the \n     Department of Commerce shall conduct routine, independent \n     reviews of the activities carried out with grants or\n\n[[Page S5048]]\n\n     other financial assistance made available by the \n     Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration. Such reviews shall include cost-benefit \n     analysis of such activities and reviews to determine if the \n     goals of such activities are being accomplished.\n       (2) Availability to the public.--The Administrator shall \n     make each review conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) \n     available to the public through the website of the \n     Administration not later than 60 days after the date such \n     review is completed.\n       (b) Prohibition on Use of NOAA Funds for Meetings.--No \n     funds made available by the Administrator through a grant or \n     contract may be used by the person who received such grant or \n     contract, including any subcontractor to such person, for a \n     banquet or conference, other than a conference related to \n     training or a routine meeting with officers or employees of \n     the Administration to discuss an ongoing project or training.\n       (c) Prohibition on Conflicts of Interest.--Each person who \n     receives funds from the Administrator through a grant or \n     contract shall submit to the Administrator a certification \n     stating that none of such funds will be made available \n     through a subcontract or in any other manner to another \n     person who has a financial interest or other conflict of \n     interest with the person who received such funds from the \n     Administrator.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we passed the Fisheries Act, the Magnuson-\nStevens Act, which was reauthorized this year in which Senator Stevens \nundertook, correctly, the responsibility of eliminating conflicts of \ninterest and created oversight on the fisheries boards.\n  We have recently had notification and seen some pretty significant \nabuse within NOAA of some of their grant processes. All this amendment \nsays is, we are going to add some accountability and transparency to \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration grants program.\n  I refer my colleagues to a Baltimore Sun article which has been \nprominent in that newspaper over the last couple of weeks where over \n$10 million in a grant has failed to demonstrate results. It is riddled \nwith conflicts of interest, and it has had little to no oversight from \nNOAA.\n  Before we expand NOAA, one of the things we ought to do is make sure \nthere are no conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, in the \ngrant process.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record both articles \noutlining this situation, as well as a Stanford study on other areas of \nNOAA where there is a lack of informed consent and a lack of conflict \nof interest rules for NOAA.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Environment News Service, Nov. 13, 2003]\n\n     Fish Perish as Conflict of Interest Snares Management Councils\n\n       Washington, DC.--The regional fishery management councils \n     that govern the multi-billion dollar U.S. commercial and \n     recreational fishing industry are dominated by the industry, \n     exempted from federal conflict of interest laws, and subject \n     to little federal oversight, says a new report released \n     Wednesday by three Stanford University researchers. Sixty \n     percent of appointed council members have a direct financial \n     interest in the fisheries that they manage and regulate, say \n     the authors of the report, ``Taking Stock of the Regional \n     Fishery Management Councils.''\n       Stanford's Josh Eagle, Barton Thompson Jr., and Sarah \n     Newkirk conducted a review of the mandates, constitution, \n     rules, and procedures of the United States' Regional Fishery \n     Management Councils, and surveyed members of four of the \n     eight councils. Their study, sponsored by The Pew Charitable \n     Trusts, concludes that the councils have presided over the \n     economic and biological decline of many fisheries, and that \n     the councils are not likely to implement the kind of \n     management necessary to prevent future declines. ``The oceans \n     are among the nation's greatest natural resources, yet few \n     Americans know who manages the nation's fisheries or how \n     decisions affecting the sustainability of fisheries are \n     made,'' said co-author Josh Eagle, director of the Stanford \n     Fisheries Policy Project and lecturer in law at Stanford Law \n     School.\n       The eight fishery councils were established in 1976 by the \n     passage of the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, now \n     known as the Magnuson-Stevens Act, to take primary \n     responsibility for the management of dozens of fisheries \n     along U.S. coasts in Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and \n     Pacific waters.\n       The recent collapses of once abundant species, such as cod \n     in New England and rockfish off the Pacific coast, have \n     caused hardship for fishing communities across the country. \n     In addition salmon, tuna, red snapper, lobster, and blue \n     crab, among many other species, are overfished, and many \n     scientists, including the report's authors, say an essential \n     step in helping these species recover is to put an end to \n     overfishing. Eagle said, ``With more than a third of the \n     nation's studied fish stocks overfished and the status of \n     many more uncertain, it is clear that we must apply standards \n     of good government to the management of America's fisheries \n     and place the public's interest first.''\n       The councils opened a three day conference today in \n     Washington, DC to educate the public, policy makers, and \n     media on the marine fishery management process. They are \n     presenting successful management examples by region, and \n     current management and research initiatives. The councils say \n     they wish to ``help bridge the gap between perception and \n     reality regarding fisheries management'' and to provide a \n     forum for information exchange and to solicit a wide range of \n     perspectives on future management and marine research \n     directions. But Eagle, Thompson, and Newkirk say in their \n     report that the councils are unlikely to solve the current \n     problems facing the Nation's fisheries for at least three \n     reasons.\n       First, council members face a conflict of interest because \n     they must limit the number of fish that can be caught to \n     ensure their conservation while also allocating the allowable \n     catch among members of the industry, who may apply pressure \n     to increase the size of their quotas. Second, because 80 to \n     90 percent of appointed council members are from the fishing \n     industry, diverse viewpoints are not fairly representated in \n     council discussions and decisionmaking, the report states. \n     Each council has only one environmental representative, one \n     state official and one federal official in addition to the \n     fishing industry members. Congress requires federal advisory \n     commissions to be ``fairly balanced in terms of points of \n     view represented and the functions to be performed by the \n     advisory commission,'' but the fisheries management councils \n     are not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act.\n       Finally, the split in responsibilities between the councils \n     and the National Marine Fisheries Service removes effective \n     accountability for the status of the Nation's fisheries, the \n     report's authors conclude. An example from the Western \n     Pacific Fishery Management Council based in Honolulu, \n     reported by the ``Cascadia Times,'' shows how the process \n     works in practice. In June the Secretary of Commerce \n     appointed longline fisherman Sean Martin to a seat on the \n     Western Pacific Fishery Management Council. Martin is also \n     co-owner, with Jim Cook, of Pacific Ocean Producers, a \n     fishing equipment supply company.\n       Longlining kills endangered sea turtles when they become \n     entangled in the 60 mile long fishing lines baited for \n     swordfish and other commercial fish species.\n       On September 23, the Western Pacific Fishery Management \n     Council decided whether or not to reopen swordfishing in \n     Hawaiian waters through which endangered leatherback turtles \n     migrate. Biologists told the council the rule would harm 144 \n     sea turtles per year, but on a motion by Martin, the council \n     voted 8-5 to reopen the fishery. The September 23 vote may \n     also lead to violations of the Endangered Species Act. ``It \n     would authorize a far higher number of sea turtle takes than \n     the scientific record supports,'' says William Hogarth, \n     assistant administrator of the National Marine Fisheries \n     Service, now known as NOAA Fisheries.\n       Some fisheries management councils do take action to \n     protect fish species. On November 21, following action taken \n     by the federal Pacific Fishery Management Council and \n     conforming action taken by the state of California, \n     recreational and most commercial fisheries for nearshore \n     rockfishes, shelf rockfishes, California scorpionfish \n     (sculpin), and lingcod will close in all Pacific waters. ``In \n     past years, anglers had more opportunities to fish for \n     rockfish in deeper waters. This year, fishing for rockfish \n     was limited to waters shallower than l20 feet which put \n     greater pressure on nearshore species,'' explained Fred \n     Wendell, California Department of Fish and Game nearshore \n     fishery manager. And some fish populations are doing well. \n     The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council released survey \n     data in June showing summer flounder numbers had reached the \n     highest levels ever recorded since the survey began in 1968.\n       ``The robust recovery of the summer flounder stock is a \n     direct reflection of the positive impacts that the management \n     measures have had on the resource,'' said Dr. Christopher \n     Moore, council deputy director. ``The Council and Commission \n     should be extremely proud of the management decisions they \n     have made over the years to rebuild summer flounder.'' Still, \n     many members of the four fisheries management councils polled \n     by the authors of ``Taking Stock'' agreed that there are \n     problems with the current system and that these problems \n     should be addressed.\n       Eagle, Thompson, and Newkirk report that more than half of \n     the council members polled said environmental interests are \n     underrepresented on the councils. Roughly a third of the \n     respondents said they had felt it unfair in one or more past \n     instances for a fellow council member to participate in a \n     decision in which he or she had a financial interest. A \n     similar percentage expressed concern about decisions in which \n     the relatives or friends of voting council members had a \n     financial interest in the outcome.\n       Eagle, Thompson, and Newkirk call for changes in federal \n     policy on fisheries management councils that would institute \n     the\n\n[[Page S5049]]\n\n     same standards of ``good government'' that apply to other \n     federal and state agencies charged with managing U.S. natural \n     resources. First, they say Congress should separate the \n     institutional decisionmaking responsibilities for \n     conservation and quota allocation. To broaden council \n     representation, Congress could require governors to submit a \n     more diverse list of candidates, or require that nominations \n     be made by an independent body such as the National Academy \n     of Sciences, they recommend. And finally, only federal \n     management exempts federal decisionmakers, the council \n     members, from conflicts of interest. Remedies suggested by \n     the authors include lowering the recusal threshold and \n     prohibiting those holding financial interests in regulated \n     fisheries from council appointment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Baltimore Sun, Apr. 1, 2007]\n\nOystermen Reap Federal Bounty--Bid To Revive Bivalve Benefits Watermen \n                                  More\n\n                   (By Rona Kobell and Greg Garland)\n\n       At the Hyatt Regency resort in Cambridge, several dozen \n     scientists, watermen and government regulators gathered to \n     sip martinis and mingle over hors d'oeuvres. Later, there \n     were cheers and tributes as they dined on crab and filet \n     mignon. The mood was celebratory at January's annual meeting \n     of the Oyster Recovery Partnership. Yet the government-\n     financed nonprofit has made little progress toward its stated \n     mission of restoring oysters to the Chesapeake Bay. Maryland \n     officials set up the group more than a decade ago in what was \n     envisioned as a groundbreaking attempt to revive a species \n     all but destroyed by overharvesting and disease. Since 2002 \n     alone, the partnership has received $10 million in federal \n     funds to lead Maryland's efforts to make oysters an abundant, \n     self-sustaining species again.\n       The way to do that, leading scientists say, is to leave the \n     shellfish in the water so they can reproduce and propagate \n     the species. But the partnership puts most of its oysters in \n     places where watermen can take them out--and sell them for \n     roughly $30 a bushel. ``If you're serious about the \n     ecological value of oysters, then they must remain in the bay \n     and live,'' said veteran oyster biologist George Krantz, \n     former fisheries director at the Maryland Department of \n     Natural Resources. The partnership's spending has done more \n     to create income for watermen than bring back the Maryland \n     oyster, an investigation by The Sun has found. The group not \n     only provides watermen a crop to harvest, but it also pays \n     them to do work that many scientists say has little merit. \n     The Sun found:\n       While the partnership has planted tens of millions of \n     hatchery-raised oysters, less than a third have been put in \n     protected sanctuaries. Most are planted in places where they \n     can be harvested.\n       The group is paying the Maryland Watermen's Association \n     nearly $400,000 this year to remove diseased oysters from one \n     part of the bay and dump them in another. Proponents say this \n     practice helps other oysters survive, but it has no proven \n     scientific value. Critics say a primary benefit is to provide \n     work for watermen.\n       The head of the Watermen's Association sits on the \n     partnership's board and is among those who benefit \n     financially from the federal grants. Association president \n     Larry Simns Sr. doled out tens of thousands of dollars of the \n     grant money to watermen last year to help plant or move \n     oysters. Also, he collected $40,100 for supervising their \n     work.\n       The group used $46,000 in federal funds to hold its annual \n     meeting at the Hyatt Regency, a golf resort and spa. The \n     money went not just for the fancy dinner but also for hotel \n     rooms for 50 of the guests. Private funds were used only for \n     the alcohol.\n       While solid figures are not available, the Department of \n     Natural Resources estimates that there are fewer oysters in \n     the Chesapeake today than when the Oyster Recovery \n     Partnership began its work in 1994. Its efforts have failed \n     to overcome the devastating impact of two oyster parasites, \n     MSX and Dermo, that have all but wiped out the oyster \n     population. Partnership officials nonetheless consider their \n     work a huge success. ``We're certainly doing infinitely \n     better than what has been done in the past,'' said Torrey C. \n     Brown, a former state natural resources secretary who now \n     serves as the partnership's unpaid chairman. He is proud of \n     the group's extensive oyster-planting program. Partnership \n     officials say it makes sense to let watermen harvest many of \n     those oysters because the shellfish would die eventually of \n     disease. They point out that in the several years before the \n     oysters are harvested, they help the bay by filtering away \n     pollution. ``The idea that it is a watermen's welfare program \n     is nonsense,'' Brown said. ``I don't think that they're \n     getting any untoward benefit.''\n       Though the partnership gets millions in federal funds, it \n     operates with virtually no governmental oversight. The group \n     gets the money as the result of a budget ``earmark'' arranged \n     by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, and the grant \n     is distributed. by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration. A top NOAA official acknowledged that his \n     agency hasn't intervened as the partnership used the grant to \n     run programs that he said are effectively subsidies for \n     watermen. Because the money was approved specifically for the \n     partnership through an earmark, agency officials believed \n     they had no authority to interfere, said Lowell Bahner, a \n     NOAA administrator who until recently oversaw the agency's \n     Chesapeake Bay office.\n       ``Senator Mikulski said, `I want oysters in the water for \n     harvest by watermen,' '' Bahner said. ``Is that a subsidy? \n     That's what it looks like. And I think she would be proud of \n     that.'' Mikulski declined to be interviewed for this article. \n     But in a written response to questions from The Sun, she said \n     she expected NOAA ``to have strong oversight'' of how the \n     grant was being spent. In addition, she said the money ``was \n     never intended to be a subsidy for industry or watermen.'' \n     ``Unlike farm subsidies, this does not guarantee revenue for \n     watermen or industry,'' Mikulski said. ``This was intended . \n     . . to help jumpstart restoration for the economic and \n     environmental health of the Bay.''\n       Many scientists question why the partnership is spending \n     millions of federal dollars to plant oysters, only to let \n     watermen take them before they can reach full reproductive \n     potential. ``You can't justify doing it,'' said Krantz. ``The \n     agenda has virtually excluded any scientific personnel who \n     voiced opposition to this concept. . . . The decision to take \n     them out is based on a harvester's wishes, not a \n     conservationist's wishes.''\n\n\n                              rock bottom\n\n       The Oyster Recovery Partnership traces its roots to the \n     winter of 1993, when Maryland's oyster industry hit rock \n     bottom. Watermen harvested fewer than 80,000 bushels of \n     oysters that season, taking home about $1 million. Just a \n     decade earlier, they were bringing in more than a million \n     bushels, which fetched $16 million at the dock. In the years \n     before that, the harvests were even better, providing a \n     stable income for thousands of people who earned their living \n     on the water.\n       The fast decline of the oyster was alarming not just \n     because it was putting watermen out of a job. Oystering was \n     part of Maryland's identity, the old-fashioned simplicity of \n     the work immortalized in sepia-toned photographs of watermen \n     plying their wooden tongs from sail-powered skipjacks. The \n     collapse of the species was of tremendous concern to \n     scientists. Oysters are the backbone of many aquatic \n     communities, providing reefs that are crucial habitat for \n     crabs and small fish. They are also critical to the health of \n     the Chesapeake because, as they suck in water to filter out \n     food, they literally filter away pollution.\n       Among those most concerned was Brown, then Maryland's \n     secretary of natural resources. He gathered everyone he could \n     think of with a stake in keeping oysters healthy, assembling \n     in one room a motley coalition of 40--watermen, regulators, \n     legislators, university professors. He hired a facilitator to \n     calm tensions at what became known as the Oyster Roundtable. \n     No one was allowed to leave the table until everyone agreed \n     on what to do next.\n       But as further meetings were held, Brown said, it was clear \n     the warring parties didn't trust each other. So he suggested \n     creating a nonprofit agency that would get the various groups \n     involved in an effort to bring back oysters. It would not be \n     a research organization--plenty of those already existed. \n     Rather, it would work with scientists and watermen to plant \n     oysters in the water and monitor their progress. Ideally, the \n     group would receive a small amount of government money, but \n     it would also raise private funds.\n       The Oyster Recovery Partnership was formally created in \n     1994, under a board that today numbers 18 people, including \n     seafood executives, other businessmen and environmentalists. \n     Its purpose, according to a written agreement with the state, \n     was to develop projects to promote ``the ecological \n     restoration of oysters in the Chesapeake Bay.'' The agreement \n     says nothing about helping watermen. But the group's first \n     office was in a back room of the Maryland Watermen's \n     Association headquarters in Annapolis. The partnership has \n     since moved into space across the hall. The organization got \n     off to a rocky start. It never raised the private money its \n     founders had hoped for, and its small staff often seemed \n     overwhelmed. By 2000, the group had gone through two \n     executive directors and was in poor financial shape. It \n     advertised for a new executive director and interviewed \n     dozens of candidates. Charles Frentz was one of the last. ``I \n     told them, `I am either going to put you out of business or \n     straighten you out,' '' Frentz recalls.\n\n\n                            a lack of focus\n\n       Frentz conceded that he knew little about the biology of \n     the bay--he had spent much of his career running several \n     horse racing businesses in Florida, including one that put on \n     the prestigious Breeders' Cup. He said he hadn't been looking \n     for a job; he was retired and had moved to Maryland largely \n     to marry his high-school sweetheart, an executive at the \n     Social Security Administration. But he brought with him a \n     passion for the bay that came from growing up near Sparrows \n     Point and spending summers at a family home in Tolchester \n     Beach, trawling for soft-shell crabs. More importantly, he \n     said, he could apply sound management practices to a \n     foundering organization. ``It was almost a feel-good \n     situation where you had good intentions, but there was a lack \n     of business focus,'' Frentz said. ``There was no question \n     that I challenged how they did business, why they did \n     business and how they would do business in the future.''\n       When Frentz came on board, the partnership was getting \n     about $450,000 from NOAA and had little other income. It was \n     using volunteers to plant small clusters of oysters on\n\n[[Page S5050]]\n\n     tiny plots throughout the bay. If the partnership had any \n     prayer of significantly increasing the number of oysters in \n     the Chesapeake, Frentz reasoned, it would need to plant many \n     more baby oysters. To do that, it would need more money.\n       Frentz persuaded Donald Meritt, the manager of the \n     University of Maryland's Horn Point hatchery, to produce more \n     oysters, promising to get money to upgrade the facility. \n     Frentz also cultivated Mikulski, who had been earmarking \n     money for the partnership. In his first year in the job, \n     Frentz nearly doubled the ORP's federal funding, to $850,000. \n     By 2002, the group was getting $1 million; by 2004, $2 \n     million. Last year, the funding doubled again to about $4 \n     million.\n       As the money increased, so did Frentz's pay. He was hired \n     for $58,000 in 2000, according to the partnership. By the \n     time he retired three months ago, he was earning $151,000, \n     most of it from federal funds. He still gets $10,000 a month \n     as a consultant. Frentz frequently praised Mikulski, even \n     presenting a video tribute to the woman he called ``Our Bay \n     Lady.'' She returned the compliments. In a 2004 letter to \n     Frentz, she called him ``just about the best thing that has \n     happened to the Chesapeake Bay since the skipjack.''\n\n\n                            helping watermen\n\n       The idea of using government money to help watermen isn't \n     new. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources has for \n     years run oyster programs that are essentially subsidies. The \n     state agency moves baby oysters from the lower Chesapeake, \n     where they are abundant naturally, and spreads them around \n     the bay. A committee of oystermen tells the department where \n     they want this ``seed,'' as the babies are called, and the \n     department delivers. The idea is to help watermen from upper \n     bay counties earn a living, state officials say. The agency \n     has been doing this for decades. But when parasites began to \n     attack the bay's oysters in the 1970s and 1980s, this \n     practice turned out to have a down side. The parasites that \n     attack oysters thrive in the same salty waters where oysters \n     reproduce. So when the state moved oyster seed to lower-salt \n     waters, the parasites hitched a ride--spreading disease.\n       Initially, state officials thought that wouldn't happen \n     because they believed the parasites wouldn't survive in the \n     fresh water of the upper bay. Once it was clear the parasites \n     would survive, the department continued to move the seed \n     around anyway, arguing that since the bay's oyster population \n     was so far gone, stopping the program wouldn't lessen disease \n     and would only hurt watermen. ``History is what it is,'' said \n     Chris Judy, the department's longtime shellfish director, \n     explaining why the practice has continued. ``The time to \n     [say] `Let's not move diseased seed' was at the beginning.''\n\n\n                            managed reserves\n\n       Charlie Frentz didn't want to spend millions of dollars to \n     plant disease-resistant oysters only to have the state turn \n     around and deposit diseased seed nearby. So he asked the \n     watermen to turn down the state's seed. He said the \n     partnership would instead provide hatchery-raised oysters \n     that would eventually be available for harvest. The oysters \n     would be planted on special bars that he called ``managed \n     reserves.''\n       Normally, watermen can take oysters from the bay when they \n     are 3 inches long. In the managed reserves, they had to wait \n     until the oysters were 4 inches. The larger size meant the \n     oysters would have an extra year or so to live in the bay. \n     But after the first year, when one waterman was so mad about \n     the restrictions that he threw an oyster hammer at Larry \n     Simns, the partnership changed the rules. Today, when half a \n     bar's oysters reach 4 inches, watermen also can remove the 3-\n     inch oysters.\n       Meritt, the hatchery manager, calls the managed reserve ``a \n     really nice compromise'' because it gives many oysters an \n     extra year in the bay to provide ecological benefits. But \n     other scientists say the program is nothing more than an \n     expensive put-and-take fishery falsely billed as restoration. \n     An oyster's ability to reproduce increases exponentially with \n     each year it survives. So harvesting the animal after just \n     four years--about the time it takes to reach 4 inches--cuts \n     off its life span at a critical time, according to Krantz, \n     the former fisheries chief.\n       He estimates that if an oyster reaches 5 or 6 inches, it \n     will have a 3,000 percent increase in reproductive \n     capability. Krantz and other scientists say it's crucial to \n     leave the oysters in the water; even if many will die of \n     disease, the ones that live will help propagate a species \n     that can withstand disease. Of the 950 million hatchery-\n     raised oysters that the partnership has planted since 2000, \n     more than half have gone into managed reserves. About 100 \n     million were planted for harvesting without any special \n     restrictions. Only about 265 million were put in oyster \n     sanctuaries where harvesting is prohibited. The sanctuary \n     oysters have done better than many expected. About 20 percent \n     of them are still alive, according to Kennedy T. Paynter Jr., \n     a University of Maryland scientist who is paid by the \n     partnership to monitor its bars. That survival rate is good, \n     Paynter said, given that half of the oysters planted anywhere \n     in the bay are expected to die in the first year. The numbers \n     appear to contradict the watermen's assertions that if \n     oysters are not harvested, they will just die of disease. \n     ``To use that as an excuse to harvest is a logical \n     absurdity,'' said University of Maryland oyster biologist \n     Roger Newell. ``If an oyster is harvested, there is a 100 \n     percent chance of it dying.'' If you leave it at the \n     bottom, he said, there is a chance it will live.\n\n\n                              bar-cleaning\n\n       More lucrative for Simns and some other watermen has been \n     the ``bar-cleaning'' work--removing diseased adult oysters \n     from some of the partnership's bars and dumping them in \n     another spot. Watermen will return to the spot later to \n     harvest the oysters for private sale; while disease \n     eventually kills the shellfish, infected oysters are safe for \n     people to eat. So the watermen earn money twice in this \n     process. They are paid by the partnership to move the \n     diseased oysters, and then they get to harvest them. The bar-\n     cleaning work is done in the spring, between the end of \n     oyster season and the start of crabbing season--a period when \n     many watermen have time on their hands. But removing the bad \n     oysters is also good for the bay, according to Paynter.\n       When oysters die, they gape open and spread disease. So \n     it's important, Paynter said, to get them out while they're \n     alive. Paynter said, however, there is no scientific benefit \n     to putting the diseased oysters back in the bay for watermen \n     to harvest later. ``Really,'' he said, ``we'd like to take \n     the diseased oysters out and put them into the driveway.'' \n     Other scientists and state officials say bar cleaning has \n     little merit even in terms of removing disease. A state study \n     in 2005 showed that bar cleaning leaves behind infected \n     oysters.\n       ``Bar cleaning may buy you a little bit of time to produce \n     more market-size oysters, but eventually disease is going to \n     take hold,'' said DNR assistant fisheries director Tom \n     O'Connell. He argues the partnership shouldn't be spending so \n     much money on bar cleaning until it is studied more. Despite \n     the lack of scientific evidence that the process works, the \n     ORP allocated almost $400,000 of this year's $4 million \n     federal grant to the Maryland Watermen's Association for bar \n     cleaning. Simns, a member of the ORP's executive board, hands \n     out that money--wearing his hat as president of the \n     Watermen's Association. He says he uses a process that is \n     above board and fair.\n       He sends out ``bid forms'' to the roughly 500 watermen who \n     have oyster licenses asking them to suggest a daily price for \n     the work, he said. Then, Simns said, he sets a rate based on \n     the average of the bids he receives--last year, $450 a day. \n     He gives work to pretty much everyone who asks, Simns said, \n     about 50 watermen last year.\n       Simns acknowledges that he used ORP money to pay himself \n     $40,100 last year, in part to supervise this work that is \n     done by men who are members of his association. The people \n     who are paid include his son, Larry Jr., who gets $100 day as \n     a crewman on his father's boat, partnership records show. The \n     Watermen's Association itself gets about $65,000 of the money \n     for administering the contract--money it uses for operating \n     expenses. As for his own pay, Simns argues that the \n     partnership needs him to oversee the work--he has been \n     working the water since he was a boy, and he knows all the \n     watermen. ``It's better for ORP to have someone like the \n     Watermen's Association manage the watermen,'' said Simns, 70. \n     ``They can't blow smoke at me, because I know. I've done all \n     that stuff.''\n       He said Frentz assured him that his role in the Watermen's \n     Association was not a problem--that he could be on the ORP \n     board at the same time he was getting money from an ORP \n     grant. ``I don't vote on anything that has to do with the \n     Maryland Watermen's Association,'' Simns said. But his \n     position as a member of a nonprofit's board who derives \n     financial benefits from the relationship raises conflict-of-\n     interest questions. Daniel Borochoff, president of the \n     American Institute of Philanthropy, a watchdog group that \n     monitors nonprofits, said it generally is not good practice \n     for an organization to pay one of its governing board members \n     for services. ``A board member receiving money to perform \n     services, that is frowned upon,'' he said.\n       According to Simns, the other watermen net from $100 to \n     $125 from their $450 barcleaning checks after paying for gas \n     and the expense of keeping up a boat. Nevertheless, it can be \n     an important source of income, said Floyd ``Bunky'' Chance, \n     an Eastern Shore waterman. ``Everyone who participates likes \n     it, for the income if nothing else. . . . Most watermen are \n     just trying to keep the wolf from the door,'' he said.\n\n\n                             hey, trust us\n\n       NOAA officials acknowledge that they have done little to \n     manage or oversee the money their agency gets from the \n     earmark and passes on to the Oyster Recovery Partnership. The \n     agency does not scrutinize the partnership's salaries, \n     administrative expenses or the money it spends on its annual \n     banquet, said NOAA grant manager Rich Takacs. ``It's up to \n     the organization receiving the funds to use their internally \n     approved business practices,'' Takacs said.\n       When asked for copies of the partnership's contracts with \n     the Watermen's Association for bar cleaning and other work, \n     Takacs said he didn't have any. The partnership wasn't asked \n     to provide them, he said. Takacs said the partnership's \n     approach to its bar cleaning and oyster planting operations \n     has been ``a lot of `Hey, trust us.' '' Unlike many other \n     NOAA grantees, which provide detailed reports on their \n     scientific work, the partnership provides only cursory \n     reports of one to two pages with a broad general description \n     of its work, he said.\n\n[[Page S5051]]\n\n       As a result, there has been no comprehensive assessment of \n     what the $10 million in federal funds granted to the \n     partnership in the past five years has done to help the cause \n     of restoring oysters to the bay, NOAA officials said. Even in \n     terms of helping watermen, the program almost certainly is \n     not cost-effective, partnership and NOAA officials admit. A \n     government analysis of the Department of Natural Resources \n     seed-moving program showed that, for every dollar the state \n     spent to create a crop for watermen to harvest, the watermen \n     earned 13 cents in oyster sales.\n       Bahner, who ran NOAA's Chesapeake Bay office until last \n     year and has taken a job at the agency's Silver Spring \n     headquarters, said he believes the partnership is making a \n     valuable contribution to the bay in planting millions of \n     oysters. He also said, however, that Mikulski's earmark put \n     his agency in a difficult position.\n       Federal scientists and grant managers wanted to ensure that \n     the money was used in the best way to restore oysters, he \n     said. But partnership officials argued that the program was \n     designed to help watermen and that NOAA's job was to hand \n     over the checks. ``When the program started, it was \n     primarily, `Put the oysters in the water for the watermen,''' \n     Bahner said. ``You've got this whole watermen's community. \n     It's a subsidy program.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Apr. 14, 2007]\n\n  Oyster Grants to State Disputed--Senator Asks Details on $10 Million\n\n                           (By Greg Garland)\n\n       A conservative Oklahoma senator who wants to eliminate \n     congressional earmarks has asked a federal agency for a \n     detailed explanation of how $10 million in government grants \n     for oyster recovery has been spent in Maryland.\n       In a letter to the head of the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn said he was \n     ``very concerned'' about questionable spending practices \n     detailed in an article in The Sun about the Maryland's Oyster \n     Recovery Partnership. ``It sounds like a dubious use of \n     federal dollars and raises a lot of questions,'' Roland R. \n     Foster, an aide to the Oklahoma Republican, said yesterday. \n     The partnership, a nonprofit group charged with trying to \n     restore oysters to the Chesapeake Bay, receives its annual \n     funding through a federal budget ``earmark'' arranged by U.S. \n     Sen. BARBARA A. MIKULSKI, a Maryland Democrat.\n       The Sun reported this month that while the group has \n     planted nearly a billion hatchery-raised oysters since 2000, \n     less than a third have been put in protected sanctuaries. \n     Most have been planted in places where they can be harvested \n     by watermen and sold. The newspaper also found that the \n     partnership is paying the Maryland Watermen's Association \n     nearly $400,000 this year to remove diseased oysters from one \n     part of the bay and dump them in another. Proponents say this \n     practice helps other oysters survive, but it has no proven \n     scientific value. Critics say its primary purpose is to \n     provide income for watermen. The partnership also used \n     $46,000 in federal funds to hold its annual dinner at the \n     Hyatt Regency golf resort and spa in Cambridge, The Sun \n     reported. Meanwhile, the bay's oyster population remains at \n     historic lows.\n       In the letter to NOAA chief Conrad C. Lautenbacher Jr., \n     Coburn questioned how the earmarked funds were being used. \n     ``What oversight has NOAA conducted of this specific grant?'' \n     Coburn asked. ``[P]articularly was NOAA aware that funds were \n     being used for banquets or of the financial conflicts of \n     interest between staff and organizations receiving funding?''\n       Coburn also asked for reports on how the partnership is \n     doing in meeting its stated goals and whether its federally \n     funded efforts have been cost effective. Monica Allen, a \n     spokeswoman for NOAA, declined to comment on Coburn's letter \n     but said the agency would provide a copy of its response when \n     it is completed and sent to Coburn. Stephan Abel, executive \n     director of the Oyster Recovery Partnership, said, ``It would \n     be inappropriate to comment until NOAA has had the \n     opportunity to respond.'' Foster said Coburn has attempted to \n     focus attention on earmarks as part of a campaign to end what \n     he regards as wasteful government spending. A year ago, \n     Coburn and Arizona Sen. John McCain sent a letter to all 100 \n     U.S. senators announcing they would challenge every earmark, \n     or ``pork project,'' on the Senate floor.\n       The problem with earmarks, Foster said, is they are made \n     based on political connections and aren't subject to \n     competition or stringent oversight. Coburn said The Sun's \n     article about the Oyster Recovery Partnership's spending \n     raises larger concerns about how NOAA handles its federal \n     grants. ``Is this one example the exception, or is this a \n     widespread problem at NOAA?'' Foster asked. Lautenbacher has \n     taken issue with The Sun's findings, saying in a recent \n     letter to the newspaper that his agency provides adequate \n     oversight of the federal funds provided to the partnership.\n       NOAA officials have pointed to the fact that the \n     partnership has hired an auditor each year to do a standard \n     financial review to comply with federal requirements. In \n     2006, Senator Mikulski asked NOAA for ``an independent \n     audit'' of the partnership. In response, records show, the \n     partnership had its usual accounting firm review its own \n     audit reports from prior years. The firm found its reports to \n     be appropriate.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it has come to mind that NOAA, when they \ndo the grants, lets the grantee set the terms of oversight. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record from NOAA's official \nWeb site their financial assistance application for their grants where \nthey ask the grantee what kind of oversight they want rather than \nsetting it up themselves.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 NOAA Financial Assistance Application\n\n\n                         C. Federal Involvement\n\n       C1. Is the proposed activity going to be conducted in \n     partnership with NOAA or would the proposed activity require \n     NOAA's direct involvement, activity, or oversight? If yes, \n     describe NOAA's involvement, activity, or oversight, \n     including the name of the office or program that is involved.\n       C2. Would the proposed activity involve any other federal \n     agency(ies) partnership, direct involvement, activity, or \n     oversight? If yes, provide the name(s) of the agency(ies) and \n     describe its involvement, activity, or oversight.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, let me describe what has happened. There \nwas an earmark which NOAA believed they did not have the responsibility \nto oversee, since it was an earmark, in terms of rehabitating oyster \nbeds. We have seen from the investigations so far that it has been \nhighly ineffective. But more importantly, what we have seen is \nconflicts of interest in terms of the board that manages the program \nand the ownership of the companies that are given the grant money.\n  I won't go into the details. Senator Mikulski is in agreement that \nthey should be oversighted and looked at and conflict of interest \nshould be eliminated. This amendment is very simple. It just says that \nought to happen and there ought to be a review, there ought to be a \nprohibition of use of NOAA funds for meetings. There is $46,000 yearly \ngoing out for a meeting out of this grant money with no real concern. \nThere is no conflict of interest requirement in the grant authority-\nmaking process at NOAA. So this amendment simply sets out that we ought \nto have basic conflict of interest rules of engagement in the grant-\nmaking process with NOAA.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak, again regretfully, against \nthe Senator's amendment, and I do so first on behalf of Senator Inouye \nas chairman of the Commerce Committee. This is, of course, within the \njurisdiction of the Commerce Committee. The provisions of the amendment \nrelate to the Department of Commerce and NOAA, and the statement I have \nbeen given by Senator Inouye is pretty straightforward and says the \namendment, while possibly based on good intentions, actually causes \nsubstantial harm to numerous NOAA programs and activities and missions.\n  Some of the specifics cited are that the provision requiring that \naudits be posted on the Web within 60 days does not contain safeguards \nfor proprietary information that may have been gathered as a result of \nthe audit. Also, a concern has been raised about the prohibition in \nsection B on the use of NOAA funds for meetings. The provision in the \namendment says:\n\n       No funds made available by the administrator through a \n     grant or contract can be used by the person who received the \n     grant or the contract to attend any conference other than a \n     conference related to training or routine meetings of \n     officers or employees of the administration.\n\n  One of the basic activities scientists and engineers engage in is \ndoing their research and then presenting that research at conferences \nso they can have reaction from their colleagues and their peers and \nhave an interchange about the validity of the work they have done. This \nwould prohibit the use of funds for that purpose, which is one reason \nit would be objectionable.\n  The other concern that has been raised is we are setting up a \nseparate procedure here with regard to handling conflict of interest \nissues at NOAA which would be separate and apart from the general \nprocedures the Federal Government has with regard to grant review \nprocesses. The thought is that those general processes should be made \nto apply and we should not be writing into law, particularly as an \namendment to this legislation, some kind of separate provision and \nrequirement with regard to just this one agency within the Department \nof Commerce\n\n[[Page S5052]]\n\nunder the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what you just heard was a denial that we \nneed oversight and that people shouldn't be accountable for how they \nspend Federal dollars. The fact is, this is one program and one \nmeeting. This doesn't stop meetings. This doesn't stop any legitimate \nfunction. This was a golf tournament and a meeting for 2 days that cost \n$46,000 of Federal funds. I will tell you, NOAA does not have any \nconflict of interest rules presently in their guidelines.\n  So what the Senator is saying is, leave it the way it is today. Let's \ndon't change it. That is exactly the problem, because this didn't come \nthrough the Commerce Committee. They would have fixed it, as Senator \nStevens fixed the fishery boards. Instead, what we are trying to do \nwith this is to fix the same thing Senator Stevens did with the fishery \nboards. Because it didn't come through committee, that didn't get \nattached. Now that we want to attach it on the floor, we don't want to \nhave that done.\n  The fact is, there is no oversight catalyst with these grant \nprograms. By defeating this amendment, we are going to continue saying \nthere is none. If you don't like this amendment, then fix it in \nconference. There is no reason why we shouldn't hold these grants to \nthe light of day. There is no reason why they shouldn't be transparent. \nEverything in this Government should be transparent.\n  There is nothing in these grants that is fiduciary or private that \nshouldn't be exposed. The fact is, if you are going to take money from \nthe Federal Government, the American people ought to know what you do \nwith it. What we are saying is, we don't want that to happen. That is \nwhat defeating this amendment means. It means more secrecy, less \ntransparency. It means, by the way, if there is a financial conflict of \ninterest, don't worry about it, we don't want to hold them accountable.\n  I understand the resistance, but the American people won't understand \nthe resistance. The real problem we are faced with is our Government is \nso big and into so many things that we don't know where it is being \nhandled right or wrong. This is one small step to say there shouldn't \nbe a conflict of interest. There ought to be reporting, there ought to \nbe oversight, which there is not. We ought to be asking the GAO to \noversee it and to look at it. That is all it does.\n  Mr. President, I will rest with the will of the body on that \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Oklahoma \nwould permit me a couple of minutes to comment on something.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I want to describe how this bill got to \nthe floor because it has been suggested it might not have come through \ncommittee. The energy parts of this bill were fully considered by the \nEnergy Committee when it was chaired by Senator Domenici last year, and \nit was then reported to the Senate in March. The Commerce Committee \nparts of it were fully considered by the Commerce Committee in May or \nJune and reported to the full Senate then. The only parts of the \nlegislation that didn't go through the regular committee process were \nfrom the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. That was the decision \nof that committee to do that. They had a series of roundtables and a \nseries of meetings and made recommendations to the working group.\n  The working group then had meetings with the administration \nofficials, and Senator Domenici presided over most of them--we called \nthem homework sessions--and then Senator Frist and Senator Reid \nintroduced this legislation last October. It has been public all that \ntime. Then Senator Reid and Senator McConnell introduced the \nlegislation in January of this year, and it has been public all that \ntime.\n  I wanted to make sure it was known that this is legislation that has \nbeen fully exposed to the light of day, whatever the merits. I am not \ncommenting on the merits of the comments of the Senator from Oklahoma, \nbut I did want everyone to be reminded of the process through which \nthis went to get to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 921\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and that amendment No. 921 be called up.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the amendment \nwill be set aside, and the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes amendment \n     No. 921.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To discontinue the Advanced Technology Program of the \n            National Institute of Standards and Technology)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DISCONTINUATION OF THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--Section 28 of the Act of March 3, 1901 (15 \n     U.S.C. 278n) is repealed.\n       (b) Unobligated Balances.--Any amounts appropriated for the \n     Advanced Technology Program of the National Institute of \n     Standards and Technology, which are unobligated as of the \n     effective date of this section, shall be deposited in the \n     General Fund of the Treasury of the United States for debt \n     reduction.\n       (c) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect on the \n     date that is 90 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is an amendment to eliminate the \nAdvanced Technology Program. I see the Senator from Michigan is here, \nand I am sure she will mount a rigorous defense in regard to it.\n  There are some things people should be aware of. We had an oversight \nhearing on this program in my Federal Financial Management \nSubcommittee. We showed it to be ineffective. Between 1990 and 2004, 35 \npercent of the $2 billion of this program went to Fortune 500 \ncompanies--Fortune 500 companies--with 65 percent of the grants under \nthis program never being asked to be funded outside of the program. In \nother words, they never went to the private sector. Almost two-thirds \nnever attempted to get funding in the private sector.\n  This was a program that was designed to help with technology. It \nwasn't designed to be a corporate welfare program. In fact, what has \nhappened is that five companies since 1990 have consumed $376 million \nof this money. Let me tell you who the companies were. They were: \nGeneral Motors, hardly in need of taxpayer money to fund research; IBM, \nhardly in need of taxpayer money to fund research; General Electric, \nhardly in need of taxpayer money to fund research; Minnesota Mining, \n3M; and Motorola. Their combined revenues yearly are in excess of $50 \nbillion.\n  We are going to see a large defense of this program, because there \nhave been some instances where it has done some good. I don't deny \nthat. But for the $2 billion we have spent on it, what have we gotten? \nThe House has eliminated this program, by the way. We decreased it over \nthe last 2 years. This is a program that is not working efficiently, is \nnot working effectively, and we are not getting great return for our \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, with that, I will withhold the rest of my comments and \nretain the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator yield for 30 seconds to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico?\n  Mr. COBURN. I believe you all still have time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I intend to vote for your NOAA amendment, and I \ncompliment you on what it does. I do think you have some merit in the \nother amendments, including the last one. It is just very hard to do \nthat kind of thing now on this bill.\n  I think you have raised some real points about that big program. We \nought to be careful when we have a $2 billion program, and we are not. \nIt is not getting out there to small and independent businesses that \nhave to go and seek private assistance, and you have made good points. \nIt is just hard to do it on this bill.\n  The NOAA amendment, I am telling you in advance, I am for you.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator for his comments. I would note that \nthe House didn't find it hard to eliminate ATP on their component piece \nof legislation that will be matched up with\n\n[[Page S5053]]\n\nthis and, in fact, last year we eliminated ATP in the funding cycle on \nthe appropriations side.\n  I know there are some positive things about the program, but overall \nit is a poor investment for the Federal taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at the present time, and I reserve \nthe remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership role Senator \nBingaman and Senator Alexander are playing on this critical bill, as \nwell as Senator Domenici and others who have worked on putting together \nthis legislation.\n  It makes no sense to eliminate the Advanced Technology Program. In \nfact, the House is renaming it but extending the very same approach in \nterms of a partnership for the kind of research that takes place after \nbasic research.\n  I might say that 65 percent of the ATP awards have gone to small \nbusinesses, many of them small- and medium-sized manufacturers. The \nreality is that, yes, our large employers and small have joined \ntogether with universities, with the Federal Government, and with \nFederal labs to do partnerships where the Federal Government puts up \nhalf the money and they put up half the money to do the kinds of \nresearch to move the industry forward in order to be able to compete in \na global economy.\n  Frankly, this is one of the areas where we are woefully behind, I \nwould suggest to my friend from Oklahoma. We are woefully behind. One \nexample of this is in advanced battery technology. While we are \ndeveloping the basic science in the United States, it is Japan and \nChina and South Korea that are taking the next steps to make those \nbatteries. A $50 million investment in Japan alone; a 5-year commitment \nfrom China of over $100 million; a 5-year commitment from South Korea \nof over $100 million. Yet in our budget in the United States we have \n$11 million to focus on what is one of the most critical parts of \ntechnology to move forward on alternative fuels and new breakthroughs.\n  ATP is different. It is unique among Federal research programs. Most \nresearch is focused on advanced scientific knowledge, but there is a \nvery long road from scientific discovery in a university lab to the \ncommercialization of that product. This is in between that. You might \ncall it a bridge project, or a bridge loan. This is that in-between \nperiod before industry feels confident enough to pick it up and move \nforward with it.\n  The goal of ATP is to push basic research knowledge into the \ninnovation pipeline. That is what it is all about. When we add more \ndollars to increase basic research, we have to make sure we are also \nnot creating a bottleneck in that innovation pipeline. We have to be \nable to fund the next step in that partnership. I would suggest this \nhas been a tremendous investment in terms of what has actually \nhappened.\n  The ATP programs have succeeded in a wide range of fields. There is \nno question, when you are doing this research it is basic research. By \nthe way, we give the R tax credit to those same large companies my \ncolleagues spoke about. We give it to large companies and small \ncompanies to do basic research--no different. This is the next step.\n  We have seen wide-ranging successes. They have already delivered on \ncheaper, better bone marrow transplants, mammograms, cartilage repair. \nThey are enabling companies to make biodegradable plastics from corn, \nimproving manufacturing, and powering longer lasting lightweight fuel \ncells, all of which are critical for our future.\n  The Advanced Technology Program has made investments in \nnanotechnology. They were making them long before anybody knew what \nnanotechnology was, along with investments in homeland security and \nbringing fuel cells and solar cells and microturbines to the \nmarketplace.\n  In 2003, the White House sponsored a fuel cell demonstration, and the \nPresident tested a long-life mobile phone. The phone the President \ntested was powered by advanced fuel cell technology. Without the \nadvanced technology program, MTI microfuel cells would not have been \ndeveloped. This breakthrough technology was developed to power the very \nphone the President was holding. It would not have happened without \nthat joint partnership with ATP.\n  There are certainly other companies where ATP projects have not been \nsuccessful. That is the nature of high-risk, high-payoff research \nprograms, and people around the world know that. Governments around the \nworld know that. Right now, I should add, our companies are competing \nwith governments around the world, governments that own companies, \ngovernments that are doing these kinds of research.\n  Let's put the successes and failures in the overall context. A 2003 \nsurvey of over 350 companies indicates the actual economic value \nresulting from ATP joint ventures exceeded $7.5 billion. The ATP annual \nreport showed the program has generated $17 billion in economic \nbenefits from just 41 of the 736 completed projects.\n  In conclusion, this is a program that works. We should not be cutting \noff this investment in innovation in America.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico has \nclose to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time on the side of the Senator from Oklahoma?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma has 21 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me go ahead and use the remainder of our time in \nopposition to the amendments, and then the Senator from Oklahoma can \nuse as much additional time as he would like, obviously.\n  I agree with the comments the Senator from Michigan has just made \nabout the ATP program. I do think one of our weaknesses historically, \nparticularly in recent decades in this country, is although we have \ndone reasonably well on basic research, we have not done as well in \ntaking that basic research the next step and getting it to a point \nwhere it can be commercialized and manufacturing can occur in this \ncountry.\n  I have a chart I was going to show. Let me put up the chart and try \nto make the point as to where the advanced technology program is in the \ndevelopment cycle, as I understand it. This chart tries to point out \nthe venture capital funds focused on late-stage research.\n  There are five different categories represented on this chart: seed \nfunding, startup funding, other early stage, expansion, and then later \nstage.\n  Regarding venture capital funding, the higher bars on the chart, of \ncourse, are in the later stage. The seed funding and the startup \nfunding are the two areas on which the Advanced Technology Program \nconcentrates. It does so in a way which is intended to get the very \nbest results.\n  These programs are peer-reviewed. There is real competition, rigorous \npeer-reviewed competition in the allocation of this money. The funds go \nto those researchers and those technologists who are most likely to be \nable to take these basic discoveries and turn them into commercial \nproducts and commercial services. There are many examples of successes \nin this area.\n  Unfortunately, we do not have as many today that we can point to, \nrelative to the rest of the world, as we used to have. The competition, \nfrankly, between ourselves and many of our competitors, is very severe \nat this point. When you go to a country such as Japan and look at the \nextent of the Government's support of this kind of technology \ndevelopment, it is extremely impressive. We shy away from that. We say \nwe are not going to help; it is up to our individual companies to do \nthe best they can. Sometimes they do well, sometimes they do poorly. \nBut the Advanced Technology Program helps them to do better. It has \nbeen a very good investment.\n  The Academies of Science did a report looking at this very thing a \nfew\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\nyears ago. Their expert panel included top executives from companies \nsuch as Intel and Xerox and groups such as Sematech, venture \ncapitalists, also academic researchers. They concluded the following:\n\n       The Advanced Technology Program is an effective Federal \n     partnership program. The selection criteria applied by the \n     program enabled it to meet broad national needs and to help \n     ensure that the benefits of successful awards extend across \n     firms and industries. Its costshared, industry-driven \n     approach to funding promising new technological opportunities \n     has shown considerable success in advancing technologies that \n     can contribute to important societal goals such as improved \n     health diagnostics, developing tools to exploit the human \n     genome, and improving the efficiency and competitiveness of \n     U.S. manufacturing.\n\n  This is a program I think deserves the increased levels of support \nthat are contemplated in this legislation. I urge my colleagues to \nresist the amendment of the Senator to delete funding for the Advanced \nTechnology Program.\n  Is there still time on my side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 17 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am somewhat perplexed. We had a debate \non Medicare Part D. The debate was about corporate welfare. I find it \nhard to believe that we want to continue to fund General Electric and \nIBM and Intel and all these other companies with taxpayer money after \nwe have claimed we do not want to do corporate welfare.\n  Tell me where in that process--if the Senator from New Mexico would \ncare to put his sign back up--this money is? Tell me why an IBM needs \nmoney at that stage. Tell me why a General Electric needs taxpayer \nmoney at that stage, money that is going to go to them. They have all \nthe resources. IBM just announced they are buying back 10 percent of \ntheir stock. They have plenty of cash. They are buying back their \nstock. Tell me why, in a time when we have a $300 billion deficit, $300 \nbillion we borrowed from two generations from now, that we should give \na penny to IBM, corporate welfare to enhance anything. They have all \nthe resources they need. Tell me why we should give a penny to General \nElectric or Intel or any of those large companies that consume 30 \npercent of this money.\n  If we want to have an Advanced Technology Program, why wouldn't we \nsay, yes, we will do it, but you have to be at a certain size. You have \nto truly not be able to access the capital markets. They have no \nproblems accessing the capital markets for research. So what we are \ndoing is taking from two generations from now and giving it to the \nrichest corporations in this country and making ourselves feel good \nbecause it wouldn't happen otherwise. It will happen otherwise. That is \nwhat markets are all about.\n  I will be happy to have the Senator respond to my question.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am happy to respond. I would respond \nby saying we are not providing funds to particular companies so they \ncan compete effectively. What we are doing is saying there are sectors \nof U.S. industry which are in very substantial competition with their \ncounterparts worldwide. Whether it is the automobile industry, whether \nit is the semiconductor industry, whether it is the biologics industry, \nwhatever the area is, we have companies in our country that are \ncompeting in those areas, and there is early stage research and seed \ndevelopment--early stage development into which they should be putting \nsignificant efforts.\n  When you look at it from the point of any individual company, it \nmight not make that much sense to say we are going to devote a \nsubstantial portion of our research dollars to this because it is long \nterm. It may not pay off in 10 years. It may never pay off. But here we \ncan use some taxpayer dollars to prime the pump, so to speak, and to go \nto these companies on a cost-shared basis and say: You guys get \ntogether. We will help you develop advanced battery technology because \notherwise we may eliminate our dependence on foreign oil. But we are \ngoing to become dependent on foreign battery cells. That is not good \nfor the U.S. economy as a whole.\n  If General Motors happens to be one of the participants in that \nconsortium of companies that is working on that advanced battery \ntechnology, then so much the better. But I do not consider that \ncorporate welfare. I consider that good, intelligent allocation of our \nresources in order to keep our industry competitive in the world \nmarketplace.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me reclaim my time. I thank the Senator for answering \nmy question. I guess the difference is, in the long run, where is the \nbenefit? If any of those industries are going to survive, they are \ngoing to be putting research dollars into those areas already. That is \nmy contention. We know from the studies that, of all the Fortune 500 \ncompanies, the money that has been given to them they would have spent \nanyway. This is just money that they don't have to spend because we are \ngoing to spend American taxpayer dollars on it. The fact is, anybody in \nany of those areas, especially major companies that have all the \ncapital resources they need--they have an inherent self-interest to \nfund that research. Why? Because their livelihood and their existence \ndepends on it.\n  What we are doing is we are saying, for the big companies, the \nFortune 500 companies, we are going to take away their risk. The market \nhas already created the risk. Their risk is to develop the program. So \nI would disagree. I think it is corporate welfare, especially with \nregard to the Fortune 500 companies that have significant assets.\n  All you have to do is look at what is out there today, look at the \nshare buy-backs. They have more than enough money with which to fund \nall these things.\n  I can give you specific examples from GE, IBM, and Intel. All of \nthose projects were going to be funded anyway. We just gave them a \ngift. We just simply gave them a gift.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if he will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Here is the information I am given. I would cite this \nto the Senator and ask if he has a reason to disagree.\n\n  Of the single applicant awards under the Advanced Technology Program, \n78 percent have gone to small businesses, 11 percent have gone to \nmedium-size businesses and nonprofits, and only 11 percent of solo \nawards have gone to large businesses. Is that accurate?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is inaccurate; 21 percent of the ATP grants over the \nlast 14 years went to Fortune 500 companies.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is 21 percent over the last 14 years?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is contrary to the information I was given. I \nthank the Senator for yielding for the question.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me just summarize, and then I will yield back the \nremainder of my time. How much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 14\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to yield after I finish this last \nstatement, and I appreciate the managers of this bill for the time they \nhave given me on these amendments, and their courtesy.\n  There is no question, there are positive aspects of this program. I \nsaid that before. The question comes--and it really comes from what \nSenator Stabenow said. We already give them an R tax credit. They \nalready get a direct writeoff for doing this research anyway. So the \nAmerican taxpayers are already paying for it. Now we come along and \ngive them more.\n  The point is, we do not need both. We do not need both. IBM gets an \nR tax credit, and then they get money from us under ATP for things \nthey were going to do anyway. General Electric gets an R tax credit, \nthen they get money from us in the ATP program for these things they \nare going to do anyway.\n  I believe there has to come a time when we start thinking about how \nwe spend our money and whether we are getting a good return. The fact \nis, with ATP, overall, all the money we have spent, we have not gotten \nback a return.\n  The other point I would make is, only four States have received about \n60 percent of the money on this ATP program. Ironic, isn't it? Four \nStates. So\n\n[[Page S5055]]\n\nthere is great consensus among those people on a parochial basis to \nsupport this program because it is a big program for those individual \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I will finish by saying that all three amendments I \nhave offered today are designed to increase transparency, increase \naccountability, eliminate conflicts of interests, and eliminate \nwasteful Government spending. That is what we have to be about if we, \nin fact, want to leave the heritage to our children and grandchildren \nthat we will receive by such great sacrifice of those people who came \nbefore us. That is the real deal. The way you leave a heritage is to \nsacrifice today. We cannot have everything we want today if we want our \nkids and grandkids to have what we have experienced.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders.) The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Georgia has an \namendment he wishes to speak to and offer and proposes to withdraw. I \nwill yield in a moment for him to do that. But let me ask unanimous \nconsent that following his statement and his action, the votes in \nrelation to the pending amendments occur in the following order: DeMint \namendment No. 930, Coburn amendment No. 918, Coburn amendment No. 921, \nCoburn amendment No. 922, and Kohl amendment No. 942; that no amendment \nbe in order to these amendments prior to the vote or to this final Kohl \namendment prior to the vote; that prior to each vote in the sequence \nlisted here, there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form; that after the first vote in the \nsequence, the remaining votes be 10-minute votes; further, that \nprovisions of previous orders governing these amendments remain in \neffect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  I rise today to propose and then to withdraw an amendment that will \nmake sure our Nation's historically Black colleges and universities, \nour HBCUs, are not overlooked in this important bill, the America \nCOMPETES Act of 2007.\n  In the State of Georgia, we have eight HBCUs: Albany State \nUniversity, Clark Atlanta University, Fort Valley State University, \nMorehouse College, Savannah State University, Spelman College, Paine \nCollege, and Morris Brown College.\n  This is a pretty simple amendment which would simply ensure that the \nHBCUs are included in the study by the National Academy of Sciences on \nbarriers and innovations to advanced technologies. Specifically, I want \nto make sure we are able to find and highlight what HBCUs are doing \nnationally to equip their students with the knowledge and skills to \ncompete in the 21st century workforce.\n  The underlying bill would establish a President's Council on \nInnovation and Competitiveness. My amendment simply includes HBCUs in \nthe Council's recommendation for strengthening innovation and \ncompetitiveness capabilities in academia.\n  I wish to specifically highlight two examples of programs at Spelman \nCollege in Atlanta. Established in 1987, the Spelman College Women In \nScience and Engineering--or WISE--Scholars Program is a model student \ndevelopment effort that has successfully facilitated the recruitment, \nretention, and graduation of more than 200 African-American females \npursuing baccalaureate degrees in sciences, mathematics, or a dual \ndegree in engineering. The WISE Program addresses a national need to \nincrease the prevalence of underrepresented racial minorities and women \nin science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines, while \nstrengthening Spelman's capacity to continue to serve as a national \nconduit for the human resources needed to sustain the country's global \neconomic competitiveness. The WISE Program continues Spelman's \nimportant role in providing the Nation with a skilled scientific \nworkforce.\n  As part of the American Competitiveness Initiative, unveiled during \nlast years's State of the Union Address, the President called upon the \nNation to, one, double the Federal commitment to the most critical \nbasic research programs in the physical sciences; two, make permanent \nthe research and development tax credit; and three, train 70,000 high \nschool teachers to lead advanced-placement courses in math and science \nand bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms.\n  Both the National Science Foundation and National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration believe Spelman's WISE Scholars Program is the \nvehicle to meet the Nation's increasing need for math and science \nteachers. Also, in 2003, NASA awarded the college with a $4.5 million \ngrant to enhance its WISE Scholars Program.\n  In 2005, six Spelman women qualified for the international RoboCup \n2005 four-legged robot soccer competition in Osaka, Japan. The students \ncreated computer programs for the robots to compete in the soccer \ntournament, requiring the robots to play without human intervention. Of \nthe 24 teams that qualified internationally, the SpelBots, as the team \nwas called, were the first and only historically Black college and \nuniversity, the only all-women institution, and the only U.S. \nundergraduate institution to qualify for the tournament. When looking \nback years from now at historically Black colleges and robotics \nresearch, all searches will lead to Spelman.\n  Mr. President, these are just two examples of what is taking place at \nour HBCUs all across our country. That is why I believe HBCUs and \nprograms such as these should be included in the recommendations by the \nPresident's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness.\n  Now, I am going to withdraw this amendment because I have had a \ndiscussion with the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from New \nMexico, and I think they are probably right that this might be more \nappropriate as we reauthorize the Higher Education Act, which I \nunderstand will be marked up in the HELP Committee here within the next \ncouple of weeks, in all probability. So I am going to withdraw the \namendment. But I do wish to put this body on notice that we need to \nrecognize the contributions our HBCUs are making in math, science, and \ntechnology, and that is a critical component of this bill. It will also \nbe a critical component of the Higher Education Act. At that point I \nwill be bringing this amendment forward to highlight those men and \nwomen who are at our HBCUs and the contribution they are making to \nmath, science, and technology innovation.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \nhis leadership on the issue of competitiveness. He has been one of the \nforemost advocates for this legislation, which has made its way through \nso many committees and reached the floor, and we are close to passage \ntoday. I thank him as well for his consistent advocacy for historically \nBlack colleges and universities of which Georgia has several of the \nmost prominent. He has talked to me and other members of the HELP \nCommittee about that. He is exactly right. Reauthorization of the \nhigher education bill is fairly imminent. Hopefully in the next couple \nof weeks we will begin to mark up a bill. Senator Chambliss has made it \nclear he expects the committee to take seriously his amendment. I have \nassured\n\n[[Page S5056]]\n\nhim that for my part, the committee will. I know Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Enzi feel the same way. Senator Warner of Virginia has also \nnoted he wants to make certain that what we do in this legislation \ntakes into account historically Black colleges and universities. He, \ntoo, is looking toward the Higher Education Act reauthorization. It is \nvery helpful of both of them to, in this case, take the floor and in \nother conversations to make us aware of what needs to happen as that \nact comes up in the next couple of weeks. The Chambliss amendment and \nhis advocacy will be an important part of the discussion. I thank him \nfor his leadership.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 930\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate on amendment No. 930 offered by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Mr. DeMint.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me take the lead in opposition to \nthe amendment. This is the amendment that would set up a new 60-vote \npoint of order on any appropriations bill that comes to the floor with \nanything contained in it that could be designated a congressional \nearmark. Unfortunately, the definition of congressional earmark set out \nin the amendment is very broad. It basically says: If you are \nspecifying money going to an entity, either in the language of the \nappropriations bill or in the report accompanying it, and it relates to \nitems being authorized in this legislation, the objection could be made \nthat you had to have 60 votes. So you would have one set of rules for \nmost appropriations bills and a different set of rules for \nappropriations bills that would include appropriations relevant to this \ncompetitiveness bill. It would be a very bad policy. I urge colleagues \nto oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am strongly opposed to the amendment \noffered by the junior Senator from South Carolina, which would prohibit \ncongressional earmarks of funds appropriated, pursuant to \nauthorizations in this bill, for the America Competes Act. The effect \nof the amendment proposed by the Senator from South Carolina could be \nwaived or suspended in the Senate only by a 60-vote supermajority.\n  If this amendment were agreed to, it would set up two criteria for \nall appropriations legislation, pursuant to authorizations in the \nAmerica Competes Act--one criterion requiring a simple majority vote \nfor Presidential budget recommendations and another criterion requiring \na supermajority of 60 votes for congressional earmarks, which, \naccording to this legislative provision, is virtually anything that \nCongress changes from the President's budget request.\n  Under the Constitution of the United States, the Congress has the \npower of the purse. The Senate should jealously guard that prerogative. \nOur system of government includes checks and balances that have served \nus well through over 200 years as a Republic. And the power of the \npurse is a check on the ambitions of the executive branch.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate considered comprehensive ethics reform. \nIt passed with an overwhelming majority of 96-2. In addition, the \nSenate Appropriations Committee has announced a new policy of increased \ntransparency and accountability in regard to earmarks, which uses the \nsame definition of earmarks contained in the ethics bill that was \nadopted overwhelmingly on the floor of the U.S. Senate. These changes \nin the appropriations process are intended to help restore confidence \nin the Congress. It ends ``business as usual'' in Washington. It \nrestores integrity to the appropriations process. It will increase \naccountability and openness. Moreover, Senators will be required to \ncertify that neither they nor their spouses have a financial interest \nin any earmark. I have asked Senators to submit a letter to Senator \nCochran and me certifying they have no financial interest in a project \nbeing proposed for an earmark. Those letters will be available for \npublic inspection.\n  Earmark disclosure, as important as it is, is only one part of a much \nbroader package of ethics reforms that has already passed the Senate. \nThis includes strengthened gift and travel rules for Members of the \nSenate, strengthened lobbying disclosure, and outlawing some of the \nnotorious lobbying abuses in which Mr. Abramoff and others were \ninvolved. We should not cherry pick this legislation. It needs to be \nenacted as a whole.\n  In the meantime, I would like to remind my colleagues that when we \nconsidered the joint funding resolution earlier this year, which \nincluded all of the pending appropriations bills from the previous \nRepublican-controlled Congress that had yet to be enacted, the House \nAppropriations Chairman, Mr. Obey, and I made a bold move and \neliminated 9,300 earmarks that were in bills authored when the Senator \nfrom South Carolina was in the majority. We eliminated every single one \nof them--all 9,300 earmarks. The joint funding resolution, which was \nsigned into law on February 15, 2007, contained no new earmarks.\n  In summary, the process of earmarking funds has gotten out of \ncontrol. The status quo is not satisfactory. That is why I have taken \nthe initiative to establish new standards for transparency and \naccountability. That is why I joined with House Appropriations \nCommittee Chairman David Obey to eliminate earmarks from the fiscal \n2007 funding resolution.\n  I strongly oppose the amendment from the Senator from South Carolina. \nThe Senate has already voted on an ethics reform package that revises \nthe method by which earmarks will be considered. The Senate \nAppropriations Committee has already put in place rules that will \nincrease the transparency and accountability for earmarks in the fiscal \n2008 process. But most of all, I oppose the amendment by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina because it would establish two criteria for \nearmarks--those proposed by the President would require only a simple \nmajority, while those proposed by the Congress, in which the power of \nthe purse resides, would require a 60-vote supermajority.\n  The Framers of our Constitution chose to give the power of the purse \nto the Congress for a reason. They did not want an overbearing, \nunaccountable executive branch.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject the proposal by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for all \nhis work on this bill. The question is, after we have gone through \nthese many months of work on this bill to make America more competitive \nand we have directed funds to the Federal agencies that we think are \nmost appropriate and would be most helpful in raising the quality and \nskill level of our labor force, do we want it to happen? Do we want \nthis authorization bill to be implemented as we have written it? As the \nsponsors have been very careful to point out, this is an authorization \nbill, not an appropriations bill. What my amendment does is ensure that \nthis bill is carried out the way it is authorized and that the \nappropriators do not take money for the National Science Foundation and \nsay: I want some to go to my State or to this university, and we spread \nit out instead of using the merit-based peer review process. We change \na bill that has a lot of thought and bipartisan support, and we \nbasically turn it over to the appropriators to change. If Members want \nthis bill implemented the way it is written, please support the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n930.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, this amendment is one which I think \nwould be bad policy, a bad precedent for us here in the Senate. It \nbasically puts a hard and fast, drop-dead date on any legislation \ncontained in this bill and says there is a sunset provision so that any \nprogram authorized here, any kind of activity permitted under this \nlegislation, would be prohibited following that date in 2011. It is not \nthe kind of sunset we would normally adopt on legislation. I don't \nthink it is appropriate here. I urge colleagues to oppose the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In my view, this would be a \nvery bad step for us to take. I know there are some Members who do not \nbelieve this is a worthwhile use of taxpayers' dollars. I am not one of \nthose. I believe the Federal Government should partner with industry to \nassist in the early stages of technology development, and particularly \nthat is important when we compete with other countries that spend \nheavily to assist their industrial sectors to compete in world markets.\n  So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, there is no question the ATP program has \nhad some successes. The fact is that over $2.5 billion has gone to \nFortune 500 companies over the last 14 years for research they would \nhave done otherwise. This is a program which is outmoded. We have a way \nto help businesses do research and development. It is called the R \ntax credit. This is not effective. It is a poor way to spend our money.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. President, we inadvertently left a cleared \namendment off the list I read describing the managers' package. I ask \nunanimous consent that amendment No. 956 be agreed to and that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 956) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding concerns that \n  United States capital markets are losing their competitive edge in \nintensifying global competition, and to recommend that Congress and the \n   Administration take the necessary steps to reclaim the preeminent \n    position of the United States in the global financial services \n                              marketplace)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CAPITAL MARKETS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) United States capital markets are losing their \n     competitive edge in the face of intensifying global \n     competition, posing a risk to economic growth, a problem that \n     is well-documented in initial public offerings (IPO), over-\n     the-counter (OTC) derivatives, securitization, and \n     traditional lending;\n       (2) according to the Senator Charles E. Schumer and Mayor \n     Michael R. Bloomberg report, entitled ``Sustaining New York's \n     and the U.S.'s Global Financial Services Leadership'', ``In \n     looking at several of the critical contested investment \n     banking and sales and trading markets--initial public \n     offerings (IPOs), over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, and \n     debt--it is clear that the declining position of the U.S. \n     goes beyond this natural market evolution to more \n     controllable, intrinsic issues of U.S. competitiveness. As \n     market effectiveness, liquidity and safety become more \n     prevalent in the world's financial markets, the competitive \n     arena for financial services is shifting toward a new set of \n     factors--like availability of skilled people and a balanced \n     and effective legal and regulatory environment--where the \n     U.S. is moving in the wrong direction.'';\n       (3) further, the report referred to in paragraph (2) stated \n     that--\n       (A) ``The IPO market also offers the most dramatic \n     illustration of the change in capital-raising needs around \n     the world, and U.S. exchanges are rapidly losing ground to \n     foreign rivals. When looking at all IPOs that took place \n     globally in 2006, the share of IPO volume attracted by U.S. \n     exchanges is barely one-third of that captured in 2001. By \n     contrast, the global share of IPO volume captured by European \n     exchanges has expanded by more than 30 percent over the same \n     period, while non-Japan Asian markets have doubled their \n     equivalent market share since 2001. When one considers mega-\n     IPOs--those over $1 billion--U.S. exchanges attracted 57 \n     percent of such transactions in 2001, compared with just 16 \n     percent during the first ten months of 2006.''; and\n       (B) ``London already enjoys clear leadership in the fast-\n     growing and innovative over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives \n     market. This is significant because of the trading flow that \n     surrounds derivatives markets and because of the innovation \n     these markets drive, both of which are key competitive \n     factors for financial centers. Dealers and investors \n     increasingly see derivatives and cash markets as \n     interchangeable and are therefore combining trading \n     operations for both products. Indeed, the derivatives markets \n     can be more liquid than the underlying cash markets. \n     Therefore, as London takes the global lead in derivatives, \n     America's competitiveness in both cash and derivatives flow \n     trading is at risk, as is its position as a center for \n     financial innovation.'';\n       (4) on March 13, 2007, the Department of the Treasury \n     convened a conference on United States capital markets \n     competitiveness, where--\n       (A) key policymakers, consumer advocates, members of the \n     international community, business representatives, and \n     academic experts, each with different perspectives, discussed \n     ways to keep United States capital markets the strongest and \n     most innovative in the world; and\n       (B) conference delegates examined the impact of the United \n     States regulatory structure and philosophy, the legal and \n     corporate governance environment, and the auditing profession \n     and financial reporting on United States capital markets \n     competitiveness;\n       (5) the foundation of any competitive capital market is \n     investor confidence, and since 1930, the United States has \n     required some of the most extensive financial disclosures, \n     supported by one of the most robust enforcement regimes in \n     the world;\n       (6) a balanced regulatory system is essential to protecting \n     investors and the efficient functioning of capital markets; \n     and\n       (7) too much regulation stifles entrepreneurship, \n     competition, and innovation, and too little regulation \n     creates excessive risk to industry, investors, and the \n     overall system.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Congress, the President, regulators, industry leaders, \n     and other stakeholders should take the necessary steps to \n     reclaim the preeminent position of the United States in the \n     global financial services marketplace;\n       (2) the Federal and State financial regulatory agencies \n     should, to the maximum extent possible, coordinate activities \n     on significant policy matters, so as not to impose \n     regulations that may have adverse unintended consequences on \n     innovativeness with respect to financial products, \n     instruments, and services, or that impose regulatory costs \n     that are disproportionate to their benefits, and, at the same \n     time, ensure that the regulatory framework overseeing the \n     United States capital markets continues to promote and \n     protect the interests of investors in those markets; and\n       (3) given the complexity of the financial services \n     marketplace today, Congress should exercise vigorous \n     oversight over Federal regulatory and statutory requirements \n     affecting the financial services industry and consumers, with \n     the goal of eliminating excessive regulation and problematic \n     implementation of existing laws and regulations, while \n     ensuring that necessary investor protections are not \n     compromised.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague Senator Crapo \nin offering our Sense of the Senate to express that the Congress and \nthe administration take the necessary steps to sustain the United \nStates' position as the global leader in financial services to S. 761.\n  We can all agree that the U.S. is the financial capital of the world. \nToday, Wall Street is booming, and our Nation's short-term economic \noutlook is strong. But to maintain our success far into the future we \nmust immediately address a real and growing concern: our global \ncompetitive position in the capital markets is being threatened.\n  The evidence is quite clear.\n  London, certainly our greatest competitor, has been working hard to \ngain on us in financial services in the last few years. And, although \nLondon has not overtaken us, it is no longer a distant second.\n  While New York is still the dominant global exchange center, we have \nbeen losing ground as the leader in capital formation. In 2005, only \none out of the top 24 IPOs was registered in the U.S. and four were \nregistered in London.\n  Sadly, the problem is not just IPOs. Our competitive position is \nbeing challenged in most businesses that are globally contestable.\n  Today London leads in some of the fastest growing and innovative \nareas in the financial services. They account for 70 percent of the \nglobal secondary bond market, 40 percent of the derivatives market, 30 \npercent of foreign exchange activity, and 30 percent of cross border \nequities trading.\n  Why is this happening? Not because London is more innovative--New \nYork City is and 49 percent of the top CEOs say so. But, what they also \nsay is--given the risks associated with developing innovative financial \ninstruments and the importance of attracting talent in finance--the \nU.S.'s legal, regulatory and immigration policies are not attractive \nand it only makes sense to pursue cutting edge activity overseas. To \nmake matters even worse, it is not only London. As technology has \nvirtually eliminated barriers to the flow of capital, it now freely \nflows to the most efficient markets, in all corners of the globe. So, \nin addition to London we're increasingly competing for position against \ncities like Hong Kong, Tokyo and Bombay.\n  My concern about this issue has been keeping me awake at night. For \nover a year now I have been racking my brain, trying to understand the \ncauses and fixes needed to keep us No. 1.\n  Well . . . that is precisely what Mayor Bloomberg and I set out to do \nin\n\n[[Page S5065]]\n\na more formal way when we commissioned McKinsey Consulting to conduct a \nstudy to examine the competitive position of New York City's financial \nservices industry, specifically in comparison to London's. The study \nidentified the drivers that might cause New York City to lose its \ncompetitive edge, but more importantly provided recommendations and an \naction plan to correct the problem.\n  We gathered detailed analyses of market conditions here and abroad. \nMcKinsey interviewed and consulted more than 50 respected leaders from \nthe financial services industry, consumer and labor groups, and other \nstakeholders.\n  Our report which was released in January illustrated the reality of \nthe situation. The U.S., New York in particular, is in grave danger of \nlosing its status as the financial capital of the world without a major \nchange in policy and regulation. If we continue on with the status quo, \nwithin the next ten years we will go from being number one, to becoming \na marginalized regional market--spelling disaster for New York and the \nentire country.\n  Financial services comprise 8 percent of the U.S. economy--the third \nfastest growing sector of the U.S. economy. The industry also plays an \nimportant intermediary role in promoting economic activity and creating \njobs (savings, investment, borrowing, capital formation, wealth \naccumulation, transactions). 1 in every 19 jobs in the U.S. is in \nfinancial services.\n  This clearly is not just a New York issue. Many of you will be \nsurprised to learn, just as I was--that seven states (Connecticut, \nMassachusetts, Delaware, Rhode Island, North Carolina, South Dakota), \nincluding New York, have more than 10 percent of their State's GDP \ndevoted to financial services.\n  Resolving this issue will require all hands on deck. In New York we \nalready recognize that--the Mayor, the Governor, and I have already \njoined forces.\n  I strongly believe that we are in a good position to act now in order \nto lessen the damage that could be waiting for us 10 years down the \nroad.\n  Cleary, this is an issue that will take some time to work through--\ntaking on our country's regulatory regime, legal system and immigration \npolicies will be no easy undertaking. In recognizing the complexities, \nour report focused on near term recommendations that are mostly \nadministrative and the longer term recommendations that are \nlegislative.\n  I want to commend Secretary Paulson and the Department of Treasury \nfor convening a conference on United States capital markets' \ncompetitiveness. I hope this will build more momentum for other \nfinancial services regulators and Congress to take action and sends a \nsignal that we are in need of a renewed U.S. focus on competitiveness.\n  We deed to take action to level the playing field for both domestic \nand foreign companies doing business in the United States, to address \nmore complex policy, legal, regulatory and other structural issues \naffecting the U.S. position as the world's leading financial center. We \nmust create a responsive, market-oriented regulatory framework, moving \ncloser towards a fair and predictable legal environment, and provide \naccess to skilled professionals from outside of the U.S.\n  I want to thank my friend and colleague Senator Crapo for his \ncommitment and leadership on this issue. I look forward to working with \nyou over the next several months to protect our capital markets--this \nis not a Democrat or Republican issue, it's an American issue.\n  The bottom line is that we, in New York and in the U.S., literally \ncannot afford to lose our place as the global leader in financial \nservices and we must examine which factors impede our competitive \nstanding.\n  At the same time, we have to be smart, careful, and balanced as we \nseek to continue to redefine the exquisite balance of innovation and \nregulation as markets evolve internationally.\n  We know that addressing these challenges and ensuring that we do so \nin a way that continues to offer strong protections to consumers and \ninvestors will be a huge undertaking. But if all stakeholders--\nindustry, consumer advocates, labor, and government--come together in \nthe name of securing our economic future, we can do it.\n  Failing to do so would be dereliction of duty.\n  We must all commit to seeking a shift in national policy in a \ndirection that will ensure that New York and America retain its \nleadership position in the financial services industry well into the \n21st Century.\n  I thank my colleagues for joining us in support of this amendment.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this global \ncompetitiveness amendment with the senior Senator from New York to S. \n761 and to call attention to the challenges facing U.S. financial \nmarkets. I really appreciate the leadership role the senior Senator \nfrom New York has taken in the global capital markets competitiveness \ndebate and I really appreciate our working relationship.\n  The first part of the amendment highlights findings that U.S. capital \nmarkets are losing their competitive edge in the face of intensifying \nglobal competition in initial public offerings, IPOs, over-the-counter, \nOTC, derivatives, securitization, and traditional lending. The second \nhalf of the amendment expresses the sense of the Senate about what \nsteps should be taken to bolster the competitiveness of this essential \nsector of the U.S. economy.\n  According to the Schumer/Bloomberg report entitled Sustaining New \nYork's and the U.S.' Global Financial Services Leadership, ``In looking \nat several of the critical contested investment banking and sales and \ntrading markets--initial public offering, over-the-counter derivatives, \nand debt--it is clear that the declining position of the U.S. goes \nbeyond this natural market evolution to more controllable, intrinsic \nissues of U.S. competitiveness. As market effectiveness, liquidity and \nsafety become more prevalent in the world's financial markets, the \ncompetitive arena for financial services is shifting toward a new set \nof factors--like availability of skilled people and a balanced and \neffective legal and regulatory environment--where the U.S. is moving in \nthe wrong direction.''\n  This is a very alarming trend because IPOs and OTC derivatives \ncontribute to a robust and dynamic capital market which is a \ntremendously beneficial force for our economy and an empowerment to our \ncitizens. It is critical to ensuring economic growth, job creation, low \ncosts of capital, innovation, entrepreneurship, and a strong tax base \nin key areas of the country. The U.S. financial sector acts as a \ncatalyst for all other sectors in the U.S. economy. That is why the \ndecline in global initial public offerings in the United States, and \nthe fact that London already enjoys clear leadership in the fast \ngrowing OTC derivatives market, are such worrying trends.\n  The report further states, ``The IPO market also offers the most \ndramatic illustration of the change in capital raising needs around the \nworld, and the U.S. exchanges are rapidly losing ground to foreign \nrivals. When looking at all IPOs that took place globally in 2006, the \nshare of IPO volume attracted by U.S. exchanges is barely one-third of \nthat captured in 2001. By contrast, the global share of IPO volume \ncaptured by European exchanges has expanded by more than 30 percent \nover the same period, while non-Japan Asian markets have doubled their \nequivalent market share since 2001. When one considers mega IPOs--those \nover $1 billion--U.S. exchanges attracted 57 percent of such \ntransactions in 2001, compared with just 16 percent during the first \nten months of 2006.''\n  It further notes: ``London already enjoys clear leadership in the \nfast-growing and innovative over-the-counter derivatives market. This \nis significant because of the trading flow that surrounds derivatives \nmarkets and because of the innovation these markets drive, both of \nwhich are key competitive factors for financial centers. Dealers and \ninvestors increasing use derivatives and cash markets as \ninterchangeable and are therefore combining trading operations for both \nproducts. Indeed, the derivatives market can be more liquid than the \nunderlying cash markets. Therefore, as London takes the global lead in \nderivatives, America's competitiveness in both cash and derivatives \nflow trading is at risk, as its position as a center for financial \ninnovation.''\n  One of the common themes we are seeing in terms of movement of \nbusiness away from the United States to\n\n[[Page S5066]]\n\nLondon and other capital markets are the regulatory burdens and the \nregulatory regime that we impose here in the United States. I do not \nthink anybody would say that we should simply take down our regulatory \nposition, because we do have one of the strongest markets in the world. \nBut the question is are we over-regulating.\n  Fortunately, academics, business leaders, and politicians are working \ntogether to study this issue. They have identified several specific \nproblems that hinder the competitiveness of the U.S. capital markets \nand have issued reports outlining possible solutions:\n\n       Interim Report of the Committee on Capital Markets \n     Regulation, November 2006; Schumer/Bloomberg report entitled: \n     ``Sustaining New York's and U.S.' Global Financial Services \n     Leadership, January 2007; Commission on the Regulations of \n     U.S. Capital Markets in the 21st Century, March 2007.\n\n  I would especially like to commend the senior Senator from New York \nfor his efforts in this project. All three reports add considerably to \nthe understanding of the challenges that American capital markets face \nand offer solutions that could help American markets, companies, and \nworkers to better compete.\n  Additionally, on March 13, 2007, the Department of the Treasury \nconvened a conference on United States capital markets competitiveness \nwhere conference delegates discussed ways to keep U.S. capital markets \nthe strongest and most innovative in the world. This problem is well-\ndocumented and it is time that we take the necessary steps to restore \nAmerica's leadership position in the global financial services \nmarketplace.\n  This amendment states it is the sense of the Senate\n  (1) Congress, the President, regulators, industry leaders, and other \nstakeholders should take the necessary steps to reclaim the preeminent \nposition of the United States in the global financial services \nmarketplace;\n  (2) the Federal and State financial regulatory agencies should, to \nthe maximum extent possible, coordinate activities on significant \npolicy matters, so as not to impose regulations that may have adverse \nunintended consequences on innovativeness with respect to financial \nproducts, instruments, and services, or that impose regulatory costs \nthat are disproportionate to their benefits, and, at the same time, \nensure that the regulatory framework overseeing the United States \ncapital markets continues to promote and protect the interests of \ninvestors in those markets;\n  (3) given the complexity of the financial services marketplace today, \nCongress should exercise vigorous oversight over Federal regulatory and \nstatutory requirements affecting the financial services industry and \nconsumers, with the goal of eliminating excessive regulation and \nproblematic implementation of existing laws and regulations, while \nensuring that necessary investor protections are not compromised.\n  This amendment is supported by the American Bankers Association, the \nBusiness Roundtable, United States Chamber of Commerce, Financial \nServices Forum, Investment Company Institute, International Swaps and \nDerivatives Association, Securities Industry and Financial Markets \nAssociation, NASDAQ, and NYSE.\n  I also thank my colleagues for joining me in supporting this \namendment, and I thank the senior Senator from New York for working \nwith me on this amendment\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 922\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate on amendment No. 922, offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to speak against this amendment. \nThis amendment will increase the work of the inspector general because \nof its mandatory nature, but it will not add any additional results.\n  Secondly, it provides that audits be posted on the Web within 60 days \nwithout any safeguards for proprietary information that may be gathered \nas a result of the audit, and it provides no protections under existing \ninformation privacy laws.\n  Then there is the word ``conference,'' which I think is too broad and \nhas implications for existing and future educational activities, which \nis the major part of the underlying bill.\n  For this reason, and many others, I am opposed to it.\n  I yield back my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oklahoma wish to be \nheard?\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 922.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I voted against Senator Coburn's \namendment, No. 922, because it will place a difficult burden on grant \nactivities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nNOAA. The amendment as drafted has disturbing privacy implications. The \ninspector general's audits must be posted on the Web within 60 days \nwithout any safeguards for proprietary information. Further, the \namendment is drafted so broadly that some reasonable uses of grant \nawards would be jeopardized. Researchers might be restrained from \nattending peer conferences which are a part of the scientific process. \nNOAA awards grants throughout Michigan in order to protect and restore \nthe Great Lakes, and I want to ensure that this amendment does not \ninterfere with NOAA's mission in the Great Lakes and our Nation's \nwaters. I support the goal of the amendment to provide for \naccountability and transparency, and I hope that my concerns with the \namendment will be addressed in conference so that I can support the \nprovision in the conference report.\n\n\n                     Nanotechnology in the Schools\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I would like to thank the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, for their leadership in crafting the \nAmerica COMPETES Act and managing it on the Senate floor. I would also \nlike to thank Senator Inouye and Senator Kennedy for their roles in \ndeveloping and moving this bill. It is a critical piece of legislation \nthat will help ensure our great Nation remains competitive in the \nglobal economy.\n  I would also like to thank my distinguished colleague from Oregon, \nMr. Smith, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, and \nthe distinguished Senator from Arkansas, Mr.\n\n[[Page S5067]]\n\nPryor, for working with me to draft language to enable high schools and \ncolleges to purchase nanotechnology equipment through grants from the \nNational Science Foundation. And I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNew Jersey, Mr. Menendez, for working with us to add some of that \nlanguage to his important amendment to this fine bill.\n  Nanotechnology involves the understanding and control of matter at \ndimensions of roughly 1 to 100 nanometers--as small as a single \nmolecule. At that scale, unique phenomena enable novel applications. \nThe rapidly growing field of nanotechnology is generating scientific \nand technological breakthroughs that will benefit society by improving \nthe way many things are designed and made. It will continue to be at \nthe heart of innovation in a wide range of sectors for decades to come.\n  With the inclusion of the language that we proposed, partnerships \nbetween low income school districts, colleges and universities, and \nbusinesses will be able to secure funds to purchase classroom versions \nof scanning electron microscopes and other tools that are fundamental \nto the study of nanotechnology.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague and \nthe Senators from New Mexico, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Arkansas, and \nNew Jersey.\n  Nanotechnology will have a significant, positive impact on the \nsecurity, economic well-being, and health of Americans as fields \nrelated to nanotechnology expand. In order to maximize the benefits of \nnanotechnology to our citizens, the United States must maintain world \nleadership in the field.\n  According to the National Science Foundation, foreign students on \ntemporary visas earned 32 percent of all science and engineering \ndoctorates awarded in the United States in 2003, the last year for \nwhich data is available. Foreign students earned 55 percent of the \nengineering doctorates. Many of these students expressed an intent to \nreturn to their country of origin after completing their study.\n  To maintain world leadership in nanotechnology, the United States \nmust make a long-term investment in educating U.S. students in high \nschools and colleges, so that our students are able to conduct \nnanoscience research and develop and commercialize nanotechnology \napplications.\n  Preparing students for careers in nanotechnology requires they have \naccess to the necessary scientific tools, including scanning electron \nmicroscopes designed for teaching, and involves training to enable \nteachers and professors to use the tools in classrooms and \nlaboratories.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I agree with my colleague. It is well documented that \nAmerica needs to address the science, technology, engineering and math \ndeficit--this entire bill is a reflection of that understanding. This \ndeficit is possibly greatest in the Nation's poorest school districts. \nYet these school districts also offer a reservoir of potential--\npotential, if properly tapped, that could generate hundreds of \nthousands of scientists and engineers who can help ensure that America \ncan compete in the global marketplace, and harness the economic \npromise--and good paying jobs--of emerging fields like nanotechnology.\n  I have seen some of the nanotechnology equipment that folks will be \nable to use these funds to purchase. And honestly, it is exciting \nstuff. I expect that it will help generate the enthusiasm, as well as \nthe knowledge and understanding, necessary to attract and retain \nAmerica's future nanotechnologists.\n  So I would urge the Director of the National Science Foundation, as \nhe is implementing this program, to give special attention to grant \nproposals that include a nanotechnology element.\n  Mr. SMITH. I agree with my colleague from Oregon and I also hope that \nthe Director will give special attention to grant proposals that \ninclude a nanotechnology element. Nanotechnology is not a specific \ntechnology, but a descriptive term encompassing a range of fields from \nbiology to computer science, and from medicine to engineering. This \nlegislation will enable high schools and colleges, in partnership with \nlocal businesses, to purchase basic tabletop nanotechnology tools for \nclassroom use--not laboratory use for research, but classroom use for \neducation--to help create the next generation of scientists of all \nkinds, and to ensure that they will have the skills to apply \nnanotechnology to whatever specific scientific field they enter.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I would like to make one last point--the 21st Century \nNanotechnology Research and Development Act will come up for \nreauthorization next year. As one of the authors of the act, and as one \nof the cochairmen of the Congressional Nanotechnology Caucus, I am \nlooking forward to hearing my colleagues' thoughts about how the act \nmight be amended to further promote American competitiveness in the \nvitally important field of nanotechnology.\n\n\n  authorization for department of energy basic research, section 2006\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I wish to commend the managers of the \nbill for continuing here on the floor the remarkable cooperative effort \nthat characterized the development of this legislation by the three \nSenate committees. That said, I want to note that I think we need to \ngive further consideration to the funding pattern for basic research \nwithin the Department of Energy in Section 2006. We have responded to \nthe Augustine Report's call for increasing our commitment to basic \nresearch in the physical sciences by doubling funding over the next \ndecade, but we need to make sure that those funds are distributed over \nthe years in a manner that will maximize the effectiveness of those \nprograms. I suggest that we need to increase and accelerate funding for \nthese basic research programs. I request that the managers agree to \nwork with me to accomplish that as this bill works its way through \nconference.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I share my colleague's concern. We must ensure that the \nfunding increases for the Office of Science at the Department of Energy \nare sufficient and that they are allocated to specific years so that \nthere is a nexus between the needs of each of the various research \nprograms and the amounts provided for each fiscal year. I will be \npleased to work with my colleagues in conference to refine further \nthese authorizations.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the senior Senator from New Mexico for \nbringing this matter to our attention. I, too, recognize the \nsignificant contributions of the Department of Energy Office of Science \nto our Nation's commitment to basic research. It is the largest Federal \nfunding source of basic research in the physical sciences. So it is, of \ncourse, extremely important that we get the funding right. I will also \nbe pleased to work with my colleagues to make certain we provide \noptimal support for these programs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my colleagues for their willingness to work \nwith me on this issue, and I am hopeful that the conference report we \nultimately consider will have the best funding scenario we can provide \nfor these basic research programs.\n\n\n                    Authorization of the Atp Program\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I had intended to call up amendment No. \n969 which sets forth authorization levels for the Advanced Technology \nProgram, ATP, to restore the ATP program to its historic funding \nlevels. The Senate's defeat of the Coburn amendment expresses the will \nof the Senate to support the ATP program. I am also confident that the \nchairman and the committee can accomplish in conference what this \namendment intended to do.\n  Again, by defeating the Coburn amendment to repeal the authorization \nfor the Advanced Technology Program, ATP, the Senate has again \nexpressed its support for ATP.\n  This body understands the importance of this program. In the past the \nSenate has, on numerous occasions, supported amendments to the budget \nresolution to provide for ATP. Every time we have had an appropriations \nvote on this program we have retained funding for ATP.\n  We have lost 3 million manufacturing jobs since January 2001. In the \nface of these losses and strong global economic competition, we should \nbe doing all we can to promote programs that help create jobs and \nstrengthen the technological innovation of American companies.\n  The ATP is one of the key Federal programs available to help U.S. \nmanufacturers remain competitive in a global economy.\n\n[[Page S5068]]\n\n  I have spoken with the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee and I \nam confident he will support strong funding for the ATP program in \nconference.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will support efforts to authorize this important \nprogram which the Senate has so often voted to support, consistent of \ncourse with our ability to get a conference report that the Senate can \npass.\n  I thank Senator Levin for bringing this matter to the attention of \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if all of the Members are here now, I want \nto express thanks--I think I speak for the whole Senate--for the work \ndone by Senators Bingaman and Alexander. It is a very important piece \nof legislation. This is the fifth day we have worked on this piece of \nlegislation; this is only the floor days. We spent hours and hours \ncoming up with the idea, having meetings, meeting with individual \nSenators.\n  It is a good piece of legislative work. As we know, legislation is \nthe art of compromise. They have made the compromises which improved \nthe legislation. They were assisted by the chair and ranking member of \nthe HELP Committee, Kennedy and Enzi; Commerce Committee, Inouye and \nStevens; and, of course, Senator Bingaman's housemate from New Mexico, \nSenator Domenici, has been on the floor a lot these past few days. It \nis good to see him up around, back in his fighting form. He has done \nvery good work as usual.\n  I also express my appreciation to Senator McConnell for allowing us \nto move forward. This is a good bipartisan piece of legislation. I said \nwhen this legislation started we were going to do something on a \nbipartisan basis. Recognizing that although there was a little bit of \ndowntime on a few occasions, I made the decision before we went to this \nbill there would be no procedural cloture votes filed. I thought it was \ngood to let everybody know we can work through these bills if we have \nto with a little cooperation from everyone.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Let me finally say, the House is going to complete the work on the \nsupplemental sometime late tonight. We will get that sometime late \ntomorrow. We are going to try to have the final passage of this about a \nquarter to 1 tomorrow. I am assuming it will be final passage: we will \nhave the vote, anyway. Then that will be the last vote for this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me join my good friend the \nmajority leader, and say this is a good example of the Senate, a broad \nbipartisan bill of consequence, with spectacular, widespread \nparticipation led by Senator Alexander, Senator Domenici, Senator \nStevens, and others on this side; Senator Bingaman and others on that \nside. This is a proud moment for the Senate. I congratulate all of \nthose who spent a couple of years crafting this measure and putting it \ntogether so it can enjoy this large vote it is about to receive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 973\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, we did inadvertently leave one \nadditional amendment off the list that I read describing the managers' \npackage. I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 973 be agreed to, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 973) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To include the Administrator of the Small Business \n      Administration on the President's Council on Innovation and \n                            Competitiveness)\n\n       On page 16, strike lines 15 and 16 and insert the \n     following:\n       (P) The Small Business Administration.\n       (Q) Any other department or agency designated by the \n     President.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me say very briefly that I very \nmuch appreciate Senator Reid's leadership in setting time aside and \nmaking this a priority for the Senate, and Senator McConnell as well. \nAnd, of course, I acknowledge the great work Senator Alexander has done \nat every stage in this process. He has done a terrific job, and he has \nbeen the persistent impetus for getting this legislation to this point \nand deserves great credit for it. Senator Domenici does as well. He \ntook a very strong leadership role in the last Congress and again in \nthis Congress in getting this done.\n  Of course, Senator Ensign and Senator Lieberman have been real \nleaders on the issue, and Senator Mikulski, Senator Inouye, Senator \nStevens, Senator Hutchison, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Enzi. All of \nthem have played a major part.\n  This is multicommittee legislation and multi-Senator legislation. It \nis bipartisan, as was said. It is a good step for the Senate to be \ntaking. I appreciate everyone's cooperation and help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, out of respect to our colleagues, I \nam going to defer my remarks until after the vote except to say--all of \nthe thank-yous, except to say one thing: There are a number of issues \nbefore this body that are too big for one party to solve. This has been \none of them. But after 2 years of work across party lines, we ended up \nwith 63 cosponsors, 208 pages of legislation. We dealt with 40 \namendments in the last 3 days without any cloture. I hope this sets an \nexample for dealing with some of the other large issues we have that \nare too big for one party to solve.\n  I thank my colleagues for working with us in this way. I will be more \nspecific about those thanks to the leaders and the other Senators after \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, fellow Senators, I have been involved \nin the last 2 years in two major legislative efforts; both of them have \nbeen bipartisan, extremely bipartisan. I don't know how far that will \ncarry us, but it certainly is a good feeling. It is different to know \nthat Senators on both sides of the aisle support the effort you are \nmaking when you work hard for something like we did for this one.\n  The brain power of our youth is the salvation of our country. It is \nthe source of innovation and the source of our economic power. It is \nfailing because we are not educating our children properly. That is the \nheart of the recommendation given to us. It is the heart of what they \ngave us as their recommendations, the great American leaders who \nvolunteered, and we were able to keep most of it regardless of how \ndifficult the committee jurisdictions are. Three major committees \ngetting together to fix this is pretty good work.\n  I thank everyone. There are more that I want to thank one on one. I \nwill thank them later. But it has been a great effort. I thoroughly \nenjoyed it after these many years of being a Senator. The last couple \nof years have been absolutely terrific when you can get a couple of \nmajor bills done with both sides of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) and \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nDelaware (Mr. Biden) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 88, nays 8, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 146 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--88\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n\n[[Page S5069]]\n\n\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--8\n\n     Allard\n     Coburn\n     DeMint\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Thomas\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Biden\n     Brownback\n     Johnson\n     McCain\n  The bill (S. 761), as amended, was passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I speak today in support of the \nAmerica Competes Act, ACA, a bill designed to increase math and science \nopportunities for our Nation's youth, an issue of great importance in \nour increasingly global economy. I have heard from Wisconsinites at the \nK-12 education level as well as members of my State's higher education \ncommunity who have voiced support for the ACA and the boost it provides \nto math and science programming. I am particularly pleased the Senate \naccepted my amendment to improve education privacy protections in the \nP-16 database component of this legislation.\n  For decades, America has dominated the science and technological \nfields both in the higher education community and the business sector. \nAs the National Academy of Sciences', NAS, report ``Above the Gathering \nStorm: Energizing and Employing America for Brighter Future'' outlined, \nthe United States is facing some important challenges that need to be \naddressed if our country wishes to remain the worldwide economic and \nscientific leader. The report made clear that the science and \ntechnology preeminence that we have enjoyed for decades should not be \ntaken for granted and deserves serious attention.\n  The NAS report also highlights the need for supporting basic and \napplied research as a foundation for America's continued competitive \nedge. The America COMPETES Act follows through on these suggestions by \nboosting funding for competitive basic research through the NSF and \nother agencies. I have long been a strong supporter of competitive \nresearch funding, cultivating young researchers, graduate students and \nprofessionals, and creating an overall environment that encourages \ninnovation, so I was glad to see these provisions in the legislation. \nWhile this legislation provides a Federal emphasis, this effort is \ngoing to have to be a partnership with public and private universities \nand colleges to be successful. Knowing Wisconsin, I am sure our \ninstitutions and higher education and companies will step up to the \nplate and embrace this partnership.\n  Keeping America competitive globally is particularly relevant as \nmanufacturing and industrial plants have closed in the United States \nand been rebuilt in other nations where the cost of hiring technical \nexperts like engineers and chemists are often one-fifth or even one-\ntenth that in the US. While we need to boost education and employment \ntraining for these workers, I am concerned that retraining and major \ninvestment in the science and technology arena will not be enough to \nmake a long-term difference without improved trade agreements. I \ncontinue to be troubled by the trade agreements into which our country \nhas entered in recent years. Too often, they lack even the most basic \nlabor and environmental standards needed to prevent a race to the \nbottom, and to ensure that our businesses and workers can compete on an \nequal footing. The unfortunate result of these flawed agreements has \nbeen the flight of jobs overseas and downward pressure on wages and \nbenefits for those jobs that remain. If agreements such as these \ncontinue to be the rule, I am afraid that even with significant \ninvestment in science and technology our global position will continue \nto erode.\n  While trade policy is an important aspect of our country's \ncompetitiveness, maintaining and strengthening America's \ncompetitiveness is a multi-disciplinary effort. I am pleased that the \nACA includes funding for various important education programs including \nteacher professional development and summer learning institutes for K-\n12 teachers, and expanded access to AP and IB courses for students in \nhigh-need schools. Providing training and support to America's teachers \nis an essential component of strengthening our nation's educational \nsystem and ensuring the educational growth of American students. \nTeacher quality is one of the biggest factors that impacts student \nachievement and too many students in our nation's most disadvantaged \nschools are taught by less experienced and less qualified teachers than \ntheir counterparts in our more advantaged schools. The programs \nprovided in the ACA move our country in the right direction towards \nclosing the gap in teacher quality and increasing the number of math \nand science teachers throughout the country.\n  I am pleased the Senate adopted my amendment to strengthen the \neducation privacy provisions in the title IV section of the bill which \nfunds alignment of education programs. Under this section, States could \napply for grants to improve alignment of the K-12 education standards \nwith the skills that are needed for both the workforce and college. \nStates could also use the grants to create P-16 databases which would \ncompile information on students from kindergarten through college for \nthe purposes of improving education policy in the States. While I fully \nsupport better alignment between the K-12 and higher education systems, \nI was concerned that the privacy provisions of the underlying bill were \nnot strong enough to protect this important student data. As we have \nseen recently with the unauthorized uses of the federal National \nStudent Loan Data System, these data systems are not completely secure \nand are potentially subject to abuse by those who have access to such \ndata systems.\n  My amendment adds some commonsense protections that States would have \nto comply with in order to receive Federal funding to create or improve \neducation databases. States and third parties will only be able to use \nthe data in the P-16 systems to fulfill purposes set out in State and \nFederal education law and third parties who access the data must sign a \ndata use agreement prohibiting further disclosure or unauthorized uses. \nStates will also have to account for all disclosures of data and make \nthe accounting available to individuals whose data has been disclosed. \nAdditionally, States must maintain adequate electronic security \nmeasures to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of the data. \nDatabases established with these Federal grant dollars would be subject \nto the protections of the Family Educational and Privacy Rights Act. \nFinally, the underlying bill requires States to assign students unique \nidentifiers in the State databases and my amendment would prohibit \nFederal, State, and local agencies from using the unique identifiers \nfor any purposes except those allowed under Federal and State education \nlaw, as well as requiring the Secretary of Education to promulgate \nregulations to govern the use of unique identifiers in order to \nsafeguard individual privacy.\n  During consideration of the bill I supported several amendments that \nwould impose greater fiscal responsibility, such as Senator DeMint's \namendment opposing earmarks and Senator Coburn's amendment addressing \nthe Advanced Technology Program. I did not support other amendments \nthat, while well-intentioned, could have undermined the principles and \npurposes of the bill. I opposed Senator Coburn's amendment to sunset \nthe provisions of the ACA and its amendments because of my concerns \nthat this would nullify positive policy changes made by the ACA. I also \nopposed his\n\n[[Page S5070]]\n\namendment regarding the grant programs of the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration. That amendment would have unduly interfered \nwith grant recipients' ability to meet the objectives of their grants \nby prohibiting participation in conferences that, for example, could \nfurther scientific understanding. Grant recipients from all Federal \nagencies already must comply with regulations that prohibit the misuse \nof Federal funds on things such as entertainment and alcohol expenses.\n  I am pleased we were able to work in a bipartisan manner to pass this \nimportant legislation. Improving math and science programs for \ndisadvantaged youth and strengthening professional development \nopportunities for America's teachers are critically important to our \nNation's future. The United States has long been known for its \nleadership in scientific discoveries and achievement, but our country \nmust continue to improve and strengthen our education programs related \nto math, science, and technology if the United States wants to remain \nthe world's leader on these issues. I believe the America COMPETES Act \nmoves our country in the right direction towards achieving these \nimportant goals.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, passing S. 761, the America COMPETES Act, \nis an important first step towards maintaining our country's \ncompetitive advantage in the global economy.\n  This legislation was written with strong bipartisan cooperation and \nnegotiation. Many competing interests and competing views were heard \nduring an open amendment process with Senators free to offer their \nideas for improving the legislation. And, in what I hope is a sign of \nthings to come, we were not forced to file cloture to complete action \non this bill. Over the past few days, the Senate worked just as it was \ndesigned to do.\n  We would not have achieved this great bipartisan success were it not \nfor the hard work of Senators Bingaman and Alexander. While many \nSenators played important roles in passing this bill, Senators Bingaman \nand Alexander were responsible for raising the awareness of our \ndiminishing ability to compete, and for bringing a much-needed sense of \nurgency to this issue. I also want to recognize the hard work of a \nnumber of my colleagues, Senators Inouye, Stevens, Kennedy, Enzi, \nLieberman, Ensign, Mikulski, and Hutchison, who were also instrumental \nin crafting and now passing this legislation.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that we follow \nthrough on the commitments and investments we made today in passing the \nAmerica COMPETES Act. And I am hopeful that we can continue to work \ntogether in a bipartisan manner to move this country forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me speak again about the \nextraordinary effort that went into this legislation and talk \nparticularly about the staff work that has brought us to this point.\n  I think everyone involved in this legislation knows this represents \nmany days and many nights of hard work by staff people in our personal \noffices as well as on committee staff. We have seen a great example of \nhow the staffs of the various committees can come together and produce \na good product.\n  I will reiterate the leadership among Senators for this work. Senator \nAlexander, of course, deserves tremendous credit. Senator Domenici \ndeserves tremendous credit. Senator Lieberman and Senator Ensign have \nboth worked very hard on this legislation and deserve great credit as \nwell. I know Senators Reid and McConnell acknowledged their good work. \nWe also, of course, could not have done this without the leadership of \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Enzi on the HELP Committee, and without the \nleadership of Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, Senator Mikulski, and \nSenator Hutchison. There are several others I am sure I should have on \nthe list as well because this was a combined effort.\n  The three committees that put this legislation together were the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, under the leadership \nof Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi; of course, the Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation Committee under Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens; \nand the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The portion of this \nlegislation that came from the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nwas reported out when Senator Domenici was the chairman in the last \nCongress. I was proud to work with him in doing that. I can recall the \neffort the three of us made--Senator Alexander, Senator Domenici, and \nmyself--to persuade the President to make this a priority. He did make \nit a priority. Of course, he deserves credit for that as well.\n  Let me also talk for a minute about individual staff members on both \nsides of the aisle who worked very hard to make this a success--from \nthe Commerce Committee: Jean Toal-Eisen, Jason Mulvihill, Chan Lieu, \nBeth Bacon, Jeff Bingham, H.J. Derr, Floyd Deschamps, and Christine \nKurth; from the HELP Committee: Missy Rohrbach, Lindsay Hunsicker, \nMichael Yudin; from my staff: Carmel Martin, David Cleary, Anne Clough, \nBeth Buehlman, Roberto Rodriguez, and Ilyse Schuman; from the Energy \nCommittee: Bob Simon, staff director Jonathan Epstein, who has been \nworking with me tirelessly on this legislation, Sam Fowler, and, of \ncourse, our general counsel, Kathryn Clay, and Melanie Roberts; on \nSenator Alexander's staff: Matt Sonnesyn and Jack Wells are the two \nwith whom I am most familiar who have worked so hard; from Senator \nLieberman's staff: Rachel Stotsky, Craig Robinson, and Colleen Shogan; \nand from on my staff: My legislative director Trudy Vincent has been \nextremely involved and helpful in getting this legislation completed. I \nwish to acknowledge the great work done by Jason Unger and Mark Wetjen \non Senator Reid's staff and by Libby Jarvis on Senator McConnell's \nstaff.\n  This is legislation which could not have come together without the \ngood work of all of these people whose names I have mentioned. They can \nbe proud of their success in this venture.\n  Of course, this is only one hurdle in the process. It seems, in the \nlegislative process, no matter how many hurdles jumped, there is always \nanother ahead. We now have to find a way to reconcile any differences \nwe have with the House on this set of issues. We hope we can do that \nsuccessfully in the near future and send the bill to the President.\n  Again, I particularly congratulate Senator Alexander and Senator \nDomenici. I know Senator Alexander has some comments he wants to make.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to add the following Senators \nas cosponsors of S. 761, the America COMPETES Act: Senators Snowe and \nHatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, let me say to Senator Bingaman, I \ngreatly appreciate working with him. I do not believe there will be a \nmore important piece of legislation to come before Congress this year \nbecause it goes right to the heart of something every American \nunderstands, which is, How do we keep our jobs? This is the way we do \nit. We keep our brainpower advantage. We keep our jobs in competition \nwith China and India. There are other factors as well, but what we know \nis--and we have a broad consensus in the Senate--that most of our \nremarkable standard of living, a situation where we have 30 percent of \nall the money in the world produced in this country for about 5 percent \nof the people, comes from our brainpower advantage, kindergarten \nthrough the twelfth grade, a wonderful higher education system, and our \nresearch institutes. That is the importance of this legislation.\n  The second thing about the legislation is that, to a remarkable \ndegree, we rely on the people we ought to rely on in giving the answer \nto the question, How do we keep our brainpower advantage? Senator \nBingaman and I, with the encouragement and under the leadership of \nSenator Domenici, who last year was chairman of the Energy Committee, \nasked the National Academy of Sciences: Please tell us the 10 things we \nneed to do in order to keep our brainpower advantage so we can keep our \njobs.\n  So they asked Norm Augustine, the former head of Lockheed Martin, to \nchair a distinguished group of about 21, and they gave up their summer \n2 years\n\n[[Page S5071]]\n\nago. They included three Nobel laureates, the former head of MIT, and \nothers of that caliber, and they gave us 20--in priority order--things \nto do. At about that same time, the Council on Competitiveness had \nfinished its work. Senator Lieberman and Senator Ensign had introduced \ntheir bill.\n  That legislation, which was the Domenici-Bingaman legislation, after \na lot of work with the Bush administration, became the Frist-Reid bill \ntoward the end of last year. Then, when we changed parties in the \nSenate, the very same bill became the Reid-McConnell bill. So we had \nworked closely together in a bipartisan way where we were able to \novercome differences.\n  I do not want the 88-to-8 vote to fool anybody. This was not that \neasy to do. This has been 2 years of work, with lots of different \ncommittees, many different ideas. But it has been a successful effort.\n  As I said, briefly, just before the vote, it is a privilege always to \nbe a Senator. It has especially been a privilege this week because the \nSenate is acting as the Senate should. We are dealing, first, with one \nof the biggest issues facing our country. Second, we are recognizing it \nis one of that handful of big issues that cannot be solved by one party \nalone. The Democrats could have charged up and down the hill all night \nlong, and they could not have done it. The Republicans could have done \nthe same, and we could not have done it. We could only have done it in \nthe way we did it, and we did.\n  There are other issues out there like that. I think of immigration, \nwhich the majority leader has said we will be moving to soon. There is \nthe question of affordable health insurance for every American. There \nis the question of energy independence. I hope this is a model for how \nwe can work together and avoid some of the petty bickering we sometimes \nfall into. I think the American people would appreciate that, and I \nhope they will appreciate this.\n  I wish to thank especially the Senators whom Senator Bingaman talked \nabout. He and his staff have been a delight to work with. Senator \nDomenici, of course, has been terrific to me as a junior member of his \ncommittee last year, allowing me to work on this. But when Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye and Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, \nbasically, lent their prestige and sense of urgency to this legislation \nand stepped back and allowed it to proceed and participated rather than \nclaim some jurisdictional advantage, that is what really helped.\n  Senator Ensign made a tremendous difference within the Republican \ncaucus, and Senator Hutchison and Senator Bond, and Senator Mikulski on \nthat side. Senator Chambliss and others from the very beginning have \nworked on this issue. That is why we had 70 Senators on the Domenici-\nBingaman bill last year--35 Republicans, 35 Democrats. And that is why \nwe had 63 cosponsors of the Reid-McConnell bill.\n  Finally, Senator Reid allowed this to come forward, and Senator \nMcConnell worked with him in a way that permitted this environment. It \nis pretty remarkable. We have had nothing like this in the Senate this \nyear. We had no cloture--not one bit of cloture. We had a very \ncomplicated bill. We dealt with 40 amendments, and we got it all done \nwithin a week--on one of the most important pieces of legislation. That \nis a significant achievement. We should not forget the role Senator \nFrist played last year in helping to move things along. So I thank my \ncolleagues for the privilege of being a part of it.\n  Senator Bingaman read the names, I believe, of all of the Democratic \nstaff and Republican staff. I do not think he left anyone out. I want \nto especially, therefore, say--I hope this is appropriate to do--to \nJonathan Epstein and Senator Bingaman's staff how much we appreciate \nall of them. They really have been indispensable to this effort. I also \nthank Matt Sonnesyn, who has been our lead. He has been indispensable, \nas well, and David Cleary; and Kathryn Clay on Senator Domenici's \nstaff, who has been crucial to the effort. The staff have spent \nhundreds of hours, literally, in the last 2 years working carefully \nthrough the bill.\n  I might say this, in conclusion--I know Senator Domenici has \nsomething to say--I took the legislation home over the weekend and \nreread it, all 208 pages. It is remarkably coherent, well written, and \nwell organized. Maybe this process would be a good model for other \nlegislation.\n  The House of Representatives is already moving. Congressman Gordon \nand Congressman Boehlert joined Senator Bingaman and me in asking the \nNational Academies for their recommendations 2 years ago. Those \nrecommendations have been introduced in the House. It is my hope that \nafter our legislation goes there, the House will act soon, and we will \nbe able to send this legislation to the President.\n  Senator Domenici took us to the White House last year to talk with \nthe President about this issue. He secured the invitation, and it was \nnot just a Republican Senator or another Republican Senator, it was a \nRepublican senior Senator and a Democratic senior Senator meeting with \nthe President. That is the way we worked on this issue. So we \nappreciate the President's attention and priority to this issue. It \nwould not have happened without that, either.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I will be very brief because so much \nhas been said, I do not think I should repeat it. I think all of the \npeople who deserve to be thanked have been thanked. I thank Senator \nBingaman for being so gracious to all of those who worked on this \nlegislation. I say to Senator Bingaman, you always do, and you made \nsure the Record reflects each of their names, including those of my \nstaff. We all thank you for that act of courtesy.\n  I just want to say, we all knew when we started we were addressing a \nvery big problem. I am sure each of us from time to time has wondered \nwhether what we were doing was going to have as big an effect as we \nhoped on our children in their ability to improve their brainpower, as \nwe help teachers who teach them be better teachers of the hard subjects \nof math and science and the like.\n  I am sure many times we wondered whether this was the right avenue \nand approach. But once we got into it, it was apparent we had not been \nled astray, that the leaders who put it together for us--and there is \nnot a large group of them, but they are very talented, and they are \nvery American--sought nothing but to give us the best recommendations \nfor our country. That was a wonderful group in the Academies. Of \ncourse, their chairman, the former CEO of Lockheed Martin, just did a \nmarvelous job.\n  I am very hopeful, now that we have done this, we will get the money \nappropriated. I pledge here tonight I will do everything I can--and I \nhope we will muster more help as we go through appropriations--to see \nthat we give this legislative thrust a chance. If you want a shell, you \nwill get a shell. If you do not want to pay for these programs, you \nwill not help your kids, because there is nothing mysterious about \nthis. There is a huge amount of work that has to be done by people and \ninstitutions that have to be paid.\n  This bill says how we are going to pay for it, but it is an \nauthorizing bill. I told the Senate that, and I proved it, there is \nnothing we could do in terms of the Budget Act for those who wanted to \nstop it, because it does not spend money. It authorizes a series of new \nideas as the program for the country. The program is immobile without \nthe resources that are stated. As we look at it carefully, we might \neven see we did not put enough in certain areas. I am certainly going \nto go to conference and work on the Appropriations Committee with the \nfull idea that we must fully fund this bill for the next 3 or 4 years \nif we are going to get what we want for our young people and the \nteachers and parents who so anxiously wait for something good and \npositive.\n  This day has been a long time coming. For over a year, we have been \nworking to pass a bill that will give America the brain power needed to \ncompete in the global marketplace.\n  This is a process that began in the Energy Committee, with a request \nto the National Academy of Sciences to put together a report that told \nus what needed to be done to help America compete. That report, \n``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' led by former Lockheed CEO Norm \nAugustine, serves as the basis for the legislation we just passed.\n\n[[Page S5072]]\n\n  Last year, the Energy Committee moved forward with legislation that \nutilizes the Department of Energy and its national labs to train our \nteachers and rekindle interest in math and science. We called that bill \nthe PACE--Protecting America's Competitive Edge.\n  At the end of last session, and again this year, we were able to \npartner with our leaders, Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, and our \ncolleagues on the Commerce and HELP Committees, to put together the \ncomprehensive America COMPETES Act.\n  Less than 6 percent of high school seniors have plans to study \nengineering, but 50 percent of our current U.S. science and engineering \nworkforce is approaching retirement age.\n  By bringing our national labs into the classroom, we can begin to \naddress this problem.\n  Since the Augustine report emphasizes the need for a renewed focus on \nbasic science and research, this bill authorizes doubling the funding \nfor DOE's Office of Science.\n  I look forward to working with the House in conference to pass a \nstrong, bipartisan bill that will allow America to rise above the \ngathering storm and compete once again.\n  With that, Madam President, once again, I thank Senator Bingaman. It \nhas been a pleasure to get another bipartisan bill through with you. If \nwe keep doing this, they are going to be mentioning the Senator from \nNew Mexico so much--mentioning you and then me--they are going to think \nthe whole place is full of Senators from New Mexico. We do not have to \nworry about that. We will take what we can get and do the best we can \nwith it.\n  I say to the Senator, thank you, Lamar, for coming to me and asking: \nCould I push this with you all? It was a pleasure--and under my \nchairmanship--to push it with you and for you. It came out very well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Mr. President, prior to this job as Democratic leader, I \nbasically lived on the floor for 6 years. I was here from the time the \nSenate came into session until we went out every day. During that \nperiod of time, I got to know staff up here very well because I \nbasically lived with them.\n  One of the people whom I certainly have gotten to know over that \nperiod of time is a man by the name of Jack Hickman. Since 1996, Jack \nhas worked in the Senate Document Room, has been the executive \ncommunications clerk, and is now the morning business editor. When he \nis here, he sits at the table right in front of me.\n  Jack is physically a giant of a man, very big. He has a wonderful \nsense of humor and is very easy to get along with. He loves his alma \nmater, the University of Wisconsin. One of his sad times was when UNLV \nbeat them once, which was unexpected in a lot of quarters. He follows \nWisconsin basketball and all of their sports teams very closely.\n  Jack has two sons, Paul and Brian. His wife's name is Margaret, and \nhe brags about her all the time.\n  I want the Record to be spread with the fact that it has been an \nenjoyable experience for me to be able to work with someone of Jack's \ncaliber, to be able to joke with him and make fun of each other in a \nrespectful way on some of our idiosyncracies.\n  Jack Hickman is going to retire. Tomorrow is his last day here. He \nand his wife had purchased a place in Florida some time ago. He has \nbeen going down there on vacation in our off times. Now he will live \nthere full time.\n  Jack does, as do all of the Senate personnel, invaluable work for us. \nHe makes sure what we say goes in the right place in the Record. He \nworks with the court reporters and the rest of the staff. His work, \neven though it is not very noteworthy to the public, is essential to \nthe Senate functioning properly.\n  I will really miss Jack a lot. He is someone with whom I have a real \nstrong comfort level. I look forward, in the years to come, to being \nable to visit with him again and talk about some of the times we have \nhad. We have spent many hours together on the Senate floor. During \nthose years, I didn't control what we did; I was just here on the \nfloor. We waited for long periods of time for the leader--whether it \nwas a Democratic or Republican leader--to come and take us out at the \nend of the day. We complained to each other, saying, ``I wonder what \nthey are doing.'' Well, since I got this job, I have a better picture \nof that. Even though it appears there is nothing going on out here, a \nlot of times, in the respective leaders' offices, a lot is going on.\n  Mr. President, I speak about Jack, but in the process I speak of all \nthese people who do so much for us and make us look good.\n  I wish Jack good luck in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5072-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING CHARLES A. SCHOLZ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I congratulate my good friend \nCharles A. Scholz. On April 29, he will be honored by the Mississippi \nValley Council, Boy Scouts of America and presented with the 2007 \nDistinguished Citizen Award. This commendation recognizes the important \ncontributions of American men and women to scouting and their \ncommunity. Charles A. Scholz is certainly deserving of such an award.\n  Charlie has spent most of his life in Quincy, IL. At 80, he retains \nfond memories of his years as a Boy Scout in Quincy. Charlie attended \nSt. Francis Grade School and Quincy Notre Dame High School.\n  Beginning in July of 1944, he served in the Navy V-12 Program, a \nunique initiative designed to recruit commissioned officers during \nWorld War II and allow young men to pursue college degrees while \nserving on active duty. Charlie continued his education at Mercer \nUniversity, ultimately receiving his juris doctorate degree.\n  After graduation, Charlie returned home to Quincy. On June 10, 1950, \nhe married the late Nancy Wright. Together they raised seven children \nin Quincy, instilling in each a desire to serve the community. The \nsuccess achieved by the Scholz children, serves as a testament to \nCharlie and Nancy's characters, as well as their dedication to the \nfamily and their faith.\n  Charlie has been a successful attorney in Quincy for years; but he is \nknown equally well for his continuing efforts to give back to the \ncommunity.\n  For 25 years, Charlie served on the board of directors of the Quincy \nFree Public Library. During his tenure as president of the library \nboard, volunteers carried out a successful campaign to raise funds for \na new library. Charlie also served board of trustees of the former St. \nMary's Hospital in Quincy, first as a member and then as the board's \npresident.\n  Charlie founded the Quincy Notre Dame Foundation to help support his \nalma mater. He served on the board of governors of the Franciscan \nSisters of the Poor Foundation, Inc. and served as a member of the \nBoard of Land of Lincoln Legal Services Foundation. In addition, \nCharlie was a past member of the Board of directors of the Community \nFoundation of Quincy.\n  The late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, ``Everyone can be \ngreat, because everyone can serve.'' Well, Charlie Scholz has taken \nthat declaration to heart. He lives a life committed to his family, his \nfaith, and his community. I congratulate him on receiving this award \nand thank him for his years of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5072-4", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5072-S5073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VIRGINIA TECH TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to express my heartfelt \ncondolences to the family of 35-year-old Christopher James ``Jamie'' \nBishop, one of the victims of the tragic Virginia Tech shooting rampage \nthat occurred this week. He was teaching an introductory German \nlanguage course in Norris Hall when the shooting occurred.\n  Jamie Bishop grew up in Pine Mountain and attended the University of \nGeorgia, where he earned a bachelor's\n\n[[Page S5073]]\n\ndegree in German studies in 1993 and a master's degree in German \nlinguistics in 1998. Additionally, he was a Fulbright Scholar at \nChristian-Albrechts-University in Kiel, Germany, in 1993 and worked as \nan academic technology liaison at the University of North Carolina at \nChapel Hill.\n  It is clear that Jamie Bishop touched many lives with his \npersonality, his sense of humor, his numerous talents, his passion for \nteaching, and his love of scientific art. In fact, those who were close \nto him have said he talked about ``changing the world with art.'' He \nhas been described as an intelligent, artistic, caring, gentle, and \npolite individual.\n  It is difficult to fathom how something like this could happen, and \nwords can't fully describe the grief we all feel as the weight of this \ntragedy settles over our Nation. My prayer is that, through faith and \nresolve, our country will emerge from this disaster in unity and \nstrength as together we find healing from this sorrow.\n  Julianne and I will keep his wife Stefanie Hofer, who is a member of \nthe Virginia Tech faculty, as well as his parents Michael and Jerri \nBishop in our thoughts and prayers during this time of sorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5073-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n              PETTY OFFICER 1st CLASS JOSEPH ADAM McSWEEN\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I wish to honor U.S. Navy \nPetty Officer 1st Class Joseph Adam McSween of Oak Harbor, WA.\n  Petty Officer McSween will be remembered as a loving husband and \nfather, a dedicated friend and sailor, and a strong leader. After \ngraduating from Georgia Christian High School, he received a track \nscholarship to York College in York, NE, where he would later graduate \nin 2001 with an associate degree. While there, Petty Officer McSween \nwas recognized as a natural leader and participated in campus \nleadership activities. He also met and fell in love with his wife Erin \nHammitt while they were students together. They later had two \ndaughters: Lily, age 5, and Gwyneth, age 2.\n  On April 6, 2007, while serving near Kirkuk, Iraq, as a demolition \nspecialist with the Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit 11, based at \nWhidbey Island, WA, Petty Officer McSween and two others passed away \nwhen a rocket hit their humvee. McSween was 26 years old. He was \nawarded the Bronze Star ``V'', Combat Distinguished Device, the Purple \nHeart, and the Combat Action Ribbon at his military service.\n  Adam was not a Nebraska resident, but he chose to be buried in York, \nNE. His very close friend, Petty Officer Randy Leppell, U.S. Navy, had \nthis to say at the funeral: ``One thing I remember about Adam, one \nstory he told was that he called back to some crazy little town called \nYork, Nebraska, which I'd never heard of, and he told me he hadn't been \nto the school for a while. But the admissions officer still remembered \nhis name. He said, `This is Adam.' The Admissions Officer said `Adam \nMcSween?' He couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it. I think it \nspeaks volumes for the people of York.''\n  Hundreds of people from York and many other areas of Nebraska and \nsurrounding States, people who never even knew a young college student \nnamed Adam McSween, came to his funeral and lined the streets, proudly \ndisplaying the American Flag as the procession made its way to Adam's \nfinal resting place in Greenwood Cemetery in York, NE.\n  In addition to his wife and two daughters, Petty Officer McSween is \nsurvived by his parents Bob and Florence McSween; his two brothers \nRobert and Kyle; and his sister Angela. I offer my sincere condolences \nto the family and friends of Petty Officer McSween. He made the \nultimate and most courageous sacrifice for our Nation.

Mr. President, the Brady law requires prospective gun \npurchasers to undergo a criminal background check before they are able \nto obtain a firearm from a federally licensed firearm dealer. It was \ncreated to prevent felons, fugitives, domestic abusers, and other \nprohibited persons from gaining access to guns. However, there are \nsignificant holes in this legislation that permit exploitation by those \nwho wish to avoid criminal background checks and still obtain guns.\n  In 1993, President Clinton signed the Brady bill into law. This law \nrequired a waiting period for handgun sales until records were \navailable to instantly check criminal background of prospective gun \npurchasers. Once the National Instant Check System, NICS, became \noperational in 1998, the Justice Department maintained background check \nrecords on approved purchases for 6 months in order to ensure that \nfelons and other prohibited buyers were not mistakenly approved. In \n2001, the Justice Department shortened this record retention period to \n90 days, the actual amount of time it takes to ensure proper audits of \nNICS.\n  Under the Bush administration, however, Attorney General John \nAshcroft sought to require the records of approved purchasers to be \ndestroyed within 24 hours. In July 2002, the Government Accountability \nOffice, GAO, issued a report on the potential effects of next-day \ndestruction of NICS background check records. It concluded that \ndestroying these records within 24 hours would prevent the Government \nfrom auditing the NICS system to ensure its accuracy and ``would have \npublic safety implications.'' The GAO warned that a corrupt dealer \ncould provide the FBI with a different name than that of the actual \nbuyer to obtain approval for the name of the false purchaser and then \nproceed with the sale to the actual prohibited buyer. Such a scheme \nwould be nearly impossible to detect with background check records \ndestroyed before the ATF could audit the dealer. Citing his concern \nabout the privacy of gun owners, Attorney General Ashcroft ignored the \nGAO report and the 24-hour record-destruction provision went into \neffect.\n  Another loophole in the law is that it applies only to sales by \nlicensed gun dealers, not to private transfers between unlicensed \npersons. Approximately 40 percent of gun sales are between private \npersons, such as at gun shows. Only six States require background \nchecks on all firearm sales. According to the ATF, almost one-third of \ntrafficked guns are acquired at gun shows and flea markets. These \ngatherings present the perfect opportunity for unlicensed sellers to \noffer countless guns for sale with no questions asked. People who would \nnot pass a background check in a licensed gun store are able to \npurchase as many guns as they wish at gun shows.\n  Between the enactment in 1993 and 2005, the Brady Act has prevented \napproximately 1.4 million convicted felons and other prohibited persons \nfrom buying guns from licensed retail dealers. Without NICS records, \nlaw enforcement officers do not have the opportunity to retrieve a \nmistakenly sold gun in order to protect against its use in a crime. I \nurge my colleagues to pass commonsense gun regulations which would put \nan end to these gaping holes in our gun laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5073-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5073-S5074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE STATE OF SMALL BUSINESS MANUFACTURING\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I commemorate National Small Business \nWeek, which President Bush designated for April 22-28, 2007. As ranking \nMember of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \nI have made it one of my top priorities to champion our Nation's small \nbusinesses and manufacturers and promote their needs and concerns. Our \ntop job creators deserve nothing less. The fact is, small businesses \nare the driving force behind our Nation's economic growth, creating \nnearly three-quarters of all net new jobs and employing nearly 51 \npercent of the private sector workforce. It is essential that we in \nCongress continue to support small businesses ability to grow and \nexpand so our economy can accelerate forward and create more jobs.\n  I can tell you, there is no higher priority for me than bolstering \nthe state of our Nation's small manufacturers. In Maine, more than \n20,700 manufacturing jobs disappeared between August 2000 and August \n2006. We here in\n\n[[Page S5074]]\n\nCongress cannot accept any more losses as a foregone conclusion. This \nvital sector continues to face tremendous challenges--taking on a \nsignificant level of domestic costs that foreign competitors do not, \nincluding labor costs, fuel costs, and the regulatory and tax burden. \nSadly, as a result, many manufacturers are forced to close their doors \nor outsource abroad.\n  The reality is, the manufacturing sector, more than any other sector, \ndrives our Nation's economy--with manufacturers responsible for more \nthan 70 percent of private sector research and manufacturing goods \nmaking up over 60 percent of U.S. exports. There is no coincidence that \nthis is a value added industry.\n  I believe that we can and must fight for our Nation's manufacturers \nespecially when you consider the manufacturing industries pay wages \nthat are about one-third higher than average wages. And that is all the \nmore true for small business when they have resources available that \nhave proven their value, including the SBA which has helped to create \nor retain over 5.3 million jobs since 1999. And just last year, the \nmanufacturing extension partnership's, MEP's, services helped to create \nand retain over 35,000 jobs and increase revenue by $6.25 billion. We \nmust work hand-in-glove with Small Business Administration, SBA, and \nMEP to bolster our manufacturing base to ensure not only that resources \nare available to those who wanted to either maintain, grow, or start \nsmall businesses.\n  That is why I introduced an amendment today to the America COMPETES \nAct that clarifies the MEP non-Federal cost share language to enable \nthe MEP centers to draw down all of their available funding and further \nenhance their capability and capacity to work with manufacturers.\n  This amendment clarifies the intent of Congress when it first enacted \nthe statute authorizing the Manufacturing Extension Partnership \nProgram, now known as the Hollings Manufacturing Partnership Program, \nto provide Federal assistance to manufacturers in the United States.\n  A key concept in the program is the requirement that each center \nobtain 50 percent of its capital and annual operating and maintenance \ncosts from sources other than the Federal Government. The National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, NIST, officials have, in the \npast, properly considered cost share requirements to have been met when \ncenters partnered or entered into other agreements with other \norganizations meeting the needs of American manufacturers.\n  This amendment clarifies and reemphasizes that such agreements and \npartnerships, and the money spent by those organizations assisting \nAmerican manufacturers, clearly are to be considered proper cost share \nas long as the partnering organization is meeting the programmatic \nobjectives for assistance to be provided to American manufacturers as \nset forth for the Hollings Manufacturing Partnership Program. By \nteaming with such organizations, as encouraged by the original statute, \nthe centers can and do leverage their Federal resources and avoid \nduplicating services necessary for the successful operation of American \nmanufacturers. With the right resources, many more small manufacturers \nwill be eligible to use this program to help grow their business.\n  We cannot ignore the effect that countries like China are having on \nour Nation's manufacturers. In order to compete fairly in this \nincreasingly competitive global market we must ensure that currencies \nare not strategically manipulated. That is why I will continue to work \nwith the President and those in Congress to ensure that our Nation gets \ntough with China on those important issues. I continue to pressure the \nTreasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative to also work \ntoward that goal China to move toward a market-based exchange rate.\n  The bottom line is, our country's future will be determined by \ntoday's small businesses. The faster we strengthen and sustain our \nNation's small manufacturers, the more quickly America's economy will \ngrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5074-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5074-S5075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SMALL BUSINESS' VITAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I offer a few remarks regarding \nNational Small Business Week, which President Bush designated for April \n22-28, 2007. As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, one of my top priorities is to champion \nour Nation's small businesses and to promote their needs and concerns. \nOur top job creators deserve nothing less.\n  This week, I have already discussed how Congress must solve the small \nbusiness health insurance crisis and bolster the state of our Nation's \nsmall manufacturers. Today, I would like to spend a few minutes on the \ncritical role small businesses play in the American economy. In the \nback of our minds, we in Congress all know how vital small businesses \nare to economic growth. But when we come to the floor to speak about \nsmall businesses issues, we are generally trying to fix a specific \nproblem. We generally gloss over the overall impact small businesses \nhave on driving our Nation's economy.\n  The Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy, an \nindependent voice for small businesses within the Federal Government, \nhas published a wide variety of statistics regarding small firms. This \ndata, which shows that small businesses are responsible for 50 percent \nof nonfarm economic output, or gross domestic product, clearly reflects \nhow vital small businesses are to job creation and the Nation's \neconomy.\n  One little known fact is that small businesses represent just about \nevery private-sector employer in the United States. According to the \nOffice of Advocacy, which defines a small business as an independent \nemployer with fewer than 500 employees, small firms represent 99.7 \npercent of all employer firms. In 2005, approximately 25.8 million \nsmall businesses, 671,800 of which are estimated to have opened in that \nyear alone, were operational and providing consumers and businesses \nwith goods and services. Of these firms, 5.8 million had employees, and \n18.6 million were sole proprietorships. In contrast, there were only \napproximately 17,000 larger business in operation across the country in \n2005.\n  Not only do small businesses account for just about every employer in \nthe United States, but these firms are also job providers. Small \nbusinesses employ fully half of all private-sector workers. They also \npay more than 45 percent of U.S. private payroll. Of the 113.4 million \nnonfarm private-sector workers in 2003, 57.4 million were employed by \nsmall firms with fewer than 500 employees. Notably, small businesses \nwith fewer than 100 employees accounted for 41 million of that number.\n  In addition to employing American workers, small businesses are also \nat the forefront of creating new jobs. Over the last decade, small \nbusinesses have generated 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs annually. \nWhat is particularly interesting is that in 2003, the most recent year \nfor which complete data is available, small businesses created \n1,990,326 net new jobs. In contrast, large firms with 500 or more \nemployees shed 994,667 jobs. Thus, if it were not for small businesses, \nthe economy would have lost jobs in 2003 instead of creating just about \n1 million new employment opportunities for America's workforce.\n  It is vital to point out that the jobs small businesses are creating \nreflect the needs of a high-tech, innovative, and global marketplace. \nSmall businesses have led the technological revolution and currently \nemploy 41 percent of high-tech workers, including scientists, \nengineers, and information technology professionals. Moreover, small \nbusinesses are constantly creating new products, producing 13 to 14 \ntimes more patents per employee than large firms. In addition, these \npatents are twice as likely as large-firm patents to be among the one \npercent most-often cited. Finally, America's small business are \ncompeting on a global scale, comprising 97 percent of all identified \nexporters and producing 28.6 of total exports in 2004.\n  The fact is small businesses are the driving force behind our \nNation's economic growth creating nearly three-quarters of all net new \njobs and employing nearly 51 percent of the private sector workforce. \nThese are the reasons it is so essential that we in Congress continue \nto support small businesses' ability to grow and expand so that our \neconomy can accelerate forward and create more jobs. I hope we keep \nthis in\n\n[[Page S5075]]\n\nmind when we come to the floor to fight for fewer regulations, a lower \ntax burden, and more affordable and accessible health insurance for \nsmall businesses and their employees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5075-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMBATTING VIOLENCE WITH JOBS FOR YOUTH\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a recent op-ed article in the Boston \nGlobe emphasizes the severity of the employment problems facing today's \nyouth and its relationship to the increase in gang and gun-related \nviolence in the Nation's cities.\n  Easy access to guns and other dangerous weapons and the shameful \nprevalence of drugs are major contributors to this problem, but so too \nis the lack of job opportunities available for our youth. We have \nfailed to develop job programs that will help these youths build a \nfuture without guns and gangs.\n  In the Globe piece, William Spring, the distinguished former vice \npresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a senior member of \nthe domestic policy staff in the Carter administration, and Andrew Sum \nof Northeastern's Center for Labor Market Studies, argue that although \nwe face a very real problem with youth unemployment, we can do \nsomething constructive about it. The only question is whether we have \nthe will and the wisdom to make the investments necessary to enable our \nyouth to seek, find, and take advantage of the job opportunities that \ncan transform their lives and make our communities safer and stronger.\n  I believe the article will be of interest to all of us in Congress, \nand I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Apr. 5, 2007]\n\n                Combatting Violence With Jobs for Youths\n\n                   (By William Spring and Andrew Sum)\n\n       During the past few weeks, attention has been focused on \n     the rise in fatal shootings and gang-related activities in \n     Boston. Governor Deval Patrick and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino \n     recently announced joint efforts to combat gang violence, \n     including an expansion in youth summer jobs. Renewed public \n     policy attention to youth labor market problems in Boston and \n     the state is clearly warranted. While the overall number of \n     jobs has increased over the past few years, the labor market \n     for teenagers in both the nation and state has remained \n     extraordinarily weak.\n       Employment rates for the nation's and state's teens (age \n     16-19) in 2005 and 2006 were the lowest in the past 50 years. \n     Male high school students and dropouts across the state have \n     found it particularly difficult to find work over the past \n     six years, often increasing their involvement in gang and \n     criminal activities.\n       To make matters worse, job opportunities for high school \n     youths are distributed unevenly across key demographic and \n     socioeconomic groups. In 2005, white high school youths were \n     twice as likely to work as black youths and 40 percent more \n     likely than Hispanic youths. The need for a concerted set of \n     public policy responses both short-term and long-term is \n     needed.\n       A variety of favorable educational, social, and labor \n     market outcomes can be generated from an expansion of in-\n     school work opportunities for high school students, \n     especially those from race-ethnic minority and low-income \n     groups.\n       National research has shown that minority and low-income \n     youths who work in high school are less likely to drop out \n     than their peers who do not work. Students with jobs that \n     offer work-based learning opportunities are more likely to \n     see the relevance of school curriculum to future job \n     performance and remain more committed to their school work.\n       Teenage women who live in local areas that provide more job \n     opportunities to them are less likely to become pregnant, and \n     male teens are less likely to become involved with the \n     criminal justice system. National, state, and local research \n     also consistently reveals that work in high school \n     facilitates the transition to the labor market upon \n     graduation and increases the annual earnings of youth in \n     their late teens and early 20s.\n       There are a variety of workforce development strategies \n     that can be pursued to boost employment opportunities for \n     high school students during the regular school year and the \n     summer.\n       First, the hiring of professional staff to work with \n     students and employers to create work-based learning \n     opportunities, paid internships, and regular job \n     opportunities is important, especially for youth from low-\n     income families and those whose parents do not work. Job \n     brokering services of these career specialists also can \n     broaden the range of jobs by industry and occupation to which \n     high school students can be exposed.\n       At a minimum, maintaining last year's increased funding for \n     the existing Connecting Activities Program at $7 million can \n     help local Workforce Investment Boards increase the hiring of \n     staff to work with students and employers to improve teen job \n     prospects. The governor and Legislature should jointly \n     support an increase in funding for such connecting activities \n     and demand strong accountability for performance.\n       Second, employers who provide work-based learning \n     opportunities and wages for students in school-to-career \n     programs should receive tax credits for their hiring and \n     training of high school students. Many employers provide \n     important staff support and in-kind contributions to such \n     programs and should be rewarded for their efforts.\n       Third, the governor should encourage all state agencies to \n     promote the hiring of high school students during the summer \n     months, and more of the state's mayors and town managers \n     should follow the lead of Menino in promoting the hiring of \n     their high school students by the private sector.\n       Fourth, the state should adopt a youth apprenticeship \n     program similar to that of the state of Wisconsin's and more \n     aggressively promote apprenticeship training under the \n     existing system in our state. Young workers in Wisconsin can \n     receive youth apprenticeship training in up to 21 \n     occupational fields under the state's system, thereby \n     providing employers with access to young skilled workers in a \n     structured work/training system.\n       Massachusetts should aim to become a national leader in \n     both the employment and training of its high school students \n     and out-of-school youth. A more successful youth employment \n     and training system can help promote the future growth and \n     quality of our state's resident labor force and help stem \n     high levels of out-migration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5075-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5075-S5076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REFORMING THE STUDENT LOAN INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a column by Joe Nocera from last \nSaturday's New York Times contains an excellent analysis of the student \nloan industry and the recent sale of Sallie Mae. We often hear about \nthe rising cost of college and the debt that so many students shoulder \nto attend college. As this article emphasizes, the industry reaps \nenormous profits by forcing students to burden themselves with \nexcessive debt.\n  The recent sale of Sallie Mae illustrates the problem. The company, \nthe largest player in the industry, was purchased earlier this month by \nprivate equity firms and banks for an incredible $25 billion, 50 \npercent premium over Sallie Mae's stock price.\n  Financial specialists know how profitable lenders such as Sallie Mae \nare because of the large Government subsidies these companies receive \nsubsidies of more than a billion dollars last year. As Congress moves \nforward with reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, we must look \nclosely at this industry and its practices to ensure that America's \nstudents are the ones being served, not just the bottom lines of \nAmerica's lenders.\n  Mr. Nocera, a Times' business columnist and former editorial director \nof Fortune magazine, is widely respected and has won numerous awards \nfor excellence in business journalism. I believe his column will be of \ninterest to all of us in Congress, as we consider the reauthorization \nof the Higher Education Act, and I ask unanimous consent that his \narticle, ``Sallie Mae Offers a Lesson in Cashing In,'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 21, 2007]\n\n                Sallie Mae Offers a Lesson on Cashing In\n\n                            (By Joe Nocera)\n\n       Aren't you just fuming about that Sallie Mae deal?\n       The company, formally known as the SLM Corporation, which \n     has been the subject of recent exposes and investigations, \n     announced this week that it had agreed to be taken private in \n     a deal worth $25 billion. The stock, which has been in a slow \n     decline over the last year, leapt. The market was pleased.\n       But I'm here to tell you that the deal stinks, though not \n     in the usual ``management and private equity are stealing \n     your company'' kind of way. You're free to disagree, of \n     course, though if you do, you're probably not struggling to \n     put your children through college.\n       Sallie Mae is the nation's largest student lender; indeed, \n     it dominates the business. It has the biggest share of \n     government-guaranteed loans, originating $16 billion of such \n     loans last year alone. In 2006, it also generated $7.4 \n     billion in ``private'' loans: that is,\n\n[[Page S5076]]\n\n     loans that aren't guaranteed, but which students need because \n     their tuition, room and board so far exceeds the pathetic \n     $23,000 the government guarantees over the course of an \n     undergraduate degree.\n       The most popular government-guaranteed loans come with \n     interest rate caps (currently 6.8 percent) but they also have \n     certain undeniable advantages for Sallie Mae and its \n     competitors. They are subsidized by the Department of \n     Education. The government makes the lenders nearly whole, \n     even if the student defaults. And the companies are \n     guaranteed by law a decent rate of return.\n       In other words, the lender takes no risk. The private loans \n     are even more lucrative because companies can charge whatever \n     interest rate they want--not to mention all kinds of fees. In \n     all, Sallie Mae originated more than 25 percent of the \n     student loans made last year.\n       But wait. There's more. Sallie Mae buys loans from other \n     education lenders and then securitizes them. It has a loan \n     consolidation business, so students can wrap all their \n     education loans into one big fat Sallie Mae loan. It even has \n     its own collection agency so it can hound delinquent broke \n     graduates into repaying. (Government-guaranteed college \n     loans, by the way, aren't easily discharged if the borrower \n     files for bankruptcy.) Sallie's market power--and its close \n     ties to university financial aid administrators, as we've \n     been learning lately from Jonathan D. Glater, a reporter for \n     The New York Times, and others--have made it immensely \n     profitable. In 2006, the company made over $1 billion.\n       Thus, you can't blame the private equity guys for drooling \n     over Sallie Mae. They look at the company, and the arena in \n     which it plays, and they see never-ending tuition increases. \n     The need for a college education will only increase in \n     importance. Most cash-short students and middle-class parents \n     will continue to borrow lots of money to pay the $100,000 to \n     $150,000 required to attend a good college. Although the \n     Democrats want to cut the subsidies for government-backed \n     loans, and lower the interest rate caps, the more lucrative \n     private market is going to continue to explode. No wonder the \n     private equity firms of J. C. Flowers & Company and Friedman \n     Fleischer & Lowe were willing to offer a 50 percent premium \n     over Sallie's stock price--and load on $16 billion in new \n     debt. This thing is a gold mine, I tell you.\n       But there's another, less market-oriented way to look at \n     this. The entire educational-lending racket is built around \n     the business of piling thousands of dollars worth of debt \n     onto a class of Americans who will probably have to struggle \n     to pay it back. ``We ask people who are trying to make \n     something of themselves to mortgage their future, and Sallie \n     Mae profits from that,'' said Elizabeth Warren, a professor \n     at Harvard Law School.\n       And when those former students have to start paying back \n     the loans, and they don't have a good-paying job, and they \n     start to fall behind, the industry takes full advantage. \n     Meanwhile, many of the practices now under investigation by \n     the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, are intended \n     primarily to keep out competition that might bring down the \n     cost of those loans. Last week, Sallie Mae paid $2 million to \n     settle an investigation that Mr. Cuomo's office was \n     undertaking. In other words, Sallie Mae and its competitors \n     are maximizing profits on the backs of college students. Can \n     that really be the right priority for our society?\n       It wasn't always like this. Sallie Mae was started in 1972, \n     and for most of its existence it was a ``government-sponsored \n     entity'' like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Its primary role was \n     to buy up and securitize government-backed student loans \n     originated by banks and others so that they, in turn, would \n     have the cash to make yet more student loans. The government \n     subsidized such loans to give lenders the incentive to make \n     them, since the interest rates were fairly low, and the \n     margins were thin. The private loan business largely didn't \n     exist.\n       During the Clinton administration, the government created a \n     new direct-loan program, thus potentially cutting out the \n     industry, and leaving Sallie Mae with the prospect of \n     becoming irrelevant. At the time, Sallie Mae was prevented by \n     law from originating its own loans.\n       In 1997, Albert L. Lord became the chief executive of \n     Sallie Mae. (He remains the company's chairman.) Despite \n     presiding over a government-sponsored entity, Mr. Lord was an \n     unapologetic capitalist, who decided that Sallie's best bet \n     was to untether itself from the feds and go directly into the \n     loan business.\n       Under his leadership, Sallie shed its status as a \n     government-sponsored entity and began the process of \n     dominating the industry. It built those controversial ties to \n     financial aid officials. It helped push back the direct loan \n     business, which many people believe offers taxpayers a much \n     better deal. It got into the private loan business. It became \n     the 800-pound gorilla. From 1999 to 2004, Mr. Lord \n     accumulated $235 million, most of it from stock options. He \n     got so rich making student loans that he even led one of the \n     groups trying to buy the Washington Nationals baseball team.\n       The abuses and problems that have recently come to light \n     have actually been around for years. But it wasn't until a \n     new entrant into the field, MyRichUncle, began running a \n     series of advertisements asking pointed questions about the \n     cozy relationships between financial aid officials and \n     executives at the big educational lenders, that the world \n     took notice. The small company's two founders, Raza Khan and \n     Vishal Garg, both 29, had the radical idea that if they \n     offered lower interest rates and a better deal, students and \n     parents would flock to them. Instead, they discovered that \n     most people simply did whatever the university federal aid \n     officer suggested, and they couldn't get on the list of \n     ``preferred lenders.''\n       Shut out by what they saw as a cartel, they decided to \n     fight back with a public campaign. That campaign helped set \n     in motion the current investigation by Mr. Cuomo--and earned \n     the MyRichUncle founders the eternal enmity of Sallie Mae and \n     the rest of the industry.\n       Not that they appear to care. ``We love talking about \n     Sallie Mae,'' Mr. Khan told me with a devious chuckle. Mr. \n     Khan believes that students will be better served if the \n     lending companies start competing on the basis of interest \n     rates and price--and not just on who can cozy up to the \n     universities. It is hard to disagree with him.\n       What does Sallie Mae say about all of this? You will not be \n     surprised to hear that the company views itself not as the \n     college student's tormentor but as her best friend. I spoke \n     to two Sallie Mae representatives, a senior vice president \n     named Barry Goulding, and Tom Joyce, its vice president for \n     corporate communications, both of whom insisted that Sallie \n     Mae was the dominant player because it offered students and \n     administrators the best level of service, and the best array \n     of products. They insisted that borrowers who exhibited \n     exemplary behavior often got interest rate reductions. (Those \n     who missed a payment weren't so lucky, however.) They said \n     that the so-called preferred-lender list was actually a good \n     thing, and not a way to keep out competition.\n       ``The vast majority of schools go through a competitive \n     bidding process and get the best deals for students,'' Mr. \n     Joyce said.\n       According to them--and they are right about this--a big \n     part of the problem is that Congress hasn't raised the limit \n     on government-guaranteed loans since the early 1990s, and \n     that fact, rather than the lenders' greed, is what has driven \n     the explosive rise in private loans. Although they complained \n     that any move by Democrats to lower subsidies and interest \n     rates would hurt its business, they denied that this would \n     cause Sallie Mae to promote its private business at the \n     expense of its government-guaranteed business.\n       And maybe it won't. But even so, the current for-profit \n     student lending industry is still more about shareholders and \n     profits than about the genuine needs of students, who very \n     often don't have enough money in the first 2, or 5, or even \n     10 years out of college to pay the high interest rates and \n     onerous fees that make the industry so profitable.\n       There are some things in life that really ought to be about \n     more than making money. Surely, student loans should be on \n     that list. Sallie Mae was once an institution where profits \n     took a back seat to performing a public good. That, alas, is \n     no longer the case.\n       Lest you doubt me, listen to Mr. Lord himself. On Thursday, \n     The Washington Post published an interview in which he \n     bluntly declared that his decision to take the company \n     private stemmed from his frustration with ``the politicians'' \n     whose decisions were hurting Sallie's share price. These are \n     the same politicians, of course, who passed the laws that \n     made Sallie's business possible. But never mind.\n       ``I didn't see our share price rebounding anytime soon and \n     I said, `This is silly,' '' Mr. Lord told the paper. Mr. Lord \n     added that when the buyout is complete and he leaves the \n     company, he'll walk away with a $135 million payout.\n       Are you mad yet?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5076-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5076-S5077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE VISIT OF PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today I extend my welcome to Prime Minister \nShinzo Abe of Japan, who is making his first trip to the United States \nas Prime Minister this week.\n  The U.S. Japan alliance has been one of the great successes of the \npostwar era, and Japan's remarkable achievements and constructive role \nin world affairs over the past 60 years are a great testament to the \nJapanese people. As the world's two wealthiest democracies, the U.S. \nand Japan, have a shared interest in promoting security and prosperity \nin Asia and around the world--shared interests that rest on a bedrock \nof shared values: in democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and free \nmarkets.\n  As one of America's closest allies, Japan today plays a vital role in \nworking with the United States in maintaining regional security and \nstability, promoting prosperity, and meeting the new security \nchallenges of the 21st century.\n  Japan's role in the Six Party Talks--supporting efforts to persuade \nNorth Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program and return to the \nnonproliferation treaty and IAE safeguards--has been essential. And \nbeyond North Korea, Japan today is playing a leading role in the \narchitecture of the Asia-Pacific region, including participating in \npeace keeping operations, and\n\n[[Page S5077]]\n\nin building stable and enduring structures for cooperative regional \nsecurity.\n  In the face of such threats as North Korea's nuclear and missile \nprograms, Japan, in partnership with the United States, has also sought \nto reinvigorate its security profile in the region. Japan's efforts to \ndevelop a more capable Self-Defense Forces, as well as the Prime \nMinister's elevation of the Japan Defense Agency to a Ministry, are, in \nmy view, both to be welcomed as signs of a ``normal'' Japan, able and \nwilling to play a leading and responsible role in the region.\n  The U.S.-Japan alliance must remain at the core of efforts to \nrevitalize Japan's role in ensuing stability and security in the \nregion. One key aspect of this effort is the realignment of forces \ncurrently in Japan, making certain that America's ability to respond to \nthreats in the region is not diminished.\n  Japan has shown that it is not only playing a responsible leadership \nrole in its own region, but globally as well.\n  The occasion of the Prime Minister's visit provides an opportunity \nfor the people of the United States to express our deep appreciation to \nJapan for its contributions to our efforts to combat al-Qaeda and other \ninternational terrorist organizations. In Afghanistan, Japan has \ndonated over $1 billion in development funds to rebuild vital \ninfrastructure precisely the sort of effort to transform the \nenvironment in Afghanistan that will be key to defeating al-Qaeda and \nthe Taliban. And Japan has provided critical support--often unseen--in \nmultilateral efforts to thwart the growth of terrorist organizations in \nSoutheast Asia.\n\n  Japan has also proved to be an invaluable partner in providing \nhumanitarian response and relief in the Southeast Asia. Japan joined \nwith the United States in responding to the tragic December 2005 \ntsunami, and has worked with others across the region to develop an \neffective tsunami early warning system.\n  And Japan has worked with the United States and others in the \ninternational community to develop the infrastructure and institutions \nwe need in order to face new transnational challenges like the threat \nof avian influenza. Also, although Japan's foreign assistance level \ndeclined earlier in the decade, as part of the 2005 G8 global \ndevelopment discussions, Japan announced it would increase foreign aid \nby $10 billion in aggregate over the next 5 years, and double its \nassistance to Africa over the next 3 years.\n  With newspaper headlines that remind us on a daily basis of the risk \nthe planet faces from climate change, we must also recognize the \ncritical leadership role in the international community that Japan has \nplayed on environmental issues and climate change. The Kyoto Protocol, \nwhich was negotiated in Japan's ancient capital of Kyoto in 1997, has \nnow been ratified by over 160 nations.\n  Japan has also played a key role in forging the Asia-Pacific \nPartnership on Clean Development and Climate, through which the U.S., \nJapan, and others in the region seek to marshal the scientific and \ntechnical expertise needed to develop cleaner and more efficient \ntechnologies and bring about a carbon-neutral Asia-Pacific region \nwithout sacrificing economic growth.\n  As the world's second-largest economy, Japan is a vital source of \ngrowth and dynamism for the rest of the world. In this regard, the \nreemergence of Japan from its ``lost decade'' of virtually no economic \ngrowth is a most welcome development.\n  There is nonetheless still more Japan can do at home to improve the \nstructure of its economy, from removing regulations that stifle \nbusiness competition and innovation to further develop Tokyo as a \nglobal financial market. And the Japanese economy is still not open \nenough to imports in key sectors or to foreign direct investment. The \nUnited States has an interest in seeing Japan address these challenges \nso that the Japanese economy can continue to play a leading role in \nsustaining global economic growth.\n  Although not without its challenges--as is natural in any normal \nbilateral relationship--the United States and Japan today have a strong \nand deep relationship and the basis for close cooperation and \npartnership which will allow us to work together to meet the challenges \nof the decades ahead.\n  But I would be remiss in my duties as a friend of Japan if I did not \nnote that for Japan to be able to play a leading role in Asia and be \nperceived by its neighbors as a ``normal'' nation it must deal \nforthrightly with its history. It is important for Japan to face these \nissue fully, openly, and honestly. A Japan that is mindful of its past \ncan and should play a leading role in Asia's future.\n  So let me, in turn, close with some thoughts on the future of the \nU.S.-Japan relationship.\n  First, I believe that it is important for Americans, so used to a \nclose partnership with Japan, to embrace the complex realities of a \nJapan that is a ``normal nation''--one that has its own identity, \nvision, and goals. Such a Japan should be welcomed by the United States \nas a true partner and friend, even while understanding that it may mean \nthat there will be differences on certain issues.\n  Given the new regional realities, United States can no longer take \nmanaging the U.S.-Japan alliance for granted.\n  Second, although the U.S.-Japan relationship remains the centerpiece \nof both U.S. and Japanese policy in the Asia-Pacific region, in recent \nyears the Bush administration has let its attention to this critical \nrelationship drift as it has been distracted by other issues.\n  The alliance demands, and is deserving of, close political \ncooperation and coordination at every level, reflecting the key role \nJapan plays as an anchor of U.S. economic and security interests in the \nregion and across the globe.\n  Third, recognizing the important role that Japan now plays around the \nglobe--on peacekeeping, economic development, global warming and new \ntransnational threats--I believe the time has long since passed for \nJapan to have a role commensurate with its responsibilities, including \nin the U.N. Security Council.\n  The visit of Prime Minister Abe provides us an opportunity to \nrededicate ourselves to the U.S.-Japan partnership, with the same \nspirit that has governed our relations for over 60 years. America \nbenefits greatly from a close and productive partnership with a Japan \nthat is confident about its future and willing and able to play a \nleading role in creating a peaceful and prosperous Asia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5077-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5077-S5079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   STATE-BASED HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, there is a crisis facing our country, a \ncrisis that directly affects the lives of over 45 million people in the \nUnited States, and that indirectly affects many more. The crisis is the \nlack of universal health insurance in America, and its effects are \nrippling through our families, our communities, and our economy. It is \nthe No. 1 issue that I hear about in Wisconsin, and it is the No. 1 \nissue for many Americans. Nevertheless, the issue has been largely \nignored in the Halls of Congress. We sit idle, locked in a stalemate, \nrefusing to give this life-threatening problem its due attention. We \nneed a way to break that deadlock, and that is why I have introduced a \nbill with the Senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, that will do \njust that--the State-Based Health Care Reform Act.\n  Senator Graham and I are from opposite ends of the political \nspectrum, we are from different areas of the country, and we have \ndifferent views on health care. But we agree that something needs to be \ndone about health care in our country. Every day, all over our Nation, \nAmericans suffer from medical conditions that cause them pain and even \nchange they way they lead their lives. Every one of us has either \nexperienced this personally or through a family member suffering from \ncancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, genetic disorders, mental illness or \nsome other condition. The disease takes its toll on both individuals \nand families, as trips to the hospital for treatments such as \nchemotherapy test the strength of the person and the family affected. \nThis is an incredibly difficult situation for anyone. But for the \nuninsured and underinsured, the suffering goes beyond physical \ndiscomfort. These Americans bear the additional burden of wondering \nwhere the next dollar for their health care bills will come from; \nworries of going into debt; worries of going bankrupt because of health \ncare needs.\n\n[[Page S5078]]\n\nWhen illness strikes families, the last thing they should have to think \nabout is money, but for many in our country, this is a persistent \nburden that causes additional stress and hopelessness when they are \nill.\n  It is difficult to do justice to the magnitude of the uninsurance \nproblem, but I want to share a few astounding statistics. Forty-seven \npercent of the uninsured avoided seeking care in 2003 due to the cost. \nThirty-five percent needed care but did not get it. Thirty-seven \npercent did not fill a prescription because of cost. The uninsured are \nseven times more likely to seek care in an emergency room. They are \nless likely to receive preventative care because they cannot afford to \nsee the doctor, and they are more likely to die as a result. Each year, \nat least 18,000 people die prematurely in this country because of \nuninsurance. If the uninsured had access to continuous health coverage, \na reduction in mortality of 5 percent to 15 percent could be achieved.\n  The United States is the only industrialized nation that does not \nguarantee health care for its citizens. In other countries, if someone \nis sick, they get proper care regardless of ability to pay. In our \ncountry, that is not the case. It is unacceptable for a nation as great \nas America to not provide good health care for all our citizens. We are \nfailing those in need. We are failing the hard-working family that \ncannot afford the insurance offered to them. We are failing the \nuninsured children whose parents do not have any access to insurance. \nWe are failing low-income Americans and middle-income Americans alike. \nThis is not right. We can do better.\n  Even for those Americans who currently have health insurance through \ntheir employer, the risk of becoming uninsured is very real. Large \nbusinesses are finding themselves less competitive in the global market \nbecause of skyrocketing health care costs. Small businesses are finding \nit difficult to offer insurance to employees while staying competitive \nin their own communities. Our health care system has failed to keep \ncosts in check, and there is simply no way we can expect businesses to \nkeep up. More and more, employers are forced to increase employee cost-\nsharing or to offer subpar benefits, or no benefits at all. Employers \ncannot be the sole provider of health care when these costs are rising \nfaster than inflation.\n  I travel to each of Wisconsin's 72 counties every year to hold \ntownhall meetings. Almost every year, the No. 1 issue raised at these \nlistening sessions is the same--health care. The failure of our health \ncare system brings people to these meetings in droves. These people \nused to think government involvement was a terrible idea, but not \nanymore. Now they come armed with their frustration, their anger, and \ntheir desperation, and they tell me that their businesses and their \nlives are being destroyed by health care costs, and they want the \ngovernment to step in.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Graham in introducing the State-\nBased Health Care Reform Act. In short, this bill establishes a pilot \nproject to provide states with the resources needed to implement \nuniversal health care reform. The bill does not dictate what kind of \nreform the States should implement, it just provides an incentive for \naction, provided the states meet certain minimum coverage and low-\nincome requirements.\n  Even though Senator Graham and I support different methods of health \ncare reform, we both agree that this legislation presents a viable \nsolution to the logjam preventing reform. I have long said that a \nsingle-payer health care system is what I prefer for our country. \nSenator Graham would like to see health care privatized and see a base, \ncatastrophic coverage offered to everyone. Despite our disagreements \nabout the form that health care reform should take, we agree on this \nlegislation.\n  This bipartisan legislation harnesses the talent and ingenuity of \nAmericans to come up with new solutions. This approach takes advantage \nof America's greatest resources--the mind power and creativity of the \nAmerican people--to move our country toward the goal of a working \nhealth care system with universal coverage. With help from the Federal \nGovernment, States will be able to try new ways of covering all their \nresidents, and our political logjam around health care will begin to \nloosen.\n  Over the years I have heard many different proposals for how we \nshould change the health care system in this country. Some propose \nusing tax incentives as a way to expand access to health care. Others \nthink the best approach is to expand public programs. Some feel a \nnational single payer health care system is the only way to go. We need \nto consider all of these as we address our broken health care system.\n  Under our proposal, States can be creative in the state resources \nthey use to expand health care coverage. For example, a state can use \npersonal or employer mandates for coverage, use State tax incentives, \ncreate a single-payer system or even join with neighboring States to \noffer a regional health care plan. The proposals are subject only to \nthe approval of the newly created Health Care Coverage Task Force, \nwhich will be composed of health care experts, consumers, and \nrepresentatives from groups affected by health care reform. This task \nforce will be responsible for choosing viable state projects and \nensuring that the projects are effective. The task force will also help \nthe States develop projects, and will continue a dialogue with the \nStates in order to facilitate a good relationship between the State and \nFederal Governments.\n\n  The task force is also charged with making sure that the State plans \nmeet certain minimal requirements. First, the State plans must include \nspecific target dates for decreasing the number of uninsured, and must \nalso identify a set of minimum benefits for every covered individual. \nThese benefits must be comparable to health insurance offered to \nFederal employees. Second, the State plans must include a mechanism to \nguarantee that the insurance is affordable. Americans should not go \nbroke trying to keep healthy, and health care reform should ensure that \nindividual costs are manageable. The State-Based Health Care Reform Act \nbases affordability on income.\n  Another provision in this legislation requires that the States \ncontribute to paying for their new health care programs. The Federal \nGovernment will provide matching funds based on enhanced FMAP--the same \nstandard used for SCHIP--and will then provide an additional 5 percent. \nStates that can afford to provide more are encouraged to, but the \nmatching requirement will ensure the financial viability of the bill \nand state buy-in. Other than these requirements, the states largely \nhave flexibility to design a plan that works best for their respective \nresidents. The possibilities for reform are wide open.\n  One of the main criticisms of Federal Government spending on health \ncare is that it is expensive and increases the deficit. My legislation \nis fully offset, ensuring that it will not increase the deficit. The \nbill doesn't avoid making the tough budget choices that need to be made \nif we are going to pay for health care reform.\n  One of the offsets in the bill was proposed by the Congressional \nBudget Office: an increase in the flat rebate paid by drug \nmanufacturers for Medicaid prescription drugs. Currently, Medicaid \nrecoups a portion of its drug spending through a rebate paid by the \nmanufacturer. The savings mechanism would set a flat rebate, and \nprovide funding for the States' health care reform projects. Another \noffset in the bill, also proposed by the Congressional Budget Office, \nis reduced subsidies for Medicare Part D prescription drug benefits for \nthe highest income seniors. This would impact only single retirees \nearning more than $80,000 per year and married retirees earning more \nthan $160,000--less than 5 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Additional funding for the bill comes from the President's fiscal \nyear 2007 budget proposal to extend the authority of the Federal \nCommunications Commission to auction the radio spectrum and the \nauthority of Customs and Border Protection to collect multiple \ndifferent conveyance and passenger user fees through fiscal year 2016. \nMy bill proposes similar extensions of these established authorities. \nAlso, my bill proposes to both simplify and reduce the Federal subsidy \nof airline passenger screening costs by replacing the current variable \nfee, which is capped at $5 per one-way trip, with a flat $5 fee. This \nproposal is similar to one in the president's fiscal year 2007 budget \nand\n\n[[Page S5079]]\n\nwould decrease Federal subsidies to about 30 percent of passenger \nsecurity costs, without reducing aviation security spending.\n  We can say that it is time to move toward universal coverage, but it \nis empty rhetoric without a feasible plan. I believe that this is the \nway to make universal coverage work in this country. Universal coverage \ndoesn't mean that we have to copy a system already in place in another \ncountry. We can harness our Nation's creativity and entrepreneurial \nspirit to design a system that is uniquely American. Universal coverage \ndoesn't have to be defined by what's been attempted in the past. What \nuniversal coverage does mean is providing a solution for a broken \nsystem where millions are uninsured, and where businesses and Americans \nare struggling under the burden of health care costs.\n  It has been over 10 years since the last serious debate over health \ncare reform was killed by special interests and the soft money \ncontributions they used to corrupt the legislative process. The \nlegislative landscape is now much different. Soft money can no longer \nbe used to set the agenda, and businesses and workers are crying out as \nnever before for Congress to do something about the country's health \ncare crisis.\n  We are fortunate to live in a country that has been abundantly \nblessed with democracy and wealth, and yet there are those in our \nsociety whose daily health struggles overshadow these blessings. That \nis an injustice, but it is one we can and must address. Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., said, ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in \nhealth care is the most shocking and inhumane.'' It is long past time \nfor Congress to heed these words and end this terrible inequality. I \nurge my colleagues to support the State-Based Health Care Reform Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5079-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMEMORATING GREEN MOUNTAIN NATIONAL FOREST\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 75 years ago today, President Herbert \nHoover signed a proclamation officially establishing the Green Mountain \nNational Forest in Vermont.\n  This was the result of significant effort on the part of the State of \nVermont and several of the State's leading conservationists and \nlegislators of the time. While a number of Vermonters had proposed a \nnational forest in the State just after the turn of the 20th century, \nit took a sustained effort over the next three decades for this vision \nto become a reality.\n  In 1925, the Vermont General Assembly passed the enabling act to \nallow the Forest Service to purchase land in Vermont. Many would argue \njust 2 years later that the devastating impact of the 1927 flood showed \nthe need for sound forest management practices in the Green Mountains. \nIt was fitting that the initial land purchases for the southern half of \nVermont's national forest were from the estate of Marshall J. Hapgood, \nwho, years earlier, had advocated for a National Forest in the Green \nMountains. Hapgood was a practitioner of scientific forestry on his own \nlands and saw the value of a sustainable timber resource and watershed \nprotection.\n  From that initial Hapgood acquisition of just over 1,000 acres, the \nGreen Mountain National Forest has grown to more than 400,000 acres \ntoday, and it includes in the northern half of the forest many of the \nlands conserved by another conservation pioneer, Joseph Battell.\n  The Green Mountain National Forest today is fulfilling the vision of \nthose early forestland stewards by protecting watersheds, providing \nforest products, forest management demonstration and recreational \nopportunities. The Green Mountain forest hosts segments of the Long and \nAppalachian Trails, alpine ski areas, several wilderness areas and two \nnational recreation areas, one of which is now named in honor of our \nlate colleague, Robert T. Stafford.\n  As one of Vermont's Senators, I am proud to have been able to play a \nrole in the growth of the national forest in my State, in both land \narea and with its facilities. I am also grateful to the dedicated, \nprofessional staff of the Green Mountain National Forest who recently \ncompleted the new land and resource management plan for the forest and \nwho were particularly helpful to the congressional delegation during \nour recent wilderness deliberations.\n  As we celebrate its 75th anniversary, we are also proud that the \nGreen Mountain National Forest will be providing the 2007 Capitol \nchristmas tree for the National Mall, and the companion trees for many \nof our public buildings in Washington a tangible example of how the \nGreen Mountain National Forest is being shared by all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5079-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   RECOGNITION OF DR.

In her years as \na practicing family physician in Lake County and on the reservation, \nMary saw first-hand the relationship between limited economic \nopportunity and family health.\n  Since retiring from medicine, Dr. Stranahan has become immersed in \nthe survival and success of local agriculture and mainstreet \nbusinesses. She knows agriculture and small business play a vital role \nin healthy rural communities. Over the years, Dr. Stranahan has, as a \nconcerned individual, been a core donor for innumerable charities and \nnon-profits in Montana.\n  But this year Dr. Stranahan is taking her philanthropic commitment to \na whole new level in chartering the Montana Good Works Foundation. This \nnew Montana foundation will work to focus Dr. Stranahan's grants and \ndonations on social justice, rural community development, and \nsustainable business development in Montana.\n  In one of the Montana Good Works Foundation's first gifts, Dr. \nStranahan has shown extraordinary leadership by giving $1.42 million to \nthe Montana Community Development Corporation. This gift kicks off \nMCDC's campaign to grow its loan fund for Montana businesses to $15 \nmillion and it empowers MCDC to expand its business coaching services.\n  Dr. Stranahan has further committed to help Montana Community \nDevelopment Corporation recruit more philanthropists to this important \neffort to build entrepreneurship in Montana.\n  I commend Dr. Stranahan for her great leadership in rural \nphilanthropy. The Big Sky Institute reports that rural States like \nMontana are on the short end of a great disparity in foundation grant-\nmaking. The Big Sky Institute found that, adjusting for population, \nfoundation grants to rural States are less than a fifth of the national \naverage. After adjusting for population, foundation grants to rural \nStates are less than a tenth of the amount received in the State of New \nYork.\n  Last May, I spoke to the annual conference of the Council on \nFoundations in Pittsburgh, PA. I challenged foundations to double their \ngrant-making to rural States within 5 years. And I am working with \nleaders in the nonprofit and foundations communities to convene a rural \nphilanthropy conference in Missoula this August. I am proud of the \nprogress we are making in rural philanthropy. And I look forward to \nworking together with Montana philanthropists like Dr. Stranahan to \nkeep the ball rolling.\n  I applaud Dr. Stranahan for the vision and the scope of her \nphilanthropy. In particular, I commend her commitment to building rural \nentrepreneurs as a core philanthropic strategy. Dr. Stranahan is one of \nthe new Montana leaders who are showing the world that Montana truly \ndeserves its designation as the Treasure State.\n  I recognize and commend Dr. Mary Stranahan for her substantial \nefforts on behalf of Montana's communities and Montana's \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5079-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5079-S5080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING THE LIFE OF FRED OCHI\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I note the passing of a most \ndistinguished and\n\n[[Page S5080]]\n\ntalented Idaho artist and businessman, Fred I. Ochi, on February 18, \n2007. Fred lived in my hometown of Idaho Falls and was best known \nthroughout Idaho and the West for his beautiful paintings; barns were \none of the trademark subjects of his Japanese-influenced art. Although \nknown for his art work, Fred's life reflected a penchant for \nperseverance, business, and appreciation of the importance of art to \ncommunities.\n  Fred, a Japanese American, was born in California in 1913. After \nlosing his mother at the young age of eight, Fred and his brother spent \n3 years in Japan living with their grandparents. He returned to \nCalifornia where he studied art and became a theatre manager in the San \nFrancisco Bay area in the 1930s. He found a public place for his \nartwork back then--movie marquees of the 17 theatres he managed. Due to \nthe war, Fred was evacuated from California in 1942 and moved to \nsoutheastern Idaho, where he managed marquees for theatres there. Fred \nwas an unfortunate victim of one of the darker periods in Idaho \nhistory; he had to be escorted by Idaho National Guard troops when \npeople organized a protest against the theatres based on Fred's \nethnicity.\n  Fred continued his life's work in Idaho Falls. He settled there in \n1943 and spent the rest of his life working there, raising his children \nwith his wife Yoshiko. The man who completed 10,000 watercolors over \nthe course of his lifetime opened a commercial art and sign shop, and \nwas a founding member of the Idaho Falls Art Guild. In Idaho Falls, he \nserved as a longtime member of the Chamber of Commerce and the Kiwanis \nClub. Fred left an indelible mark on arts in Idaho. He served as \npresident of the Idaho Art Association and earned the 1998 Governors \nAward for Excellence in Art. During Idaho's State Centennial, Fred was \nnamed one of the ``100 Citizens Who Made a Difference for the State.''\n  Fred was generous with his talent, sharing it with students of all \nages throughout Idaho and western Wyoming. Fred's ready smile and sense \nof humor was well-known: his business cards read ``Smiling Irishman, \nFred O'Shay.'' My sister Christine knew Fred well. Knowing of her \ninterest in art, Fred would invite her to watch him work at his studio, \nthe ``log hut.'' She remembers his painting style as fast and powerful; \nhe used many different brushes with big brush strokes. It was \nintentional and bright, like his personality.\n  Fellow Idaho Falls artist Gloria Miller Allen observed:\n\n       I will always remember him in old white dress shirts \n     slightly spattered with paint, and with his glasses spattered \n     as well. I can still see him in his red kimono selling \n     paintings down by the river. Idaho Falls will miss this good \n     man.\n\n  Fred's legacy lives on in his 5 children, 11 grandchildren and 2 \ngreat-grandchildren. He will be sorely missed, and I offer his family \nmy condolences and our gratitude for sharing Fred and his art and \nlegacy with us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5080-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:42 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 362.

A joint resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Maine \n     memorializing the President 'and Congress to fulfill the \n     intent to fund sixty percent of the costs of special \n     education and to end unfunded mandates; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       We, your Memorialists, the Members of the One Hundred and \n     Twenty-third Legislaure of the State of Maine now assembled \n     in the First Regular Session, most respectfully present and \n     petition the President of the United States and the Congress \n     of the United States as follows:\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has found that \n     all children deserve a high-quality education, including \n     children with disabilities; and\n       Whereas, the federal Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act, 20 United States Code, Section 1400. et seq., \n     provides that the Federal Government and state and local \n     governments are to share in the expense of education for \n     children with disabilities and commits the Federal Government \n     to provide funds to assist with the excess expenses of \n     education for children with disabilities; and\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has committed to \n     contribute up to 40 percent of the average per-pupil \n     extenditure of educating children with disabilities and the \n     Federal Government has failed to meet this commitment to \n     assit the states; and\n\n[[Page S5084]]\n\n       Whereas, the Federal Government has never contributed more \n     than a fraction of the national average per-pupil expenditure \n     to assist with the excess expenses of educating children with \n     disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act; and\n       Whereas, this failure of the Federal Government to meet its \n     commitment to assist with the excess expenses of educatirg a \n     child with a disability contradicts the goal of ensuring that \n     children with disabilities receive a high-quality education; \n     and\n       Whereas, the imposition of unfunded mandates by the Federal \n     Government on state governments interferes with the \n     separation of powers between the 2 levels of government and \n     the ability of each state to determine the issues and \n     concerns of that state and what resources should be directed \n     to address these issues and concerns; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government recognized the inequalities \n     of unfunded mandates on state governments when it passed the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995; and\n       Whereas, since the passage of the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act of 1995, however, the Federal Government continues to \n     impose unfunded mandates on state governments, including in \n     areas such as special education requirement: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the President of the United States and the \n     Congress of the United States either provide 60 percent of \n     the national average per-pupil expenditure to assist states \n     and local education agencies with the excess costs of \n     educating children with disabilities or amend the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act to allow the states more \n     flexibility in implementing its mandates; and be it further\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the Congress of the United States revisit and \n     reconfirm the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995 and put the \n     intent and purpose of the Act into practice by ending \n     imposition of unfunded federal mandates on state governments; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honrable George W. Bush, President of the United States, \n     to the President of the Senate of the United States, to the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States \n     and to each Member of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-72. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan urging the Department of \n     Homeland Security to complete an economic analysis of the \n     costs of compliance with the requirements of the federal Real \n     ID Act and the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 20\n\n       Whereas, in response to the need for heightened security \n     measures following the 9-11 attacks, Congress enacted the \n     Real ID Act in 2005. This legislation require the states to \n     dramatically redesign their respective driver's licenses. \n     Digital photos, proof of legal status, and centralized \n     database capabilities will be required. The act and the \n     Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative also greatly alter the \n     documentation required from American citizens seeking reentry \n     into this country; and\n       Whereas, as the deadlines for full compliance with the \n     requirements of the Real ID Act approach, there remains a \n     significant level of confusion over how the states can meet \n     target dates and develop the necessary policies and \n     technology. With the size and scope of the task of \n     redesigning driver's licenses and increasing identification \n     procedures in all 50 states, the current uncertainties are \n     complicating our ability to make our homeland more secure; \n     and\n       Whereas, as with any undertaking of this magnitude, there \n     are major costs involved. At this point, however, there seems \n     to be no comprehensive estimate of the overall economic \n     impact of complying with the Real ID Act and the Western \n     Hemisphere Travel Initiative; and\n       Whereas, the multiple issues involved in following the \n     provisions of the Real ID Act and the Western Hemisphere \n     Travel Initiative are vitally important in Michigan. With \n     some of the world's busiest international crossing points, \n     especially at the Detroit/Windsor border, Michigan has a \n     strong stake in this transition proceeding smoothly and with \n     all the information needed to do so: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the United States \n     Department of Homeland Security to complete an economic \n     analysis of the costs of compliance with the requirements of \n     the federal Real ID Act and the Western Hemisphere Travel \n     Initiative; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the United States Department of Homeland Security, the Office \n     of the President of the United States; the United States \n     Secretary of State; the President of the United States \n     Senate; the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives; the chairs and ranking members of the United \n     States Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the United States \n     Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \n     the United States House Homeland Security Committee, and the \n     United States House International Relations Committee; the \n     members of the Michigan congressional delegation; and the \n     Michigan Secretary of State.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-73. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan memorializing the \n     Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security \n     to develop a pilot program in Michigan for a dual purpose \n     state driver's license/personal identification card to comply \n     with the provisions of the Real ID Act and the Western \n     Hemisphere Travel Initiative; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, in response to the need for heightened security \n     measures following the 9-11 attacks, Congress enacted the \n     Real ID Act in 2005. This legislation requires the states to \n     dramatically redesign their respective driver's licenses. \n     Digital photos, proof of legal status, and centralized \n     database capabilities will be required; and\n       Whereas, another component of recent federal legislation, \n     the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, also greatly alters \n     the documentation required from American citizens seeking \n     reentry into this country. By January 1, 2008, for example, \n     United Sates citizens may be required to show passports when \n     they drive across the border from Canada; and\n       Whereas, with the new requirements of the Real ID Act, \n     state driver's licenses would closely mirror passports not \n     only in the way they are used by travelers, but also in \n     providing a higher level of identification. There is an \n     opportunity in this transition to explore the possibility of \n     combining the secure technology of a passport into the \n     driver's license and realizing significant savings without \n     compromising the security that is the goal of the federal \n     legislation; and\n       Whereas, with some of the busiest international crossing \n     points in the world, Michigan is well-suited for a pilot \n     project to develop a dual driver's license/passport. With $70 \n     billion worth of commercial traffic and nearly 3 million \n     visitors crossing the Michigan/Canadian border each year, \n     including thousands crossing for their jobs each day, \n     Michigan has an unsurpassed stake in how the Western \n     Hemisphere Travel Initiative is implemented; and\n       Whereas, Michigan's Secretary of State is in strong support \n     of the concept of exploring a dual purpose state driver's \n     license/personal identification card. The impact of such a \n     project here could reap widespread benefits for our entire \n     country: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the United \n     States Department of State and the Department of Homeland \n     Security to work with the Michigan Secretary of State to \n     develop a pilot program in Michigan for a dual purpose state \n     driver's license/personal identification card to comply with \n     the provisions of the Real ID Act and the Western Hemisphere \n     Travel Initiative; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the United States Department of Homeland Security, the Office \n     of the President of the United States; the United States \n     Secretary of State; the President of the United States \n     Senate; the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives; the chairs and ranking members of the United \n     States Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the United States \n     Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \n     the United States House Homeland Security Committee, and the \n     United States House International Relations Committee; the \n     members of the Michigan congressional delegation; and the \n     Michigan Secretary of State.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-74. A resolution adopted by the Board of County \n     Commissioners of Miami-Dade County in the State of Florida \n     urging the Florida Legislature to require Florida schools to \n     provide information to 11- and 12-year old girls and their \n     parents about the Human Papillomavirus, the vaccine against \n     HPV, and Cervical Cancer that results from HPV; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n       POM-75.

A bill to enhance Federal efforts focused on public \nawareness and education about the risks and dangers associated with \nShaken Baby Syndrome; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Shaken Baby \nSyndrome Prevention Act of 2007, important legislation that promotes \nawareness and prevention of Shaken Baby Syndrome, a devastating form of \nchild abuse that results in the severe injury, disability or death of \nhundreds of children each year.\n  Child abuse and neglect is a well-documented tragedy for some of our \nyoungest and most vulnerable citizens. According to the National Child \nAbuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) almost 900,000 children were \nvictims of abuse and neglect in 2005. More than four children die every \nsingle day as a result of abusive maltreatment in this country. Babies \nare particularly vulnerable; in 2005, children aged 12 months or \nyounger accounted for nearly 42 percent of all child abuse and neglect \nfatalities and children under age 3 accounted for almost 77 percent. \nYet even these disturbing statistics may not paint an accurate picture; \nmost experts agree that child abuse is widely under-reported.\n  Abusive head trauma, including Shaken Baby Syndrome, is the leading \ncause of death of physically abused children, in particular for infants \nyounger than one. When a frustrated caregiver loses control and \nviolently shakes a baby or impacts the baby's head, the trauma can kill \nthe child or cause severe injuries, including loss of vision, loss of \nhearing, brain damage, paralysis, and/or seizures, resulting in \nlifelong disabilities and creating profound grief for many families.\n  Far too many children have experienced the horrible devastation of \nShaken Baby Syndrome. A 2003 report in the Journal of the American \nMedical Association estimates that as a result of Shaken Baby Syndrome, \nan average of 300 U.S. children will die each year, and 600 to 1,200 \nmore will be injured, of whom two-thirds will be infants younger than \none. Medical professionals believe that thousands of Shaken Baby \nSyndrome cases are misdiagnosed or undetected, as many children do not \nimmediately exhibit obvious symptoms after the abuse.\n  Prevention programs can significantly reduce the number of cases of \nShaken Baby Syndrome. For example, the Upstate New York SBS Prevention \nProject at Children's Hospital of Buffalo has used a simple video to \neducate new parents before they leave the hospital, reducing the number \nof shaken baby incidents in the area by nearly 50 percent.\n  In Connecticut, a multifaceted prevention approach involving \nhospitals, schools, childcare providers, and community-based \norganizations in awareness and training activities, including home \nvisits and targeted outreach, has raised awareness and encouraged \nprevention across the state. Hospitals in many States educate new \nparents about the dangers of shaking a baby, yet it is estimated that \nless than 60 percent of parents of newborns receive information about \nthe dangers of shaking a baby. Without more outreach, education and \ntraining, the risk of Shaken Baby Syndrome will persist.\n  With the introduction of the Shaken Baby Syndrome Prevention Act of \n2007, I hope to reduce the number of children injured or killed by \nabusive head trauma, and ultimately to eliminate Shaken Baby Syndrome. \nOur initiative provides for the creation of a public health campaign, \nincluding development of a National Action Plan to identify effective, \nevidence-based strategies for prevention and awareness of SBS, and \nestablishment of a cross-disciplinary advisory council to help \ncoordinate national efforts.\n  The campaign will educate the general public, parents, child care \nproviders, health care professionals and others about the dangers of \nshaking, as well as healthy preventative approaches for frustrated \nparents and caregivers coping with a crying or fussy infant. The \nlegislation ensures support for families who have been affected by SBS, \nand for families and caregivers struggling with infant crying, through \na 24-hour hotline and an informational website. All of these activities \nare to be implemented through the coordination of existing programs \nand/or the establishment of new efforts, to bring together the best in \ncurrent prevention, awareness and education practices to be expanded \ninto areas in need.\n  Awareness is absolutely critical to prevention. Families, \nprofessionals and caregivers responsible for infants and young children \nand must learn about the dangers of violent shaking and abusive impacts \nto the head.\n  On behalf of the victims of Shaken Baby Syndrome, including Cynthia \nfrom New York, Hannah from California, Sarah from New York, Kierra from \nNevada, Miranda from Pennsylvania, Taylor from Illinois, Cassandra from \nArizona, Gabriela from Florida, Amber from New York, Bennett from \nMissouri, Jamison from Florida, Maggie from Texas, Dalton from Indiana, \nStephen from Texas, Kaden from Washington, Joseph from Texas, Dawson \nfrom Pennsylvania, Macie from Minnesota, Jake from Maine, Benjamin from \nMichigan, Chloe from New Mexico, Madison of Oklahoma, Peanut from \nTexas, Nykkole from Minnesota, Gianna from Rhode Island, Brynn from \nWashington, Rachael from Texas, Jack from Maryland, Ryan from Virginia, \nDavid from California, Reagan from Virginia, Skipper from New York, and \nmany other innocent lives lost or damaged, I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to see that this legislation becomes law so that we \ncan expand efforts to eradicate Shaken Baby Syndrome.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of groups supporting this \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   Groups Supporting the Shaken Baby Syndrome Prevention Act of 2007\n\n       American Association of Neurological Surgeons; American \n     Professional Society on the Abuse of Children; American \n     Psychological Association; The Arc of the United States; \n     Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs; \n     Association of University Centers on Disabilities; Brain \n     Injury Association of America; Center for Child Protection \n     and Family Support; Child Welfare League of America; \n     Children's Defense Fund; Children's Healthcare is a Legal \n     Duty; Congress of Neurological Surgeons; The Connecticut \n     Children's Trust Fund; Council for Exceptional Children; \n     Cynthia Gibbs Foundation; Division for Early Childhood of the \n     Council for Exceptional Children; Easter Seals; Epilepsy \n     Foundation; Fight Crime: Invest in Kids; and The G.E.M.

A bill to require a pilot program on assisting veterans' \nservice organizations and other veterans' groups in developing and \npromoting peer support programs that facilitate community reintegration \nof veterans returning from active duty, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Heroes \nHelping Heroes Demonstration Program of 2007, along with my \ndistinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  Our intention is to expand the use of peer-support approaches to \nassist the reintegration of America's veterans as they return from \nactive duty to their homes and communities. We hope that this \nlegislation will demonstrate the effectiveness of peer-support \napproaches and ease the burden of the social, economic, medical and \npsychological struggles our veterans face.\n  Deployed soldiers face extreme stress and at times devastating \ninjuries. Left untreated, this stress can have devastating impact on \nsoldiers and their families. Army researchers have found that alcohol \nmisuse went from 13 percent among soldiers to 21 percent one year after \nreturning from Iraq and Afghanistan. It also has been found that \nsoldiers with anger and aggression issues increase from 11 percent to \n22 percent after deployment. Furthermore, the best studies to date have \nshown that up to one-third of our current war veterans are coping with \na serious mental health problem, most notably Post Traumatic Stress \nDisorder (PTSD).\n  In addition to these personal struggles, returning soldiers also face \nserious social and economic challenges. Data from the U.S. Bureau of \nLabor Statistics indicates that unemployment among soldiers returning \nto civilian life is 15 percent--three times the national average. Those \nsoldiers planning to divorce their spouse rose from nine percent to 15 \npercent after time spent in the combat zone. Unfortunately, as more \ntroops are deployed, deployments are extended and breaks between \ndeployments become shorter these problems will only become more \nprevalent.\n  At present, the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs are struggling to meet the needs of returning veterans. \nSituations like those recently uncovered at Walter Reed Hospital \ndemonstrate a health care system stretched to its limits. Furthermore, \nit would require significant additional resources to build up \ntraditional service organizations and approaches to be sufficient to \ndeal with these serious problems.\n  I have risen on this floor many times to speak about the need to \nadequately address the mental health and physical health needs of our \ncitizens. However, there has never been a case when the responsibility \nand duty of this body and our country has been clearer than the duty to \naid our veterans who have sacrificed their bodies, minds and lives for \nthis country.\n  Fortunately, ``peer-support'' approaches offer a low cost and \neffective adjunct to traditional services by allowing the heroes of our \ncountry to help each other. Veteran peer-support offers two things that \nno kind of professionalized service can ever hope to: the support of \nsomeone who has had the same kinds of experiences and truly understands \nwhat the veteran is going through; and the potential of a large pool of \nexperienced volunteers who can assist and support returning veterans at \nvery little cost.\n  The effectiveness of these approaches has been documented in a \nvariety of domains. Specifically, for mental health disorders like PTSD \nand depression, peer-support programs have shown that participation \nyields improvement in psychiatric symptoms and decreased \nhospitalizations, the development of larger social support networks, \nenhanced self-esteem and social functioning, as well as lower services \ncosts. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration \n(SAMHSA), and even the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental \nHealth, have recognized peer-support approaches as an emerging best \npractice that is helping people recover from traumatic events.\n  Although the peer-support approach is promising, the need for this \ntype of assistance is growing and far exceeds the services that are \navailable. A report from the National Symposium for the Needs of Young \nVeterans hosted by AMVETS recognized this need in Voices for Action: A \nFocus on the Changing Needs of America's Veterans.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today requires the Veterans \nAdministration to create a pilot project. This project would \ndemonstrate and assess the feasibility of funding community based \nveterans' organizations and groups to create and expand peer-support \nprograms for veterans. It also authorizes $13.5 million over three \nyears for this program. These funds will be used to support the \ndevelopment or expansion of peer-support programs in up to 20 non-\nprofit organizations that support the reintegration of veterans on a \nlocal and national level.\n  The use of peer-support approaches is supported by veterans, \nveterans' organizations and mental health professionals. I ask for \nunanimous consent to include in the record the following letters from \nthe Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Disabled American \nVeterans, the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, Vets4Vets and \nthe American Psychological Association.\n  I am pleased that Senator Harkin has joined me in this effort. Our \nlegislation is an important step to expand and improve the support \navailable to our veterans and their transition back to community life. \nWe hope that this bill will continue to focus attention on the needs of \nour veterans who have given so much to their country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1205\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Gordon Smith,\n     404 Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gordon Smith: Only a veteran can truly \n     understand the story of another veteran. When a servicemember \n     returns home from a combat zone they are subjected to a \n     myriad of transitional issues; finding a new job, \n     reconnecting with family, and mostly important, learning \n     about the person they have become. We must find creative ways \n     to reach out and connect these returning heroes with people \n     who understand their story.\n       The Heroes Helping Heroes Program is a Demonstration \n     Project which seeks to aid existing veterans' service \n     organizations and other non-profit organizations that \n     currently work with veterans in the development and promotion \n     of peer support programs across America. Iraq and Afghanistan \n     Veterans of America (IAVA) strongly endorses the Heroes \n     Helping Heroes Program as a creative attempt to connect \n     returning veterans with other veterans.\n       This program will bolster existing local veterans support \n     organizations by offering grants, allowing them to expand \n     services at the fraction of the cost of starting new \n     programs. Heroes Helping Heroes will help fulfill the \n     government's duty to assist our service men and women who \n     fulfilled their solemn duty to serve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Paul Rieckhoff,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                    Vets4Vets,\n\n                                        Tucson, AZ, April 4, 2007.\n       To whom it may concern: Vets4Vets is proud to endorse \n     Senator Gordon Smith's bill setting up a pilot program to \n     encourage peer support programs for Iraq-era veterans.\n       Vets4Vets is a non-partisan peer support program, staffed \n     almost exclusively by Iraq-era veterans and dedicated to \n     helping Iraq and Afghanistan era veterans feel good about \n     themselves and heal from any negative aspects of service and \n     war. In our weekend workshops, one-on-ones, and local groups, \n     Vets4Vets allows veterans to take equal and uninterrupted \n     turns sharing their experiences and expressing their feelings \n     in a truly confidential setting. To further promote healing \n     Vets4Vets encourages service men and women to take part in \n     positive community action of their choosing that empowers \n     them to reach out to other veterans.\n       Over 200 Iraq-era veterans have taken part in one or more \n     of our nine weekend workshops in the last year in various \n     parts of the country. Almost all of them have been combat \n     veterans. Many of them are now actively reaching out to their \n     peers to set up local peer support groups. There are already \n     groups meeting in a half dozen or so cities around the \n     country.\n       As would be expected from the existing body of research on \n     peer support programs, these veterans universally enjoyed the \n     program and report significant improvement in their lives.\n       We urge Members of Congress to support this bill and the \n     peer support programs for Iraq-era veterans which it will \n     encourage.\n           Sincerely,\n     Abel Moreno,\n       Former Sergeant 82nd Airborne with tours in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan; Vets4Vets Media and Local Outreach Coordinator.\n     Jason Ridolfi,\n       Former Sergeant, USMCR with two tours in Iraq; Vets4Vets \n     Internet Outreach Coordinator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                National Coalition\n\n\n                                        for Homeless Veterans,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2007.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: The National Coalition for Homeless \n     Veterans (NCHV) writes to express our support for your bill, \n     which would establish a demonstration project entitled \n     ``Heroes Helping Heroes Program.'' The project would provide \n     expanded peer support services for veterans through veteran \n     service organizations and other non-profit community-based \n     organizations that serve veterans.\n       Established in 1990, NCHV is a nonprofit organization with \n     the mission of ending homelessness among veterans by shaping \n     public policy, promoting collaboration, and building the \n     capacity of service providers. NCHV's membership of over 250 \n     community based organizations (CBOs) in 48 states and the \n     District of Columbia provides housing and supportive services \n     to homeless veterans and their families.\n       The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) reports an \n     estimated 400,000 veterans experience homelessness at some \n     time during a year, and 200,000 are homeless on any given \n     night. With the VA reaching only 25 percent of the homeless \n     veteran population and CBOs 30 percent of those in need, a \n     substantial number of homeless veterans undoubtedly do not \n     receive much needed services. Moreover, because some areas of \n     our country have no community based organizations or VA \n     facilities nearby, other programs that serve veterans are \n     needed.\n       Findings from a survey conducted by NCHV in November 2005 \n     suggest the homeless veteran population in America may be \n     experiencing significant changes. In addition to those who \n     are aging and need permanent supportive housing, the \n     percentage of women veterans seeking services is growing. \n     Moreover, combat veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom, \n     Operation Enduring Freedom and the Global War on Terror are \n     returning home and suffering from war related conditions that \n     may put them at risk for homelessness. These men and women \n     are beginning to trickle into the Nation's community-based \n     homeless veteran service provider organizations and need a \n     variety of services--from mental health programs and peer \n     support to housing, employment training and job placement \n     assistance. The Heroes Helping Heroes program will serve as a \n     starting point to help these returning heroes address their \n     many needs.\n       NCHV supports your efforts and leadership on behalf of our \n     nation's veterans. Thank you for providing an opportunity to \n     help them successfully reintegrate back into civilian life.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Cheryl Beversdorf,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Disabled American Veterans,\n\n                                                   March 28, 2007.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of the Disabled American \n     Veterans (DAV), I am writing with regards to the legislation \n     that would create the ``Heroes Helping Heroes Program.''\n       As you know, active duty service members sometimes have \n     difficulty making the transition back to civilian life. This \n     is particularly true for our injured service members and \n     service members who served in combat. For some severely-\n     disabled veterans of Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom, \n     the success of becoming a productive member of society will \n     be measured by their ability to live independently and \n     achieve the highest quality of life possible.\n       Your legislation seeks to help veterans reintegrate into \n     their communities by authorizing the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs to create a pilot program to assist in the \n     development and capitalization of peer support programs. \n     While DAV does not have a resolution from our membership to \n     actively support this legislation, its purpose appears \n     beneficial and we would not be opposed to the favorable \n     consideration of this bill.\n\n[[Page S5091]]\n\n       The DAV sincerely appreciates your efforts and commitment \n     to improve the lives of our nation's sick and disabled \n     veterans, their dependents and survivors.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Joseph A.

Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith and Harkin: On behalf of the American \n     Psychological Association (APA) and our 148,000 members and \n     affiliates; I am writing to thank you for your leadership in \n     legislative efforts to promote the reintegration of America's \n     veterans as they return from active duty to their homes and \n     communities.\n       Deployed soldiers face unique risks and experience stress \n     and at-times devastating injuries. Left untreated, the \n     attendant mental health problems can severely restrict \n     veterans' lives and their ability to reconnect to family, \n     work, and social relationships. In their most tragic forms, \n     such problems can also lead to marital dissolution, the abuse \n     of alcohol and other drugs, and suicide. At present, the \n     Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) are striving to meet the mental health \n     treatment. needs of returning veterans. It is imperative that \n     we redouble our efforts to aid our veterans who served in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan and are suffering from post-traumatic \n     stress disorder and other mental health problems.\n       Your proposed bill, which would establish a demonstration \n     project entitled ``the Heroes Helping Heroes Program,'' would \n     provide expanded peer support services for veterans through \n     veterans service organizations and other non-profit \n     community-based organizations that serve veterans. Through \n     peer support programs, veterans help one another to cope with \n     the trauma of combat experience, the mental anguish that \n     comes from debilitating physical injury, and the difficulties \n     of readjusting to a civilian mindset and the rhythms of daily \n     life. Such programs are highly effective in providing needed \n     support to veterans, as we know from the veterans \n     readjustment counseling centers currently run by the VA.\n       In closing, I thank you once again for your efforts and \n     leadership on behalf of our nation's veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Norman B. Anderson, Ph.D.,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon, Senator Smith, to introduce the \nHeroes Helping Heroes Act, to expand the availability of peer support \nprograms for veterans.\n  As our military personnel return from combat, they face daunting \nchallenges in transitioning back to civilian life. They have to deal \nwith family issues arising from their long absence from home. They have \nto find new employment. They also have to cope with separation from \ntheir close friends. After spending many months if not years with the \nmen and women in their unit--sharing intense wartime experiences and \nlooking out for each other--they may not find that same close support \nwhen they return.\n  In addition, many members of our Armed Forces have endured tremendous \nstress during combat, which can trigger severe mental health issues \nafter they have returned home. Research shows that one in three \nveterans of the war in Iraq, and one in nine veterans of the war in \nAfghanistan, are coping with a serious mental health problem, including \ndepression, substance abuse, and/or post-traumatic stress disorder \n(PTSD). Untreated and under-treated stress exposure for soldiers \nresults in a higher incidence of suicide, higher divorce rates, and \nhigher rates of drug or alcohol abuse. Additionally, there have been \nalmost 25,000 non-fatal American casualties. Such injuries often have \nserious impacts on the ability of transitioning veterans to reintegrate \ninto their home and community life.\n  Currently, VA facilities are overwhelmed by the sheer number of \nveterans who need assistance. The Government Accountability Office \n(GAO) reported that many VA medical facilities are unprepared to care \nfor the mental health needs of the number of veterans who will need \nservices. Peer support approaches offer a low-cost and effective \nsupplement to traditional services by allowing veterans to help each \nother. In peer support programs, transitioning veterans can talk to \nsomeone who had similar experiences and understands what they are going \nthrough. Veteran peer counselors who are trained to provide support and \nrefer for services when necessary can provide outreach to other \nveterans and assist in a smooth transition back to civilian life.\n  The Heroes Helping Heroes program will allow veterans' service \norganizations to develop or expand peer support programs. Veterans' \nservice organizations and other non-profits that serve veterans are \nwell-equipped to provide such peer support programs. Given that the VA \nis stretched to capacity, these organizations are able to run such \nprograms in addition to mental health services provided by professional \ncounselors.\n  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMSHA) \nand the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health have \nrecognized peer support approaches as an emerging best practice in \nhelping people to recover from traumatic events. Research has found \nthat peer support programs are effective in alleviating PTSD symptoms \nand depression, reducing the likelihood of hospitalization, and \nincreasing social support.\n  When members of our Armed Forces come home from war, this does not \nnecessarily mean that the war is over for them. Many continue to carry \nphysical and psychological wounds and scars. We have a profound moral \ncontract to care for those who have fought for our country and \nsacrificed so much. One additional way to make good on that contract in \na cost-effective way is to expand the availability peer support \nprograms nationwide. To that end, I urge my colleagues to join with \nSenator Smith and me in sponsoring the Heroes Helping Heroes Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Ms. Stabenow, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1206. A bill to amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n1967 to clarify the age discrimination rules applicable to the pension \nplan maintained by the Young Woman's Christian Association Retirement \nFund; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nclarify the legal status of the Young Women's Christian Association's \nRetirement Fund.\n  The YWCA Retirement Fund is one of the oldest pension plans serving \nthe retirement needs of women. This bill will help protect the \nretirement security of thousands of YWCA employees nationwide who serve \nwell over a million users.\n  Whether it is providing day care for working mothers, keeping a \nbattered women's shelter open, or meeting the other pressing needs of \nwomen in our communities, the YWCA has a long tradition of service. \nThose who work at our local YWCAs deserve to know that their retirement \nplan is secure.\n  Today, the YWCA Retirement Fund is a unique pension program. First, \napproximately 90 percent of its participants are women. Second, it is a \nmultiple employer pension plan--one that relies on 300 local YWCAs to \nmake funding contributions. And lastly, since it was established in \n1924, the pension plan's structure has remained generally unchanged--it \nis partially a defined benefit plan, and partially a defined \ncontribution plan.\n  Recently, some employers have transformed their traditional defined \nbenefit pension plans into various types of ``hybrid'' plans, and in \nthe process, some have reduced the rate at which benefits accrue for \ntheir older workers. Older workers have successfully challenged some of \nthese arrangements as age discriminatory. During its more than 80-year \nhistory, the YWCA Retirement Fund has never treated any worker \ndifferently based on age or longevity of employment. Most of the \ncontroversy surrounding these plans focuses on how employers treat \ncertain participants when they convert their pre-existing pension \nplans. But the YWCA pension program never converted--its basic \nstructure has remained the same since it was established in 1924.\n  The success of some of these lawsuits has raised questions about \nwhether the YWCA pension plan could be found to be age discriminatory \nmerely on the basis of its design. This threat is particularly acute \ngiven the fact that the YWCA Retirement Fund is a multiple employer \npension plan--a plan that relies on contributions from each local\n\n[[Page S5092]]\n\nYWCA. This enormous potential liability would be shared jointly by all \nlocal YWCAs. Under current law, even the mere threat of a lawsuit could \ncause local YWCAs to end their participation in this plan.\n  This legislation merely delineates many of the unique characteristics \nof the YWCA pension plan and clarifies what age discrimination standard \napplies to the plan with respect to any future legal claim. This bill \nprotects participants from being treated differently on the basis of \nage, while eliminating the potential crippling legal threat that \ncurrently exists.\n  Legislation was enacted in 2004--Public Law 108-476--to clarify the \nlegal status of the YMCA pension plan, a plan that is similar to the \nYWCA plan. Congress was right to protect the YMCA pension plan then and \nnow it is time to protect the pension plan serving our YWCAs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1206\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Young Women's Christian \n     Association Pension Clarification Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Young Women's Christian Association Pension Plan is \n     a multiple employer plan (subject to the requirements of \n     section 210 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974) which is maintained by a corporation created by State \n     law prior to the enactment of the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 and the Age Discrimination in Employment \n     Act of 1967 and whose primary purpose is the maintenance of \n     retirement programs.\n       (2) No applicable plan amendment, as defined in clause (v) \n     of section 204(b)(5)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1054(b)(5)(B)(v)) (added by \n     section 701(a) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (Public \n     Law 109-280; 120 Stat. 982)) and clause (v) of section \n     4(i)(10)(B) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 (29 U.S.C. 623(i)(10)(B)(v)) (added by section 701(c) of \n     the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-280; 120 \n     Stat. 986)), or any applicable plan amendment causing a \n     participant's accrued benefit to be less than the amount \n     described in clause (iii) of such section 204(b)(5)(B) or \n     clause (iii) of such section 4(i)(10)(B), has ever been made \n     to the Young Women's Christian Association Pension Plan.\n       (3) Under the terms of the Young Women's Christian \n     Association Pension Plan, as in effect as of June 29, 2005, \n     all pension benefits of all participants under the plan are \n     immediately nonforfeitable.\n       (4) As of April 25, 2007, the Young Women's Christian \n     Association Pension Plan provides--\n       (A) for periods including June 29, 2005, and ending on or \n     before December 31, 2007, a credit to the account of each \n     participant equal to 40 percent of the pay credit provided to \n     such participant and interest credits determined for each \n     plan year at the average of the annual rates of interest on \n     10-year Treasury securities during a designated period in the \n     preceding plan year, and\n       (B) for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2008, \n     interest credits which satisfy the requirements of section \n     204(b)(5)(B)(i) of the Employee Retirement Income Security \n     Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1054(b)(5)(B)(i)) (added by section \n     701(a) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-\n     280; 120 Stat. 981)) and section 4(i)(10)(B))(i) of the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. \n     623(i)(10)(B)(i)) (added by section 701(c) of the Pension \n     Protection Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-280; 120 Stat. 989)).\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to clarify the age \n     discrimination rules under section 204(b)(1)(H) of the \n     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and section \n     4(i)(1) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, \n     as they relate to periods prior to June 29, 2005, during \n     which violations of such rules are alleged to have occurred \n     in civil actions commenced on or after April 25, 2007.\n\n     SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF AGE DISCRIMINATION RULES.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the case of any civil action which--\n       (1) is commenced on or after April 25, 2007, and\n       (2) alleges a violation of section 204(b)(1)(H) of the \n     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. \n     1054(b)(1)(H)) or section 4(i)(1) of the Age Discrimination \n     in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 623(i)(1)) occurring \n     before June 29, 2005, with respect to any benefit provided \n     under the Young Women's Christian Association Pension Plan,\n\n     such sections 204(b)(1)(H) and 4(i)(1) shall be applied as if \n     paragraph (5) of section 204(b) of the Employee Retirement \n     Income Security Act of 1974 (as added by section 701(a)(1) of \n     the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (29 U.S.C. 1054(b)(5); 120 \n     Stat. 981) and paragraph (10) of section 4(i) of the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. \n     623(i)(10); 120 Stat. 998) applied to any period in which \n     such alleged violation occurred.\n       (b) Young Women's Christian Association Pension Plan.--For \n     purposes of this Act, the term ``Young Women's Christian \n     Association Pension Plan'' means the defined benefit plan (as \n     defined in section 3(35) of the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974) established on January 1, 1926, and \n     maintained by the Young Women's Christian Association \n     Retirement Fund, a corporation created by an Act of the State \n     of New York which became law on April 12, 1924.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 1207. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease and extend the energy efficient commercial buildings \ndeduction; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nentitled Giving Reductions to Energy Efficient New Buildings, the GREEN \nBuildings Act. This bill will extend the energy efficient building tax \ndeduction from December 31, 2008 until December 31, 2013. This bill \nwill also increase the tax deduction from $1.80 to $2.25 per square \nfoot.\n  Our Nation is diligently searching to find the long-term solutions to \nglobal warming and, how to reduce our carbon foot print. As Congress \ncontinues to search for these solutions, we must continue to provide \nincentives to those who have the knowledge and resources to make an \nimpact now. Congress understands the impact `green buildings' have on \nreducing our Nation's energy consumption and carbon emissions. That is \nwhy in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 we created a tax deduction for \nenergy efficient buildings. Unfortunately, that deduction will expire \non December 31, 2008. Congress must not allow this deduction to expire. \nBuilding energy efficient buildings is one of the key things being done \nright now to reduce carbon dioxide emissions as well as reduce our \nNation's energy consumption.\n  Commercial buildings are a substantial part of our Nation's energy \nconsumption and can be a key to reducing demand for electricity. These \nbuildings are responsible for 40 percent of total U.S. energy \nconsumption, they use 70 percent of the nation's electricity and they \nare accountable for 40 percent of the U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. \nThey are a major piece to enabling our Nation's energy independence and \nto solving the global warming puzzle and Congress must not overlook \nthem or leave them out.\n  The average life-span of a commercial building is 75 years. We must \nuse our resources, to build energy-efficient buildings today and make \nthese buildings truly ready for the future. One way to do so is to \nprovide incentives to those who are willing to step up to the plate and \naccept the challenge.\n  Another benefit from building energy efficient or green buildings is \nthat they also improve our health. Americans spend about 90 percent of \ntheir time indoors. The concentration of indoor pollutants is sometimes \n10 to 100 times more than outdoor pollutants increasing the frequency \nof illnesses and ailments.\n  Researchers have proven that employees who are exposed to more \nsunlight are more productive workers. They have proven that by changing \nthe carpets on the floor and paint on the walls workers have less \nrespiratory ailments. These are simple things that can be done to \nincrease employees' health and their productivity and our nation's \noverall success.\n  Our Nation is doing a good job of researching and developing new \ntechnologies to reduce our dependence on foreign energy and to combat \nglobal warming, and Congress has helped move these technologies along \nby providing incentives in the way of tax deductions. Unfortunately, \nmany of these incentives have an expiration date that expires too soon \nto provide the help it is intended to provide. Congress needs to keep \nthese incentives intact and provide stability so companies and \ninvestors can be assured of their investment. In turn, maintaining \nthese incentives will advance our Nation's energy independence and \nreduce our carbon dioxide emissions--two very important goals. I urge \nmy fellow Senators to support this sensible and much needed tax \nincentive. We don't have another 75 years to wait.\n\n[[Page S5093]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 1208. A bill to provide additional security and privacy protection \nfor social security account numbers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a piece of \nlegislation called the ``Social Security Account Number Protection \nAct'' that would restrict the ability of companies to sell or purchase \nSocial Security numbers.\n  Let me describe why this legislation is so necessary.\n  On February 15, 2005, Georgia-based data warehouser ChoicePoint \ndisclosed that it had compromised the private customer data of 145,000 \nindividuals. Criminals posing as legitimate small business people had \npurchased files on about 145,000 people, some of whom were later \ndefrauded.\n  One of the critical pieces of information that ChoicePoint sold to \nthese criminals was Social Security numbers. That's Social Security \nnumbers of 145,000 people in all 50 states.\n  Here is a statistic that I found incredible: Choice Point has 17,000 \nbusiness ``customers'' for such information. Can you imagine your \nSocial Security number potentially being sold to 117,000 businesses? \nAnd that's just one of the companies that was selling databases that \nincluded Social Security numbers at the time.\n  I bet that most Americans were surprised to find out that it was \nperfectly legal for companies to sell their Social Security numbers to \ntens of thousands of other companies. If you took a national survey and \nasked Americans this question: ``Do you think that private companies \nshould have the ability to purchase and sell your Social Security \nnumber?'' I assure you that the answer would overwhelmingly be ``no.''\n  In the 109th Congress, when the Senate Commerce Committee marked up \nS. 1408, the ID Theft Protection Act, I offered an amendment that very \nsimply said that it should be illegal to sell or purchase Social \nSecurity numbers.\n  This as a commonsense amendment, and it passed unanimously. The ID \nTheft Protection Act was reported by the Commerce Committee in December \n2005, but the bill did not make it to the Senate floor.\n  But the problem of ID theft has not gone away. In its most recent \nsurvey, the Better Business Bureau estimated that approximately 8.9 \nmillion Americans were victims of identity theft in 2006. The total \nU.S. annual identity fraud cost is an estimated $52.6 billion per year.\n  We will shortly be marking up another ID theft bill in the 110th \nCongress, through the Commerce Committee. The bill the Commerce \nCommittee is considering now does not have provisions restricting the \nsale or purchase of Social Security numbers, and I intend to offset an \namendment to fix that, with the language that I am introducing as \nstandalone legislation today.\n  I should note that the FTC issued a report on ID theft just this \nmonth, which emphasized the importance of protecting Social Security \nnumbers.\n  The FTC report said the following about Social Security numbers: \n``Consumer information is the currency of identity theft, and perhaps \nthe most valuable piece of information for the thief is the SSN. The \nSSN and a name can be used in many cases to open an account and obtain \ncredit or other benefits in the victim's name.''\n  In fact elsewhere in the report, the FTC underscored that Social \nSecurity numbers are ``the most valuable commodity for an identity \nthief.''\n  One of the FTC's top recommendations was that federal agencies should \nreduce the unnecessary use of Social Security numbers.\n  And it's clear that the FTC heard from many Americans who were \nunhappy with the widespread overuse of Social Security numbers. Indeed, \nthe FTC report notes that one of the main concerns that Americans have \nin protecting their identity is ``the overuse of Social Security \nnumbers as identifiers.''\n  It stands to reason that the more that Social Security numbers are \nsold from one business to another for marketing and other commercial \npurposes, the greater the chance that the numbers will be lost, \nmisplaced, stolen, leaked, or otherwise fall into the wrong hands.\n  Now, I'll be the first to recognize that there are some instances \nwhere the use of Social security numbers is appropriate. So my \namendment has a number of reasonable exceptions to the prohibition on \nthe sale of Social Security numbers, for purposes such as national \nsecurity, public health, law enforcement, administration of federal or \nstate tax laws, credit reporting agencies, prevention and investigation \nof ID theft, and tracking of missing and abducted children.\n  What's more, my bill allows an ``opt-in'' clause. That is, it allows \nindividuals, if they so choose, to agree in writing to have their \nSocial Security number sold or purchased by others--provided the \nindividual provides his affirmative consent, and the individual is not \nobligated to provide the Social Security number as a condition for \nconducting a transaction.\n  I think these are reasonable exemptions.\n  I should add that in the 109th Congress, Senators Specter and Leahy \nalso introduced S. 1332, a bill that similarly restricts the sale of \nSocial Security numbers.\n  So this is a bipartisan concept, and I hope that my legislation will \nhave bipartisan support when it reaches the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1208\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Social Security Account \n     Number Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Federal \n     Trade Commission.\n       (2) Social security account number.--The term ``social \n     security account number'' means a social security account \n     number that contains more than 5 digits of the full 9-digit \n     number assigned by the Social Security Administration but \n     does not include social security account numbers to the \n     extent that they are included in a publicly available \n     information source, such as news reports, books, periodicals, \n     or directories or Federal, State, or local government \n     records.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1209. A bill to provide for the continued administration of Santa \nRosa Island, Channel Islands National Park, in accordance with the laws \n(including regulations) and policies of the National Park Service, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Boxer in introducing the Channel Islands National Park \nManagement Act of 2007.\n  This legislation seeks to clarify the future use and management of \nthe park, and specifically protects Santa Rosa Island for the use of \nthe public.\n  The taxpayers paid approximately $30 million to acquire Santa Rosa \nIsland in 1986 to restore its native ecology and provide public access.\n  Unfortunately, late last year during conference negotiations a \nprovision was slipped into the fiscal year 2007 Defense Authorization \nbill seeking to overturn a court-approved settlement agreement which \nrequires the phasing out of private hunting on Santa Rosa Island.\n  Under a binding court settlement in the late 1990s, non-native deer \nand elk must be removed from Santa Rosa Island over a phased, 4-year \nperiod beginning in 2008.\n  Today, from mid-August through mid-November, a large portion of the \nisland is closed to the public so that the island's prior owners can \nrun a trophy hunting operation targeting the deer and elk on the \nisland.\n  Under the settlement, this hunting operation was to end in 2011 \nallowing the island to be completely open to the public year round.\n  Now, under last year's provision, the prior owners will seek to \ncontinue charging $16,000 or more for their privately operated hunting \ntrips.\n  Even though the Government purchased the island from them for $30 \nmillion in taxpayer money, the prior owners would seek to keep \nessentially everything they had before--and that's simply not in the \npublic interest.\n  Some may be interested in learning a little history and background on \nthis gem of an island: Santa Rosa Island is approximately 53,000 acres \nand lies about 50 miles west of Ventura Harbor. It is the second \nlargest of the five islands making up the Channel Islands National \nPark. It is extremely rugged and pristine, with terrain ranging from \ngrassy hills to steep, wind-carved canyons to white sandy beaches. \nCraggy, steep cliffs overlook rocky tide pools along its coast. \nWildflowers cover many parts of the island during the spring and \nsummer. It is ecologically sensitive and includes several endemic \nplants and species. For example, it is the only place in the world to \nsee the island fox and spotted skunk in their natural habitat. A \nvariety of shore birds--like the snowy plover--and sea mammals--such as \nseals and sea lions--breed on its beaches. It is seen by many \nscientists as one of the nation's most unique places. In addition to \nbeing the home of rare flora and fauna, it is an archaeological and \npaleontological treasure, with some sites dating back 11,000 years or \nto the Pleistocene-era. In fact, in 1994, the world's most complete \nskeleton of a pygmy mammoth was excavated on the island. It offers \nincredible recreational opportunities for the public, including hiking, \ncamping, kayaking, fishing, sea sports, and wildlife watching.\n  The limitation of public access to the island to accommodate \nprivately run hunting trips would be a tragedy. This is the public's \nland. It's a national park, and the public should be able to visit it \nand enjoy its breath-taking beauty and remoteness.\n  I also want to address one issue the provision in last year's Defense \nAuthorization bill purportedly seeks to address: enhancing hunting \nopportunities for disabled veterans.\n  While no one opposes providing hunting opportunities for our \nveterans, it is clear that it is neither a practical nor viable option \nto use Santa Rosa Island as a hunting reserve for injured and disabled \nveterans.\n  This view is now supported by the Paralyzed Veterans of America, PVA, \nan organization which previously expressed support for the provision \noverturning the settlement.\n  Notably, in July 2006, the PVA reached the conclusion following an \ninvestigative visit to Santa Rosa that the ``numerous obstacles \ninherent to the island, including ingress and egress, logistics, \npersonal safety and cost, far outweigh the possible, limited benefit it \ncould provide.''\n  Furthermore, it should be pointed out that in California today, there \nare already 9 military installations that permit hunting--five that can \naccommodate disabled servicemembers.\n  Two of these military installations, Camp Pendleton and Vandenberg \nAir Force Base, are relatively close to the Channel Islands National \nPark, and allow disabled veterans to hunt a variety of animals, \nincluding deer, waterfowl, quail, feral pigs, small game, and coyote.\n  Altogether there are over 100 U.S. military installations where \nhunting is permitted, over 70 of which are currently accessible to \ndisabled servicemembers and veterans.\n  Naturally, the Park Service is firmly opposed to the provision \nseeking to overturn the settlement. But it is also important to note \nthat neither the Department of Defense nor the Veterans Administration \nasked for the language.\n  Consequently, I strongly believe that the Park Service should \ncontinue managing this National Park for the benefit of the general \npublic. To allow any less would be a waste of taxpayer dollars and \nwrongly limit the public's access to this national treasure.\n  I strongly believe that we must do everything to protect the island \nfor the public and oppose any measures that could continue to restrict \naccess to the island.\n  This legislation we are introducing today would safeguard the island \nin just this manner. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation \nand I ask unanimous consent that the text of this proposed legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1209\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S5096]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Channel Islands National \n     Park Management Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to extend the grant program for drug-endangered \nchildren; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing with Senator \nGrassley, as well as Senators Kohl, Feingold and Durbin as original co-\nsponsors, the Drug Endangered Children Act of 2007. This bill would \ntake an important grant program for drug-endangered children that \nCongress authorized in the USA PATRIOT Reauthorization Act, and extend \nit for two additional years.\n  In particular, the USA PATRIOT Reauthorization Act authorized $20 \nmillion in Federal grants for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 to States to \nassist in the treatment of children who have been endangered by living \nat a home where methamphetamine has been manufactured or distributed. \nBut unless we pass new legislation, that authorization will not \ncontinue beyond the current fiscal year.\n  A companion bill was introduced earlier this year by California \nCongressman Dennis A. Cordoza, with bipartisan support in the House.\n  The White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, or ONDCP, \nhas documented that innocent children are sometimes found in homes and \nother environments, hotels, automobiles, apartments, etc., where \nmethamphetamine and other illegal substances are produced.\n  According to the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) National \nClandestine Laboratory Seizure System, there were 1,660 children \naffected by or injured or killed at methamphetamine labs during 2005.\n  These children who live at or visit drug-production sites or are \npresent during drug production face a variety of health and safety \nrisks, including: inhalation, absorption, or ingestion of toxic \nchemicals, drugs, or contaminated foods that may result in nausea, \nchest pain, eye and tissue irritation, chemical burns, and death; fires \nand explosions; abuse and neglect, and hazardous lifestyles, presence \nof booby traps, firearms, code violations, and poor ventilation.\n  Where children are involved, drug lab seizures must go beyond the \nnormal response from law enforcement, fire and HAZMAT organizations. \nAdditional agencies and officials often must be called in to assist, \nincluding emergency medical personnel, social services, and physicians.\n  Recognizing this need, the ONDCP several years ago announced a \nnational Drug Endangered Children (DEC) initiative to assist with \ncoordination between existing State programs and create a standardized \ntraining program to extend DEC to states where such a program does not \nyet exist.\n  As a result of this initiative, several states developed DEC \nprograms, to coordinate the efforts of law enforcement, medical \nservices, and child welfare workers, to ensure that children found in \nthese environments receive appropriate attention and care.\n  These DEC programs began to develop interagency protocols to support \ndrug-endangered children, addressing issues such as: staff training, \nincluding safety and cross training; roles and responsibilities of \nagencies involved; appropriate reporting, cross-reporting, and \ninformation sharing; safety procedures for children, families, and \nresponding personnel; interviewing procedures; evidence collection and \npreservation procedures, and medical care procedures.\n  Protocols were designed to identify and provide guidance on the \nvariety of issues that responding agencies needed to address in these \nsituations, such as taking children into protective custody and \narranging for child protective services, immediately testing the \nchildren for methamphetamine exposure, conducting medical and mental \nhealth assessments, and ensuring short- and long-term care.\n  Unfortunately, the ONDCP's initiative, which had been funded in part \nthrough a DOJ award of $2.124 million under the Community Oriented \nPolicing Services (COPS) Methamphetamine Initiative of 2003, was not \ncontinued thereafter.\n  The USA PATRIOT Reauthorization Act that we passed in 2005, \nestablishing a specific grant program for this purpose, recognized the \nneed to continue this initiative. Unfortunately, this grant program \nthat we authorized was never funded. In fiscal year 2006, the program \nthat we authorized was appropriated no funds at all.\n  In fiscal year 2007, the House of Representatives voted to include $5 \nmillion for this important program as part of its CJS Appropriations \nbill. But unfortunately, the 109th Congress adjourned without passing \nmost of its FY2007 appropriations bills, and the Continuing Resolution \nwe passed to keep the government running did not fund this provision \neither.\n  So the bill that I introduce today would give the Congress another \nchance to revive this important initiative. And it can't come too soon \nfor places like Merced, California, where three-quarters of all foster \ncare cases are reported to be methamphetamine-related.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1210\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Drug Endangered Children Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DRUG-ENDANGERED CHILDREN GRANT PROGRAM EXTENDED.\n\n       Section 755(c) of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and \n     Reauthorization Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 3797cc-2(c)) is \n     amended by striking ``fiscal years 2006 and 2007'' and \n     inserting ``fiscal years 2008 and 2009''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague today, \nSenator Feinstein, in introducing the Drug Endangered Children Act \n(DEC) of 2007. As U.S. Senators representing States that have been \namong the hardest hit by the scourge of meth, we have witnessed first \nhand how this horrible drug has devastated individual lives and \nfamilies. We have seen the havoc wreaked on the environment as well as \nthe child welfare system and we have listened to the horror stories of \nthose caught in the grips of addiction.\n  Last year we worked together in a bi-partisan effort to pass the \nCombat\n\n[[Page S5097]]\n\nMeth Act, which was eventually included in the USA PATRIOT Act \nReauthorization. The result has been a dramatic decrease in the number \nof clandestine meth lab seizures. While this is certainly welcome news, \nparticularly for our first responders and local law enforcement \ncommunity, last year there were over 6,400 clandestine meth lab \nincidents throughout the country. In my home State, we saw a 73 percent \ndecrease in the number of meth lab incidents compared to the previous \nyear yet there were still over 300 incidents last year alone. Clearly, \nthe Combat Meth Act has made progress against locally produced meth, \nbut further action is needed to fully combat this epidemic.\n  In spite of our success and ongoing efforts to reduce the dangers \nfrom ``mom and pop'' meth labs, new and more disturbing instances of \nmeth production, trafficking, and abuse are becoming more prevalent \nthroughout the country. In the State of Missouri, police recently made \nseven meth-related arrests in just as many hours in the tiny, quiet \ntown of Ozark. The house where these arrests were made belonged to a \n45-year-old grandmother, who was baby sitting her infant grandson while \nhis mother was away at school. Upon her arrest she admitted to using \nmeth, but denied she was a dealer. However, while police searched the \nhouse, six more individuals were picked up on meth-related charges. \nWhen it was all said and done, three children under the age of 3 \nwatched as the police arrested their parent or grandparent for selling \nor possessing this dangerous drug.\n  Sadly, this was not an unusual incident. Since 2002, more than 12,000 \nchildren throughout the country have been affected, injured, or killed \nat meth lab sites and thousands more have been sent to foster homes or \nwere victims of meth-related abuse in the home. In Iowa, the Department \nof Health reports that over 1,000 children over the past 4 years were \nclassified as victims of abuse, and that nearly half of child abuse \ncases have been meth-related.\n  Due to the shocking number of children that were being victimized by \nmeth in one form or another, I joined my colleagues in supporting the \n``Drug Endangered Children Act of 2005.'' This bill which passed into \nlaw as part of the USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization, established a \nnational grant program to support state Drug Endangered Children \nprograms and to assist local law enforcement, medical services, and \nchild welfare workers to ensure that victimized children would receive \nproper attention and treatment after living in these terrible \nenvironments. I'm pleased to report that since we implemented this \ngrant program, a large number of communities throughout the nation have \nformed multi-disciplinary alliances for the benefit of drug-exposed \nchildren. There are 16 communities throughout Iowa that have taken \nadvantage of these grants and more are in the process of planning and \nsetting up programs.\n  The Drug Endangered Children Act of 2007 would re-authorize this \nimportant grant program for an additional 2 years and assist States in \ncoordinating law enforcement, medical services, and child welfare \nefforts, to ensure that children found in such environments receive \nappropriate attention and care. I am pleased to join with my colleague \nagain as we work together to renew this wonderful and worthwhile \nprogram. I ask that my colleagues join us in support of this important \nlegislation and pass the Drug Endangered Children Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1211. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to provide \nenhanced penalties for marketing controlled substances to minors; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Grassley in \nintroducing the Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act of 2007. This bill \nwould increase the criminal penalties that apply when criminals market \ntheir illegal drugs to our children, using appalling techniques like \nthe recently reported sales on our streets of candy-flavored \nmethamphetamine.\n  In particular, the bill would: double the maximum penalties \napplicable to drug crimes if a criminal defendant manufactures, offers, \ndistributes, or possesses with intent to distribute a controlled \nsubstance that is flavored, colored, packaged or otherwise altered in a \nway that is designed to make it more appealing to a person under the \nage of 21; if the violation is a repeat offense, the maximum sentence \nwould be tripled; and a mandatory minimum prison sentence of at least a \nyear would apply in every case involving illegal drugs that targets its \nmarketing at minors.\n  The growing problem of marketing illegal drugs to minors was \nhighlighted in a recent USA Today article, entitled ``Flavored Meth Use \non the Rise,'' which stated, ``Reports of candy-flavored \nmethamphetamine are emerging around the nation, stirring concern among \npolice and abuse prevention experts that drug dealers are marketing the \ndrug to younger people.''\n  Normally, methamphetamine--a highly addictive stimulant--is a \nbrownish, bitter-tasting crystalline powder. But drug dealers, \nrecognizing that this may not be appealing to children or teenagers, \nhave reacted by reaching a new low: they are using candy and soda \nflavors to market their meth.\n  Soda flavors. Strawberry methamphetamine that they market as \n``Strawberry Quick.'' Reddish methamphetamine marketed as an energy \ndrink like ``Red Bull.'' Even ``chocolate quick.''\n  Scott Burns, Deputy Drug Czar at the White House Office of National \nDrug Control Policy, warns that this development may negatively affect \nthe gains we have recently made in getting the word out to our young \npeople about how horrible this drug is.\n  According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the number \nof people 12 and older who used methamphetamine for the first time in \nthe previous year decreased from 318,000 people in 2004 to 192,000 \npeople in 2005. That's the good news.\n  But Deputy Drug Czar Burns warns that with drug dealers having a \ntougher time selling their product, especially to young people, ``they \nhave to come up with some sort of gimmick.'' And that gimmick, he \nwarns, is the use of flavored methamphetamine.\n  In my own State of California, San Francisco police since late \nJanuary have arrested teens with quantities of meth designed to taste \nlike chocolate. The Haight-Asbury clinic also confirms chocolate-\nflavored methamphetamine being used on the streets.\n  Dr. Alex Stalcup, a nationally renowned drug counselor, reports \nseeing teenage patients at the New Leaf Treatment Center suffering the \nill effects of flavored methamphetamine since the first of this year.\n  One of Dr. Stalcup's patients was unaware that the substance was meth \nat all, and said he was told that it was a solidified form of the \nenergy drink Red Bull. Dr. Stalcup warns that this new form of the drug \nalso may be more likely to lead to an overdose, by users who may not be \naware of, or who may underestimate, a candy-flavored drug's impact.\n  Perhaps the first report of this problem emerged in late January, \nwhen a Carson City, Nevada police informant purchased 2 grams of a \nstrawberry-flavored methamphetamine from an alleged member of the Lima \nStreet gang. Officers later served a search warrant on his home and \nfound more. Police bulletins warned this ``new type of meth will be \nmore attractive to a younger crowd and may surface in schools.''\n  Additional reports also came in. On February 13, a police officer in \nGreene County, MO, seized a bag of ``strawberry meth'' from a female \npassenger in a car stopped in a rural area of Greene County, MO. And in \nIdaho, the Administrator of the Governor's Office of Drug Control \nPolicy warned of how drug dealers were producing ``strawberry quick'' \nand ``chocolate quick'' forms of meth, to attract young buyers and \nspawn a new generation of drug buyers.\n  The Idaho Press-Tribune even reported that at Valentine's Day, drug \ndealers compressed the flavored form of the drug into heart-shapes, \ncolored it bright pink, and wrapped it in shiny paper.\n  Based on intelligence gathered by Drug Enforcement Administration \nagents from informants, users, police and drug counselors, flavored \ncrystals are now available in California, Nevada, Washington, Idaho, \nTexas, New Mexico, Missouri and Minnesota.\n\n[[Page S5098]]\n\n  The bill I offer today would address this problem, by enacting \npenalties to discourage colored and flavored drugs and the marketing of \ndrugs to minors.\n  Under current law, there is already an enhanced penalty if someone \ndistributes illegal drugs to a minor. The maximum sentence is doubled, \nand tripled for a repeat offense, and there is a minimum of at least a \nyear in prison. But the enhancement applies only if there is an actual \ndistribution to a minor. Even possession with intent to distribute \ndoesn't qualify. And current law doesn't address flavored drugs or \nmarketing illegal drugs in ways appealing to kids.\n  The bill I introduce would fix that. If someone manufactures, \ncreates, distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute an illegal \ndrug that is flavored, colored, packaged or altered in a way designed \nto make it more appealing to someone under age 21, they would face this \nsame enhanced penalty.\n  This bill will send a strong and clear message to the drug dealers--\nif you flavor up your drugs or alter them in a way that makes it more \nappealing to our children, there will be a very heavy price to pay.\n  Flavored meth is designed to get people to try it a few times. It's \nall about hooking young people. And that is truly tragic. Listen to \nwhat one former addict wrote after hearing about this new development:\n\n       They do need to worry about our children because I happen \n     to know quite a few 10 and 12 year olds on up that are \n     already using it and selling it out there. So whoever thinks \n     it's not a threat to our children--WRONG WRONG WRONG! It's \n     more and more dangerous out there when people cannot handle \n     it and they develop a chemical imbalance and lose their mind \n     to where they don't even know who they are anymore. I happen \n     to know a very, very young pretty girl I've met, and she will \n     never come back to who she was. She's gone. She is crazy and \n     is gonna end up hurt then dead one of these days. I pray for \n     this girl all the time . . .\n\n  Estimates now place the number of habitual meth users worldwide at 26 \nmillion worldwide--more than the combined total for heroin and cocaine. \nIt is extraordinarily addictive. We must act to preserve the gains we \nhave made, and keep kids from getting cruelly tricked into an addiction \nthey may never break.\n  These new penalties will make dealers think twice before flavoring up \ntheir drugs, and punish them appropriately if they don't. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1211\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Saving Kids from Dangerous \n     Drugs Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS FOR MARKETING CONTROLLED \n                   SUBSTANCES TO MINORS.\n\n       Section 418 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     859) is amended--\n       (1) in the section heading, by adding at the end the \n     following: ``; marketing to minors'';\n       (2) in subsection (a), by inserting after ``twenty-one \n     years of age'' the following: ``, or who manufactures, \n     creates, distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute \n     a controlled substance that is flavored, colored, packaged, \n     or otherwise altered in a way that is designed to make that \n     controlled substance more appealing to a person under twenty-\n     one years of age, or who attempts or conspires to do so,''; \n     and\n       (3) in subsection (b), by inserting after ``twenty-one \n     years of age'' the following: ``, or who manufactures, \n     creates, distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute \n     a controlled substance that is flavored, colored, packaged, \n     or otherwise altered in a way that is designed to make that \n     controlled substance more appealing to a person under twenty-\n     one years of age, or who attempts or conspires to do so,''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague today, \nSenator Feinstein, in introducing the Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs \nAct of 2007. I believe we have a moral obligation in this country to \nensure our young people have every opportunity to grow up without being \naccosted by drug pushers at every turn, whether on TV, in the movies, \nor on the way to school.\n  This important legislation comes in response to the recent warnings \nissued by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy of candy-flavored meth and other illegal \ndrugs being colored, packaged, and flavored in ways that appear to be \ndesigned to attract use by children and minors. As co-chairman of the \nSenate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, I can tell you that \nthe most at-risk population for drug abuse is our young people. \nResearch has shown time and again that if you can keep a child drug-\nfree until they turn 20, chances are very slim that they will ever try \nor become addicted. Unfortunately, unscrupulous drug dealers are all \ntoo aware of statistics like these and have developed new techniques \nand marketing gimmicks to lure in younger users. As a parent and now \ngrandparent, this is extremely worrisome.\n  Last year, we worked to pass the Combat Meth Act into law. Since that \ntime, the number of clandestine meth lab seizures have dropped \ndramatically across the country. By placing the essential ingredient \npseudoephedrine behind the counter, we have lifted a heavy burden from \nthe shoulders of our local law enforcement and made our communities a \nsafer place to live and raise a family. In my home State of Iowa alone, \nthe number of seizures fell a remarkable 73 percent since the sale of \npseudoephearine was restricted. But as anyone can tell you, we have a \nlong way to go.\n  Despite our best efforts and recent success, meth continues to wreak \nhavoc on families and communities across the country. While local ``mom \nand pop'' meth labs are being dismantled everywhere, drug dealers \ncontinue to look for new ways to market their poison. This legislation \nis intended to protect our young people by expanding existing penalties \nfor those marketing their poison to kids.\n  Currently Federal law enhances Federal penalties for selling drugs to \nanyone under the age of 21. When a violation occurs, the Federal \npenalties are doubled--tripled for a repeat offense--and a mandatory \nminimum of at least 1 year also applies. However, only the dealer who \ndirectly sells drugs to someone under 21 is subject to a double \nsentence.\n  The Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act would expand the \ncircumstances under which these enhanced penalties apply. Under our \nbill, the enhanced penalties that already exist would also apply to \nanyone who ``manufactures, creates, distributes, or possesses with \nintent to distribute a controlled substance that is flavored, colored, \npackaged or otherwise altered in a way that is designed to make it more \nappealing to a person under 21 years of age, or who attempts or \nconspires to do so.''\n  The fight against meth and other dangerous drugs is and will continue \nto be an ongoing struggle. We must adapt and change our tactics just as \nthe dealers, distributors, and pushers have changed theirs. We must do \nall we can to protect the most vulnerable among us and send a clear \nmessage to those wishing to prey on our youth.\n  I ask that my colleagues join us in support of this important \nlegislation and pass the Drug Endangered Children Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Inouye, Ms. \n        Cantwell, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1212. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npermit direct payment under the Medicare program for clinical social \nworker services provided to residents of skilled nursing facilities; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSI. Mr. President, acknowledging the social workers' \npresence on Capitol Hill this week for their Annual Leadership Meeting \nLobby Day, I rise today to introduce the ``Clinical Social Work \nMedicare Equity Act of 2007.'' I am proud to sponsor this legislation \nthat will ensure clinical social workers receive Medicare \nreimbursements for the mental health services they provide in skilled \nnursing facilities. Under the current system, social workers are not \npaid for the services they provide. Psychologists and psychiatrists, \nwho provide similar counseling, are able to separately bill Medicare \nfor their services.\n  Since my first days in Congress, I have been fighting to protect and \nstrengthen the safety of our Nation's seniors. Making sure that seniors \nhave access to quality, affordable mental\n\n[[Page S5099]]\n\nhealth care is an important part of this fight. I know that millions of \nseniors do not have access to, or are not receiving, the mental health \nservices they urgently need. Nearly 6 million seniors are affected by \ndepression, but only one-tenth ever receive treatment. According to the \nAmerican Psychiatric Association, up to 25 percent of the elderly \npopulation in the United States suffers from significant symptoms of \nmental illness and among nursing home residents the prevalence is as \nhigh as 80 percent. These mental disorders, which include severe \ndepression and debilitating anxiety, interfere with the person's \nability to carry out activities of daily living and adversely affect \ntheir quality of life. Furthermore, older people have a 20 percent \nsuicide rate, the highest of any age group. Every year nearly 6,000 \nolder Americans kill themselves. This is unacceptable and must be \naddressed.\n  As a former social worker, I understand the role social workers play \nin the overall care of patients and seniors. This bill protects \npatients across the country and ensures that seniors living in \nunderserved urban and rural areas, where clinical social workers are \noften the only available option for mental health care, continue to \nreceive the treatment they need. Clinical social workers, much like \npsychologists and psychiatrists, treat and diagnose mental illnesses. \nIn fact, clinical social workers are the primary mental health \nproviders for nursing home residents and seniors residing in rural \nenvironments. Unlike other mental health providers, clinical social \nworkers cannot bill Medicare directly for the important services they \nprovide to their patients. Protecting seniors' access to clinical \nsocial workers ensures that our most vulnerable citizens get the \nquality, affordable mental health care they need. This bill will \ncorrect this inequity and make sure clinical social workers get the \npayments and respect they deserve.\n  Before the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, clinical social workers \nbilled Medicare Part B directly for mental health services they \nprovided in nursing facilities for each patient they served. Under the \nProspective Payment System, services provided by clinical social \nworkers are lumped, or ``bundled,'' along with the services of other \nhealth care providers for the purposes of billing and payments. \nPsychologists and psychiatrists, who provide similar counseling, were \nexempted from this system and continue to bill Medicare directly. This \nbill would exempt clinical social workers, like their mental health \ncolleagues, from the Prospective Payment System, and would make sure \nthat clinical social workers are paid for the services they provide to \npatients in skilled nursing facilities. The Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act addressed some of these \nconcerns, but this legislation would remove the final barrier to \nensuring that clinical social workers are treated fairly and equitably \nfor the care they provide.\n  This bill is about more than paperwork and payment procedures. This \nbill is about equal access to Medicare payments for the equal and \nimportant work done by clinical social workers. It is about making sure \nour Nation's most vulnerable citizens have access to quality, \naffordable mental health care. The overarching goal we should be \nstriving to achieve for our seniors is an overall improved quality of \nlife. Without clinical social workers, many nursing home residents may \nnever get the counseling they need when faced with a life threatening \nillness or the loss of a loved one. I think we can do better by our \nNation's seniors, and I'm fighting to make sure we do.\n  The Clinical Social Work Medicare Equity Act of 2007 is strongly \nsupported by the National Association of Social Workers. I also want to \nthank Senators Stabenow and Inouye for their co-sponsorship of this \nbill. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this \nimportant legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                            of Social Workers,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2007.\n     Senator Barbara Mikulski,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: I am writing on behalf of the \n     National Association of Social Workers (NASW), the largest \n     professional social work organization in the world with \n     150,000 members nationwide. NASW promotes, develops, and \n     protects the effective practice of social work services. NASW \n     strongly supports the Clinical Social Work Medicare Equity \n     Act of 2007, which will improve mental health care to nursing \n     home residents and end the unfair treatment of clinical \n     social workers under the Medicare Prospective Payment System \n     (PPS) for Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs).\n       The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 authorized the creation of \n     the PPS, under which the cost of a variety of routine \n     services provided to SNF patients is bundled into a single \n     amount. Prior to adoption of the PPS, a separate Medicare \n     claim was filed by providers for individual services rendered \n     to a patient. However, Congress recognized that some \n     services, such as mental health and anesthesia, are provided \n     on an individual as-needed basis rather than as part of the \n     bundle of services. Thus, the following types of providers \n     were excluded from the PPS: physicians, clinical \n     psychologists, certified nurse-midwives, and certified \n     registered nurse anesthetists. Unfortunately, due to an \n     oversight during the drafting process, clinical social \n     workers were not listed among the PPS excluded providers.\n       In 1996, the DHHS Inspector General issued a report \n     entitled ``Mental Health Services in Nursing Facilities,'' \n     which described the types of mental health services provided \n     in nursing facilities and identified their potential \n     vulnerabilities. One critical finding of the report was that \n     70 percent of respondents stated that permitting clinical \n     social workers and clinical psychologists to bill Medicare \n     independently had a beneficial effect on the provision of \n     mental health services in SNFs. Your legislation will improve \n     care for SNF residents by restoring Medicare payments for \n     specialized clinical social work services rendered to SNF \n     patients.\n       Your tireless efforts on behalf of consumers of mental \n     health services and professional social workers nationwide \n     are greatly appreciated by our members. We thank you for your \n     strong interest in and commitment to these important issues \n     as demonstrated by your sponsorship of the Clinical Socia1 \n     Work Medicare Equity Act. NASW looks forward to working with \n     you on this and future issues of mutual concern.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Elizabeth J. Clark,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1214. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe partial exclusion for gain from certain small business stocks; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this week we are celebrating National Small \nBusiness Week to recognize the contributions made by small businesses, \nwhich are the engine of our economic growth. During 2005, more than 25 \nbillion small businesses in the United States contributed $918 billion \nto the economy.\n  Many of our most successful corporations started as small businesses, \nincluding AOL, Apple Computer, Compac Computer, Datastream, Evergreen \nSolar, Intel Corporations, and Sun Microsystems. As you can see from \nthis partial list, many of these companies played an integral role in \nmaking the Internet a reality.\n  Today, Senator Snowe and I are introducing the Invest in Small \nBusiness Act of 2007, to encourage private investment in small \nbusinesses by making changes to the existing partial exclusion for gain \nfrom certain small business stock.\n  We are at an integral juncture in developing technology to address \nglobal climate change. I believe that small business will repeat the \nrole it played at the vanguard of the computer revolution by leading \nthe Nation in developing the technologies to substantially reduce \ncarbon emissions. Small businesses already are at the forefront of \nthese industries, and we need to do everything we can to encourage \ninvestment in small businesses.\n  Back in 1993, I worked with Senator Bumpers to provide a partial \nexclusion for gain from the sale of small business stock. This \nprovision would provide a 50 percent exclusion for gain for individuals \nfrom the sale of certain small business stock that is held for five \nyears. Since the enactment of this provision, the capital gains rate \nhas been lowered twice without any changes to the exclusion. Due to the \nlower capital rates, this provision no longer provides a strong \nincentive for investment in small businesses.\n  The Invest in Small Business Act makes several changes to the \nexisting provision. This legislation increases the exclusion amount \nfrom 50 percent\n\n[[Page S5100]]\n\nto 75 percent and decreases the holding period from five years to four \nyears. This bill would allow corporations to benefit from the provision \nas long as they own less than 25 percent of the small business \ncorporation stock.\n  Currently, the exclusion is treated as a preference item for \ncalculating the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The Invest in Small \nBusiness Act of 2007 would repeal the exclusion as an AMT preference \nitem. Under current law, the nonexcluded amount of gain is taxed at 28 \npercent. This legislation would tax the nonexcluded portion at the \nlower capital gains rate of 15 or 5 percent.\n  The Invest in Small Business Act of 2007 will provide an effective \ntax rate of 3.75 percent for the gain from the sale of certain small \nbusinesses. This lower capital gains rate will encourage investment in \nsmall businesses. In addition, the changes made by the Invest in Small \nBusiness Act of 2007 will make more taxpayers eligible for this \nprovision.\n  As we celebrate the success of entrepreneurs this week, it is an \nappropriate time to encourage new investment. The Invest in Small \nBusiness Act of 2007 strengthens an existing tax incentive to provide \nan appropriate incentive to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary of \nthe bill be printed in the Record\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1214\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Invest in Small Business Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

the Invest in Small Business Act of 2007\n\n       The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 included a \n     provision to encourage investment in small businesses. This \n     provision created section 1202 of the tax code which provides \n     a 50 percent exclusion for the gain from the sale of certain \n     small business stock held for more than five years. The \n     amount of gain eligible for the exclusion is limited to the \n     greater of 10 times the taxpayer's basis in the stock, or $10 \n     million gain from stock in that small business corporation. \n     This provision is limited to individual investments and not \n     the investments of a corporation. At the date of the issuance \n     of the stock, the gross assets of the corporation cannot \n     exceed $50 million. At least 80 percent of the assets of the \n     corporation are used for the active conduct of business. For \n     purposes of calculating the alternative minimum tax (AMT), \n     seven percent of the excluded amount is added back into the \n     AMT calculation. The nonexcluded portion of section 1202 gain \n     is taxed at the lesser of ordinary income rates or 28 \n     percent, instead of the lower capital gains rates for \n     individuals. Since the enactment of this provision, the \n     capital gains rate has been lowered twice. No corresponding \n     changes were made to section 1202.\n       The Invest in Small Business Act of 2007 makes the \n     following changes to section 1202 to encourage more \n     investment in small businesses.\n       Increases the exclusion from 50 percent to 75 percent.\n       Decreases the holding period from five to four years.\n       Repeals the capital gains exclusions as an AMT preference.\n       Taxes the nonexcluded portion of section 1202 gains at the \n     regular capital gains rate, which is currently 15 percent or \n     5 percent for individual taxpayers.\n       Allows corporations the benefits of section 1202, but to be \n     eligible, a corporation cannot hold more than 25 percent of \n     the stock of a qualified small business.\n       Provides a 100 percent exclusion for gain from the sale of \n     small business stock of corporations located in an \n     empowerment zone.\n       Increases the asset limitation from $50 million to $100 \n     million.\n       Below are calculations based on $100 of gain calculated \n     under current law and under the Invest in Small Business Act \n     of 2007. Under the present law, calculations for the \n     remaining $50 would be taxed at 28 percent and result in a \n     tax of $14 for a regular taxpayer and $14.98 of tax for an \n     AMT taxpayer. (This calculation is based on a taxpayer paying \n     the 28 percent AMT rate.)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\nRegular Tax Calculation:\nGain...............................................................$100\nExclusion...........................................................-50\nRegular Tax Rate.................................................. 0.28\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n  Total Regular Tax.................................................$14\nAMT Tax Calculation\nExcluded amount.....................................................$50\nAMT preference rate................................................ .07\nAMT preference......................................................3.5\nAMT taxable income.................................................53.5\n(regular income plus preference)....................................\nAMT rate.......................................................... 0.28\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n  Total AMT......................................................$14.98\n\n\n                  Invest in Small Business Act of 2007\n\n       There is only one calculation under this legislation for \n     individual taxpayers because section 1202 gain is no longer a \n     preference item under the AMT. The total amount of tax on \n     $100 of gain is $3.75 and this represents an effective tax \n     rate of 3.75 percent. Under the changes made by the Invest in \n     Small Business Act of 2007, the tax on capital gains\n\n[[Page S5101]]\n\n     of the sale of qualified small business stock is 3.75 \n     percent, instead of 14 percent for individual taxpayers. \n     Corporate taxpayers would have an effective tax rate of 8.75 \n     percent instead of 35 percent.\n\nTax Calculation Individual Taxpayer:\nGain...............................................................$100\nExcluded Amount.....................................................-75\nCapital Gains Tax Rate............................................ 0.15\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n  Total Tax.......................................................$3.75\nTax Calculation Corporate Taxpayer:\nGain...............................................................$100\nExcluded Amount.....................................................-75\nCapital Gains Tax Rate............................................ 0.35\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n  Total Tax.......................................................$8.75\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1216. A bill to allow certain nationals of Mexico entering the \nState of New Mexico on a temporary basis to travel up to 100 miles from \nthe international border between the State of New Mexico and Mexico, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Bingaman to \nintroduce a bill of importance to the economic development of our \nSouthwest border States, the Laser Visa Extension Act of 2007.\n  The United States and Mexico have had special travel rules for \nMexican nationals who visit our country for short periods of time since \n1953. These visitors can come into our country with a document known as \na ``laser visa'' or ``border crossing card'', which is an alternative \nto a passport and must be obtained from the U.S. government. In the \n1990s, the rule was that anyone who held such a document could travel \nup to 25 miles from the Mexico/U.S. border.\n  In 1999, Arizona and the Border Trade Alliance mounted a successful \ncampaign to extend the mileage limit in Arizona to 75 miles because \nthere is no large town within 25 miles of the Arizona/Mexico border, so \nArizona wasn't getting the economic benefits of these travelers.\n  Similarly, there is no large town within 25 miles of the New Mexico/\nMexico border, so my constituents do not get the economic benefits of \nlaser visa travelers. This disparity needs to be corrected. Moreover, \nall four Southwest border States should see the same benefits of laser \nvisa travelers.\n  Therefore, the bill I am introducing today extends the distance laser \nvisa holders can travel into the United States to 100 miles, regardless \nof which State they are in. Such an extension will allow more towns in \nall four of our Southwest border States to reap the economic benefits \nof short-term visitors to our country who hold a travel document issued \nby our Federal Government.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1216\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Laser Visa Extension Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRAVEL PRIVILEGES FOR CERTAIN TEMPORARY VISITORS FROM \n                   MEXICO.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall permit a national of \n     Mexico to travel up to 100 miles from the international \n     border between Mexico and the State of New Mexico if such \n     national--\n       (1) possesses a valid machine-readable biometric border \n     crossing identification card issued by a consular officer of \n     the Department of State;\n       (2) enters the State of New Mexico through a port of entry \n     where such card is processed using a machine reader;\n       (3) has successfully completed any background check \n     required by the Secretary for such travel; and\n       (4) is admitted into the United States as a nonimmigrant \n     under section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(B)).\n       (b) Exception.--On a case-by-case basis, the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security may limit the travel of a national of \n     Mexico who meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) through \n     (4) of subsection (a) to a distance of less than 100 miles \n     from the international border between Mexico and the State of \n     New Mexico if the Secretary determines that the national was \n     previously admitted into the United States as a nonimmigrant \n     and violated the terms and conditions of the national's \n     nonimmigrant status.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Akaka, \n        Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1219. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntaxpayer protection and assistance, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Taxpayer \nProtection and Assistance Act of 2007'' with Senators Smith, Akaka, \nDurbin, Kerry, and Lieberman. My colleagues may recall that similar \nlegislation, S. 832, was introduced last Congress and ultimately \nreported out of the Finance Committee last year but unfortunately it \nnever made it to the floor of the Senate. This Congress, the House has \nalready passed taxpayer rights legislation which makes me optimistic \nthat many of these long overdue reforms may finally become law.\n  This Act is a combination of a variety of well-vetted provisions that \nwill ensure that our Nation's taxpayers are better able to prepare and \nfile their tax returns each year in a fashion that is fair, reasonable \nand affordable. As long as we continue to require taxpayers to \ndetermine their own tax liability, Congress has a responsibility to \nensure that we do not leave taxpayers vulnerable to abuses from those \nmasquerading as tax professionals. The current environment is bad for \neveryone including the majority of tax return preparers who provide \nprofessional and much needed services to taxpayers in their \ncommunities. I encourage all of my colleagues to work with us to pass \nthis legislation before the next filing season begins.\n  The first section of the Taxpayer Protection and Assistance Act would \ncreate a $10 million matching grant program for lower income tax \npreparation clinics much like the program we currently have in place \nfor tax controversies. I have seen first hand the impact free tax \npreparation clinics can have on taxpayers and their communities, as we \nare fortunate to have one of the best State-wide programs in the Nation \nin New Mexico. Tax Help New Mexico, which has been in operation for \nmany years, helped over 20,000 New Mexicans prepare and file their \nreturns last year, resulting in over $20 million in refunds--all \nwithout refund anticipation loans. This program has turned into one of \nthe best delivery mechanisms for public assistance I have seen in the \nState and has been fortunate enough to receive additional funding from \nthe Annie E. Casey Foundation and the McCune Foundation. In order to \ncontinue to grow, though, we need to do our part in Congress and give \nthem matching funding so they can continue their outreach into new \ncommunities in need of assistance.\n  The second set of provisions contained in this legislation would \nensure that when taxpayers hire someone to help them with their tax \nreturns they can be sure that the person is competent and professional. \nThe first part of the bill makes sure that an enrolled agent, a tax \nprofessional licensed to practice before the IRS, shall have the \nexclusive right to describe him or herself as an ``enrolled agent,'' \n``EA,'' or ``E.A.'' In New Mexico, enrolled agents play an important \nrole in helping taxpayers with problems with the IRS and with preparing \ntheir returns. Enrolled agents have earned the right to use their \ncredentials. Furthermore, we should protect the credentials of those \nwho have taken the rigorous exams and have experience in tax \npreparation rather than allow others to confuse the public into \nthinking they too have the same credentials.\n  The next part of the bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury to \ndetermine what standards need to be met in order for a person to \nprepare tax returns commercially. Like all other tax professionals, \nthis will require people who make a living preparing tax returns to \npass a minimum competency exam and take brush up courses each year to \nkeep up to date with changes in tax law. The majority of tax return \npreparers already meet these standards, including many who have \nreceived credentials from the State or from a nationally recognized \nassociation of accountants or tax return preparers. We provide specific \nauthority to the Secretary to determine whether people who have already \ntaken a written proficiency exam as part of some other tax return \ncredentialing will need to take the new exam. The Secretary will be\n\n[[Page S5102]]\n\nable to exercise these authorizations only after thorough review of the \nspecific examination and only for those examinations subsequently \ndetermined to be comparable. In that light, we urge the Secretary to \nexercise his authority in this area in a manner consistent with the \ngoal of protecting taxpayers through ensuring the competency of \nenrolled preparers. The Treasury Department will also be required to \noperate a public awareness campaign so that taxpayers will know that \nthey need to check to be sure that someone preparing their tax returns \nfor a fee is qualified.\n  The fourth set of provisions would directly address the problems with \nrefund anticipation loans (RALs)--a problem throughout the country, but \none that is particularly troublesome in New Mexico. First, this bill \nrequires refund loan facilitators to register with the Treasury \nDepartment. Refund loan facilitators are those people who solicit, \nprocess, or otherwise facilitate the making of a refund anticipation \nloan in relation to a tax return being electronically filed. The \nlegislation also requires these refund loan facilitators to properly \ndisclose to taxpayers that they do not have to get a RAL in order to \nfile their return electronically, as well as clearly disclose what all \nthe costs involved with the loan. Finally, the refund loan facilitators \nmust disclose to taxpayers when the loans would allow their refunds to \nbe offset by the amount of the loan. Much like the public awareness \ncampaign for advertising the credentials required for preparing Federal \ntax returns, the Act requires the Treasury Department to operate a \nprogram to educate the public on the real costs of RALs as compared to \nother forms of credit. This program will be funded, at least in part, \nby amounts collected from penalties imposed on refund loan facilitators \nwho have broken the law.\n  The next section of the bill is an issue that my colleague from \nHawaii, Senator Akaka, has been actively working on for the last \nseveral years. This provision would authorize the Treasury Department \nto award grants to financial institutions or charitable groups that \nhelp low income taxpayers set up accounts at a bank or credit union. \nBecause many taxpayers do not have checking or savings accounts, their \nrefunds from IRS cannot be electronically wired to them. The \nalternative is to have the check mailed to the taxpayer or to have the \nrefund immediately loaned to the taxpayer in the form of a RAL. Of \ncourse, getting people to set up a checking or savings account for \npurposes of receiving their tax refund will also have the benefits of \ngetting many of these people to start saving for the first time.\n  Finally, we have added two new provisions to clarify existing law. \nThe first clarifies that the National Taxpayer Advocate has the \nauthority to issue taxpayer assistance orders in cases involving \nclosing agreements and compromises. The other clarifies that the \nSecretary of the Treasury has the authority to take into account a \ntaxpayers specific facts and circumstances when evaluating an offer in \ncompromise. Both of these provisions are the result of bipartisan \nnegotiations and are an improvement to our tax system.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with me and the cosponsors of this \nbill to pass this important legislation. Our voluntary tax system is \ndependent on taxpayers being able to receive the best advice and \nassistance possible. We have a responsibility to our Nation's taxpayers \nto make sure that they do receive such advice and assistance. This bill \ngoes a long way toward that goal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1219\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the enactment of comprehensive health \ncare reform; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this week thousands of business owners, \nunion members, faith leaders, physicians, nurses, and patients will \ncome together in Washington and in each of the 50 States to demand \nimmediate action to fix our Nation's growing health insurance crisis. \nThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's fifth annual Cover the Uninsured \nWeek will once again call attention to the 45 million of our neighbors, \nco-workers and friends--including 11 million children under age 21--who \nlive without any health care coverage. Unable to afford doctor's visits \nand prescription drugs, they live day to day in fear that a child will \nget sick or suffer an accident. No family in this  great Nation should \nhave to live in such fear.\n  Understandably, the focus of Cover the Uninsured Week this year is on \nthe great opportunity presenting this Congress to expand coverage to \nmillions of America's uninsured children through the reauthorization \nand expansion of the successful, bipartisan State Children's Health \nInsurance Program. This is the number one domestic budget priority for \nme and for the new Democratic Congress.\n  In a given year, uninsured kids are only half as likely to receive \nany medical care. That neglect leads to chronic disease. Uninsured kids \nalso cost us productivity when parents must choose between working and \ncaring for a sick child without the help of a doctor. Kids in public \ninsurance programs perform 68 percent better in school, and insuring \nall of them would reduce avoidable hospitalizations by 22 percent.\n  But while kids are undoubtedly our first priority, we must take care \nnot to lose sight of our ultimate objective: Ensuring that every single \nman, woman, and child in America has affordable and meaningful health \ninsurance coverage. The fact is that denying health insurance is not \njust immoral, it's ultimately more costly than insuring them. In the \nlong run, this is an obvious choice.\n  But we do not have time to wait for the long run. Our businesses, \nfamilies, and health care providers need relief immediately from the \ninsecurity, inefficiency, and inequity bred by a system which insures \ntoo few at too high a cost.\n  Therefore, I am introducing today the ``Countdown to Coverage Act of \n2007.'' It's simple: The Countdown to Coverage Act requires Congress to \npass legislation by the end of the 111th session that will ensure all \nAmericans have quality, affordable health care coverage. If Congress \nfails to act, members will become responsible for 100 percent of the \ncost of their own plan through FEHBP.\n  Senators and Congressmen give ourselves the very best health care \ncoverage, and it's American taxpayers who foot the bill. Now, Congress \nneeds to step up and pass universal health care coverage by 2011--or \npay the price and pick up the cost of our own health care ourselves. 45 \nmillion people--11 million kids--without health insurance is \nunacceptable in the richest country in the world. Every American \ndeserves the kind of quality care that Senators and Congressmen give \nthemselves, and this bill sets a deadline for members of Congress to \ntake real action.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1221\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Countdown to Coverage Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE REFORM.\n\n       (a) In General.--If a provision of law that ensures \n     accessible, affordable, and meaningful health insurance for \n     all Americans is not enacted before the adjournment, sine \n     die, of the 111th Congress, as determined by Institute of \n     Medicine, there shall be no Government contribution under \n     section 8906 of title 5, United States Code, for any Member \n     of Congress and any Member of Congress shall pay 100 percent \n     of all premiums for any health benefits plan under chapter 89 \n     of that title.\n       (b) Notification.--The Institute of Medicine shall submit \n     timely notice to the Office of Personnel Management, the \n     Secretary of the Senate, and the Chief Administrative Officer \n     of the House of Representatives of--\n       (1) the determination that a provision of law has not been \n     enacted before the adjournment, sine die, of the 111th \n     Congress, as described under subsection (a); and\n       (2) the dates and adjustments that are required to take \n     effect under this Act.\n       (c) Adjustments.--After receiving notice under subsection \n     (b), the Office of Personnel Management, the Secretary of the \n     Senate, and the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of \n     Representatives shall make such\n\n[[Page S5106]]\n\n     adjustments as may be necessary on the first day of the first \n     applicable pay period beginning on or after the date of that \n     notice.\n       (d) Regulations.--The Office of Personnel Management may \n     prescribe regulations to carry out this section.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1222. A bill to stop mortgage transactions which operate to \npromote fraud, risk, abuse, and under-development, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation to \nprotect American consumers and homeowners from fraudulent and abusive \nmortgage lending practices. Mortgage fraud and abuse are growing \nproblems in this country, problems that are depriving thousands of \nAmericans of their dream of homeownership and often their hard-earned \nlife savings. These problems are also costing the mortgage industry \nhundreds of millions of dollars each year and making the housing \nmarket, which is critical to our economy and the stability of our \nneighborhoods, more vulnerable.\n  Although the data in this area is limited, mortgage fraud, which \ntakes a variety of forms from inflated appraisals to the use of straw \nbuyers, is a growing problem. In September of 2002, the FBI had 436 \nmortgage fraud investigations. Currently, they have more than 1,036--an \nincrease of 137 percent in less than 5 years. And of the 1,036 current \ncases, more than half have expected losses of more than $1 million. \nThis is due largely to the housing boom which has driven up housing \nprices across the country. Nearly $2.37 trillion in mortgage loans were \nmade during 2006, and the number may be even higher this year.\n  But mortgage fraud is not just about dollars and statistics; it's \nabout real people, real homes, and real lives. I first introduced this \nlegislation last year after my hometown Chicago Tribune featured a \nseries of articles about mortgage fraud in Illinois, which, along with \nGeorgia, South Carolina, Florida, Missouri, Michigan, California, \nNevada, Colorado and Utah, is among the FBI's top-ten mortgage fraud \n``hot spots.''\n  The Tribune stories highlighted the plight of the good folks on May \nStreet in Chicago, who saw a block's worth of homes go boarded up in \nthe span of a just few years, as swindlers racked up hundreds of \nthousands of dollars in bad loans. The shells of houses were left \nbehind as sad reminders of broken dreams. The Tribune highlighted the \nplight of 75-year-old Ruth Williams, who had to spend her personal \nfunds to clear the title to her home after fraudsters secured $400,000 \nin loans on three buildings they didn't own. A recent Tribune \ninvestigation turned up a 91-year-old woman defrauded into signing away \nher brick Chicago home, her sole asset, leaving her with nothing.\n  Law enforcement, consumer groups and many in the mortgage industry \nare working extremely hard to combat fraud and abusive lending \npractices. I applaud their good work. Now, Congress should come to the \ntable and do its part, and I'm pleased to introduce legislation today \nwith my good friend Senator Durbin to address this important issue.\n  The STOP FRAUD Act, which was first introduced in February 2006, is \naimed at stopping mortgage transactions which operate to promote fraud, \nrisk, abuse and underdevelopment. This year, the bill includes new \nprovisions to protect the legal rights of borrowers with particularly \nrisky subprime loans. The Act provides the first Federal definition of \nmortgage fraud and authorizes stiff criminal penalties against \nfraudulent actors. STOP FRAUD requires a wide range of mortgage \nprofessionals to report suspected fraudulent activity, and gives these \nsame professionals safe harbor from liability when they report \nsuspicious incidents. It also authorizes several grant programs to help \nState and local law enforcement fight fraud, provide the mortgage \nindustry with updates on fraud trends, and further support the \nDepartments of Treasury, Justice and Housing and Urban Development's \nfraud-fighting efforts.\n  At a time when many homeowners are concerned about losing their home \nto foreclosure, and policymakers are worried about fraudulent, \ndeceptive, and even just plain confusing lending practices that are \nroiling communities across the country, STOP FRAUD provides $25 million \nfor housing counseling. The Department of Housing and Urban Development \nwill contract with public or private organization to provide \ninformation, advice, counseling, and technical assistance to tenants, \nhomeowners, and other consumers with respect to mortgage fraud and \nother activities that are likely to increase the risk of foreclosure.\n  The Act also protects the legal rights of borrowers with risky, \nsubprime loans. The greatest growth in the mortgage lending market is \nin subprime loans and some have estimated that more than 2 million \nhomeowners with subprime mortgages are at risk of losing their homes. \nIf a borrower receives a subprime mortgage with any one of several \nhigh-risk characteristics, the Act protects the rights of borrowers to \nchallenge lending practices in foreclosure proceedings. The high-risk \ncharacteristics targeted by this Act include loans for which the \nborrower does not have the ability to repay at the maximum rate of \ninterest, loans whose true long-term costs are not clearly disclosed to \nthe borrower, stated-income and no-documentation loans, and loans with \nunreasonable prepayment penalties.\n  Many States are actively trying to prevent a wave of expected \nforeclosures as housing prices stop rising while adjustable rates on \nmany risk loans start rising. STOP FRAUD instructs the Government \nAccountability Office to evaluate the various State initiatives and \nreport to Congress on lending practices and regulations related to \nmortgage fraud and deception, predatory lending, and homeownership \npreservation efforts.\n  We cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American \nfamilies face the risk of losing their homes. There is excellent work \nbeing done by the Banking Committees in the House and Senate to tackle \nsome of the thorniest and most challenging problems affecting the \nmortgage industry today. I look forward to working with my colleagues \non comprehensive legislation to protect consumers and strengthen the \nhousing market. The STOP FRAUD Act is just the beginning of an \nimportant Federal response. It is a tough, cost-effective, and balanced \nway to address the serious problem of mortgage fraud in our country and \nto provide additional protections for vulnerable borrowers. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in this important effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Carper, and Mr. \n        Pryor):\n  S. 1223. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to support efforts by local or regional \ntelevision or radio broadcasters to provide essential public \ninformation programming in the event of a major disaster, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the \nFirst Response Broadcasters Act, legislation I am introducing today \nalong with Senators Stevens, Carper and Pryor.\n  As my State suffered the devastating impact of Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita and the levee breaks that followed, we learned that one of the \nmost vital relief supplies is information. In providing it, all of our \nlocal media--newspapers, broadcasters and web sites included--did \namazing work to keep the people of my State informed, even when \ndisplaced thousands of miles away. But with phone lines down and \nstreets too flooded to move around, the sound of a local radio or \ntelevision station was for many of my constituents the only voice in \nthose first few dark nights after the hurricanes. Our local \nbroadcasters provided life-saving information and comfort when both \nwere needed the most. Many of them worked through unimaginable \ntechnical and emotional obstacles, staying on the air as their \nfacilities and staff homes were destroyed, and loved ones remained \nmissing.\n  With the entire industry dependent on public airwaves, broadcasters \nhave a duty to serve the public in times of crisis. As local radio and \ntelevision stations stand up, as so many did, to put commercial \ninterests aside to serve the public interest, the federal government\n\n[[Page S5107]]\n\nshould be ready to stand with them. This is not a new partnership.\n  Under laws going back to 1951, radio and television stations are \ntoday required to participate in the national Emergency Alert System \n(EAS), and many stations have protected, government-funded circuits \nconnecting them to emergency command centers. This legislation would \ndirectly connect more stations nationwide to this network by \nauthorizing $6.5 million to FEMA to set up Primary Entry Point radio \nstations in another twenty five states and U.S. territories. Currently \nthere are thirty-two stations and two under development in Alabama and \nMississippi.\n  A Primary Entry Point (PEP) station is a radio broadcast station \ndesignated to provide public information following national and local \nemergencies where there is no commercial power. For example, WWL Radio \nin New Orleans was the only PEP station in the Gulf Coast after Katrina \nand it provided radio broadcasts for two weeks after the storm until \ncommercial power was restored. FEMA commissioned recommendations from \nthe Primary Entry Point Advisory Committee, a non-profit group they set \nup to oversee the stations, and just needs the additional funds to \nbuild the additional facilities. Included in the findings of the \nlegislation is a comprehensive list of the states that are currently \nwithout PEP stations and which would benefit from this provision. There \nare also States which have PEP stations, but because of geographic \nlimitations, require an additional station to fully cover the State. \nThis bill would provide those two additional stations in Kansas and \nFlorida.\n  But what good is this successful emergency information chain if the \nlast link fails? By technical necessity, this last link is right in the \ndisaster's path. Simply put, the transmitter needs to be in the same \narea as the people in need of warning. Despite our Federal investments \nin the emergency system and entry point stations, there were several \nGulf Coast broadcasters after the hurricanes that could not stay on the \nair simply because the government took their fuel away. They were told \nthey weren't on the list.''\n  This legislation puts these broadcasters on the list, where they \nbelong. To protect vital broadcast infrastructure and encourage more \nbroadcasters to deploy disaster-resistant telecommunications equipment, \nthis bill would also create a 3-year pilot program managed by the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency to provide annual matching grants \nto qualified First Response Broadcasters for the protection and \nreinforcement of critical-to-air facilities and infrastructure. The \nprogram would receive $10 million per year to fund matching program \ngrants, and grants could also be used for projects to enhance essential \ndisaster-related public information services.\n  As the program encourages both disaster preparedness and community \ncoordination, increased scoring would be granted to applications from \nbroadcasters who form cooperative proposals with other broadcasters in \nthe area or those who submit plans in conjunction with local or State \ngovernments. Priority scoring would also be given to applicants in \ndisaster-prone areas and also based on the public service merits of the \nbroadcasters disaster programming plan.\n  No disaster warning, evacuation plan or emergency instruction matters \nif it can't get to the people who need it. This is why the Federal \nCommunications Commission and a presidential advisory panel have each \nrecommended we take steps to keep these lifesaving broadcasts on the \nair.\n  In particular, this bill would require that the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency and other Federal response agencies, in coordination \nwith State and local authorities and the National Guard, honor press \naccess guidelines and credentials set by the local governing authority \nin the declared disaster area. For example, if the City of New Orleans \nissued press credentials before the disaster and the city decided to \ncontinue honoring them post-disaster, FEMA officials operating in the \narea would be required to honor those credentials as well. The local \nentity, at its own discretion, would be able to request that this \ncredentialing authority be passed instead to federal or state \nofficials.\n  Along these same lines, the bill would also direct the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency to coordinate with local and State agencies \nto allow access, where practicable and not impeding recovery or \nendangering public safety, into the disaster area for personnel and \nequipment essential to restoring or maintaining critical-to-air \nbroadcast infrastructure. The priority policies and procedures for this \ncoordination would be similar to those practiced for restoring public \nutilities, and would include access for refueling generators and re-\nsupplying critical facilities.\n  For all journalists working to tell the story-newspapers and web \nsites included-the First Response Broadcasters Act makes sure that the \nlocal officials, who know local reporters best, decide where the \njournalists can go, not some Washington bureaucrat who just stepped off \nthe plane.\n  In closing, I would like to submit for the record the stories of a \nfew incredible broadcasters who through recent disasters have \ndemonstrated exactly the type of response this bill is intended to \nencourage. I would also like to submit for the record a list of \norganizations which have already endorsed this legislation-including \nthe state broadcasting associations from every one of the 50 states and \nthe District of Columbia.\n  Broadcasters have a duty to the American people to spread the word in \ntimes of crisis. No one else can do it. They are already a key part of \nour national emergency response plan, and have been for more than 50 \nyears. This bill merely reinforces this fact and secures the logical \nextension of commitments already made by Federal government. We have a \nresponsibility to make sure the tools are protected to make the system \nwork.\n  Broadcasters are first responders--and with this bill today, we will \nstrengthen our essential partnership with them for the benefit of all \nAmericans. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation \nand ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation, the \nbroadcaster stories, and a list of the organizations already supporting \nthis bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1223\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``First Response Broadcasters \n     Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in the periods before, during, and after major \n     disasters that occurred not long before the date of enactment \n     of this Act (including Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, and \n     the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001), local media \n     organizations (including newspapers, public and private \n     broadcasters, and online publications) provided a valuable \n     public service by transmitting and publishing disaster-\n     related information, guidance, and assistance;\n       (2) local broadcasters, public and private, provided a \n     particularly valuable public service by transmitting \n     evacuation instructions, warnings of impending threats, \n     timely response status updates, and other essential \n     information related to such major disasters to listeners and \n     viewers to whom other forms of media were often unavailable \n     or inaccessible;\n       (3) an inability to access a disaster area may impede the \n     ability of local media organizations to provide such public \n     services;\n       (4) according to the report by the Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, titled \n     ``Hurricane Katrina: A Nation Still Unprepared'', dated May \n     2006, ``It is essential that the news media receive accurate \n     disaster information to circulate to the public. News media \n     can also help inform the public by reporting on rumors and \n     soliciting evidence and comment on their plausibility, if \n     any'';\n       (5) according to testimony provided on September 22, 2005, \n     to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of \n     the Senate, an estimated 100 Gulf Coast broadcast stations \n     were unable to broadcast as a result of Hurricane Katrina, \n     with approximately 28 percent of television stations and \n     approximately 35 percent of radio stations unable to \n     broadcast in the area affected by Hurricane Katrina;\n       (6) according to testimony provided on September 7, 2005, \n     to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of \n     Representatives, following Hurricane Katrina only 4 of the 41 \n     radio broadcast stations in the New Orleans metropolitan area \n     remained on the air in the immediate aftermath of that \n     hurricane;\n\n[[Page S5108]]\n\n       (7) the only television station in New Orleans to continue \n     transmitting its over-the-air signal uninterrupted during and \n     after Hurricane Katrina was able to do so only as a direct \n     result of steps taken to better protect its transmitter and \n     provide redundant production facilities in the region;\n       (8) fuel and other supply shortages inhibit the ability of \n     a broadcaster to stay on the air and provide essential public \n     information following a major disaster;\n       (9) according to the report by the Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, titled \n     ``Hurricane Katrina: A Nation Still Unprepared'', dated May \n     2006, there were instances of Federal authorities \n     confiscating privately-purchased fuel supplies in the area \n     affected by Hurricane Katrina;\n       (10) the ability of several broadcasters in Mississippi to \n     remain on the air was unduly compromised by the confiscation \n     of their privately-purchased fuel supplies;\n       (11) practices put in place following Hurricane Andrew to \n     involve broadcasters in disaster response and expedite access \n     by broadcast engineers to disaster areas for the purpose of \n     repairing critical-to-air facilities and infrastructure has \n     significantly increased the ability of broadcasters in \n     Florida to continue transmitting essential public information \n     during subsequent major disasters;\n       (12) a June 12, 2006, report to the Federal Communications \n     Commission from the Independent Panel Reviewing the Impact of \n     Hurricane Katrina on Communications Networks recommends that \n     cable and broadcasting infrastructure providers, and their \n     contracted workers, be afforded emergency responder status \n     under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) and that this \n     designation would remedy many of the access and fuel sharing \n     issues that hampered industry efforts to quickly repair \n     infrastructure following Hurricane Katrina;\n       (13) the partnership of competing radio broadcasters in the \n     wake of Hurricane Katrina, casting aside commercial interests \n     to provide uninterrupted, redundant public information \n     programming from multiple transmission facilities, served the \n     public well and for many hurricane victims was the only \n     source of disaster-related information for many days;\n       (14) other similar models for regional broadcaster \n     cooperation nationwide, such as the initiative by 3 public \n     and private radio groups to cooperatively produce essential \n     disaster-related programming in eastern and central Maine, \n     will further prepare the industry to effectively respond to \n     major disasters;\n       (15) following Hurricane Katrina, a Primary Entry Point \n     station in Louisiana, operating only on generator power until \n     commercial power was restored 2 weeks after the disaster, was \n     instrumental in providing life-saving information to the \n     general public throughout the area as battery-operated radios \n     were the only source of official news and information;\n       (16) as of April 18, 2007, there were 24 States with 1 \n     Primary Entry Point station, 4 States with 2 Primary Entry \n     point stations, 2 Primary Entry Point stations located in \n     territories of the United States, and 2 Primary Entry Point \n     stations under development in Alabama and Mississippi;\n       (17) in the event of a man-made or natural disaster, it is \n     essential to provide for Primary Entry Point stations in any \n     State or territory where there is not a facility, meaning an \n     additional 23 stations are required, located in--\n       (A) Arkansas;\n       (B) Connecticut;\n       (C) Delaware;\n       (D) the District of Columbia;\n       (E) Indiana;\n       (F) Iowa;\n       (G) Kentucky;\n       (H) Maine;\n       (I) Michigan;\n       (J) Nebraska;\n       (K) New Hampshire;\n       (L) New Jersey;\n       (M) Oklahoma;\n       (N) Oregon;\n       (O) Pennsylvania;\n       (P) Rhode Island;\n       (Q) South Dakota;\n       (R) Vermont;\n       (S) West Virginia;\n       (T) Wisconsin;\n       (U) American Samoa;\n       (V) the Northern Mariana Islands; and\n       (W) Guam; and\n       (18) in the event of a man-made or natural disaster, it is \n     essential to provide for the Primary Entry Point stations in \n     larger States where there is currently a facility, but an \n     additional station is required to ensure full sufficient \n     geographic coverage, meaning 2 stations are required, located \n     in--\n       (A) Kansas; and\n       (B) Florida.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Many did this while knowing they \n     had lost everything they owned (40 percent of station \n     personnel lost homes in the storm). Many worked with the \n     stress of knowing that spouses, relatives and friends were \n     missing or working in dangerous situations.\n       During the course of the storm and initial aftermath, WWL-\n     TV broadcast from four different studios. When the storm \n     forced the evacuation of our French Quarter studio, the \n     broadcast seamlessly shifted to the Louisiana State \n     University Manship School of Mass Communications in Baton \n     Rouge, which WWL-TV had chosen as an alternative broadcast \n     site in early 2004. Half of the newsroom worked from that \n     location while the other half stayed in New Orleans and \n     worked from the station transmitter site. When it became \n     apparent that lack of city services would keep us out of our \n     undamaged station for an extended time, we rented the \n     Louisiana Public Broadcasting studios in Baton Rouge. Our \n     signal was carried by satellite to our New Orleans \n     transmitter.\n       WWL-TV informed viewers wherever they were. The commercial-\n     free programming was broadcast from our transmitter, \n     simulcast on radio, streamed on our website and seen \n     statewide on Louisiana's public broadcasting channel. \n     Satellite feeds of our coverage were rebroadcast by stations \n     from Texas to New England, and other areas housing evacuees.\n       Our parent company, Belo Corp., and its affiliated stations \n     provided major support. Corporate staff worked to provide \n     communications, housing, fuel, food and clothing for \n     displaced WWL-TV employees. Satellite News Gathering trucks \n     from Belo stations began moving in shortly after the storm \n     first entered the Gulf of Mexico. The stations also sent \n     news, production and technical staff to help as WWL covered \n     the storm of the century.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From KPLC-TV--Lake Charles, LA]\n\n                     (By General Manager Jim Serra)\n\n       KPLC's non-stop coverage of the approach, passage, and \n     aftermath of Hurricane Rita began several days before the \n     storm came ashore just south of Lake Charles and extended for \n     two weeks until the region was reopened to evacuees.\n       Throughout the storm, KPLC never lost its broadcast signal, \n     and maintained full coverage including live streaming video \n     on its website. Evacuated citizens of Southwest Louisiana, \n     even those who fled far from the station's broadcast signal, \n     never lost touch with local emergency information from their \n     community\n       Upon its approach, Rita was the strongest hurricane ever \n     recorded in the Gulf. Based on the anticipated threat of wind \n     damage and flooding, 25 KPLC employees rode out the hurricane \n     in a makeshift studio in the more secure confines of nearby \n     CHRISTUS-St. Patrick Hospital. Hospital employees became our \n     partners in the storm coverage.\n       After the hurricane, KPLC produced a DVD documentary on \n     Rita, donating nearly $50,000 in proceeds to the St. Patrick \n     Foundation. As a result of this partnership, CMN\n\n[[Page S5110]]\n\n     (Children's Miracle Network) awarded KPLC and St. Patrick \n     Hospital their national community service award.\n       KPLC's coverage was simulcast on multiple local radio \n     stations. It was also augmented by the efforts of several \n     television stations within Louisiana and beyond.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       [From WLOX-TV--Biloxi, MS]\n\n                    (By News Director Dave Vincent)\n\n       For more than 12 days, WLOX employees banded together & \n     provided exceptional coverage of Hurricane Katrina despite \n     personal danger & ultimately great personal loss. WLOX News \n     broadcast 24/7 for 12 days delivering life saving information \n     to the people of South Mississippi. Our news coverage went \n     wall to wall when it became apparent that Hurricane Katrina \n     would gravely impact South Mississippi. Katrina's winds & \n     deadly 30 foot plus tidal surge did not stop our coverage. \n     Neither did her massive path of destruction nor her impact on \n     our TV station. We continued to broadcast even when Katrina \n     ripped off our newsroom roof, destroyed another wing of our \n     station, toppled one of our TV towers, wiped out our Jackson \n     & Hancock County news bureaus & forced us in the main station \n     to evacuate to a safer section of our building.\n       There is no doubt that without the courageous action of \n     WLOX employees many more lives would have been lost in this, \n     the worst natural disaster to hit our county. In addition, we \n     have been told by many viewers that we were their only life \n     line during the height of the storm & in those first days \n     after Katrina, when our community was devastated & very much \n     like a third world country.\n       Here is an excerpt from one letter: ``During the storm we \n     ran our small generator a few hours a day. Your station was \n     the only one we could count on to have news when we could see \n     it. God Bless all of you for being there for all of us.'' \n     Scott and Lori Lasher of Carnes, Mississippi Sept 16, 2005.\n       Here is one other letter: ``First of all, I would like to \n     commend you on an AWESOME JOB!! Your coverage of Hurricane \n     Katrina and her aftermath was and continues to be superb! \n     Thanks for giving us here in South Mississippi some semblance \n     of normalcy during such a teffifying time.'' Doyla Ashe, \n     Poplarville, MS Sept., 16 2005.\n       During our coverage, we were the source of information for \n     our community. We told people where to find shelter, where to \n     find food & medicine & other needed supplies. To insure that \n     life saving information reached our community we reached out \n     to all the radio groups on the coast & they carried our \n     signal. Also the local newspaper contacted us & we put many \n     of their reporters on the air. The local FOX affiliate even \n     carried our signal for a few days. After Katrina knocked out \n     our ability to stream our continual coverage on our web site, \n     our sister stations in the Liberty chain took over the \n     postings & helped us keep thousands of evacuees informed \n     through wlox.com.\n       Hurricane Katrina left thousands of people homeless & \n     forever changed the face of our community. Our station is a \n     reflection of the community in which we live & work. At least \n     12 of our employees lost everything. Another 60 had \n     significant damage to their homes. Everyone suffered some \n     loss.

In Washington DC and \n     New York City, those challenges were especially difficult. \n     The nation had never been attacked on this scale at home. \n     Modern television journalists had a critical role in \n     communicating what had happened and what it meant.\n       As journalists in the nation's capital, our \n     responsibilities were two-fold: to report rapidly changing \n     developments amidst an uncertain and frightening environment, \n     and to keep the community and ourselves safe and informed.\n       The day of the initial attack was chaotic. Our ability to \n     provide crucial public safety information to the community \n     depended upon our access to key officials, locations and \n     events, along with the ability to be mobile when necessary.\n       Our efforts were severely hampered when our portable Nextel \n     radios, our cell phones, and our landline phones went down. \n     Newsroom decision makers were unable to communicate with \n     reporters and photographers for some time.\n       Our field teams were on site and on air for hours, \n     sometimes days at a time. In order to sustain that coverage, \n     we used couriers to shuttle food, water and supplies. Due to \n     road closures and other limitations, that task became \n     extremely difficult.\n       At every location, we were forced to provide several pieces \n     of identification, and at times were turned away from \n     critical places.\n       It is important to note that in a time of great chaos and \n     danger, our role as journalists contributes to the solution. \n     We cannot provide a service to the community without the \n     cooperation and support of governing jurisdictions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     With Power Out, Local Radio Station Becomes Voice in the Dark\n\n        (By John Curran, Associated Press Writer, Apr. 21, 2007)\n\n       Rutland, VT.--Some of them needed generators, others \n     kerosene. Some wanted to know how many others were in the \n     dark, or which streets were passable. Some just needed to \n     hear a voice.\n       ``This is Glendora,'' one caller said. ``I'm a little \n     nervous. The laundromat across my window here, the whole sign \n     just completely came out of its case off and is flying over \n     the street right now.''\n       The power was out, she told Terry Jaye, who was taking \n     calls on WJJR. Her house was shaking from the high winds and \n     it had no heat. She didn't know who else to call.\n       ``Only thing I have is my CD disc radio, listening to you \n     guys, and a cell phone,'' she said.\n       When a ferocious nor'easter blew chaos into Rutland last \n     Monday, she and others turned to WJJR. With the lights out, \n     televisions silenced and personal computers powerless, the \n     50,000-watt local radio station shucked its adult \n     contemporary music format and turned over its airwaves to \n     listeners, giving and getting information about problems big \n     and small.\n       It wasn't the first time local radio proved itself the go-\n     to medium in time of crisis.\n       It happened when ice storms ravaged northern New England in \n     1998, it happened when Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in \n     2005, it happened Monday after 70 mph winds from a nor'easter \n     blew chaos into this small Vermont city.\n       When the lights go out and Google is unavailable, radio is.\n       ``Part of it goes back to the technology,'' said former \n     radio news director Suzanne Goucher, president of the Maine \n     Association of Broadcasters. ``People aren't likely to have \n     battery-powered TVs in their home, but everybody's got a car \n     radio. What you're left with is the old reliable standby of \n     radio. It's always on and it's always on when you need it.''\n       It was on at 7:30 a.m. Monday, when the winds ripped into \n     town, snapping utility poles, blowing trees into houses and \n     collapsing power lines in the streets. Soon, the switchboard \n     at WJJR's studios in a downtown office building began \n     lighting up.\n       The calls came from New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.\n       Don called to say a front window in his Victorian home had \n     ``imploded.'' Michelle from West Rutland called to say she \n     had no power and no telephone service. Millie's power was \n     out, and her back yard was full of fallen trees.\n       ``It's horrible. It hit my ex-husband's car,'' she said.\n       ``A lot of women would be happy if it hit their ex-\n     husband's car,'' Jaye replied.\n       Some people called to pass on information about impassable \n     streets. One was looking for a pet hotel. Another warned \n     about the hazards of operating a generator indoors.\n       Jaye, 52, a veteran radio personality with a soothing voice \n     and the patience of a traffic cop, was in his element.\n       ``I had a lady call about a generator, which she needed for \n     her husband's oxygen tank,'' he said Tuesday, taking a break \n     from the microphone. ``A friend of hers called the next \n     morning to tell us that within 40 minutes of that call, a man \n     from Springfield was on his way to her house with a \n     generator. You hear stuff like that and go `How cool is \n     that?' ''\n       ``That's as important as it gets,'' he said.\n       The only breaks came when there were studio guests. Mayor \n     Christopher Louras, Fire Chief Robert Schlachter, police \n     Officer Tim Tuttle and utility company spokesman Steve \n     Costello all made appearances, eager to get word out about \n     the condition of the city and the severity of the outages.\n       ``We have 1,000 trees down,'' said Schlachter, asking \n     callers not to bother reporting downed trees that posed no \n     hazard. ``If it's against a car, or you see arcing and \n     sparking or someone in a car, let us know.''\n       All that day and into Tuesday, as utility crews raced to \n     address downed power lines and crippled substations, lines \n     remained open.\n       Sometimes, the information they got was erroneous, and \n     later corrected. Rutland Regional Medical Center was said to \n     be open only for emergencies; soon after, Jaye corrected \n     himself, saying anyone with an appointment there should go to \n     it,\n       And there were callers like the one from Forest Dale, who \n     lost power and reported winds howling ``like a train'' \n     outside his home but appreciated having someone on the air.\n       ``Boy, this is a real case for having radio stations that \n     are staffed by actual live people. Thanks to you guys for \n     getting into work and getting on the air,'' he told Jaye.\n       On Tuesday afternoon, WJJR started easing back into its \n     normal format, as power began returning to many of the 50,000 \n     homes and businesses in Rutland and elsewhere that had lost \n     it.\n       Brian Collamore, 56, of sister station WSYB, also worked \n     the impromptu storm-a-thon with Jaye and studio sidekick \n     Nanci Gordon. He called situations like it the reason he got \n     into radio in the first place.\n       ``Satellite radio can't do this. TV can't do this. The \n     Internet can't do this. When push comes to shove, and you're \n     in a situation like this, this is the only medium that can do \n     this,'' he said.\n\n[[Page S5111]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n            [From the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Oct. 16, 2006]\n\n2 Stations Take Real-Time Lead--KSSK Radio and KITV Become the Primary \n              Sources for the Latest News After the Quakes\n\n                          (By Gary C.W.

Perry and Larry \n     Price took over the microphones around 9 a.m., relieving on-\n     air personality Kathy Nakagawa and director of programming \n     Paul Wilson, who broke into recorded public-service \n     programming an hour earlier.\n       ``When it's something of this magnitude, it's Perry-and-\n     Price time,'' Nakagawa said.\n       With the help of their listener ``posse,'' the familiar duo \n     were the voices for the constantly flowing information, \n     staying on the air for most of the day. Nakagawa and Wilson \n     hung around to help. ``It feels great to be here,'' Nakagawa \n     said. ``Those two are such a reassuring presence, just \n     passing on the info to the public as we get it.''\n       ``Everyone's working well in crisis mode,'' Wilson said.\n       ``And everyone on staff that was needed came in on their \n     own,'' Nakagawa said.\n       ``I'm planning to stay put till the power is restored,'' \n     said Hawaii National Guard public relations officer Maj. \n     Chuck Anthony, who was at the KSSK studios. ``Coincidentally, \n     the Guard is on drill weekend, with about 5,000 at the ready \n     at duty stations and armories.

You dig out your transistor radio and \n     turn it on for the news.''\n       Regular morning newscaster Julia Norton-Dennis and \n     assistant Gina Garcia were busily screening phone calls in \n     the adjoining room to the on-air studio, occasionally typing \n     up messages to send to Perry and Price for their immediate \n     attention. Announcements about the cancellation and \n     postponement of scheduled events and airline flights, the \n     occasional emergency tip and the inevitable ``will there be \n     school tomorrow?'' were all taken care of on air.\n       Gov. Linda Lingle called the station around 1 p.m. for her \n     latest assessment of the disaster that struck especially \n     close to her, having stayed at the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel in \n     Kohala the previous night.\n       JUST AS KSSK was able to stream its audio on its Web site, \n     KITV was doing the same thing, albeit with the additional \n     help of its news staff and technicians.\n       KHON and KGMB were unable to stream their newscasts, \n     although they did broadcast newscasts and updates when power \n     was available.\n       KHNL/KFVE Internet coordinator Mike Strong said that with \n     the help of a fellow Raycom station in Tyler, Texas, they \n     were able to update information on its Web site and had set \n     up a Yahoo! address to have people send digital photos of \n     quake damage and information.\n       Photos were also sent to KITV, which inserted some of them \n     into the streaming newscast.\n       KITV General Manager Mike Rosenberg said that anchor Pamela \n     Young started it off around 8:15 a.m. from the update desk, \n     with Paula Akana and Shawn Ching joining later.\n       ``Coincidentally, we were in the process of doing emergency \n     continuity planning, in light of what happened to our sister \n     Hearst-Argyle-owned station in New Orleans after Hurricane \n     Katrina,'' said Rosenberg. ``We realized that even though \n     we're not on the air, we could start streaming our newscast \n     on the Internet.''\n       CNN's pipeline premium subscriber service even picked up \n     the KITV Webcast for further distribution on the Net.\n       Managing Editor Brent Suyama said that the station's site \n     would easily approach 1 million hits yesterday. ``I've \n     already received dozens of e-mails from people everywhere \n     thanking us for doing this.

It is one of the few trees left standing in \n     this neighborhood. An American flag flies from one of its \n     branches.\n       She still has moments when the tears come. This is one of \n     them. It is almost two weeks after the March 1 tornado, but \n     everything around her is a reminder of that terrible \n     afternoon.\n       ``I'll be glad when they knock this house down so I don't \n     have to see it anymore,'' she said.\n       But Black is alive. She doesn't know how long she spent in \n     the hall of her modest brick house. Sometimes, it feels like \n     seconds, sometimes, hours. What she does know is a television \n     weather alert saved her life along with the lives of most of \n     her family.\n       Black, her three grandchildren, younger sister and her son \n     were home watching television that afternoon when Dothan \n     television station WDHN interrupted programming for a special \n     weather bulletin. A tornado had been spotted on the ground in \n     Enterprise. Meteorologist Greg Dee warned residents.\n       ``I just remember him saying `Enterprise, take cover now,' \n     '' Black recalled.\n       Black and the others were in the living room at the front \n     of the house. She ordered everyone to the home's interior \n     hallway. She held the remote control in her hand and turned \n     up the volume as she backed into the hall.\n       At the same time, the twister was ravaging Enterprise High \n     School. Black's home sits across the street from the football \n     stadium. She and her husband bought the house last July, the \n     first house they ever bought together.\n       ``That's when the power went out and the roof blew off,'' \n     she said.\n       Black said she remembers reaching her arms around her \n     grandchildren, trying to protect them from flying glass and \n     other debris tossed into their home.\n       ``We were screaming, yelling and crying,'' Black said.\n       When the storm passed, much of the home was gone. The \n     interior hall, however, remained. Black said a fireman \n     responded almost immediately and took them to safety. \n     Everyone was fine, other than a few scrapes and minor cuts \n     from the glass. When she walked outside, something was \n     missing.\n       ``Where is our car-'' she asked.\n       The wind snatched the Black's 2005 Mazda Tribute and tossed \n     it into a back room of the house.\n       A few days later, a relative sent an e-mail to WDHN, \n     letting management know Dee's report spurred the family to \n     act.\n       Black and Dee met for the first time Tuesday at the \n     Henderson Street home. Black cried and her hands trembled as \n     she embraced Dee.\n       ``If it hadn't been for you, we would have been dead. I \n     know it,'' she said.\n       Dee walked through the destroyed home as Black showed him \n     where the family huddled to avoid the storm.\n       ``You talk about it on television, but when you see it \n     first-hand, it brings it home,'' Dee said. ``Just the fact we \n     were able to make a difference means something. When I got \n     that e-mail on my desk and read it, I just welled up.''\n       Workers will tear down what is left of Black's home soon, \n     but she plans to rebuild there.\n       ``No tornado is going to move us away,'' she said.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Smith and Ms. Collins):\n  S.J.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING FREEDOM OF WORSHIP.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the citizens of Israel \n     should be allowed, as a fundamental human right recognized by \n     the United States and United Nations General Assembly \n     resolution 181 of November 29, 1947, to worship freely and \n     according to their traditions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5112-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 171--MEMORIALIZING FALLEN FIREFIGHTERS BY LOWERING \nTHE UNITED STATES FLAG TO HALF-STAFF ON THE DAY OF THE NATIONAL FALLEN \n          FIREFIGHTER MEMORIAL SERVICE IN EMMITSBURG, MARYLAND\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Biden, Mr. McCain, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nCarper, and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 171\n\n       Whereas 1,100,000 men and women comprise the fire service \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas the fire service is considered one of the most \n     dangerous professions in the United States;\n       Whereas fire service personnel selflessly respond to over \n     22,500,000 emergency calls annually, without reservation and \n     with an unwavering commitment to the safety of their fellow \n     citizens;\n       Whereas fire service personnel are the first to respond to \n     an emergency, whether it involves a fire, medical emergency, \n     spill of hazardous materials, natural disaster, act of \n     terrorism, or transportation accident; and\n       Whereas approximately 100 fire service personnel die \n     annually in the line of duty: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That this year, the United States flags on all \n     Federal facilities should be lowered to half-staff on the day \n     of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service in \n     Emmitsburg, Maryland.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise to submit Senate Resolution 171 to \nmemorialize our country's fallen firefighters by lowering U.S. flags to \nhalf-staff each year on the day of National Fallen Firefighters \nMemorial Service.\n  As a co-chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, it is my \nhonor to sponsor the tribute to some of America's bravest and most \ndedicated public servants. I am pleased that Senators Biden, McCain, \nMikulski, Carper, and Dodd have joined me in sponsoring this \nresolution.\n  More than a million men and women work in the fire service in the \nUnited States. They respond to more than 22 million emergencies every \nyear, including not only fires, but accidents, medical emergencies, \nhazardous spills, and terror attacks.\n  And each year, about 100 of these brave firefighters die in the line \nof duty, often in circumstances too terrifying and agonizing for us to \nimagine. The sad toll in 2006 was 105 firefighters.\n  Recognizing the many dangers of our firefighters' profession and the \nessential public service that they selflessly provide, Congress has \ntaken practical steps to ensure that firefighters possess the equipment \nand other resources needed to safely fulfill their many missions. For \nexample, in 2001, Congress created the Assistance to Firefighters Grant \nProgram, otherwise known as the Fire Act Grants, which fire \ndepartments--including many in Maine--have used to buy much-needed \nequipment and to fund training, health, and fitness programs.\n\n  Congress has also taken symbolic steps to honor the brave \nfirefighters who have died in the line of duty. Under the leadership of \nour retired colleague senator Paul Sarbanes, Congress established the \nnon-profit National Fallen Firefighters Foundation to honor America's \nfallen firefighters and to support their families.\n  The Foundation maintains the official national memorial to fallen \nfirefighters in Emmitsburg, MD, and conducts an annual memorial weekend \nthat draws thousands of firefighters and the families from around the \ncountry.\n  The memorial weekend, begun in 1982, will be held this year October 5 \nthrough 7, including a memorial service on Sunday, October 7.\n  The resolution I submit today would provide another demonstration of \nour respect and appreciation for our fallen firefighters. It would \ndirect that flags on all Federal facilities would be lowered to half-\nstaff each year on the day of the memorial service.\n  Our firefighters risk their lives every day for their fellow \ncitizens. It is fitting that we offer this simple but richly symbolic \ntribute to all those firefighters who have given their lives in our \ndefense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/25/senate-section/article/S5112-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 172--COMMEMORATING THE 400TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                        SETTLEMENT OF JAMESTOWN\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Webb) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 172, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 172) commemorating the 400th \n     anniversary of the settlement of Jamestown.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in a few short weeks, America will \ncommemorate the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the \nfirst permanent English settlement in the New World. It is an event \nthat I, along with many of my fellow Virginians and Americans, have \nlooked upon with great anticipation.\n  Jamestown's anniversaries have always been major national patriotic \nevents, and this year will be no different. Visitors and dignitaries \nfrom all over the world will converge on the site, where, in 1607, CAP \nJohn Smith and his motley crew of Englishmen first stepped ashore to \nbegin life in the New World. Commemorating the Jamestown anniversary \nallows Americans to not only remember the bravery of Captain Smith's \ncrew and the founding of America but also to celebrate the democratic \nideals and institutions that trace their roots to that remarkable \nbeginning. The rule of law, the entrepreneurial spirit, representative \ngovernment, and cultural diversity all originated at Jamestown and all \ncontinue to have profound effects on America today.\n  To recognize the impact of Jamestown and to signal Congress's support \nfor the 400th anniversary of its founding, I introduce today this \nresolution. It marks the importance of Jamestown to our Nation's \nhistory and recognizes its 400th anniversary as a seminal event for the \nAmerican people. Furthermore, the resolution recognizes the critical \nrole Native Americans played in the colony's survival, notes the \ndemocratic ideals first instilled at Jamestown, and reflects on the \nunique confluence of cultures that made Jamestown strong and \nsuccessful. With this resolution, Congress has a chance to officially \nrecord for history its support for the commemoration of the 400th \nanniversary of the founding of Jamestown.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nresolution.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.
