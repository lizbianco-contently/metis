Mr. President, all across America this past weekend, and \neven this morning in schools, cafes, pool halls, I am sure, churches, \nsynagogues, military bases, and all offices, people are talking about \nthis war in Iraq. They are talking about President Bush's plan to \nescalate the war in Iraq--or ``augment,'' as the amendment of the \nSenator from Virginia talks about. But if you look in the dictionary, \n``augment'' and ``escalate'' have the same definition. So every place \nin America people are talking about Iraq--every place, that is, except \nin the Senate. I say that because in press conferences held, in \nstatements made by the Republican leader, they have stated there will \nbe no ability to proceed to the debate on this most important issue.\n  According to my counterpart, the Republican leader, the Republican \nSenators are going to say no and, he says, without exception. What does \nthis mean? That we are not going to be able to move to proceed to this \ndebate? What is more important than what we are trying to do here \ntoday; that is, move forward on a debate on Iraq? As I said, they are \ndoing it every other place in America. Why shouldn't we be able to do \nit here in the Senate? We learned on Friday--it was continued over the \nweekend--that the minority is going to do everything in its power to \nblock an Iraq vote. Are they so worried that a bipartisan majority of \nSenators might voice their opposition to this escalation; so worried \nthat these Senators are going to prevent any Iraq debate?\n  Remember, this is a very delicate time in the history of our country. \nNot only do we have the Iraq debate to worry about, but we also, \nbecause of the mess, frankly, that was left by the prior majorities in \nthe House and Senate, have no ability to fund this Government after \nFebruary 15. We have to do that. This has to be completed by a week \nfrom this Friday.\n\n  I received letters from Republican Senators. They are going to \nfilibuster the continuing resolution, which\n\n[[Page S1546]]\n\nmeans I have to move forward on this to keep the Government from \nshutting down. Our inability to go forward on the Iraq debate means we \nmay not have the Iraq debate. Remember, we have lost, already, several \ndays. We should be debating this right here today rather than having to \nvote at 4:30 on whether we can proceed on it.\n  What is the excuse--and I say excuse--that they are not going to let \nthe American people hear the Senate debate the escalation of the war in \nIraq? This claim--and I might say, it is a feeble claim--that they \nhaven't been guaranteed a vote on amendments is not credible. It is \nsimply not true. They have rejected, through their leader--they, the \nRepublicans--three compromises that would have permitted the Senate to \nvote on the President's plan. I have done this privately. I have done \nit publicly.\n  I offered to schedule an up-or-down vote on McCain--that is a \nresolution supporting the President's plan--and on the Warner-Levin \nresolution in opposition. That is votes up or down on these two \namendments. This offer was rejected.\n  We then offered the Republican leadership up-or-down votes on those \ntwo resolutions I just talked about and they had another one. The \nRepublican leader had another one. I read it. It is the Gregg \namendment. So we said let's go ahead and vote on that. I was turned \ndown there also.\n  I don't know what more we can do. I even went one step further and \nsaid we will hold supermajority votes, 60 votes, on Warner and on \nMcCain, two separate votes, 60 each. What more could we do? These were \nrejected. I have said this publicly, but I said it privately--and there \nwere all kinds of witnesses to my conversation with the Republican \nleader--the Republican leader obviously can't take ``yes'' for an \nanswer. They have been given all they asked. It is clear their actions \nare not driven by getting votes on Republican proposals, they are not \nbeing driven by getting votes on Republican proposals; they are driven \nby a desire to provide political cover.\n  The majority can't rubberstamp the President's policies on Iraq \nanymore so they decided to stamp out debate and let the actions in Iraq \nproceed unchecked. America deserves more than a filibuster on the \nPresident's flawed plan to add 48,000 troops to Iraq. It is not 21,000. \nThe war in Iraq has taken a great toll on our country. Well more than \n3,000 American soldiers have been killed, 24,000 or 25,000 of them \nwounded, a third of them missing eyes--head injuries. We have 2,000 who \nare missing limbs.\n  The war has strained our military. I have been told by leaders at the \nPentagon that we do not have a single Army unit that is nondeployed \nthat is battle ready.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator say that again, please?\n  Mr. REID. We do not have a single, nondeployed Army unit that is \nready to go to war. We have depleted our Treasury over $400 billion--\nsome say $500 billion.\n  Look at this. The Congressional Budget Office is a nonpartisan entity \nset up by this Congress. According to the Congressional Budget Office, \na surge of 21,500 combat troops really means up to 48,000 more troops \nwhen support personnel are counted. And, remember, the 3,180 American \nsoldiers who were killed were not all combat troops. They were \ntruckdrivers, they were working in commissaries, they were doing all \nkinds of things to support the combat troops.\n  So we are saying it is not 21,500, it is 48,000, and it is going to \ncost, this little surge, an additional $27 billion. If the President \nwants to escalate the conflict and send, according to CBO, 48,000 more \ntroops, given these costs alone--that is $27 billion in addition--it is \nimportant the Senators have an opportunity to vote up or down on \nescalation.\n  But it is even more important because there is widespread opposition \nin Congress and the country to the President's plan. Those we trust the \nmost do not believe escalation is the right way forward. America's \ngenerals don't support this. What does General Casey say? When he was \nin Iraq he said, I don't think this is going to work. General Abizaid \nsaid the same thing. Many others have told us the same thing.\n  More troops will not bring stability to Iraq. The Iraq Study Group \nsent this project in another direction. They made very different \nrecommendations. America's generals--of course, they do not support \nthis. The American people do not support the escalation. Look at any \npublic opinion poll--Democrats, Republicans, Independents. The \nPresident has heard from the Prime Minister of Iraq, al-Maliki, that he \ndoesn't want more troops in Baghdad; he wants American troops to leave \nBaghdad. He told the President that to his face. This is the message \nPresident Bush has heard from the generals, the people, the Iraq Study \nGroup, even the Iraq Prime Minister. Now the President should hear from \nCongress. But is he going to? Perhaps not. The President must hear from \nCongress that he stands alone. A loud bipartisan message from this body \nwill give him another opportunity to listen and to change course to a \nplan that gives our troops the best chance for success and gives the \ncountry of Iraq the best chance for stability.\n\n  Is there anyone who does not think this is an important debate? Is \nthere anyone who believes the Senate should remain silent on the most \npressing issue facing the country today? Unfortunately, the answer is \nyes. According to the Republican leader, all Republican Senators will \nvote not to proceed.\n  We are running out of time to find a new way forward in Iraq. That is \ncertainly clear. Americans and our troops have waited 4 years for the \nSenate to get off the sidelines on this issue. They shouldn't have to \nwait longer for a new direction in Iraq because the minority wants to \nprotect their politics at home.\n  We have seen politics in this war before. Politics gave us ``Mission \nAccomplished.'' Remember that? On the aircraft carrier, the President \ndressed in a flight suit said: The mission is accomplished; we have won \nin Iraq. Politics gave us the Vice President who said the insurgency \nwas in its last throes, and the President saying: There are insurgents? \nBring them on. Politics gave us a Vice President who promised America \nwe would be greeted as liberators. So we have had enough of this \npolitics for 4 years into this war--4 years.\n  What we need is a strategy that will succeed in Iraq, a strategy that \nis not an escalation. Last week, America's intelligence communities \nprovided their latest estimates of conditions on the ground in Iraq. \nThe picture they painted was bleak and was backed by events this past \nweek in Iraq. Every day, with rare exception, this is what we see out \nof Iraq: More than 200 people killed--more than 200 people. Hundreds \nand hundreds injured. It was a 2,000-pound bomb in a marketplace. The \nIraqi Interior Ministry, which has been very conservative, said last \nweek that at least 1,000 were killed in Iraq. Two million, it was \nreported over the weekend, have left Iraq--2 million Iraqis have left \nIraq.\n  We don't need the unclassified assessment of our intelligence \ncommunity to know things aren't going well in Iraq--and that is an \nunderstatement--that the present strategy has failed and there are only \nnonmilitary solutions to address Iraq's problems. That is why the \nmilitary surge makes no sense.\n  Again, the National Intelligence Estimate came out last week. It was \nmonths overdue, but it did come out. Here are some of the things it \ntalked about. This is from our own intelligence agencies:\n\n       Even if violence is diminished, Iraqi leaders will be hard-\n     pressed to achieve sustained political reconciliation in the \n     time frame of this estimate.\n\n  Listen to this next one:\n\n       Iraq has become a self-sustaining inter-sectarian struggle.\n\n  This is not Harry Reid. These are the finest, the people who are \ndoing their very best to make America safe. The National Intelligence \nEstimate:\n\n       The term ``civil war'' accurately describes key elements of \n     the Iraqi conflict, but does not adequately capture the \n     complexity of the conflict.\n\n  I have been saying, and the American people have been saying, for \nmonths this is a civil war. It is a civil war, but it is more than a \ncivil war.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate:\n\n       The involvement of these outside actors, Iran and Syria and \n     Iraq's neighbors, is not likely to be a major driver of \n     violence or the prospects for stability.\n\n  In effect, they are saying the President is now sending battle \ncarrier groups off the waters of Iran because\n\n[[Page S1547]]\n\nhe is trying to blame them for everything that is going on in Iraq. \nThat is not credible.\n  Am I saying Iran is the good guy on the block? Of course not. But \nlet's not say they are the cause of all the trouble in Iraq because \nthey are not.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate:\n\n       A number of identifiable developments could help to reverse \n     the negative trends driving Iraq's current trajectory. They \n     include, again, military solutions. Broader Sunni acceptance \n     of the current political structure and federalism, \n     significant concessions by the Shia and the Kurds, a bottom-\n     up approach, mend frayed relationships between tribal and \n     religious groups.\n\n  Mr. President, we need to work to come to a political solution for \nthe problems in Iraq.\n  Surging U.S. military forces is not a development that is going to \nhelp in Iraq. That is because there is no military solution. Military \nescalation would not end this conflict that is more complex than a \ncivil war. Military escalation would not make it easy for Iraqi leaders \nto achieve political reconciliation. Military escalation would not \nbring an end to Iraq's internal sectarian struggle.\n  Mr. President, as I said when I started, all over America today \npeople are talking about what is going on in Iraq--every place you want \nto talk about, whether it is the water cooler at the office or truck \ndrivers on their CBs talking back and forth to each other. It is in \nschools all over America, from elementary to college, talking about \nwhat is going on in Iraq. But in the Senate, are we going to have a \ndebate on it? We have been told ``no.''\n  The problems in Iraq are long term. Yet military escalation is a \nstrategy that is shortsighted. This is the message President Bush has \nheard from the generals, the people, the Iraqi Prime Minister, the Iraq \nStudy Group, and now he must hear from Congress. I hope this afternoon \nmy Republican colleagues will do what is right and allow this important \ndebate to go forward.\n  I don't know if the Republican leader wishes to be recognized, but I \nask unanimous consent that the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield to the minority leader, if he \nwishes to speak first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1547-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1547-S1548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IRAQ DEBATE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Illinois. Mr. President, this \nwhole discussion can best be described as a bump in the road. The \nmajority leader and I had a number of discussions last week about how \nto proceed with the Iraq debate. There is no reluctance on this side of \nthe aisle to have that debate. In fact, we had a number of different \nRepublicans who had different approaches to offer in anticipation of \nthe Iraq debate this week. We hear there are different approaches on \nthe Democratic side as well.\n\n  In an effort to reach a unanimous consent agreement, we pared down \nour requests to two resolutions, one by Senator McCain and Senator \nLieberman that basically embodied benchmarks for the Iraqi Government \nand one by Senator Gregg, a very important resolution that should be \nvoted on in the Senate that deals with the issue of whether the Senate \nbelieves we should cut off funds for the troops. This vote this \nafternoon should not be misunderstood. This is a fairness vote. This \nvote this afternoon is a vote to insist that the minority have a fair \nprocess in going forward to this very important debate. I think I am \nsafe to say every single Republican shares the view it is not \nrequesting too much of the majority to have a fair process. We could \nhave asked for many more than two resolutions. There were several other \nMembers of the Senate on this side of the aisle who had what they \nthought were good ideas that should have been put in the queue.\n  With regard to what the vote should be, this is the Senate. With the \nexception of the budget resolution, I can't think of anything in the \nSenate we have dealt with in my memory, except some kind of consent on \na noncontroversial matter, that didn't require a 60-vote threshold. \nThat is routine in the Senate. That is not extraordinary; that is \nordinary. So what could be done and should be done--and I hope will be \ndone sometime today--is the majority leader and myself will sit down \nand come up with a reasonable list of resolutions, all of them, as \neverything else in the Senate, subject to a 60-vote threshold. In fact, \nour good friends on the other side of the aisle in the previous \nCongress went to great lengths to establish that there even ought to be \na 60-vote threshold for judges, something that had not been the norm in \nthe Senate. So it looks to me like where we are today is that \neverything in the Senate requires 60 votes. Why would we not have a 60-\nvote threshold for the most important issue in the country right now: \nThe Iraq war? So, of course, we think it should be dealt with in the \nsame way that other issues are dealt with in the Senate.\n  So make no mistake about it. This vote at 5 o'clock doesn't have \nanything whatsoever to do with scuttling the Iraq debate. We welcome \nthe debate. We are happy to have it. But the minority will insist on \nfair treatment, and our definition of fair has been pared down to two \nresolutions. And all of the resolutions, as everything else we consider \nin the Senate, would be subject to a 60-vote threshold.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Fairness. You start throwing the 60-vote number around when \nyou have something to hide or you want to stall, and it appears that is \nthe case here. We have offered the Republicans an up-or-down vote on \nWarner, an up-or-down vote on McCain, and an up-or-down vote on the \nmatter relating to Senator Gregg. How much fairer could you be on that? \nWe have heard in this body from the Republicans for years now: Up-or-\ndown vote, up-or-down vote. We want an up-or-down vote.\n  That is what we want. Why should there be an arbitrary ruling by the \nminority that this take 60 votes as to how people feel about the Warner \namendment or the McCain amendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Isn't it true that any one Member of the Senate, just \none Member of the Senate could insist that there be a 60-vote threshold \non this issue?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, nearly everything we do in this body--and I \nwill be happy to respond to the distinguished Republican leader--nearly \neverything we do in this body is determined by unanimous consent. We \nhave matters that come before this body--and that is how we get here, \nis with unanimous consent. I can't imagine why there would be anyone \nwho would require 60 votes unless they didn't want us to go forward--\nunless they didn't want us to go forward. That obviously is the message \nwe are giving around the country. Look at any newspaper: ``GOP \nThreatens to Block Vote on Resolution.'' That, Mr. President, is USA \nToday. That is only one newspaper. They are all over America, the same \nthing.\n  This is an effort to stop. For every day we are not able to debate \nthe Iraq resolution means one less day, and maybe we would not be able \nto get to it because of the continuing resolution. As I said earlier, \nwe have been told by letters I received from Republicans that they are \ngoing to filibuster the continuing resolution. Today, starting today \nwhenever we came in--and we came in late because we knew we had this \nprocedural vote--we should have been debating Warner and McCain, but we \nare not. And now, if cloture is invoked, there is 30 hours after that \nbefore we can get to debating this and by then, frankly, it is too \nlate. We will not be able to do it because of the continuing \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me repeat my question. Isn't it true, I say to my \ngood friend, the majority leader, that any one Member of the Senate \ncould ensure that a matter has to receive 60 votes?\n  Mr. BYRD. Could do what, may I ask?\n  Mr. REID. Could ask for 60 votes. I say to my friend, hypothetically \nthat is true, but that is the way it is with many things in this body. \nBut that person would have to come forward, identify themselves, and \nstand up and say:\n\n[[Page S1548]]\n\nI do not want the debate on Iraq to go forward. This is a little \ndifficult to do with the situation where, as I said before, everybody \nin America wants this debate to go forward. So let's hear somebody on \nthe other side stand up, akin to a Senator who believes in something, \nand say: I don't want this debate to go forward.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say that there are many Members \non my side who would argue we should not be having this debate this \nweek at all. I hope none of those watching this on C-SPAN or any people \nin the gallery are confused. A 60-vote threshold is routine in the \nSenate. It is the ordinary, not the extraordinary. There was really \nonly one exception to that, and that was the consideration of judicial \nnominees. My good friends on the other side of the aisle spent an \nenormous amount of time in the last couple of years trying to establish \na 60-vote threshold for that as well.\n  There is nothing the minority is asking for that is in any way \nextraordinary, nothing extraordinary about it at all. It is really \nquite ordinary. We are prepared to have a debate on Iraq this week. We \nlook forward to having a debate on Iraq this week. What should happen \nis the distinguished majority leader and myself should agree, by \nconsent, to a reasonable number of resolutions. As I have indicated, \nsome of the Republican Senators have given up their opportunity to \noffer proposals in deference to my request that we narrow down the \nnumber of resolutions to a reasonable number for consideration this \nweek.\n  I hope that one of two things would happen: Either we vitiate the \nvote this afternoon because it is completely unnecessary or we will \ndefeat cloture and the majority leader and I, hopefully, will be able \nto sit down and reach agreement for a fair consideration of alternate \nproposals that could have been reached last Friday and I had hoped \nwould have been reached last Friday.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, keep in mind what I offered the minority: \nup-or-down votes on Warner and McCain; up-or-down vote on Judd Gregg. I \nalso offered a 60-vote on Warner and a 60-vote on McCain. That was also \nturned down.\n  This thing about 60 votes is exaggerated. I have been in the Senate \n25 years. I have been involved in two filibusters, and that is two more \nthan most anyone in the Senate has been involved in. Filibusters are \njust talk. Rarely are filibusters ever necessary or do they occur.\n  Therefore, this ``everything is 60 votes'' is simply not valid.\n  They want a fair process? Up-or-down vote on McCain, up-or-down vote \non Warner, up-or-down vote on Judd Gregg. Okay, don't want that? I tell \nyou what, this has been stated publicly and privately long before \ntoday: We will give you a 60-vote on Warner, we will give you a 60-vote \non McCain. Nope. Turned down.\n  Where does this fairness come in? Is fairness in the eye of the \nbeholder? They have to get everything they want? I cannot imagine how \nwe could be more fair. The American public would see a debate on \nWarner, see a debate on McCain. One is for the surge, one is against \nthe surge. Why not have that debate? There will be lots of other times \nto debate other issues dealing with Iraq. We have the September 11 \nrecommendation coming up; we have the supplemental coming up. Iraq is \nnot going to leave the Senate. But it will leave this Senate if we are \nnot allowed to proceed in this manner because--again I say that is \nbecause of bad housekeeping and the Republicans just simply leaving \ntown after they lost the majority--we have to pass a continuing \nresolution. We have to. We have no alternative. We have to start on \nthat by Wednesday.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, first, with regard to the 60-vote \nthreshold, the majority leader and I both praised the bipartisan \ncooperation we had in the Senate on both the ethics bill and the \nminimum wage bill, both of which had a 60-vote requirement. That \ndemonstrates how extraordinary 60-vote requirements are. These were two \nbills which were widely praised by both the majority leader and myself \nas examples of bipartisan cooperation.\n  I heard the majority leader say up-or-down votes on McCain and on \nWarner. If he would throw in the Gregg amendment for an up-or-down \nvote--I am sorry, what was his offer?\n  Mr. REID. My offer has always been an up-or-down vote on McCain, on \nWarner, on Judd Gregg, and the Democratic alternative which basically \nsays we are against the surge. It has always been the same. And the 60-\nvote would be on McCain and on Warner.\n  I would also say I appreciate my friend talking about the ethics in \nlobbying reform and the debate we had on minimum wage. However, I don't \nwant to start a battle that is already over. But one reason we were \nable to get those two bills passed--we thought stopping debate on these \nwas not the right thing to do. We spoke out loudly, and the American \npeople said: Let's get on with those two issues. They held it up for a \nlittle while but not for very long.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. A further illustration of how ordinary it is to get 60 \nvotes around here, there have been 9 cloture motions filed in this \nCongress alone, and we are now finally starting the second month. It is \nreally not in dispute that a 60-vote threshold is quite common around \nhere. It is ordinary rather than extraordinary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have offered 60 votes on McCain and \nWarner.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I understand he has offered 60 votes on McCain and \nWarner. The Gregg amendment is also important and would have to be \nincluded in any such negotiation which, hopefully, we will get back to \nhaving later today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1548-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be a period for the transaction of morning business until 4 p.m., \nwith Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, \nwith up to 60 minutes under the control of the Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, I inquire, at what point \ncan other Senators speak? I presume at the conclusion of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We have--\n  Mr. WARNER. Might I make that a unanimous consent, that I can be \nrecognized following the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for \n10 minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The order is first the assistant \nmajority leader gets 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. All right. That is fine. And I notice the presence of the \nassistant Republican leader, so I would want to accommodate the \nassistant Republican leader.\n  At some point, I am just asking, as a matter of courtesy, at what \ntime may I speak? The Senator from Maine, Senator Hagel--there are \nseveral Members who would like to speak. If the Chair could help us, \nrecognizing the leadership precedes.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is the order that has been previously entered?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no order in effect except \nfor Senator Durbin and Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could I then ask unanimous consent at the appropriate \ntime that the Senator from Virginia be recognized for 10 minutes, the \nSenator from Maine and the Senator from Nebraska for 10 minutes?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I believe if \nSenator Durbin and Senator Byrd speak before we get into the rest of \nthe lineup, I would like to have an opportunity to have at least 5 \nminutes to speak after Durbin and Byrd but then go forward with the \nunanimous consent request of Senator Warner for himself and others.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am not sure a unanimous consent has been propounded, \nbut\n\n[[Page S1549]]\n\nI would like to modify what is pending as follows: I have a hearing to \nchair at 3 o'clock. I have been allocated 10 minutes. I would like to \nuse 5 and give 5 to the Senator from New York and allow the other \nSenators--I have noted several Republican Senators who wish to speak \nfor whatever period the Senator from West Virginia would be prepared to \nwork out with them. He was kind enough to allow me 10 minutes, which I \nwill share with the Senator from New York if it meets with the approval \nof the Senate.\n  Let me defer to the Senator from West Virginia because I believe \nunder the existing order I have 10 minutes and he has 1 hour, if I am \nnot mistaken; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 60 minutes reserved for Senator \nByrd is not necessarily following your 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might inquire of the Chair, then, is the 60 minutes \nfor Senator Byrd reserved after morning business or during morning \nbusiness?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. During morning business.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I defer to the Senator from West Virginia because he made \nthe earlier request and was kind enough to yield 10 minutes my way, and \nI want to make sure he agrees with whatever we tend to think is a \nreasonable way to allocate time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I don't believe there is any order in place \nthat Senator Byrd would go next even though there was, I believe, an \norder that he have an hour as if in morning business; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. My only reservation, not wanting in any way to cut off any \nSenator, is that there be some flow of back-and-forth after the \ndistinguished whip has his time, along with Senator Schumer; that some \nof us be able to comment in response, perhaps; and that Senator Byrd, \ncertainly, get his time, but Senator Warner would also have an \nopportunity to get engaged in this lineup, and Senator Collins.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator from Mississippi propound a unanimous \nconsent request based on that so we can decide whether that would be an \nappropriate way to proceed?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \n10 minutes that has been allocated for Senator Durbin as he would see \nfit to use his time, that I have 10 minutes, to be followed by the time \nSenator Byrd has, to be followed by Senator Warner, an equal amount of \ntime as he would see fit.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what is the \nrequest?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe Senator Durbin would have 10 minutes as yielded \nby you, Senator Byrd, then I would have 10 minutes, to be followed by \nyour time that you have requested, to be followed by Senator Warner and \nothers as they would want to divide up that time. So we all would \nbasically have an equal amount of time to go forward, but after an \nestimated 20 minutes, you would have your time to go forward.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is that the order that has been established or is that the \nrequest?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is the request.\n  Mr. BYRD. But the order as established is what, may I ask the Chair?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no order established. We \nhave Senator Durbin who is recognized for 10 minutes. The Senator from \nWest Virginia has 60 minutes although there is no order established. In \nother words, it is not locked in that the Senator from West Virginia go \nimmediately after Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, what is the order?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi has \nproposed an order where he would give 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois, which I assume is 5 for the Senator from Illinois and 5 for \nthe Senator from New York, although it is 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not mean to be contentious, but what is \nthe order without the request?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The order without the request is \nSenator Durbin, from Illinois, is recognized for 10 minutes; then, \nfollowing that--but again, there is no sequence laid out specifically \nto what has been agreed to--following that, the Senator from West \nVirginia is to have 60 minutes.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Following that, if there is no sequence laid out, I would \nlike for my time to follow the Senator from Illinois, and then we can \ntalk about my time if Senators want some of it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, after Senator Durbin and perhaps Senator \nSchumer speak, my request was propounded on the basis that we try to go \nback and forth between the two parties and that I be allowed to have an \nequal amount of time in response to the remarks of Senator Durbin and \nthen go forward with an order that would put Senator Byrd next in \norder, to be followed by Senator Warner. I am just trying to establish \nsome fair flow back and forth.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, is there a previous order to \nthe effect that I have an hour?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. All right. The previous order is that I have an hour. When \nshould I have the hour under the previous order?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is what is trying to be worked \nout right now. Right now, the Chair asks the Senator from West Virginia \nif the Senator intends to use the full hour and if the Senator would \nlike it all in one block or if the Senator would prefer to break it up?\n  Mr. BYRD. I don't know yet, but I want the hour.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. In one block?\n  Mr. BYRD. I want the hour.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The full hour.\n  Mr. BYRD. An hour is a full hour.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Uninterrupted?\n  Mr. BYRD. As of now, I want the hour.\n  Mr. LOTT. Parliamentary inquiry: While there is an order that Senator \nByrd have an hour, it was not put in place at a particular time or to \nfollow in any particular order; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Is there objection to the request of the Senator from Mississippi?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. My objection as of this point----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If I could suggest, to speed this up, if instead of \ntaking the 5 minutes Senator Durbin was going to yield me, I would be \nhappy to defer and let Senator Lott speak for that 5 minutes, and after \nSenator Byrd finishes his remarks, I could speak my 5 minutes. That way \nwe would have an order, and Senator Byrd would not have to yield any \nmore time, and all of us would get to say whatever we wanted to say. I \nmake that a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, could then the three \ncolleagues I have mentioned--myself, Senator Collins, and Senator \nHagel--follow the distinguished Senator from New York?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have no problem with that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, before that, let me----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, had an order been previously entered for me \nto have an hour?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Let me read the order for a point of clarification. It says: Under \nthe previous order, there will be a period for the transaction of \nmorning business until 4 p.m., with Senators permitted to speak therein \nfor up to 10 minutes each, with up to 60 minutes under the control of \nthe Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd.\n  So it is in morning business, and the Senator from West Virginia has \n60 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. All right. I thank the Chair.\n  Let's proceed under the order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. And also, the next Senator to be \nrecognized is the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator from Illinois, all right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Chair yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S1550]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is there a record vote scheduled at 5:30 on the cloture \nmotion?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is a vote scheduled under a \nprevious unanimous consent at 5:30.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 10 \nminutes before that vote be equally divided between the majority and \nminority so that at 5:20 a person speaking--sorry. I withdraw that \nrequest.\n  Mr. President, as I understand it, I am recognized for 10 minutes at \nthis point?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. My intention is to yield 5 minutes to Senator Schumer. So \nI will begin at this point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1550-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1550-S1552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESOLUTIONS OF DISAPPROVAL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say, for those who have not \nfollowed this debate closely, I think we have made amazing progress \nuntil today--until today--because what happened before today was that \nwe were moving on a bipartisan track, a track of cooperation, so that \nthe Senate would exercise its responsibility and deliberate a topic \nthat is being debated today in Springfield, IL, and Little Rock, AR. \nThat is the war.\n  In an effort to reach this point, we have made accommodations. \nSenators Biden, Levin, and Hagel worked long and hard on a resolution \nof disapproval of the President's policy. They reported it from the \nForeign Relations Committee. Yet, we set that aside and said, in the \ninterest of comity, in the interest of fairness, we will gather behind \nSenator John Warner, the former chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, in a bipartisan fashion, and we will work together so we \nbring one resolution of disapproval to the floor.\n  Senator Warner was kind enough to make some modifications in that \nresolution, and we were prepared to proceed. We felt that was fair. \nThroughout this process, we have not been asserting the rights of the \nmajority. We have tried to work in a bipartisan fashion.\n  So now comes the moment of truth. Will the Senate, after all the \nsound and fury, finally have a debate? Now we are told by the \nRepublican side, no. We are told by the Republican side that because \nthey have several other amendments they want to have brought up, they \nwill stop any debate on the Warner resolution unless they have their \nway on the procedure.\n  I am troubled by this. If the Republicans in the Senate cannot \nswallow the thin soup of the Warner resolution, how will they ever \nstomach a real debate on the war in Iraq?\n  What we face now is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  It is important. It expresses the feeling of the Senate. But it is \nnot going to change the situation on the ground. The President will not \nbe held back from sending the troops that he wants to escalate the war, \nnor will there be any money moved from one place to another, nor any \nlimits on the troops, nor any of the changes that have been discussed.\n  What we started to do here was to have a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, a bipartisan resolution, introduced by Senator Warner on \nthe Republican side, as the basis for this debate. How much more good \nfaith could we show on the majority side? And yet now we find that the \nRepublicans have objected. We are witness to the spectacle of a White \nHouse and Republican Senators unwilling to even engage in a debate on a \nwar that claims at least one American life every day and $2.5 billion a \nweek.\n  As we debate the procedures, as we go back and forth, day by day, we \nlose more soldiers and spend more money. I am sorry there is no sense \nof urgency on both sides of the aisle to move this matter to debate \nquickly. If the Republicans want to stand by their President and his \npolicy, they should not run from this debate. If they believe we should \nsend thousands of our young soldiers into the maws of this wretched \ncivil war, they should at least have the courage to stand and defend \ntheir position.\n  One of their own on the Republican side, speaking before the Foreign \nRelations Committee, said he felt it was a matter of responsibility. He \nsaid: We are Senators, not shoe salesmen. I do not want to reflect \npoorly on entrepreneurs in America by referring to shoe salesmen in a \nderogatory way, but I would join in his remarks. If we cannot come \ntogether today and begin the debate on the single issue that is \nparamount in the minds of people across America, why are we here? What \nare we waiting for?\n\n  We have certainly tantalized them with the prospects of a debate. And \nnow to have the Republicans pull the rug out from under us at the last \nminute and say, no debate this week, well, they understand, as we do, \nthe continuing resolution is imminent. We have no time to wait. We have \nto move to it. And if they can slow us down and stall us for a few more \ndays, then the White House gets its way: no deliberation, no debate, no \nvote.\n  The final thing I will say is this: Some on the other side have \nargued this is a vote of no confidence in the President and the troops. \nThey could not be further from the truth. I cannot believe that Senator \nWarner, a man who has served his country so well in so many capacities, \nwould be party to a resolution which would express no confidence in the \ntroops of this Nation. I would not be. He would not either.\n  This resolution expresses our confidence and our faithfulness in \nthose men and women in uniform. Nor is it a vote of no confidence in \nthis President. Of course it is his policy. But what we should debate--\nand we will debate--is the policy itself, not the personalities \ninvolved. But for the Republicans, now in their minority status, to put \na stop to this debate is to try to put a stop to a debate that is going \non across America.\n  I will tell them this. They may succeed today, but they will not \nsucceed beyond today. There will be a debate on this war. It may not be \nthis week; it may not be this bill; it may not be this resolution. \nThere will be a debate because the American people made it clear in the \nlast election it is time for a new direction.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, no, no. I asked----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not mean to be discourteous to my \nleader. I understand he yielded the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was yielding the remaining time. I had 10 minutes, and \nI was yielding--how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  The Senator from Illinois had the floor, and he was going to give 5 \nminutes to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was yielding my remaining 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNew York.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding the \ntime. And I thank my good friend from West Virginia. I know he will \nhave a lot to say, and we will all listen to it with eager ears.\n  Mr. BYRD. And I am going to speak often. I do not speak often.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am sorry to delay that a few minutes and look forward \nto hearing it.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is all right.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, let's make no mistake about what is \nhappening today. The Republican side is afraid to debate even a \nnonbinding resolution as to whether this Senate supports an escalation. \nSimply put, this is a filibuster so that we cannot debate the war in \nIraq. Some on the other side will say, well, the word ``filibuster'' \nshould not be used. But that is exactly what is going on.\n  Some on the other side will say, well, Democrats filibustered judges. \nWe did. They said that. We were willing to stand by it. Are they \nwilling to stand by filibustering the war in Iraq? And let me say \nthis--let me say this--the lack of debate on this war in this Senate, \nin this administration, and in this country has led to the muddle, the \ndebacle we are now in, where 70 percent of the people do not support \nthis war. And most experts you talk to say: What is the strategy? We do \nnot seem to have one.\n  When General Shinseki, 3 years ago, said we needed more troops, there \nwas\n\n[[Page S1551]]\n\nno debate. When CIA agents and others said there were not weapons of \nmass destruction, they said we do not need debate. When this war \ndevolved from fighting terror and removing Saddam Hussein into a war \nthat was a civil war, with our young men and women policing the age-old \nhatred between the Shiites and the Sunnis, there was no debate.\n  That is why we are in the sad state we are right now. I fully support \nthe troops. And I understand the need of a President to lead, but \nwithout debate, debate that has been the hallmark of this country, not \nwords but a meeting of ideas, a meeting of disagreements so that the \nbest policy might emerge? That is what America is all about. And when \nit comes to war, it should be all about it more than any single other \nissue.\n  Every one of my colleagues who is willing to block off this debate \nright now, who will vote against cloture, is saying: I don't wish to \ndebate whether this escalation is the right thing. You can say the \ncommas are in the wrong place or the dots are in the wrong place. \nSenator Reid has offered both resolutions, the one by the Senator from \nArizona and the one by the Senator from Virginia, both Republican \nresolutions--an equal place under the Sun--yes or no.\n  The ability to obfuscate, the ability to shade, the ability to hide \nshould not be available here. Yes or no. Do you support this so-called \nsurge, this escalation, or do you not? I believe the election answered \nthat on behalf of the American people. They want their Senate to debate \nit. They would much rather have their Senator vote yes or no than not \nvote at all.\n  And here we are at this sorry moment. We are on the most important \nissue that has faced this Senate in quite a while. We are saying, at \nleast those on the other side of the aisle: No debate, no discussion.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues it is that lack of debate and that lack \nof discussion that led us into the situation we are in now, where this \nwar has dwindling support in this country, in this Senate, and even in \nIraq itself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. LOTT. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, all I am trying to do is get a chance to have a \ndiscussion on both sides of the aisle on the differing points of view \non what is occurring. I do not wish to cut off or delay Senator Byrd. \nBut my point is, if he does, in fact, use the next 50 minutes or an \nhour, we then will be out of morning business into the regular debate \nat 4 o'clock, without us ever having a chance to respond to the \ncomments made by Senator Durbin or Senator Schumer.\n  So I ask the Senator from West Virginia--and I address this question \nthrough the Chair--if he will allow me to proceed for 5 minutes so I \ncould respond to some of the comments that were made by my two \ncolleagues, Senator Durbin and Senator Schumer, and then go forward \nwith the time that was left.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the Senator wish me to yield at this point?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would ask, Mr. President, the Senator to yield for that \npurpose.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am a reasonable man, a reasonable Senator. \nI yield 5 minutes now, and without losing my right to the floor. I ask \nunanimous consent that I may do that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. And for clarification, the Senator----\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, if we can have one thing \nclarified. Under that time agreement, if we come to 4 o'clock, does \nthat eclipse the ability of the Senator from Virginia to speak, the \nSenator from Maine to speak, the Senator from Nebraska to speak? \nPerhaps the two Senators from Nebraska wish to speak.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator allow me to intervene here?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not intend to take 60 minutes. But I do \nnot want to waste 60 minutes before I start.\n  Mr. WARNER. I appreciate that. But the question before the Chair is, \nif we do not have time within that hour, are we then unable to speak?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will try to help if the Senator will let \nme get started.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. I know we can go to \nthe bank on your word.\n  I withdraw any objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator from West Virginia \nyield to the Senator from Mississippi? The Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized for up to 60 minutes or until 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. LOTT. Has the unanimous consent request the Senator propounded \nbeen confirmed?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair did not ask for that to \nbe confirmed and didn't ask for any objection. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, would the Senator allow me \nto ask unanimous consent that I be recognized following the conclusion \nof such time as the Senator from West Virginia takes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, we will proceed \nto the Senator from Virginia for a few minutes, 5 minutes, after----\n  Mr. WARNER. I would presume that I would have whatever time is \nbetween the conclusion of the Senator from West Virginia and 4 o'clock.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I intend to share it with other colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Virginia will be recognized after the Senator \nfrom West Virginia completes his remarks, and the Senator from West \nVirginia has given his first 5 minutes to the minority whip. Is there \nany objection to that? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. He \nhas proven once again his knowledge of how things proceed. But he also \nis fair in how he proceeds. I thank Senator Byrd for upholding the \ntradition that he feels so strongly about.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me get right to the point. This is all \nshow and tell. We know the Senate is ready to have a full debate on the \nquestion of how we proceed in Iraq. There are a number of resolutions \nthat have been suggested that are pending. We know our leaders are \ngoing to find a way to work this out. So why are we here taking all \nthis time to accuse each other of unfairness and trying to block and \ndelay? We don't want to do that. There is a way we can work this out \nwhere resolutions of different points of view can be offered. I don't \nknow what the magic number is. The leaders are going to work that out. \nBut to come to the floor and suggest that we don't want a full debate--\nthis is the Senate. We are going to have a full debate on this approach \nand a lot of others as we go forward----\n  Mr. BYRD. You bet.\n  Mr. LOTT [continuing]. Into the situation in Iraq. That is as it \nshould be. I want to make it clear, this is not an effort to block \ndebate. We could get an agreement, vitiate this vote this afternoon, \nand go right now into the debate. I think we ought to do that. What are \nthe numbers and what resolutions will actually be offered, our leaders \nare going to work out.\n  But I do want to say this, too: If we really want to get to the \ndebate about what is going to be the future there, we ought to be doing \nit in some way other than these nonbinding resolutions. This is a lot \nof sound and fury signifying nothing, so I question the whole process \nthat we are under. I don't mind going forward. In fact, I want to go \nforward and have a full debate about what is going on here.\n  I recently had occasion to be at a meeting with a number of world \nleaders, and the discussion went back and forth. Finally, it came down \nto this: What do we do in Iraq? Stay, leave, or what? Well, they said: \nNo, no, no, you can't leave. You have to stay. Then the question was, \nor then what? Well, they had no answer.\n  The President has been criticized for not coming forth with some \nchanges to change the status quo. He did. Now he is being criticized \nwith what he came\n\n[[Page S1552]]\n\nup with in this plan that we are going to be voting on later. I don't \nknow if it is perfect. I don't know if it will work. But I do know \nthis: he is the Commander in Chief.\n  We do need to change the dynamics there. We do need to go forward in \na way that will produce a positive result or decide what else we are \ngoing to do. That is what the Senate, in the minds of our forefathers, \nwas intended to do.\n  Let's stop questioning each other's motives or threatening to block \nthis, block that. Let's work this out. Let's have a full debate on this \nissue, beginning tonight, going forward tomorrow. I think everybody \nwill be satisfied with the results, once we actually get to some votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I now have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 56\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1552-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1552-S1554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MINE SAFETY\n\n  Mr BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the great labor leader--and I mean great labor \nleader--and legendary president of the United Mine Workers of America, \nJohn L. Lewis, pleaded the cause of America's working men and women, as \nhe said, ``not in the quavering tones of a feeble mendicant asking \nalms, but in the thundering voice of the captain of a mighty host, \ndemanding the rights to which free people, free men are entitled.''\n  This was the voice of a true coal miner. I know that voice. I grew up \nin the coalfields of southern West Virginia. My dad--not my father, my \ndad--Titus Dalton Byrd, was a coal miner. He belonged to the United \nMine Workers, then district 29, now district 17, local union 5771. My \ncoal miner dad worked in the coal mines with my father-in-law, my \nwife's father, Fred James. My wife's brother-in-law was killed by a \nslate fall in a coal mine. My wife's brother-in-law died of \npneumoconiosis, black lung.\n  I--yes, I--married a coal miner's daughter. You have heard the song \n``I'm a Coal Miner's Daughter.'' By whom? By Loretta Lynn.\n  I married a coal miner's daughter a long time ago. We were married \nwhen we were 19. She was 19; I was 19. That marriage lasted almost 69 \nyears, until her death. And today she is in heaven. She is in heaven. \nYes, she is in heaven today. I believe that.\n\n  Together, my wife Erma and I--mostly Erma--ran a grocery store, yes, \nin Sophia, WV. Our customers were coal miners for the most part. Our \nneighbors were coal miners. Our friends were coal miners and others, \nbut coal miners, surely.\n  Today my constituents in West Virginia, the core--certainly, the core \nin my viewpoint, but my constituents--includes coal miners. When I \nspeak about coal miners and their safety underground, I am speaking \nabout coal miners, my people, my family. I am speaking from the bottom \nof my soul when I speak about coal miners. It is a different breed of \npeople, coal miners. Yes, they would leave the open air and sunshine \nand go back into the bowels of the Earth to search for their brothers, \ntheir brother coal miners--Black or White, it doesn't make any \ndifference. They are all black when they come out of that mine. But \nthey are all coal miners. They are West Virginians. I am talking about \nmy constituents. I am speaking from the heart because that is the heart \nof my background, the coal miners.\n  I know what it is to stand at the mouth of a mine after an explosion. \nI know what it is to see the widows and the children who are left to \nshed their tears and to bury their loved ones. I know. I have helped to \ncarry coal miners who had died around the mountainside. Their coffins \nare very heavy. I am no big man, never was, but I have helped to carry \nthose coffins. And they are heavy, especially when we are walking on \nhillsides, yes. So I know what I am speaking about, and I am speaking \nfrom my heart. That is where I grew up. I expect to be buried there, \nyes, in the mountain soil of West Virginia.\n  The coal miner is proud--yes, you better believe it--of his \nprofession. He is patriotic in that he mines the coal that fuels the \nAmerican economy. You see those lights up there that are lighting this \nwonderful, beautiful Chamber of the Senate, the only Chamber of its \nkind in the world, the Senate, yes. The miner fuels those electric \nlights that surround this Chamber.\n  He, the coal miner, is religious in that he trusts in almighty God to \nkeep him safe in his dirty, dangerous job; and he trusts in that God to \nkeep and protect his family, while he, the coal miner, is away. He is \ncourageous--you better believe it--in that he goes underground every \nday, even though he is surrounded by life-threatening hazards; they are \noverhead. I have been in the mines. I was not a coal miner, but I was \nin there with my dad--not my father but my dad. I have been in those \nmines. I heard the timbers, the tree trunks holding up the tons and \ntons and tons of earth and rock overhead to keep those rocks from \ncrashing to the Earth and killing the miners. I could hear those \ntimbers cracking. When I was in there, I heard the timbers--these \ntrees, as they were. They are cut off, and they are 8, 10, 12, 15 feet, \nwhatever the height of the covering earth is from the floor there; they \nwere coming down. I heard them timbers cracking under that weight.\n  Coal miners provide so much for my country, for your country, for \ntheir country. And we--Robert Byrd, Senator Rockefeller, and other \nSenators and Members in the House--owe them, the coal miners, our best \nefforts in securing safer working conditions. Not as their alms but \ntheir right.\n  In 1977, the Congress passed--I was in this Senate in 1977--what is \narguably the toughest worker safety law in the history of the world, \nthe Federal Mine and Safety Health Act. I helped to write that law. I \nhelped to champion its enactment in the Congress of the United States. \nIt created the Mine Safety and Health Administration, MSHA, within the \nU.S. Department of Labor--MSHA, the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration, was in the Department of Labor--and the position of \nAssistant Secretary of Labor for Mine, Safety, and Health. I helped. I \nwas here.\n  The opening passages of the MINE Act tell us all we need to know \nabout what MSHA's priorities ought to be:\n\n       The first priority and concern of all in the coal or other \n     mining industry must be the health and safety of its most \n     precious resource: the miner, the coal miner.\n\n  In recent years, that obligation has been neglected. It has been \neroded by a Department of Labor that emphasizes so-called ``compliance \nassistance'' programs and has tried to recast its role as a technical \nconsultant to business rather than a protector of working men and \nwomen. Let me read that again. In recent years, that obligation has \nbeen neglected. It has been eroded by a Department of Labor that \nemphasizes so-called ``compliance assistance'' programs and has tried \nto recast its role as a technical consultant to business rather than a \nprotector of working men and women; namely, coal miners.\n  The Department's obligation to protect the safety of the coal miners \nhas been eroded by arbitrary spending targets that are designed to \nappease the White House Budget Office rather than ensure the safety of \nthe coal miners in the coal fields. These policies have fostered the \nhighest casualty rates in the coalfields in more than a decade. Forty-\nseven coal miners perished--died, dead--last year, half of them in West \nVirginia. In the opening days of 2006, our Nation mourned as 12 coal \nminers--yes, my darling wife was on her deathbed at that time in the \nopening days of 2006; that was last year. Our Nation mourned after a \n40-hour rescue effort was unable to save 12 miners at the Sago mine in \nUpshur County, WV. Our Nation watched with disbelief as an underground \nmine fire, days later, at the Aracoma Alma mine in Logan County, WV, \nkilled 2 more miners after another exhausting 40-hour rescue effort. \nThe disbelief--yes, the disbelief--soon turned to outrage as \ncongressional hearings and investigative news reports revealed an \natrocious safety record at the Sago and Alma mines. The Department of \nLabor had been lax in assessing penalties for repeat violations. When \npenalties were assessed, habitual violators were too often given minor \nslaps on the wrist or had their fines reduced or negated within the \nappeals process.\n  Congressional hearings revealed the Department of Labor had abandoned \nor\n\n[[Page S1553]]\n\nhad withdrawn countless safety standards prior to the Sago and Alma \ntragedies, leaving coal miners underground with outdated emergency \nbreathing and communications equipment. How would you like to be a coal \nminer in those conditions? Emergency preparedness and rescue training \nhad been allowed to fall by the wayside, as the safety of coal miners \nbecame a secondary concern to what? To rising corporate profits. Shame, \nshame. This is the lives of men and women underground, in the bowels of \nthe Earth.\n  The Department of Labor had allowed the Federal budget for mine \nsafety to be squeezed by lesser priorities, reducing the number of coal \nmine safety inspectors by 217 since January 2001. The Government \nAccountability Office--the General Accounting Office--had warned as \nearly as 2003 about the timeliness of inspections, and the Mine Safety \nand Health Administration, which was created to be an ever-vigilant \nadvocate for the safety of coal miners, had been failing in its duty. \nMine safety budgets and regulations had been allowed to erode at the \nSago mine.\n  MSHA could have required better communications. That alone might have \nsaved those miners. It could have mandated better emergency \npreparedness. It could have been more vigorous in its inspections and \nassessments of penalties. If MSHA, the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration, had used its authorities under the Mine Act to the \nfullest extent possible, those miners who perished at Sago and Alma \nmight have survived. They might have been alive today. Who knows.\n  Coal mining communities across Appalachia were outraged by these \nfindings, and they demanded action. They marched through the Halls of \nthe Congress carrying pictures of their husbands, their brothers, their \nsons who had perished in the coalfield.\n  In response, my illustrious colleague, Senator Jay Rockefeller, and \nI, along with the entire West Virginia delegation in the House of \nRepresentatives--two Democrats and one Republican--introduced mine \nsafety legislation to force the Department of Labor to act. The \nchairman and ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, Senators Mike Enzi and Ted Kennedy, rallied to our \ncause. Our offices began to craft, to shape, to write important and \nmuch needed mine safety legislation.\n  By the end of May--May, O May, when the flowers bloom--the Senate had \npassed legislation to add the first new safety requirements to the Mine \nAct since 1977. The MINER Act required additional oxygen. Oh, I can \nonly live with oxygen. You can only live with oxygen. You, Mr. \nPresident, can only live with oxygen. You can't live without it. No, I \nmean by that, without it, a few minutes. Oxygen. It has been around \nsince Adam and Eve inhabited the Garden of Eden.\n  The MINER Act required additional oxygen supplies underground. It \nrequired emergency wireless communications within 3 years. It required \nimprovements in emergency preparedness, rescue teams, and accident \nnotification.\n  Separately, I worked to secure $36 million in the fiscal year 2006 \nIraq supplemental for the Mine Safety and Health Administration, MSHA, \nto hire additional mine safety inspectors and for the National \nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, to expedite the \nintroduction of emergency breathing and communications equipment into \nthe coal mines.\n  Who am I? I am a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Yes, \nI am the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. So I worked \nto do that.\n  By June--the merry month of June--the Congress had passed the MINER \nAct and added $36 million to the Federal budget for mine safety. By the \nend of the summer, the Department of Labor had pledged, with the funds \nthat I, a coal miner's boy, had secured, to hire 170 new coal \ninspectors by the end of the fiscal year 2007. By the end of calendar \nyear 2006, the coal mining industry had at last focused on getting \nemergency communications and breathing equipment into the coal mines. \nThat's late, isn't it? By the end of the calendar year 2006, while coal \nmining has been going on for decades--yes, yes, back beyond the \nbeginning of the 20th century until now--by the end of the calendar \nyear 2006, the coal mining industry had at last focused on getting \nemergency communications equipment and breathing equipment into the \ncoal mines of America.\n  The question before the Congress now--do it here, do it now; do it \nhere, do it now. Have you heard that on the radio or TV? Do it here; do \nit now. The question before the Congress now is, what happens next?\n  We know that extensive oversight will be required by the Congress not \nonly to ensure that MSHA fulfills its duties under the MINER Act but \nalso to ensure that the coal operators meet their duties. So we know \nthat extensive oversight will be required by the Congress not only to \nensure that MSHA fulfills its duties under the MINER Act but also to \nensure that the coal operators meet their duties.\n  The House and Senate appropriations and authorizing committees have a \nsignificant role to play in this regard. We must do all--we must do \nall--that we can to ensure that the deadlines set by the MINER Act are \nmet. We must do all that we can to ensure that wireless communications \nare available to coal miners within the next 2\\1/2\\ years, after all \nthe many years that have gone before. If that means providing more \nfunds to NIOSH to expedite the development of wireless communications \nand tracking and prodding the industry along to purchase and install \nthat equipment, count on me. As the old Bible says: Here am I, send me. \nHere am I, send me.\n  We know also that several issues have not yet been addressed by the \nCongress from last year. The Congress has not yet addressed the issue \nof refuge chambers. The MINER Act required NIOSH to study the issue and \nreport back by the end of this year. About what? Refuge chambers.\n  The Congress must require MSHA and NIOSH to find a way to make refuge \nchambers. What does ``refuge'' mean? A place to go. Refuge chambers, a \nplace to go for refuge, for safety after an explosion. During the \nexplosion, that's a big wind, a big explosion.\n  The Congress has not yet addressed the issue of whether belt air \nshould be used to ventilate the working areas of underground mines--\nbelt air, a conveyor belt that comes along, a belt, a wide belt that \ncomes on rollers and comes into the mine.\n  Given how the use of belt air and inadequate safety precautions at \nAlma Mine resulted in the death of two coal miners last year, this is \nan issue that will not go away with yet another study and yet another \nreport to the Congress. The Department of Labor must reconsider the \nbelt air rule issued in 2004.\n  We know that the low level of penalties remains an ineffective \ndeterrent for too many coal operators. I am not against coal operators. \nWe have to have them. They invest money, their money. They invest \nmoney. We know the low level of penalties remains an ineffective \ndeterrent for too many coal operators. I know many of them personally. \nI like them. They like me, I think. Penalties are not commensurate with \nthe seriousness of violations.\n  The Department of Labor recently informed my office that the accident \nat the Jim Walters Resources Mine in Alabama that killed 13 miners in \n2001 will be punished with a fine as little as $5,000--$5,000. That is \ndisgusting. That is disgusting. It is clearly a signal to the Congress \nthat the penalty system demands further improvement.\n  Last October, MSHA issued its procedural instruction letter to revise \nthe structure for how penalties are assessed by its inspectors. That \nprocedural letter implemented the minimum penalty provision of the \nMINER Act. However, if higher fines are being assessed by inspectors \nbut continue to be reduced or negated within the appeals process, then \nMSHA's procedural letter is almost irrelevant.\n  How much time do I have remaining, may I ask the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 19 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we need to find a way to ensure that fair penalties \nare assessed by administrative law judges and the Mine Safety and \nHealth Review Commission within the appeals process.\n  We must continue to review and ask questions about the structure of \nmine rescue teams and the changes codified by the MINER Act last year. \nHere is\n\n[[Page S1554]]\n\nanother area where the rules issued by MSHA in recent years have \ncontradicted the intent and spirit of the 1977 Mine Act.\n  We must continue to probe whether enough has been done. Two deaths \nlast month in southern West Virginia serve as a macabre reminder that \nthe crisis in the coal fields is not yet over--will probably never be \nover--but we have got to work at it. It is not yet over. We must be \ninnovative. It is time for us to stop simply addressing mine disasters \nas they happen. We must seek opportunities to get ahead of the dangers. \nWe must use foresight as well as hindsight.\n  Last month, I met with the Assistant Secretary of Labor, Mine Safety \nand Health, Richard Stickler. Mr. Stickler is in his current position \nbecause of a recess appointment in October 2006. He has not been \nconfirmed by the Senate, and so his appointment will expire at the end \nof this year. I am hopeful that he will prove himself a friend of the \ncoal miner. He has a dedicated team at MSHA, which includes many former \ncoal miners who would like to see MSHA do better. I am convinced that \nmore can be done. The question is whether the Department of Labor and \nthe White House will let MSHA do what needs to be done. The Congress \nwill get some insight into that question as it reviews the President's \nbudget request for mine safety, which was delivered today.\n  As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and as a Senator \nwho will have some say about the Federal budget for mine safety, hear \nme when I say that the days of cheating the safety and well-being of \nour Nation's coal miners are over. The Senate Appropriations Committee \nwill examine the various mine safety accounts, and the Senate \nAppropriations Committee will make its recommendations to the Senate \nabout where improvements can be made. That process has already begun \nwith the inclusion of $13 million above--above, on top of, over--the \nPresident's request in the continuing resolution for the fiscal year \n2007 for MSHA to hire and train additional coal safety inspectors. I \nand other Senators have encouraged the President of the United States--\nhear me--to include additional funds to retain those inspectors in his \nmine safety budget request for the fiscal year 2008, and I am glad that \nthe President appears to have done so.\n  This is an issue that is close to my heart, and I pledge to do all \nthat I can to increase congressional oversight in the coal field. As a \nson of the coal fields, the Appalachian coal fields, as the son of a \ncoal miner, I am determined, yes, determined to be the ``captain of a \nmighty host demanding the rights to which free men''--free men--coal \nminers--``free men are entitled.'' And women. Free men and women are \nentitled.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my prepared speech.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say this to the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia. I have been privileged to be here but a small \nfraction of the time that he has, 29 years here and well over 40 for my \ncolleague from West Virginia, but in that period we have worked many \ntimes on behalf of coal miners.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. As the Presiding Officer recognized, my fellow colleague \nfrom Virginia, our States are joined.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Those mines have a great deal of comparability, those in \nVirginia and those in West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Joined at the hip.\n  Mr. WARNER. They are joined. The plight of the miners and their \nfamilies has been a subject that no Senator in the modern history of \nthis Senate has fought harder for than the senior senator from West \nVirginia, and very often you have involved me and my colleagues, \nwhoever they might be. I have served with three now, the distinguished \nHarry Byrd, Jr., whom you will recall, Senator Robb, and Senator Allen. \nAll of us have worked on this subject.\n  I hope to join you on this, and I hope the Presiding Officer, \nlikewise, will work on this subject of coal mine safety. So I thank my \nfriend.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished, the very distinguished senior \nsenator from the great State of Virginia. I thank him.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, and we will work \ntogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1554-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1554-S1555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IRAQ\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the cloture vote was very fully discussed \nby the distinguished Senator from Nevada and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky, with leadership and our ranking members, so I am \nconfident that somehow this matter can be worked out. I want you to \nknow, however, that I stand steadfast behind the content of a \nresolution I put together, along with Senator Ben Nelson, Senator Susan \nCollins, and some eight other cosponsors.\n  The question is how does the Senate bring it into focus under the \ncomplexity of our rules. I won't take the time to deal with that now, \nbut I would say to those following this debate that we stand, the \nSenators I mentioned, the two principal cosponsors and myself, firmly \nbehind this resolution, the content of which has been amended.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amended copy of the \nresolution be printed in the Record following my remarks, allowing \nready reference for those persons examining the Congressional Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. That resolution has been distorted and misunderstood in \nthe debate thus far. That is one of the reasons I am so anxious to \nproceed with this debate. I want to make clear, because it was \nmentioned that perhaps these resolutions were brought along for \npolitical cover, that on that issue each Senator has to speak for \nthemselves, but I assure my colleagues that this Senator from Virginia \nhas moved forward with my thoughts and my ideas in the best interest of \nthe country and the best interest of the men and women of the United \nStates military, and not for any political cover. Nor will I, in any \nway, impugn the motives of Senators whose opinions differ from mine.\n  This being my 29th year in the Senate, I have never, to my knowledge, \never intentionally, and I don't think indirectly, impugned the motive \nof any Senator for the position he or she has taken on a matter. We are \nall patriots. We are equal patriots. We all support the men and women \nof the Armed Forces. Let that be understood.\n\n  I firmly believe, as we are approaching this debate, that it is \nimperative that the Senate work its will, and work its will in the \nopen, on this issue which is so critical at this point in time in our \nmany years of involvement in the Iraq situation.\n  I solidly support the President in his view that we cannot accept \nfailure in getting a government, whether it is this one or an ensuing \ngovernment, in Iraq up and running and functioning such that it can \nseize the full range of sovereignty in this nation, and not let this \nnation implode, causing absolute disaster throughout the region. \nIndeed, certainly as it relates to energy and other issues, it could \nimpact severely on the rest of the world, not only in energy but in a \nsignal that the terrorists have won. We cannot let that happen. So \nlet's let the Senate work its will, and I think our colleagues here, \nthe distinguished leaders, will work out a procedure by which we will \ndo that. The comment was made, and understandably, that this is a \nnonbinding resolution. Nonbinding. Well, we have them in the history of \nthe Senate. At this time, this Senator is not voting for any cutoff of \nfunds. That is our one constitutional lever we can pull. As a matter of \nfact, in our resolution--I refer to our resolution as the one that I, \ntogether with Senator Ben Nelson and Senator Susan Collins of Maine \nhave put together--we specifically have included an iteration of the \nconcept advanced by our distinguished colleague Senator Gregg, which \nmay come before the Senate. We solidly support that concept of no \ncutoff of funds.\n  What do we do short of that? Well, we have a debate. Somehow you have \nto have some focal point, something written down, some document in \nwriting as to the ability of this institution, the Senate, to reach a \nconsensus, and a bipartisan consensus, on how best we go\n\n[[Page S1555]]\n\nforward with a new strategy in Iraq. That has been my motivation from \nthe very beginning, to put this institution on record on a bipartisan \nbasis. I am not talking about one or two Senators on that side joining \nall the Senators on this side or vice versa, no, a truly on its face \nbipartisan consensus, albeit a resolution without any legal force and \neffect.\n  It is important that the people of this country give their support to \nthe men and women in uniform and to a strategy which they hope will \nsucceed in our goal of not letting Iraq implode and fall into greater \ndisaster than it is experiencing today. So how do they go about it? The \nPresident, in his speech on January 10, explicitly said those who have \nother ideas, generally speaking, or concepts, bring them forward. That \nis what we have done. We have exercised what the President has given \nus, the option to come forward.\n  To quote the President: ``If Members,'' referring to Congress, ``have \nimprovements that can be made, we will make them,'' he said. ``If \ncircumstances change, we will adjust, showing flexibility,'' said the \nPresident.\n  Using that as our chart, we then proceeded as a group to figure out \nhow best to comment on the President's strategy. We did say, and I \nrepeat it, that the Senate disagrees with the plan to augment our \nforces by 21,500 and urge the President, instead, to consider all \noptions and alternatives for achieving the strategic goals set forth \nbelow. Each Senator has to interpret that phrase, that sentence, as he \nor she so desires. I repeat that. Each Senator has the right to look at \nthat and decide, one, do you disagree in any way with what the \nPresident is doing and the force of 21,500.\n  I believe we can accomplish the goals this country has set out to \naccomplish in Iraq, goals that were enumerated by the Baker-Hamilton \ncommission, in a manner that we do not need a full force of 21,500. \nIndeed, that force, we now learn, could be somewhat higher than that \nnumber if you are going to have the essential support troops joined. \nUnfortunately, there was no reference to that made in the President's \nspeech, and right now it is a matter of debate and contention.\n  I don't know what the additional figure is, but in my judgment, I say \nmost respectfully that we do not in this resolution in any way \nchallenge or contravene the constitutional provision that you are \nCommander in Chief and that you can deploy troops which, in your best \njudgment, are for the security of this Nation and the welfare of the \ntroops. We don't challenge that. We simply accept your offer, we have \nexpressed it, so we support it.\n  I support, for example, additional troops if they are necessary over \nand above the current level for operations in Al Anbar. On my last trip \nto that region, it was clear that the marines had enough troops to do \ncertain portions of their mission, but it was also clear that \nadditional forces were needed. Perhaps they could come from within the \ncurrent force structure currently in Iraq. But perhaps you need--to use \nthe word ``surge''--some modest surge to meet the requirements for Al-\nAnbar to be brought under a higher level of security.\n\n  Nothing in this resolution prohibits the President from having some \nportion of that surge force of 21,500 utilized to do those things which \nare essential--further training of the Iraqi forces, further embedding, \nenlarging the number of troops to be embedded with the Iraqi forces. \nThose are the sorts of things this Senator supports. Within the \nframework of this resolution, I can take those stands.\n  But I turn now to the principal thing we have in this resolution, and \nthat is one of the main things that I believe has to have greater \nemphasis. It is as follows. We state it very clearly in a provision in \nour resolution:\n\n       The United States military operations should, as much as \n     possible, be confined to these goals, which were enumerated \n     by the Baker-Hamilton Commission.\n\n  I go back and I read the goals here, all set forth on page 6 of the \nresolution. The military part of this strategy should: focus on \nmaintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq, denying international \nterrorists a safe haven, conducting counterterrorism operations, \npromoting regional stability, supporting Iraqi efforts to bring greater \nsecurity to Baghdad, and training and equipping Iraqi forces to take \nfull responsibility for their own security.\n  Therein is the principal motivation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wonder if I could ask unanimous consent that I could \nproceed until such time as Senators desiring to come forth and address \nthe standing order, namely----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have an order to lay down the motion to \nproceed. Will the Senator allow that to go forward at this time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine, if the Presiding Officer desires to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1555-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is dated as of January 27, 2007. It says, ``Transition \nIraq to Security Self-Reliance--Iraq Security Forces.''\n  It lays it out. This is what the American taxpayer has been \nexpending--an enormous sum of money for 2\\1/2\\ years to train the Iraqi \nforces. I bring to your attention, for the Ministry of Defense Forces: \nthe army, 132,700; air force, 900; the navy, 1,100; total, 134,700. \nMinistry of Interior, trained and equipped: police, 135,000; national \npolice, 24,400; other MOI forces, 28,900; total, 188,300. That is a \ntotal of 323,000 forces trained in the past 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  In the resolution my distinguished colleagues and I have put \ntogether, we specifically say look at all options. I say the Iraqi's \nare the ones who should be responsible for these problems in Baghdad. \nWe will give them support. We will give them the training. But I say to \nmy colleagues here in the Senate, this is what we have trained these \npeople to do. The Iraqi forces understand the language. They understand \nthe culture. How does an American GI, being thrust into the darkened \nalleys of this city, with all of the crossfire between the Sunni and \nthe Shia, and Shia upon Shia decide whom to shoot, how to direct the \nforce?\n  The National Intelligence Estimate just released made mention of \nthis. The report states--I shall read it.\n\n       The intelligence community judges that the term ``civil \n     war'' does not adequately capture the complexity of the \n     conflict in Iraq, which includes extensive Shia-on-Shia \n     violence, al-Qa'ida and Sunni insurgent attacks on Coalition \n     forces, and widespread criminally motivated violence. \n     Nonetheless, the term ``civil war'' accurately describes key \n     elements of the Iraqi conflict, including the hardening of \n     ethno-sectarian identities, a sea change in the character of \n     the violence, ethno-sectarian mobilization, and population \n     displacement.\n\n  I say most respectfully to our President: Mr. President, recognize \nwhat we have done in 2\\1/2\\ years to train these people. Let them take \nthe point. Let them take the brunt of the fight. And maybe we do not \nneed 21,500, together with support troops, to go in and do the job we \nhave trained these people to do themselves.\n  In this regard I would like to quote from T.E. Lawrence. This quote \nis also cited in the Army Field Manual on Counterinsurgency. Lawrence \nsaid:\n\n       Do not try to do too much with your own hands, better the \n     Arabs do it tolerably than you do it perfectly. It is their \n     war, and you are to help them, not to win it for them.\n\n  Additionally, the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq also \ndescribes a very complex conflict between all parties in Iraq. Putting \nAmerican soldiers in the midst of that will require military plans and \norders to contain exquisite tactical detail sufficient to afford our \nmen and women in uniform the ability to discern friend from foe in an \nurban environment.\n  I, and others, also remain very concerned about the command and \ncontrol structure that has been planned for this operation in Baghdad. \nIn his January 10, 2007, address to the Nation, President Bush stated \nthat U.S. troops would be ``embedded'' in Iraqi formations. This left a \nvery serious question about the unity of command. On February 1, \nGeneral Casey described the command and control as `` a nonstandard \narrangement.'' This nonstandard arrangement must be clarified and our \nresolution addresses this serious concern.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 7\n\n       Whereas we respect the Constitutional authorities given a \n     President in article II, section 2, which states that ``The \n     President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of \n     the United States''; it is not the intent of this resolution \n     to question or contravene such authority, but to accept the \n     offer to Congress made by the President on January 10, 2007, \n     that, ``if members have improvements that can be made, we \n     will make them. If circumstances change, we will adjust'';\n       Whereas the United States strategy and operations in Iraq \n     can only be sustained and achieved with support from the \n     American people and with a level of bipartisanship;\n       Whereas over 137,000 American military personnel are \n     currently serving in Iraq, like thousands of others since \n     March 2003, with the bravery and professionalism consistent \n     with the finest traditions of the United States Armed Forces, \n     and are deserving of the support of all Americans, which they \n     have strongly;\n       Whereas many American service personnel have lost their \n     lives, and many more have been wounded, in Iraq, and the \n     American people will always honor their sacrifices and honor \n     their families;\n       Whereas the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, including their \n     Reserve and National Guard organizations, together with \n     components of the other branches of the military, are under \n     enormous strain from multiple, extended deployments to Iraq \n     and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas these deployments, and those that will follow, will \n     have lasting impacts on the future recruiting, retention and \n     readiness of our Nation's all volunteer force;\n       Whereas in the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2006, the Congress stated that ``calendar year \n     2006 should be a period of significant transition to full \n     sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for \n     the security of a free and sovereign Iraq'';\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1723, \n     approved November 28, 2006, ``determin[ed] that the situation \n     in Iraq continues to constitute a threat to international \n     peace and security'';\n       Whereas Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating and ever-\n     widening problem of sectarian and intra-sectarian violence \n     based upon political distrust and cultural differences \n     between some Sunni and Shia Muslims;\n       Whereas Iraqis must reach political settlements in order to \n     achieve reconciliation, and the failure of the Iraqis to \n     reach such settlements to support a truly unified government \n     greatly contributes to the increasing violence in Iraq;\n       Whereas the responsibility for Iraq's internal security and \n     halting sectarian violence must rest primarily with the \n     Government of Iraq and Iraqi Security Forces;\n       Whereas U.S. Central Command Commander General John Abizaid \n     testified to Congress on November 15, 2006, ``I met with \n     every divisional commander, General Casey, the Corps \n     Commander, [and] General Dempsey. We all talked together. And \n     I said, in your professional opinion, if we were to bring in \n     more American troops now, does it add considerably to our \n     ability to achieve success in Iraq? And they all said no. And \n     the reason is, because we want the Iraqis to do more. It's \n     easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future'';\n       Whereas Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated on \n     November 27, 2006, that ``The crisis is political, and the \n     ones who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting \n     of innocents are the politicians'';\n       Whereas there is growing evidence that Iraqi public \n     sentiment opposes the continued U.S. troop presence in Iraq, \n     much less increasing the troop level;\n       Whereas, in the fall of 2006, leaders in the Administration \n     and Congress, as well as recognized experts in the private \n     sector, began to express concern that the situation in Iraq \n     was deteriorating and required a change in strategy; and, as \n     a consequence, the Administration began an intensive, \n     comprehensive review by all components of the Executive \n     Branch to devise a new strategy;\n       Whereas, in December 2006, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group \n     issued a valuable report, suggesting a comprehensive strategy \n     that includes ``new and enhanced diplomatic and political \n     efforts in Iraq and the region, and a change in the primary \n     mission of U.S. forces in Iraq that will enable the United \n     States to begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq \n     responsibly'';\n       Whereas, on January 10, 2007, following consultations with \n     the Iraqi Prime Minister, the President announced a new \n     strategy (hereinafter referred to as the ``plan''), which \n     consists of three basic elements: diplomatic, economic, and \n     military; the central component of the military element is an \n     augmentation of the present level of the U.S. military forces \n     through additional deployments of approximately 21,500 U.S. \n     military troops to Iraq;\n       Whereas, on January 10, 2007, the President said that the \n     ``Iraqi government will appoint a military commander and two \n     deputy commanders for their capital'' and that U.S. forces \n     will ``be embedded in their formations''; and in subsequent \n     testimony before the Armed Services Committee on January 25, \n     2007, by the retired former Vice Chief of the Army it was \n     learned that there will also be a comparable U.S. command in \n     Baghdad, and that this dual chain of command may be\n\n[[Page S1557]]\n\n     problematic because ``the Iraqis are going to be able to move \n     their forces around at times where we will disagree with that \n     movement'', and called for clarification;\n       Whereas this proposed level of troop augmentation far \n     exceeds the expectations of many of us as to the \n     reinforcements that would be necessary to implement the \n     various options for a new strategy, and led many members of \n     Congress to express outright opposition to augmenting our \n     troops by 21,500;\n       Whereas the Government of Iraq has promised repeatedly to \n     assume a greater share of security responsibilities, disband \n     militias, consider Constitutional amendments and enact laws \n     to reconcile sectarian differences, and improve the quality \n     of essential services for the Iraqi people; yet, despite \n     those promises, little has been achieved;\n       Whereas the President said on January 10, 2007, that ``I've \n     made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders \n     that America's commitment is not open-ended'' so as to dispel \n     the contrary impression that exists; and\n       Whereas the recommendations in this resolution should not \n     be interpreted as precipitating any immediate reduction in, \n     or withdrawal of, the present level of forces: Now, \n     therefore, be it--\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Senate disagrees with the ``plan'' to augment our \n     forces by 21,500, and urges the President instead to consider \n     all options and alternatives for achieving the strategic \n     goals set forth below;\n       (2) the Senate believes the United States should continue \n     vigorous operations in Anbar province, specifically for the \n     purpose of combating an insurgency, including elements \n     associated with the Al Qaeda movement, and denying terrorists \n     a safe haven;\n       (3) the Senate believes a failed state in Iraq would \n     present a threat to regional and world peace, and the long-\n     term security interests of the United States are best served \n     by an Iraq that can sustain, govern, and defend itself, and \n     serve as an ally in the war against extremists;\n       (4) the Congress should not take any action that will \n     endanger United States military forces in the field, \n     including the elimination or reduction of funds for troops in \n     the field, as such an action with respect to funding would \n     undermine their safety or harm their effectiveness in \n     pursuing their assigned missions;\n       (5) the primary objective of the overall U.S. strategy in \n     Iraq should be to encourage Iraqi leaders to make political \n     compromises that will foster reconciliation and strengthen \n     the unity government, ultimately leading to improvements in \n     the security situation;\n       (6) the military part of this strategy should focus on \n     maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq, denying \n     international terrorists a safe haven, conducting \n     counterterrorism operations, promoting regional stability, \n     supporting Iraqi efforts to bring greater security to \n     Baghdad, and training and equipping Iraqi forces to take full \n     responsibility for their own security;\n       (7) United States military operations should, as much as \n     possible, be confined to these goals, and should charge the \n     Iraqi military with the primary mission of combating \n     sectarian violence;\n       (8) the military Rules of Engagement for this plan should \n     reflect this delineation of responsibilities, and the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff should clarify the command and control arrangements in \n     Baghdad;\n       (9) the United States Government should transfer to the \n     Iraqi military, in an expeditious manner, such equipment as \n     is necessary;\n       (10) the United States Government should engage selected \n     nations in the Middle East to develop a regional, \n     internationally sponsored peace-and-reconciliation process \n     for Iraq;\n       (11) the Administration should provide regular updates to \n     the Congress, produced by the Commander of United States \n     Central Command and his subordinate commanders, about the \n     progress or lack of progress the Iraqis are making toward \n     this end; and\n       (12) our overall military, diplomatic, and economic \n     strategy should not be regarded as an ``open-ended'' or \n     unconditional commitment, but rather as a new strategy that \n     hereafter should be conditioned upon the Iraqi government's \n     meeting benchmarks that must be delineated in writing and \n     agreed to by the Iraqi Prime Minister. Such benchmarks should \n     include, but not be limited to, the deployment of that number \n     of additional Iraqi security forces as specified in the plan \n     in Baghdad, ensuring equitable distribution of the resources \n     of the Government of Iraq without regard to the sect or \n     ethnicity of recipients, enacting and implementing \n     legislation to ensure that the oil resources of Iraq benefit \n     Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other Iraqi citizens in \n     an equitable manner, and the authority of Iraqi commanders to \n     make tactical and operational decisions without political \n     intervention.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I state again for my \ncolleagues that this debate is not about support for the troops or \nsupport for their extraordinary work on the ground in Iraq. Our troops, \nthe best fighting force in the history of the world, have performed \nadmirably, honorably, and successfully under extreme and dangerous \nconditions in Iraq. We are not here today to besmirch their efforts, \ntheir work, or their sacrifice. To indicate otherwise is disingenuous \nand out of line.\n  This is not the time or the place for political attacks. The \nPresident even made an offer to Congress before a nationally televised \naudience on January 10 that, ``if Members have improvements that can be \nmade, we will make them.''\n  This is a debate about a serious topic: What is the way forward in \nIraq? How can we achieve a political solution without the additional \nloss of American lives?\n  One of my colleagues has said over and over, ``this comes down to if \nyou support an escalation or not'' and ``the American people deserve \nthis debate.'' For me, the question is, Will the Senate lead? Will the \nSenate express its opposition to the surge? I know many do not think \npassing a nonbinding resolution is leading, and I know others say the \nresolution goes too far. I say that, on an issue of this magnitude, an \nissue this important, it is critical for the Senate to speak with the \nstrongest voice possible. Generating a revised resolution with broader \nappeal was putting our best foot forward in securing the strongest \nbipartisan vote possible.\n  I am proud to have worked with my colleague, Senator Warner, the most \nrecent past chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and our \ncolleague, Senator Collins of Maine, in this cause. They have shown \ntremendous leadership on this issue, as have Senator Levin, Senator \nBiden, and Senator Hagel. But it seems that even when it comes to the \nlives of our troops, partisanship prevails. Here we are, after weeks of \nnegotiations, after weeks of public proclamations, after weeks of \nconsideration, about to witness the minority choose politics over \nprogress--and this is after we revised our original resolution to \naddress some of the concerns that were raised by both Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  It is important that we point out that this is not simply about being \nopposed to a surge. It is about opposition to a surge to do what? To go \ninto Baghdad? To go into the midst of sectarian violence, civil war, \ncriminality? There is no opposition to continuing to support troops in \nAl-Anbar and even an increase in the troops to fight the bad guys in \nthat location. But that is altogether different from going into Baghdad \nwhere our troops will be expected to be on the point and in harm's way \nin the midst of sectarian violence that is unparalleled across our \ngreat world today. But in strong support of Iraq, we must, in fact, do \nwhat we can to support Iraq but without putting our troops in the midst \nof that caldron.\n  The Baker-Hamilton report made things very clear. We have established \nbenchmarks as well--that we should empower the Iraqi Government to be \nable to do what it can to quell its own violence. We cannot win their \ncivil war. We cannot stop the violence in Baghdad. Only a political \nsolution achieved by the Iraqis will be able to do that.\n  If we are to do our duty, if we are to exhibit leadership, let us \nbegin by allowing a full debate on the resolutions we have pending. \nLet's talk about the President's plan to deploy American troops to the \ncrossroads of civil war in Iraq. Let's talk about holding the Iraqi \nGovernment accountable for its responsibilities.\n  I am prepared to defend the resolutions I have offered with Senators \nWarner, Collins, and Levin. I am prepared to vote on the McCain \nresolution. And I am prepared for the debate because its time has come.\n  I ask my colleagues, if not now, when? If not now, do we wait for \nmore troops to die before we oppose the President's plan? If not now, \ndo we wait for more violence, more unrest, more danger for our troops \nbefore we act? Some have said the President deserves one last chance to \nsucceed. How do we ask our troops to do again what has failed in the \npast? We have had other surges that have not succeeded for a variety of \nreasons, not the least of which is the Iraqis have not shown up. So \nwhat is different this time?\n  I hope we do not look at this as our last hurrah.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1558]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Florida, Mr. Nelson, be recognized after the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have a \nlist of speakers on our side, and I would ask to be recognized to ask \nif the Senator would revise his request that following Senator Reed, \nSenator Specter be recognized for 7\\1/2\\ minutes. Then if we can \nalternate sides, and on our side, then, it would be the Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Cornyn, for 7\\1/2\\ minutes; Senator Lieberman for 10 \nminutes; and then Senator Hagel, who would use the remainder of our \ntime, which I believe would be 8 more minutes. If we could revise the \nUC to reflect that order of speakers for our time, I would appreciate \nit.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, may I get in \nthe queue?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, might I suggest that while I speak an order \nbe established, and at the conclusion of my remarks I would again make \nthe unanimous consent for that order.\n  Mr. CORNYN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend Senator Warner, Senator Nelson, \nSenator Levin and others who have worked so hard on this resolution. I \ndo believe, like my colleagues, that this measure and an alternative \nmeasure deserve an up-or-down vote by the Senate. That is what the \nAmerican people want, and that is what they should receive.\n  We embarked on this effort in Iraq more than 4 years ago. From the \nvery beginning I thought this was not a response to an imminent threat \nto the United States or even to the region. It was based upon highly \nspeculative and, it turns out in many cases, flat wrong intelligence. \nIt represents, in my view, a flawed strategy because the approach the \nPresident has taken in Iraq fails to recognize that the major regional \nthreat was not Iraq but Iran and failed to recognize the huge amounts \nof resources that will be necessary to successfully occupy and \nstabilize a country the size of Iraq with the cultural and historical \nissues that are inherent in that country.\n  The strategy, as I said, I think was flawed. Strategy, to me, means \nhaving a clear objective and putting forth the resources necessary to \nachieve that objective. The objective in Iraq shifted from the WMD \nallegations, to terrorist connections allegations, to creating a \ntransformative oasis of democracy and free enterprise in a country that \nhas not seen that in many years. And the resources were never adequate \nfor the task.\n  One of the most important resources in a strategy is public support. \nI think one of the major problems with the President's last address a \nfew days ago when he talked about Iraq and his so-called new strategy \nis that, I believe, he squandered significantly the willingness of the \nAmerican public to support any proposal made. Without that public \nsupport, it will be very difficult to sustain our activities in Iraq.\n  I think the proof of this failed strategy is evident. Today Iran is \nin an enhanced strategic position vis-a-vis the United States and is \nbeing much more difficult to deal with, with respect to the region and \nto its aspirations of nuclear technology. We have compromised our \nefforts in Afghanistan and in Pakistan where real significant threats \nexist to the world and to the United States. We have diverted our \nattention from North Korea and from the Iranian aspirations for nuclear \ntechnology.\n  According to many experts such as Hank Crumpton, who is leaving as \nthe Assistant Secretary of State for Counterterrorism:\n\n       We have made it more likely this country will be struck by \n     terrorists, not less likely.\n\n  Of course, we can talk at length about the incompetent execution of \nthese policies in Iraq, but I want to go right to the heart of what the \nPresident is talking about. He suggests that we have a changed \nstrategy. I would suggest that perhaps we are changing our tactics; we \nare taking American units and putting them in the heart of Baghdad. But \nit seems that this surge is more of the same, more of the clear hold \nand build, more of involvement in the existing conflicts of the Iraqi \npeople and not essential to our national security, which would be to \nprotect ourselves from terrorists there, to stabilize the country so it \ndoesn't disintegrate, and also to go ahead and to train, continually \ntrain the Iraqi security forces.\n  Many have criticized this surge on purely military grounds. Too few \ntroops. The doctrine calls for more than 120,000 troops to cover the \ncity of Baghdad. We will be lucky to muster 50,000 to 60,000 to 70,000. \nIncluding Iraqi security forces.\n  There is a lack of unity of command. There is uncertain leadership by \nthe Iraqis. Their commanding general is a virtual unknown who has been \nplucked by Maliki to lead this effort, probably more for political \nreliability than for tactical skill. And the rolling start, the gradual \nbuildup has already led many Iraqis in Baghdad to suggest that our \nefforts have further compromised their security, as evidenced by the \nbombing just a few days ago of a marketplace in a Shia neighborhood in \nBaghdad.\n  The strategy we have to pursue is a complementary and reinforcing \nstrategy involving military, political, and economic steps, together \nwith regional and international diplomacy. It rests fundamentally on \nthe capacity of Iraq and non-DOD, nonuniform military advisers to carry \nthe day. Frankly, the Iraqi Government is in too many cases \ndysfunctional and incompetent, and elements outside of our uniformed \nmilitary personnel--our State Department officials, our Agriculture \nofficials, our Justice officials, our AID officials--have not been in \nIraq in sufficient numbers and in sufficient quality to deal decisively \nwith these issues. There is nothing in this plan which suggests that \nsituation will change.\n  I think we are also at a point where we have been informed by the \nNational Intelligence Estimate of the true nature of the struggle in \nIraq. It is a sectarian battle between Shia and Sunni, with insurgents \nwho, according to the NIE, accelerate the violence between these two \nsectarian groups. It is an existential battle where the Shias feel \ninsecure because they have labored for many years under the yoke of the \nSaddam Hussein regime, and they don't want to go back there. It is \nexistential from the Sunni position because they see themselves \nentitled to rule.\n  I think our best course is outlined in the Warner resolution, clearly \nstating our disapproval and disagreement with the augmentation as the \nresolution describes, and focusing ourselves on reconciliation, on both \nmilitary efforts, but scaled back, and also concentrating on diplomacy \nand economic activities. I would hope that at least we could get a vote \non it and, frankly, I think it will pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, is someone offering the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I believe under the previous UC, if I am \nnot mistaken, the Senator from Pennsylvania would be the next in our \nqueue on our side. If I may ask for clarification, the order that I \nbelieve was encompassed in the UC on our side was the Senator from \nPennsylvania, then the Senator from Texas, then Senator Lieberman, the \nSenator from Connecticut, and then Senator Hagel, the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I believe, again, the Senator suggested we \nwould alternate from side to side, and at the conclusion of--in fact, \nif I may, I have a unanimous consent stating that after Senator \nSpecter, I would suggest that from our side the order be Senator \nNelson, 5 minutes; Senator Biden, 10 minutes; Senator Levin, 10 \nminutes; and Senator Schumer, 5 minutes; and they would be alternating \nbetween the Republican side and the Democratic side, and the Republican \nside would be----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Texas modify his \nunanimous consent request to include the remarks and the proposal of \nthe Senator from Rhode Island?\n  Mr. CORNYN. That is correct. If I could, just in the interest of \nclarity, and I know this is confusing, Senator Specter will be \nallocated 7\\1/2\\ minutes, followed by myself for 7\\1/2\\ minutes, \nSenator Lieberman will be allocated 10 minutes, and then Senator Hagel, \n8 minutes, on our side.\n\n[[Page S1559]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot, I would like to have Senator Collins included for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we have 33 minutes total.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 31 minutes to dole \nout.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could Senator Collins be accommodated subsequent to the \nother names that have been enumerated, just to add her to the list, for \n10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is being counted now until 5:20.\n  Mr. WARNER. Very well. I will try and work with colleagues to see if \nwe can find time for Senator Collins on somebody else's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to oppose \ncloture on the pending motion to proceed on the issue of how to deal \nwith the Iraqi problem.\n  As I look at this issue, it is one of enormous magnitude, and it \nought not to be subject to shortcuts in the debate of the Senate. We \npride ourselves on being the world's greatest deliberative body, and \nnow is the time to show it. But what is happening on this motion for \ncloture and what is happening behind the scenes on negotiations is an \neffort to short-circuit debate on this matter of great importance, \ngreat magnitude. It is the issue which is engulfing the work of this \nbody, the work of the House, and, really, all of Washington, and many \nof the eyes of the world are focused on this issue. There is no oxygen \nleft in this town except on what to do on Iraq.\n  I suggest that this is not the kind of an issue where we ought to be \nshort-circuited. There ought to be a full opportunity to debate this \nissue and all of its ramifications. What is happening behind the scenes \nis an effort to limit the number of resolutions and/or bills which may \nbe offered as alternatives as to what the course of the United States \nought to be on this very important subject.\n  Although it is arcane and esoteric and not subject to being \nunderstood, what is happening, again, behind the scenes, is the threat \nby the majority to fill up the tree, and that means when a bill is on \nthe floor, if there is a first-degree amendment and a second-degree \namendment, both of which are technical in nature and both of which may \nbe offered by the majority leader because of the rule of priority of \nrecognition, nobody else can offer an amendment.\n  Now, the countersuggestion has been made that there would be two \namendments by the Republicans. That is down from five amendments, and \nit may be that even five are insufficient. As we debate this issue, \nother ideas may occur as to what ought to happen. But we are dealing \nwith very complex issues.\n  On this state of the record, I cannot support an additional \nallocation of 21,500 troops because it is my judgment that would not be \nmaterial or helpful in what is going on at the present time. This comes \nagainst the backdrop of extensive hearings in the Armed Services \nCommittee and Foreign Relations Committee, and in the context of the \nmilitary having given many estimates with many of those in key command \npositions saying that no more troops are necessary. This comes with the \nIraqi Prime Minister Maliki saying a variety of things but at some \ntimes saying he doesn't want any more troops.\n  This debate ought to be taking up alternative proposals, and the one \nwhich is the most attractive to this Senator on this state of the \nrecord and has been endorsed by a number of the military is to give \nnotice to the Iraqis that at some point in the future, with the exact \ntime to be determined by the military experts, perhaps 6 months or \nperhaps some other point, that the Iraqis will be called upon to take \nover Baghdad, the security of Baghdad, to keep U.S. troops out of the \nline of fire between the Sunnis and the Shias, and that our current \nforce would remain in Iraq to guard the infrastructure, to guard the \noil wells, to give advice and to give training but not to undertake the \nmajor responsibility.\n  The obvious answer ultimately has to be a diplomatic solution, and as \nlong as the Iraqis know that we are going to send in additional troops, \nthat we are going to take over the responsibilities which they should \nbe undertaking, they are going to sit back and let us do it. It is a \nmatter of human nature. If Uncle Sam will do it, why should the Iraqis \ndo it? But if we put them on notice that it is going to be their \nresponsibility at a given time, then that puts the obligation on them.\n  In the President's State of the Union speech, he was explicit that \nthe Iraqis had to do two things: No. 1, end the sectarian violence, \nand, no. 2, secure Baghdad. And on this state of the record there is no \nshowing that the Iraqis are capable of doing either.\n  It is my hope, as we listen to the Senators who have been engaged in \nthese hearings, who have studied the matter in some detail, and as we \nexplore the alternatives, explore the alternative resolution of putting \nbenchmarks that the Iraqis have to meet, when we explore the \nalternative of limiting funding--which I think there is unanimity we \ncannot limit funding at a time when American troops will be put in \nharm's way--this is the time for the Senate to assert congressional \nresponsibility, which we have.\n  When the President says repeatedly he is the ``decider,'' I say \nrespectfully to the President that is a shared responsibility. Under \nthe Constitution, the Congress has the authority to decide, to maintain \narmies. The Constitution specifically limited appropriations to 2 \nyears.\n  However, if we are to assert that responsibility and that support, it \nseems to me we have to do it in a way which does not limit our debate. \nRight now, we are under a tremendous time pressure, with only an hour \nand a half to debate this important matter, and Senators are looking \nfor more time. That is a very poor way for this Senate to approach this \nvery important subject.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, in November, General Abizaid \ntold our Senate Committee on Armed Services, when asked did he need any \nmore troops in Iraq, he said ``no.'' Admiral Fallon, who has been \nchosen by the administration to succeed General Abizaid, when asked did \nhe think by the Senate taking a position in opposition to the \nPresident's determination to put 21,000 new troops in Iraq that was \nundercutting the military forces in Iraq, Admiral Fallon deferred and \nwould not answer that, as some others had been quick to answer in the \naffirmative.\n  When General Casey was in front of our committee last week, when \nasked how many additional troops do you think should be put into \nBaghdad, he said two brigades--not the five brigades the President has \ndetermined.\n  What we have is a majority of Members in this Senate feel there \nshould not be any increase. We have General Casey, the commander for \nthe last 2\\1/2\\ years, saying there should only be a two-brigade \nincrease. So there is, in fact, conflicting opinion.\n  If we are going to have any increase in troops in Iraq, the Marine \ngenerals in Anbar Province have convinced this Senator that an increase \nin Anbar Province would be helpful, but the conclusion of this Senator \nwas that putting more American troops in the middle of Baghdad, in the \nmiddle of that sectarian violence, was not going to do any good; it was \ngoing to put more Americans in harm's way, particularly in the limited \nnumbers the President is talking about.\n  If we wish to make a difference in Baghdad in the midst of all that \nsectarian violence, where it has been going on for 1,327 years, since \nthe year 688 A.D., after the death of Mohammed, when the grandson was \nassassinated because he broke off and that became the Shiite branch and \nthe Sunnis and the Shiites have been at it ever since, if you want to \nmake a difference in Baghdad with all that sectarian strife, put in 50, \n100, 200 or 300,000 troops. But 21,000--17,000 of which are going into \nBaghdad additionally--in this Senator's opinion, is not going to do the \njob.\n  As the Senator from Virginia knows, this Senator is one of his \ncosponsors. I support his resolution. I think it is very important \nthere be truth and openness. In this Senator's position on\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\nthe Foreign Relations Committee, on the Senate Committee on Armed \nServices, and on the Intelligence Committee of the Senate, I have been \nhammering away at correct information over and over because what we \nhave been dished out over the last several years has been incorrect \ninformation.\n  That leads us to this point where we have to make a judgment. We are \na coequal branch. We are part of the formulation of policy, and it is \nintended that way by the U.S. Constitution that the people speak \nthrough us as well as through the President.\n  It is my privilege to say I support the Senator from Virginia in his \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 7\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as I try to count up the number of \npositions of Senators articulating either for or against the various \nresolutions, I count at least six, and maybe there are more.\n  There are some who say, yes, that the President's plan--basically, \nthat General Petraeus, the architect of that plan, will have \nresponsibility for implementing--that plan ought to get a chance.\n  Then there are those who say: No, we disagree with that plan. We do \nnot believe that General Petraeus should get the additional five \nbrigades that the plan calls for, but we do think in Anbar Province \nadditional troops ought to go in to fight al-Qaida in Iraq.\n  Then there is a third position I count that says we think there \nshouldn't be additional troops, and we want to cap the number of \ntroops, period, and we want to set a timetable for their withdrawal. \nThat would actually be No. 4.\n  Some of the distinguished Members of this Senate have said these \nnonbinding resolutions are shooting with blanks. What we ought to do is \nhave a vote on cutting off funds because that is the sole way that \nCongress can have a definitive impact on what is happening. We do not \nbelieve any funds should be appropriated for this effort. That is a \nfifth position, as I count it.\n  Then there are those--and I find myself in this group--who say: No, \nwe shouldn't cut off funds that support our troops during a time of \nwar. In fact, we ought to give this a chance.\n  Some of these positions may have some commonality and some may merge \nand diverge, but the point is, for the majority to say we have one vote \non one resolution, in spite of the fact there are at least six \npositions, as I count them, on this issue is asking Members to \naccept limited debate and does not reflect the diversity of views in \nthis Senate.\n\n  The vote we are going to have at 5:30 tonight--and I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia and others who, perhaps, share a \ndifferent view from me on the substance of the resolution, for \nsupporting our right to have a fair process and to have all the various \nresolutions or, I should say, at least two, in opposition that ought to \nbe offered, that Senators ought to be given the chance to vote for.\n  Senator Reid, the majority leader, on the floor earlier asked \nrhetorically: What makes the Baghdad security plan different from the \nones that have come before? Let me mention the specific answer to his \nquestion. First of all, this is an Iraqi-initiated plan for taking \ncontrol of the capital of Iraq. No. 2, there will be adequate forces--\nIraqis supported by American and coalition forces--to hold \nneighborhoods cleared of terrorist extremists. Third, there is a new \noperational concept, one devised not just to pursue terrorists and \nextremists but actually to secure the city once they are cleared. \nFourth, new rules of engagement will pursue that Iraqi and U.S. forces \ncan pursue lawbreakers, regardless of their communities or sect. Five, \nsecurity operations will be followed by economic assistance and \nreconstruction aid, including billions of dollars in Iraqi funds, \noffering jobs and the prospect for better lives.\n  The reason I support the plan General Petraeus is largely the \narchitect of, and the very same commander whom we have confirmed by \nunanimous vote about a week or so ago, is because I think it represents \nthe last best chance for success in Iraq. I don't know anyone who \nbelieves the status quo is acceptable.\n  The question is, Are we simply going to give up and see a regional \nconflict? Are we going to see ethnic cleansing occur? Are we going to \nsee countries that have Sunni majorities come to the aid of their Sunni \nbrothers and sisters who might be the subject of ethnic cleansing by \nthe Shia majority? Are we going to allow Iraq to become another failed \nstate which will then serve as a launching pad for future terrorist \nattacks, perhaps including against the United States? The risks of that \nhappening by doing nothing or by simply saying what we have been doing \nnow is not working so we are simply going to refuse to endorse any \nalternative plan because we are not sure it is going to be successful \nis giving up before we should.\n  While opinion polls should not govern our conduct, it is significant \nthe one question I have heard, when asked by Opinion Dynamics Poll on \nthe process we are engaged in today, the question was: Congress has \nbeen considering a nonbinding resolution expressing opposition to the \nPresident's plan to send more troops. By almost two to one, Americans \nthink passing a resolution would do more harm than good; 47 percent in \nthis poll that was reported February 1, 2007, say it is likely to \nencourage the enemy and hurt troop morale compared with 24 percent who \nthink it would make a positive difference to the policy of the United \nStates toward Iraq.\n  Regardless of the sincerely held beliefs that I know Senators have on \nthis very important topic, the last thing we should be forced to do \nwould be to vote on a single resolution when there are so many \ndifferent points of view that deserve full and fair debate on what is \nthe most important issue that conflicts our country and, literally, the \nworld at this time and that is the global war on terror, the central \nfront of that war in Iraq and what we are going to do about it, whether \nwe are going to give up or whether we are going to try to secure that \ncountry in a way that will allow it to govern and defend itself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we will hear a lot, today and this week, of \nphrases such as ``last best chance,'' ``refuse to endorse an \nalternative plan,'' ``Iraq is a central front of the war on terror.'' \nVirtually no one subscribes to any of those three points--all of the \nexperts who have given testimony, the Iraqi Study Group, the plans that \nhave been put forward that are real alternatives.\n  The President has not put forward a plan. He has put forward a \ntactic, a tactic that most experts, including his own military, think \nwill make a plan for success less likely to be able to be arrived at.\n  No one in this Senate, at least in this debate, at least from my \nperspective, is calling for us cutting and running--none of that. I \nhope we keep our eye focused, our eye on the ball.\n  The Senate is today taking a first step toward a bipartisan effort to \nprevent the escalation of a war in Iraq and to adapt a strategy for \nIraq for leaving Iraq without leaving behind chaos.\n  The first step is to debate and vote the resolution offered by \nSenator Warner and reintroduced by Senator Levin and me as a bill. That \nsays the Senate disagrees with the President's plan to send 17,500 more \nAmerican troops into the middle of a city of over 6.2 million people in \nthe midst of a civil war, because what we are afraid of is that the \nSenator from Texas may be right; this may make things so bad that \neveryone will conclude there is no more chance of succeeding.\n\n  We have vital interests in that region. I am afraid this policy, this \ntactic of the President, is going to be a self-fulfilling prophesy. The \nquestion before us today is whether a minority of Senators will even \nallow a debate to start. That is what this is about. All they have to \ndo--there will be other resolutions brought up; they are able to be \nbrought up--all they have to do is take issue with this. They can stop \nthe debate by getting 41 votes. But they can actually engage in debate \nand try to defeat the notion, when the message of this resolution is: \nMr. President, stop. No more escalation, Mr. President.\n  Everyone from the Iraq Study Group to the Biden-Gelb plan, to every \nother plan that has been put out there says the way to get the Iraqis \nto reach a political solution is to begin to draw\n\n[[Page S1561]]\n\ndown American forces. No one, including General Petraeus, whom I know \nfairly well, suggests there is a military answer. A political solution \nis required. So to my colleagues who are thinking about trying to block \nthe debate, let me say this: Iraq dominates our national life. It is on \nthe minds of tens of millions of Americans. It shapes the lives of \nhundreds of thousands of our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies. And that the Senate would not even debate, much less vote, on \nthe single most urgent issue of our time would be a total forfeiture of \nour responsibility.\n  We have a duty to debate and to vote on the President's tactic. We \nhave a duty to debate and vote on our overall strategy in Iraq. And we \nhave a duty as Senators to speak out and say where we are.\n  Three weeks ago, Secretary of State Rice came before the Foreign \nRelations Committee and presented the President's plan. Its main \nfeature is to send more troops, increase the total number of troops, \nand send them into Baghdad in the middle of a sectarian war.\n  The reaction on the committee, from Republicans to Democrats alike, \nranged from skepticism, to profound skepticism, to outright opposition. \nThat pretty much reflects the reaction all across the country.\n  So Senator Hagel joined me and Senator Lugar and Senator Snowe. We \nsat down and wrote a resolution to give Senators a way to vote what \ntheir voices were saying, for we believe the quickest and most \neffective way to get the President to change course is to demonstrate \nto him that his policy has little or no support across the board, \nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  After we introduced the resolution, the distinguished ranking member \nof the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, came forward with his \nresolution. The bottom line of the resolutions is the same: Mr. \nPresident, don't send more Americans into the middle of a civil war.\n  There was one critical difference. As originally written, the Warner \nresolution left open the possibility of increasing the overall number \nof troops in Iraq, when in fact the Iraq Study Group and others said we \nshould be declining to get action from the politicians in Iraq.\n  We believe that would have sent the wrong message. Not ramp up; \nagain, to draw down, redeploy forces remaining in Iraq. And the best \nway to make that clear to the Iraqi people is to let them know we are \nnot going to be there forever, as the President said. And they must \nbegin to make the hard compromises necessary for a political solution \nthat virtually everyone agrees is necessary to end this war.\n  So we approached Senator Warner to work out our differences, and I am \nvery pleased to say we succeeded in doing that. The language Senator \nWarner removed from his resolution removed the possibility that it \ncould be read as calling for a troop increase. With that change, we \nagreed to support his resolution. And I do.\n  When I first spoke out against the President's planned surge before \nthe New Year, I made it clear I had one objective: I hoped to build and \ndemonstrate bipartisan opposition to this plan because it was the \nfastest way to turn the President around. And that is exactly what we \nhave done.\n  Now we have a real opportunity for the Senate to speak clearly. Every \nSenator should be given a chance to vote on whether he or she approves \nor disapproves of the President's tactic to send more troops into the \nmiddle of a civil war.\n  The debate we will have is important, but the debate is as important \nas the vote. And I hope the American people carefully listen. I predict \nthey will hear very few colleagues stand up and support the President's \nplan to send more troops into the middle of a civil war. Listen to the \nvoices. Listen to the voices as well as the votes.\n  Just as important as what we are voting against is what we are voting \nfor. This bill, similar to the Biden-Hagel-Levin-Snowe provision, makes \nthree things clear.\n  First, Iraq needs a political settlement. Second, the United States \nhas to work with other regional powers. And third, the mission of our \nforces should be confined to counterterrorism, training, and \nmaintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes 55 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will continue, Mr. President.\n  As I said at the outset, this is the first step, this rejection of \nthe President's increase of more troops into Iraq into the middle of a \ncivil war. But it can set the foundation for everything that follows.\n  If the President does not listen to the majority of Congress and the \nmajority of the American people, we will have to look for other ways to \nturn this surge around.\n  Even if we succeed in this effort, we still need to turn our overall \npolicy around. We need a strategy that can produce a political \nsettlement in Iraq. That is the only way to stop the Shiites and the \nSunnis from killing each other and to allow our troops to leave Iraq at \nan appropriate time without trading a dictator for chaos.\n  But today my message is simple. The American people want us to debate \nIraq, the most important issue of our day. They expect it. They demand \nit. And if we attempt to hide behind procedure and delaying tactics, I \nbelieve the American people will not be very happy. They get it. The \nquestion is, Do we?\n  Are you for or against the President escalating this war in Iraq? I \nam against it. I believe the majority of Members on both sides are as \nwell. We should vote on that.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, America has reached a critical crossroad in the war \nin Iraq. More than 4 years ago, this Senate voted to authorize the use \nof force against Saddam Hussein, a tyrant who slaughtered his own \npeople, attacked his neighbors, and threatened our security.\n  Thanks to the courageous service of the men and women of the American \nmilitary, that evil regime was overthrown and in its place came hopes \nfor a democracy in the heart of the Middle East, hopes for a victory in \nthe war for the hearts and minds of the Muslim world.\n  As of today, sadly, as we all know, those hopes have not been \nrealized. Because of the ruthless conduct of our enemies in Iraq, as \nwell as our own failures, we instead today find ourselves on a knife's \nedge in Iraq.\n  Now a new course has been chosen. A new commander is in place in \nIraq, confirmed unanimously by this Senate. A new Secretary of Defense \nis in place at the Pentagon, also confirmed overwhelmingly by the \nSenate. And a new strategy has begun to be put into action on the \nground in Iraq by American troops.\n  It is altogether proper that we debate our policy in Iraq. It should \nbe a debate that is as serious as the situation in Iraq and that \nreflects the powers the Constitution gives to Congress in matters of \nwar.\n  But that, sadly, is not the debate that the Warner-Levin resolution \ninvites us to have. I am going to speak strongly against this \nresolution because I feel strongly about it. I do so with the greatest \nrespect for my colleagues who have offered it. But I believe its \npassage would compromise America's security, and I will say so within \nthe clearest terms I can muster.\n  The resolution before us, its sponsors concede, will not stop the new \nstrategy from going forward on the ground in Iraq. In fact, as we speak \nin the Senate, thousands of American troops are already there in \nBaghdad, with thousands more moving into position to carry out their \nCommander's orders. This resolution does nothing to alter those facts.\n  Instead, its sponsors say it will send a message of rebuke from this \nSenate to the President of the United States, from one end of \nPennsylvania Avenue to the other. But the President has made clear he \nwill not be deterred in carrying out what he sees as his duties and \nresponsibilities as Commander in Chief.\n  And there is a world well beyond Pennsylvania Avenue that is also \nwatching and listening to what we do. What we say is being heard in \nBaghdad by Iraqi political leaders, by moderates trying to decide \nwhether we Americans will stand with them over the long term.\n\n[[Page S1562]]\n\n  What we say is being heard by our men and women in uniform who \nnaturally will be interested in knowing whether we support the plan \nthey have been asked to carry out at risk to their own lives.\n  What we say in the Senate will be heard by the leaders of the \nthuggish regimes in Iran and Syria and by al-Qaida terrorists eager for \nevidence that America's will is breaking.\n  And what we say in the Senate will be heard across America by our \nconstituents who are wondering if their Congress is capable of serious \naction, not hollow posturing.\n  This resolution is not about Congress taking responsibility. It is \nthe opposite. This is a resolution of irresolution.\n  For the Senate to take up a symbolic vote of no confidence on the eve \nof a decisive battle is unprecedented. But it is not inconsequential. \nIt is an act which I fear will discourage our troops, hearten our \nenemies, and showcase our disunity. And that is why I will vote against \nthe motion for cloture.\n  My colleagues, if you believe that General Petraeus and his new \nstrategy have a reasonable chance of success in Iraq, then you should \nresolve to support him and his troops through the difficult days ahead \nand oppose this resolution.\n  On the other hand, if you believe this new strategy is flawed or that \nour cause is hopeless in Iraq, then you should put aside this \nresolution--nonbinding--and you should vote to stop what is happening \nin Iraq, vote to cut off the funds, vote for a binding time line for \nAmerican withdrawal.\n  If that is where your convictions lie, then have the courage of your \nconvictions to accept the consequences of your convictions. That would \nbe a resolution.\n  This nonbinding resolution before us, by contrast, is an accumulation \nof ambiguities and inconsistencies. It is at once for the war but also \nagainst the war. It pledges its support to the troops in the field but \nthen washes its hands of what they have been commanded to do. It urges \nmore troops be sent for Anbar Province but not for Baghdad.\n  My colleagues, we cannot have it both ways. We cannot vote full \nconfidence in General Petraeus but no confidence in the strategy he \nsays he needs for success.\n  We cannot say our troops have our full support but disavow their \nmission on the eve of battle. This is what happens when you try to wage \nwar by committee. And that is why the Constitution gave the authority \nof Commander in Chief to one person, the President.\n  Cynics may say this kind of irresolution happens all the time in \nCongress. In this case, however, they would be wrong. If it passed, \nthis resolution would be unique in American legislative history.\n  I asked the Library of Congress this question last week and was told \nthat never before, when American soldiers have been in harm's way, \nfighting and dying in a conflict Congress had voted to authorize, has \nCongress turned around and passed a nonbinding resolution such as this \none, disapproving of a particular battlefield strategy.\n  I ask each of my colleagues to stop for a moment and consider the \nprecedent that passage of this resolution would establish. Even during \nVietnam, even after the Tet Offensive, even after the invasion of \nCambodia, Congress did not take up a nonbinding resolution such as this \none.\n  Past Congresses certainly debated wars. They argued heatedly about \nthem. And they sometimes clashed directly with the executive branch, \nwith the President, over their execution. But in so doing, they \naccepted the consequences of their convictions\n  This resolution does no such thing. It is simply an expression of \nopinion. It does not pretend to have any substantive effect on policy \non the ground in Iraq. But again, I ask my colleagues, what will this \nresolution say to our soldiers? What will it say to our allies? What \nwill it say to our enemies?\n  We heard from General Petraeus during his confirmation hearing that \nwar is a battle of wills. Our enemies believe they are winning in Iraq \ntoday. They believe they can outlast us, that sooner or later we will \ntire of this grinding conflict and go home and leave the field in that \ncountry open for them. That is the lesson Osama bin Laden has told us, \nin his writings and statements, he took from our retreats from Lebanon \nand Somalia in the 1980s and 1990s. It is a belief at the core of the \ninsurgency in Iraq and at the core of the fanatical goals of radical \nIslam worldwide.\n  I fear this resolution before the Senate, by codifying our disunity, \nby disavowing the mission our troops are about to undertake, will \nconfirm our enemies' beliefs that America has grown impatient and \nunable to fight the long fight to victory. This resolution also sends a \nterrible message to our allies. Of course, I agree that we must hold \nthe Iraqi Government to account. That is exactly what the resolution \nSenator McCain and I and others have offered would do. But I ask you, \nimagine for a moment that you are a Sunni or Shia politician in Baghdad \nwho wants the violence to end, and ask yourself how the Warner-Levin \nresolution would affect your thinking, your calculations of risk, your \nwillingness to stand against the forces of extremism. Will the \nresolution empower you or will it undermine you? Will it make you feel \nsafer or will it make you feel you should hedge your bets, or go over \nto the extremists, or leave Iraq?\n  Finally, what is the message this resolution sends to our soldiers? I \nknow that every Member of the Senate supports our troops but actions \nhave consequences, often unintended.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be given an additional moment to \nfinish my statement. That would come from Senator McConnell's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. When we send a message of irresolution, it does not \nsupport our troops. When we renounce their mission, it does not support \nour troops. We heard recently in the Senate Armed Services Committee \nfrom GEN Jack Keane, a former chief of staff of the U.S. Army, who said \nof a resolution like this one:\n\n       It's just not helpful . . . What the enemy sees is an \n     erosion of the political and moral will of the American \n     people . . .\n       Our soldiers are Americans first. They clearly understand \n     there's a political process in this country that they clearly \n     support . . . But at the end of the day, they are going to go \n     out and do a tough mission, and I certainly would like to see \n     them supported in that mission as opposed to declaring \n     nonsupport. . . .\n\n  I agree. Everyone here knows the American people are frustrated about \nthe lack of progress in Iraq. Everyone here shares that frustration. \nAnd as elected representatives of the people, everyone here feels \npressure to give expression to that frustration. This is not a new \nchallenge. It is one that every democracy in every long war has had to \nconfront. Nearly a century and a half ago, an American President \nwrestled with just this problem. It was in the midst of a terrible war, \na civil war in which hundreds of thousands of Americans were fighting \nand dying to secure the freedom of millions long and cruelly denied it.\n  ``We here highly resolve,'' that was Lincoln's message at Gettysburg. \nIt was a message of resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional moment from the time of \nSenator McConnell to finish the statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Lincoln said at Gettysburg: ``We here highly \nresolve.'' It was a message of resolution, of steadfastness in the face \nof adversity, of hope over despair, and of confidence in the cause of \nfreedom which is America's eternal cause. Today, in the depths of a \nterrible war, on the brink of a decisive battle for Baghdad, let us \nhave a serious debate about where we stand and where we must go in \nIraq. But that is not the debate this resolution of irresolution would \nbring.\n  The 60-vote requirement to close debate was put in place by our \npredecessors as a way to make it harder for the passions of a \nparticular moment to sweep through the American people and across this \nCongress in a way that would do serious damage to our Nation in the \nlong term. Because I believe this resolution, if passed, would have \nsuch an effect, I will respectfully oppose the motion for cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I believe Senator Hagel is----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Virginia 1 \nminute\n\n[[Page S1563]]\n\nto ask a question of the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader has the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield the floor, if the understanding is \nthat the Senator from Michigan is next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is next for 10 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  My question to my good friend and colleague is as follows: This \ndebate is well under way. The plans are being discussed. I just \ninquired at the desk, and the McCain resolution is not filed. Yet I \nunderstood you to say it had been filed. Could you help clarify for the \nSenate the position on that?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would be happy to, briefly. The resolution Senator \nMcCain and I and others have has been prepared and I gather has been \nthe subject of negotiation between Senator Reid and Senator McConnell.\n  Mr. WARNER. But it is not a part of the record so----\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is right. The debate going on now----\n  Mr. WARNER. I feel very strongly that the Senate should work its will \non facts that are out in the open. I have filed my resolutions, one \nafter the other, at the desk so all Senators could have the benefit. Is \nthat a possibility, that we could have the benefit of this resolution?\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. My dear friend, it is more than a possibility; it is a \npromise.\n  Mr. WARNER. And what time might the promise be executed?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. There are copies of it around now, and we will get you \none. They were publicly distributed Thursday of last week.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will be glad to give you my copy, but I feel it is \npresumptuous of me to address it unless it is properly before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend. The difference, of course, is that \nours is as nonbinding as yours, but ours is a statement of support to \nour troops and benchmarks to the Iraqis.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, clearly what is read is correct. But I \nassure you that I forcefully argue that ours is in support of the \ntroops. There is no suggestion that one is less patriotic than the \nother, if I may say to my dear friend.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. One is not less patriotic than the other, but actions \nhave consequences. As I said during my remarks, for the Senate to take \nthis unprecedented action on a nonbinding resolution, to disavow, \ndisapprove a mission that our troops are being asked to carry out right \nnow cannot help their morale.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I hope the Senate will be allowed to \ndebate our policy in Iraq by proceeding to this legislation this \nafternoon. Iraq is the single most important policy issue facing our \ncountry. It was a major issue in the November elections last fall. The \nAmerican people have strong opinions about what is happening in Iraq. \nThey want their elected officials to debate this issue, and we should \ndo it. The debate should go forward. A filibuster is out of place on \nwar and peace issues, on something of this magnitude. The debate is not \nabout whether we want the United States to act to maximize chances of \nsuccess in Iraq. We all want to maximize chances of success in Iraq. We \nall want to see a stable Iraq which enhances our own national security. \nBut the President's course of action, which he has been on for 3\\1/2\\ \nyears and which he has now proposed to continue on to deepen our \ninvolvement in Iraq, does not enhance our security. It does not \nmaximize chances of success in Iraq.\n  The debate is about the best way to maximize chances of success in \nIraq. Is the new strategy of the President, which puts over 21,000 more \nAmerican troops in the middle of an Iraqi civil war, the best way to \nbring that about? That is what this debate is about. There actually \nseems to be an agreement among most observers that an Iraqi political \nsettlement is the key to ending the violence in Iraq. The difference of \nopinion exists on whether Iraqi politicians need breathing space, as \nPresident Bush has said, to reach required political compromises or \nwhether, as many of us believe, Iraqi politicians need to be pressured \nto make those compromises and that the addition of 21,000 more troops \ndoesn't make a political compromise more likely; it just gets us in \ndeeper in the middle of a civil conflict.\n  The bill we are hoping to proceed to today incorporates the modified \nWarner resolution verbatim, except for a minor change in order to make \nit a bill instead of a resolution. The reason for making it a bill \ninstead of a resolution is simply to make it more amendable. Unlike a \nresolution, which is clumsy to amend, there is no intent to put this \nmodified Warner language in the form of a bill for any other purpose. \nAs a matter of fact, the majority leader has asked for unanimous \nconsent to treat a resolution with Senator Warner's language as \namendable, as though it were a bill, to achieve the goal we are trying \nto achieve. This unanimous consent was objected to by the Republican \nleader.\n  The majority leader, Senator Reid, has also told Senator McConnell \nthat we are more than willing to transform this bill into a resolution \nprior to final passage, if we can get to final passage, if a filibuster \ndoes not thwart our getting to final passage.\n  What does the modified Warner language do which is incorporated into \nthis bill? It makes it clear the Congress disagrees with the \nPresident's plan to increase force levels and urges the President \ninstead to consider all options and alternatives. This bill makes it \nclear that we will fund troops in the field. There is no difference \nbetween these two documents in that regard. Both our bill and the \nMcCain resolution make it clear we want to fund the troops in the \nfield. Our bill makes it clear that the responsibility for Iraq's \ninternal security and for halting sectarian violence must rest \nprimarily with the Government of Iraq and Iraqi security forces. It \nmakes it clear that Iraqis must reach political settlements in order to \nachieve reconciliation, and the failure of the Iraqis to reach such \nsettlements to create a truly unified government contributes to \nincreasing violence in Iraq.\n  Our bill makes it clear that the primary objective of the overall \nUnited States strategy in Iraq should be to encourage Iraqi leaders to \nmake political compromises that will foster reconciliation and \nestablish a true unity government, ultimately leading to improvements \nin the security situation.\n  Adding American troops does not increase the probability of achieving \nthe primary objective. Listen to what GEN John Abizaid said when he \ntestified to Congress in November of last year:\n\n       I met with every divisional commander, General Casey, the \n     Corps Commander, [and] General Dempsey. We all talked \n     together. And I said to them, in your professional opinion, \n     if we were to bring in more American troops now, does it add \n     considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq? And \n     they all said no. And the reason is, because we want the \n     Iraqis to do more. It's easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us \n     to do this work.\n\n  Finally, General Abizaid said:\n\n       I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, [prevent the Iraqis] from taking more \n     responsibility for their own future.\n\n  Besides making it less likely that the Iraqis will take more \nresponsibility for their own future, adding more American troops is an \nattempt to reach a military solution to an inherently political \nproblem.\n  The Prime Minister of Iraq himself stated last November:\n\n       The crisis is political, and the ones who can stop the \n     cycle of aggravation and bloodletting of innocents are the \n     [Iraqi] politicians.\n  Adding more American troops does not pressure Iraqi politicians to be \nIraqi leaders and to make the political compromises essential for a \npolitical solution; it only allows them to continue what in the words \nof the National Intelligence Estimate is the ``current winner-take-all \nattitude and sectarian animosities infecting the political scene.''\n  The administration says this bill emboldens the enemy. Congressional \ndebate over Iraq policy doesn't embolden the enemy. The enemy is \nalready emboldened.\n  What emboldens the enemy is the almost 4 years' presence of Western \ntroops in the middle of a Muslim country's capital, which causes over \n70 percent of the residents of that country to oppose our presence.\n\n[[Page S1564]]\n\n  What emboldens the enemy is the open-ended presence of Western \ntroops, which serves as a magnet for extremists and gives a propaganda \nclub to our enemies.\n  What emboldens the enemy is invading Iraq without the support of the \ninternational community.\n  What emboldens the enemy is lawlessness and looters ransacking public \nbuildings and institutions in Iraq.\n  What emboldens the enemy is invading Iraq without a plan for the \naftermath of the invasion.\n  What emboldens the enemy is increasing the number of American troops, \nwhich results in Iraqis taking less responsibility for providing \nsecurity for all the citizens of Iraq.\n  What emboldens the enemy is the creation of Green Zones protecting \nIraqi political leaders, in which they pursue a winner-take-all \npolitical approach.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 15 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we owe our troops everything. We owe them \nthe best equipment we can provide. We owe them the best training. We \nowe their families the best support we can give them.\n  We also owe them our best thinking. I think it is an insult to the \nintelligence of our troops to suggest that debating the wisdom of \ndeepening the military presence in Iraq somehow or other emboldens the \nenemy. Our troops depend upon us to give them what they deserve: \nsupport. And part of that support in a democracy is debating the policy \nwhich not only brought them there but which keeps them there and, if \nmany of us are correct, will keep them there longer and with greater \ncasualties. The best way to change course in Iraq is to adopt the \nmodified Warner language.\n  It has been said that this is not as strong as withholding funds. We \ndon't want to withhold funds from troops in the field. We want to \nchange this policy. If you want to change the policy this \nadministration is following, which relies on a military solution, a \ndeepening military presence in Iraq, we hope you will vote for cloture \non this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Hagel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I will not speak to the specifics of the \nresolution or resolutions, but I am confident we will be allowed to \ndebate this week. I say that because I know--and I have complete \nconfidence in the two leaders--that they will, in fact, find an \naccommodation. They each understand how critically important this \ndebate is for our country and for the world.\n  I have listened carefully this afternoon to my colleagues, and there \nwill be more intense and engaged and enlightened debate this week. But \nI believe what we are about here--and we will be about this week--is \nsomething far more important than just constitutional responsibilities \nor resolutions. What we are about is finding a policy worthy of our \nyoung men and women and their families who go off to fight and die in a \nvery difficult war. That is what we owe our troops. That is what we owe \nthis country. That is what we owe the world.\n  It surely is not and cannot be a weakness for America, as seen in the \neyes of the world, to openly debate the most critically important issue \nthat any of us will ever debate; that is, war. That is the strength of \nAmerica, not the weakness of America. The reason America has prospered \nfor over 200 years is because the world has had confidence not in its \npower, trusted not its power, but trusted America's purpose.\n  In 1968, when I served with my brother and many others in Vietnam--\nand I believe I speak for most who were there then, and I have heard \nfrom a lot of Vietnam veterans about this debate--I believe that in \n1968, the troops, the ones at the bottom doing the fighting and the \ndying, would have welcomed the Congress of the United States into a \ndebate about Vietnam. They would have welcomed somebody paying \nattention rather than just going along.\n  No, Madam President, that is a strength of this country. And surely \nwe have clear constitutional responsibilities. How could anyone argue \ndifferently? We have clear constitutional responsibilities here.\n  I heard my colleague from Connecticut talking about nonbinding \nresolutions. I don't doubt his staff's research, but I remind the \nSenator that over the last 12 years there have been a number of \nnonbinding resolutions debated on this floor--on Bosnia, Kosovo, \nSomalia, Haiti, and others. I remind some of my colleagues who do not \nbelieve it is in the interest of our country or our troops to talk \nabout nonbinding resolutions, papier mache resolutions, senseless \nresolutions, that they actually voted for some of those resolutions \nover the last 12 years. I would be very happy to provide for the record \na list of how everybody in this Chamber voted over the last 12 years, \nif they were here, on those resolutions. It might be very interesting \nand enlightening. Surely it is not because one political party controls \nthe White House and the other does not. Surely it cannot be that.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate summary--unclassified portions--\nwas made public on Friday. Those watching should have a clear \nunderstanding of what that document is and who produced that document. \nThat document is an accumulation of the 16 intelligence agencies of \nthis country. None that I am aware of has had the integrity of the \ninstitution they represent--any of those 16--ever impugned on questions \nof quality of research--maybe other facets of intelligence but not the \nintegrity of the intent of the product. The National Intelligence \nEstimate says that we are involved today, and have been, in Iraq in not \njust a sectarian conflict--a violent, vicious sectarian conflict--but \nan intrasectarian conflict. Is it not time and don't our troops and the \nAmerican people expect the Congress, after 4 years, when things have \ngotten progressively worse, not better, to engage? And is it not our \nresponsibility to address the issue of escalating our military \ninvolvement, putting American troops in the middle of a sectarian-\nintrasectarian war? Is that not our responsibility? Of course, it is \nour responsibility.\n\n  Madam President, I will have more to say as the debate goes forward \nthis week. As I noted, I have every confidence in our two leaders that \nthey will work out a resolution where we will have this debate because \nit is clearly in the interest of our country, clearly in the interest \nof our troops.\n  With that, I yield back my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, before the Senator yields, I would like \nto associate myself with his remarks. I, too, have confidence in our \nleadership being able to work this out accordingly. No matter how \nstrongly I feel about my resolution, I shall vote with our \ndistinguished leader on this issue and hope he can reconcile the \ndifferences.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I extend my gratitude to both the \nSenator from Nebraska and the Senator from Virginia for understanding \nthe importance of having a full-fledged debate.\n  How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the Republican side of the aisle is \nready for this debate. We are anxious to have it. There are different \nvoices. We just heard from a couple of my distinguished colleagues who \nhave a different view of this debate than I. What we are unified upon \nis a process that guarantees fairness for the consideration of what is \nclearly and unambiguously the most significant issue in the country at \nthis moment.\n  The majority leader and I have been working in good faith on an \nagreement that provides for a structured debate on the various \nproposals and votes on each. The other side said we turned down three \ncompromises but, frankly, that is not the full story.\n  The majority leader said he would agree to a consent that would allow \nvotes on the McCain proposal and the Warner proposal. He also mentioned \nthat he would agree to a 60-vote threshold on each of those. All we are \nasking for is the same agreement on\n\n[[Page S1565]]\n\nthe Gregg resolution. Now, in fact, there was demand among Republican \nSenators for additional alternatives. We were able to pair those down \nto two.\n  Why 60 votes? Let me remind all of our colleagues--and certainly the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Virginia doesn't need to be reminded \nof that, having been here 29 years--that one single Senator can insist \nthat a matter be subject to 60 votes. One single Senator. There are \nmany Senators on this side of the aisle who would insist upon that. So \nit is a statement of the obvious that matters of consequence in the \nSenate over the years have developed in the following way: They are all \nsubject to a 60-vote threshold. To suggest that is anything \nextraordinary really defies our experience here. It is ordinary, not \nextraordinary, for matters of great controversy--and even, in this day \nand age, matters of only a little controversy--to be subject to a 60-\nvote threshold.\n  Our good friends on the other side of the aisle--and this was an \nissue the Senator from Virginia was very much involved with in the last \nCongress--were seeking to establish in one of the last areas where 60 \nvotes was not customarily required--the confirmation of judges--that we \nshould start requiring it there as well. That would leave virtually \nnothing the Senate would consider, except the budget resolution, not \nbeing subject to a 60-vote threshold.\n  So what we are asking for on the Republican side is not at all \nextraordinary. The term ``filibuster'' has become a pejorative term for \nsuggesting that one wants to stop something. Let me repeat, as I have \nsaid to the distinguished majority leader, to the Senator from \nVirginia, and to the Senator from Nebraska, we are not trying to stop \nthis debate. We are trying to structure it in a way that is fair to the \ncompeting voices in the Republican conference who will band together \nshortly in a significant enough number to insist on a fair process.\n  So that is what this is about, Madam President. I have indicated to \nthe Democratic leader--and I certainly wouldn't want to surprise him--\nthat I intended to propound a unanimous consent request that would be \nacceptable to our side, and I will be happy to do that now, having \ngiven notice to the majority leader that I would do so.\n  But before doing that, let me say one more time, there is not a \nsingle Republican Senator seeking to avoid this debate. We have just \nheard from two voices that are in the minority in our conference--the \nSenator from Virginia and the Senator from Nebraska--who don't share my \nview, who nevertheless will vote against cloture shortly to make the \npoint that this Republican minority insists upon fair treatment on this \nimportant debate.\n  Therefore, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed en bloc to the following \nconcurrent resolutions under the following agreement:\n  S. Con. Res. 7, the Warner resolution which is to be discharged from \nthe Foreign Relations Committee; McCain-Lieberman-Graham, regarding \nbenchmarks; Gregg related to funding.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be a total of 10 hours--\nand I will be happy to pick whatever number might be agreeable to the \nmajority leader--of debate equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees; provided further, that no amendments be in order to \nany of the measures; further, that after the use or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate proceed to three consecutive votes on the adoption of \nthe concurrent resolutions in the following order, with no intervening \naction or debate: first, McCain-Lieberman-Graham; second, Gregg; third, \nS. Con. Res. 7. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that any resolution \nthat does not achieve 60 votes in the affirmative, the vote on adoption \nbe vitiated and the concurrent resolution be returned to its previous \nstatus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the vast, vast, vast majority of \nlegislation passed out of this Senate is done by a simple majority. \nThat is a fact. All one has to do is look at the Congressional Record. \nSo with this new direction of the minority, it is very clear what is \nhappening. They are trying to avoid debate on this matter. They want a \nnew set of rules.\n  We have offered them votes, up-or-down votes on McCain, Warner, \nGregg, and they turned that down. I said: OK, fine, we will have 60-\nvote margins on McCain, Warner. They turned that down. So I object, \nMadam President, and I will continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is also very interesting--and I have \nthe greatest respect for my friend from Virginia and my friend from \nNebraska--but with all due respect to them, how could they vote against \na motion to proceed? How could they vote against a motion to proceed \nsaying let the two leaders work this out? What more could we give them \nthan what they asked for last week? But now they want to throw in the \nGregg amendment with a 60-vote margin.\n  Earlier today, the minority leader said: This vote is ``about getting \nfair treatment for the minority here in the Senate.'' He was half \nright. This vote is about fairness but has little to do with being fair \nto the minority. The vote is about being fair to 132,000 troops already \nin Iraq by making sure they have the strategy they need to complete \ntheir mission so they can come home.\n  This vote is about being fair to the 48,000 American men and women \nwho would be sent to Iraq should President Bush be permitted to \nescalate this war.\n  This vote is about being fair to the bipartisan majority of Senators \nwho seek to voice their opposition to the President's plan to escalate \nthe war.\n  This vote is about being fair to the American people and the millions \nof voters who chose a new direction last November.\n  As Senators, we owe it to our troops and our people to have a real \ndebate about the way forward in Iraq. For 4 years, this body, under the \ncontrol of the Republicans, sat silent on the most pressing issue \nfacing our country--Iraq. As thousands of our soldiers were killed and \ntens of thousands wounded, the Senate, directed by the Republicans, sat \nsilent, no debate on Iraq. As hundreds of billions of dollars were \nspent, the Senate sat silent. Republicans were in charge--no debate. \nThey said no.\n  As Iraq fell into chaos and civil war, it became increasingly clear \nthat the President's plan was flawed and failing. The Senate sat \nsilent. The Republicans who were in control of the Senate said: No, no \ndebate on Iraq.\n  As Senators and Americans, we cannot permit the silence to continue. \nThis Democratic majority will not allow it to continue.\n  The administration's failures have dug us into a deep hole in Iraq--\nwe all know that--and we have an obligation to find a way out. Our \ntroops, most of all, need our help. They need a policy that is as \nworthy as their heroic sacrifice. They need a legislative branch that \nwill finally exercise its constitutional responsibilities.\n  Madam President, I say to my friend from Connecticut, I wasn't able \nto hear all of his speech, but I did hear this that caused me to take \nnote: He said words to the effect: What are the Shia politicians going \nto think? What are the Sunni politicians going to think if, in fact, \nWarner passed? I wonder what the Sunni politicians thought, and I \nwonder what the Shia politicians thought when the Iraqi Prime Minister, \nduly elected, told the President of the United States that he wanted \nAmerican troops out of Baghdad. So let's not direct this to Senator \nWarner.\n  A ``no'' vote on the motion to proceed is a green light to George \nBush to continue down the same failed course of almost 4 years.\n  A ``no'' vote is an endorsement of escalation, sending 48,000 more \ntroops to Iraq and spending at least an extra $27 billion--$27 billion \nextra--when this war has already cost almost a half a trillion dollars.\n\n  A ``no'' vote is a vote in support of this President continuing the \nsame policy of failure in Iraq.\n  We have been told by our intelligence experts that the war is not \ngoing to be won by the military; it is only going to be won \npolitically. That is what the\n\n[[Page S1566]]\n\nIraq Study Group said. That is what all people say, with rare \nexception. Those are the people holding hands with the President.\n  We must heed the results of the November elections and the wishes of \nthe American people. We must change course, and this change starts with \nthis next vote.\n  This side--Democrats--have offered the minority everything they have \nasked for. Remember: Vote on Warner, vote on McCain; you want a simple \nmajority; you want a supermajority; we will go along with that. We have \nbeen fair to them. Now the Senate must be fair to our troops, their \nfamilies, and the American people. We must proceed with a debate about \nIraq and send a clear message to President Bush that escalation is not \nthe answer.\n  Some say let the leaders work it out. Part of this stall has been a \nstall for obvious reasons. If not tonight, tomorrow? I must file a \nmotion to invoke cloture on the continuing resolution because the \nRepublicans said they are going to filibuster it. I have gotten letters \nto that effect. We should have been debating the Warner, McCain \nresolutions today, but they have not allowed us. They wouldn't allow us \nto proceed on this matter.\n  I am telling everyone within the sound of my voice, a decision will \nhave to be made whether to go further than tonight, but the time is \nvery tenuous--very tenuous. If they stop us from going forward on this \ndebate, this does not end the debate on Iraq. It may end the debate for \na few days or a few weeks, but, remember, we have the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations coming and that is open to amendment and I can \nguarantee everybody there will be Iraq amendments involved in that \ndebate.\n  The supplemental bill is coming. This is to fund the war in Iraq \nbasically more than $100 billion. I think there will probably very \nlikely be a number of amendments dealing with Iraq.\n  They can run, but they can't hide. We are going to debate Iraq, and \nthey may have gotten all their folks to vote against the motion to \nproceed, they may stop us temporarily from debating the escalation, but \nthey are not going to stop us from debating Iraq.\n  We have lost 3,100 soldiers, sailors, and marines. They are dead, \nMadam President. We don't know the exact number of how many have been \nwounded--24,000, 25,000.\n  We are not going to allow the situation in Iraq to continue. It is \nwrong. There can be no military solution. The President has been told \nthat. I think it speaks volumes when he meets with the Iraqi Prime \nMinister who is elected, and the Iraqi Prime Minister says: Mr. \nPresident of the United States, get all American soldiers out of \nBaghdad.\n  That's what he said. I think it speaks volumes when military \ncommanders say that it is not the way to go. We know what Casey said. \nHis tune has changed a little bit since he was relieved of duty over \nthere.\n  The families of the 3,100 soldiers who have been killed, the families \nof the 24,000, 25,000 who have been wounded demand we go forward with \nthis debate.\n  We are going to start voting momentarily, and remember what the vote \nis. The vote is whether we can proceed to debate the escalation of the \nwar in Iraq. And the Republicans have told everybody they are all going \nto vote no. If they think this can pop up real easily again, I think \nthey may have another thing coming.\n  I repeat, the Republicans left town and left the Government without \nadequate resources to go ahead and complete funding of the Federal \nGovernment for this year. We have to take up the work they did not \ncomplete. They funded the Government until February 15, and now it is \nup to us to make sure the Government continues to run.\n  If they want to pull a Newt Gingrich and close down the Government, \nthat is their responsibility. But I believe we should move forward and \nmake sure the Government is funded, and there is not a lot of time for \nIraq. That is a sad commentary on the situation because we lost days as \na result of these parliamentary delays.\n  I ask unanimous consent that if we get to third reading of S. 470 it \nthen be turned into a concurrent resolution and passage occur on the \nconcurrent resolution and not S. 470. Before hearing how anybody feels \nabout this, I said last week that we would be happy to consider this \nbill as a resolution. Everybody heard me say that. The American people \nheard me say that. So anybody who tries to hide under a procedural vote \nbecause this is a bill and not a resolution is not being fair because \nsimply I have stated--and I know that everyone in this Chamber heard me \nsay this, and I have said it many times--I ask unanimous consent that \nif we get to third reading of S. 470, that it be turned into a \nconcurrent resolution and that passage occur on the concurrent \nresolution and not S. 470.\n  I add another unanimous consent request to this. I am willing to \nchange it to a concurrent resolution right now, as I was willing to do \nlast week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, this is essentially the \nsame unanimous consent request propounded last Thursday night. This \nmatter ought to be dealt with as a concurrent resolution. It is clear \nthe other side does not want to vote on the Gregg amendment. Therefore, \nI object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule 22 of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 19, S. 470, Bipartisan Iraq \n     legislation.\n         Carl Levin, Joe Biden, Ken Salazar, Harry Reid, Pat \n           Leahy, Sherrod Brown, Patty Murray, Robert Menendez, \n           John F.

Mr. President, I would like to speak about two issues \nthat have been much in the news lately: the tax gap and the minimum \nwage bill. We had on the front page of the Times today the discussion \nabout the tax gap. In addition, with the release of the President's \nbudget today, the administration has provided Congress substantive \nproposals to deal with the tax gap. It is now Congress's responsibility \nto consider these proposals, review them, and hear from the public and \nalso see what more is possible in terms of addressing the tax gap. But \nthe good news is we have already taken steps in this Congress to deal \nwith the tax gap. We have very important tax reforms and tax gap \nmeasures included in the minimum wage bill. So Congress is effectively \nkilling two birds with one stone.\n  First, we are providing needed tax relief for small businesses that \ncould be harmed by the increase in the minimum wage--and I voted for an \nincrease in the minimum wage. Second, in the minimum wage bill we are \ngoing after the tax gap and those who engage in the tax scams.\n  Two things: No. 1, we are dealing with efforts to help small business \nand, No. 2, we are at the very same time bringing more money into the \nFederal Treasury by closing tax scams and reducing the tax gap.\n  I would say, as a sidenote to my colleagues, particularly the new \nleaders on the Budget Committee, that these tax provisions are only the \nlatest example of the Finance Committee producing additional revenues \nby changes in the Tax Code. Unfortunately, I feel as though I need to \nput on a Sherlock Holmes hat and hire a bloodhound to go out and try to \nfind any savings that the Budget Committee makes and had enacted into \nlaw when it comes to the spending side of the ledger. We have more than \ndone our job on the tax side. I say it is time for the Budget Committee \nto deliver savings on the spending side.\n  But let me turn back to the tax gap and turn back to the minimum wage \nbill. I am very pleased that in working with Senator Baucus we have, as \npart of the tax provisions contained in the minimum wage package, a new \nprovision--a number of provisions, in fact--that will go after those \nengaged in tax shelters and tax scams and take steps, then, in the \nprocess, to address the tax gap--in other words, money that is owed but \nnot paid. I would like to highlight just a few of these provisions that \nare in the minimum wage bill that are closing the tax gap and shutting \ndown tax scams.\n  We shut down the SILO scheme. That is an acronym. U.S. corporations \ncut their tax bills by purchasing and leasing back overseas government \nfacilities such as sewer plants and subways in the country of Germany. \nWe take additional steps to go after corporations that move to the \nBahamas and have just a mailbox, not any people, and use the gimmick to \ncut their taxes. I can't tell you how many times I have heard speeches \nabout that issue from Senators on the other side of the aisle. We can \nend the talking and we can start doing something about it with these \nvery provisions contained in the minimum wage bill if we do not let \nsuceed people who are talking about separating the tax provisions of \nthe wage bill just to get a minimum wage bill passed.\n  We also tightened the rules on individuals who expatriate to avoid \ntaxes legally owed in the United States--and we have that happen.\n  We end the fast and loose ways that corporations account for fines \nand penalties, so if a corporation gets a penalty for, let's say, \npolluting the environment, they do not get to deduct that from their \nincome tax. We also increase penalties for those who underpay taxes due \nto fraud. I think everybody would agree with that. We double the fines \nand the penalties for those who use offshore financial arrangements to \navoid taxes. The Finance Committee views that as a growing problem and \na major reason that there is such a tax gap. We expand and improve the \nwhistleblower program which will provide the Internal Revenue Service a \nroadmap for corporate tax fraud.\n\n  We modify the collection due process rules to protect the tax \nprotesters from abusing the system. This is something that the \nadministration proposed in its budget today to help deal with the tax \ngap.\n  This collection due process provision contained in the minimum wage \nbill only emphasizes my point that we can start dealing with a tax gap \ntoday, right now.\n  And then a final provision I will make reference to is one provision \nthat closes a loophole in section 162(m), the $1 million limitation for \ncorporate executives. The provisions provide that a CEO can't avoid the \neffects of 162(m) by not being on the job at the end of the year.\n  Mr. President, forests have been sacrificed to print the speeches \nthat politicians make decrying excessive CEO pay. Yes, we have a \nprovision in the minimum wage bill that tightens the deduction that can \nbe taken for higher CEO pay.\n  So I get down to the basics, and I get down to the basics because I \nhave been hearing some rumors from Senators--but more importantly from \nthe leadership of the other body--that in order to get a minimum wage \nbill passed, we ought to drop the tax provisions and pass the minimum \nwage bill. But I have always been hearing over the years from those \npeople who are saying: We need to do something about the tax gap; we \nneed to do something about the tax scams; we need to do something about \npeople going offshore to avoid the payment of taxes, and on and on. So \nI have to ask the Democratic leadership if they are going to put the \nprovisions I am talking about--closing the tax gap, closing down the \ntax scams--if they want to put those provisions in the trash can. If \nthey do, I would also like to put into the trash all the speeches made \non the other side then about CEO pay.\n  I say this because the time for speeches is over. We can take steps \nright now with the tax provisions in the minimum wage bill to deal with \nthe tax gap and CEO pay. I have listed these provisions, and as my \ncolleagues know, while many of them are good common sense, these \nprovisions are also not at all popular downtown on K Street or up the \neastern coast on Wall Street.\n  While the debate has focused on the tax breaks for small business in \nthe minimum wage bill--and those are important because they are helping \nsmall business overcome some negative impact of the minimum wage \nincrease--it is also critical we pass a much-needed tax gap and anti-\nabuse provisions contained in the minimum wage bill and pass them now. \nDelaying these reforms as some would argue--putting them on another tax \nbill--rewards tax cheats. These reforms are often date and time \nsensitive. Delay only benefits those who are playing fast and loose \nwith our tax laws.\n  I can't believe the House Democratic leadership wants the first \naction they take in the area of taxes to drop these reform provisions--\nthese provisions that would close the tax gap--and signal to the tax \ncheats that the door is wide open.\n  Senator Baucus and I, working together over the years, have passed \ninto law a good many reforms, and we have shut down a number of tax \nscams. However, we have been, at times, stymied in the other body--not \nby Democrats but by Republicans.\n  We heard a lot of commentary during the elections and afterwards how \nit was no longer going to be business as usual. My hope is that given \nthe rhetoric of the new House leadership, we could finally pass these \nanti-abuse tax reforms in the minimum wage bill. I worry, though, that \nwith folks talking about stripping the tax provisions from the minimum \nwage bill, the House leadership may be singing a new song. But\n\n[[Page S1568]]\n\nthe results are the same. The House Democratic leadership needs to \nunderstand that kowtowing to K Street is not a new direction that was \npromised by a new majority in the last election. They can show it is \nnot business as usual, as they were condemning Republicans of doing. \nThey can show that by passing all the tax provisions contained in the \nSenate minimum wage bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1568-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1568-S1570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         U.S. STRATEGY IN IRAQ\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise this evening being greatly \ndisturbed by what happened on the floor of the Senate, after a \ntremendous amount of good-faith effort and very hard work by our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, bringing together a resolution \nto offer to this body for a debate, for a full debate on the question \nof escalating the war in Iraq. What we have seen from the minority is a \nfilibuster that has stopped us from even proceeding--from even \nproceeding to be able to take up the resolution.\n  Our majority leader offered to take up other resolutions, some \ncontradicting the one that we wished to have brought forward, to have \nequally debated resolutions, the same amount of time, the same amount \nof votes that are needed in order to be able to bring forward the \nresolutions and possibly pass them.\n  Every effort by the majority leader was turned down. Every time he \nbrought up a possible solution to be able to bring forward these \nresolutions and have a full debate, which the American people are \ndemanding that we do, he was told ``no.'' No, no, no. So we are now in \na situation where the minority has voted down the ability for us to \neven go to a resolution or multiple resolutions dealing with the issue \nof Iraq, which we are all so deeply concerned about.\n  Right now it is after midnight in Baghdad, and we have over 130,000 \nAmerican troops who are settled in for another long night half a world \naway from home. They are living, working, fighting in the most \ndifficult conditions anyone can imagine. They are patrolling crowded \nstreets. They are standing guard on lonely posts. They are reaching out \nto Iraqi citizens and putting themselves constantly in harm's way to \nprotect their fellow soldiers. They are there because their Government \ncalled them. They come from every corner of this great Nation. They \nrepresent every color, creed, religion, and political voice in this \ncountry.\n\n  I have been to Iraq--many of us have--and I have talked to our men \nand women in the field and they are the best this country has to offer. \nFor our entire history, they have answered when called. They have gone \nwhere we sent them. They have fought when we have asked them to do so. \nThey have dedicated their lives to preparing for wars they did not \nwant, and when asked, they have executed their training with pride, \nbravery, and an unwavering spirit.\n  We are blessed this evening to sleep under the blanket of freedom \nthey provide. And no one--no one in this Chamber--is questioning the \njob they are doing. We are all patriots in this debate--all of us--with \ndiffering views, strongly held views about the best way to move \nforward. We are all patriots.\n  I have listened intently over the past weeks, and I have heard \ncolleagues and representatives of the administration state time and \nagain that those of us questioning the President are somehow \nundermining the morale of our troops. I find that insulting, not only \nto me and to my colleagues who care deeply about this and who have \nworked together in a bipartisan way to bring forward this resolution \nbut to our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, and marines. Open and \nhonest debate about the execution of this war is not only what our \narmed services expect, it is what they deserve. Our citizen soldiers \ndemand our best, and our best is not idle silence. Our best is not a \nfilibuster that stops a resolution from even coming to the floor so \nthat we can have an open, honest debate about it. Our citizen soldiers \nare on the frontlines. In this Chamber, we use words, but those words \nhave real-world consequences, and no one lives those consequences more \nthan our troops on the ground. Debate in a democracy does not undermine \nthe morale or the will of our armed services. The lack of a clear, \nmeasurable, and achievable mission does undermine what they are doing. \nThat is what we are all wanting to see happen. That is what we want to \nsee developed for them.\n  They need to know that their leaders have based their orders on \nreason, not on wishful thinking and on a misguided adherence to a \nfailed strategy. They need to know that their leaders have sensibly \nconsidered all of the options available and that those considerations \nare grounded in fact, not in rhetoric or posturing.\n  On October 11, 2002, 23 of us in the Senate cast a lonely vote \nagainst this White House effort to go to war because the evidence was \nnot clear enough--it just wasn't there--to warrant going to war. I cast \nthat vote because I believed that the pretense for war was based not in \ndefinable evidence but on predetermined conclusions. War is a tool of \nlast resort, a decision that should be made with great trepidation when \nour country is at risk and other options have been exhausted.\n  From day one, the reasoning for this war has been unclear and \ninconsistent, from the initial lack of preparedness for securing \nBaghdad to the most recent call for escalation. We have seen a strategy \nbased on the best-case scenario calculations of politicians, not on the \nwholly realistic conclusions of career military officers. Mistakes have \nbeen made at every turn, and 4 years and over 3,000 American lives \nlater and hundreds of thousands of lost lives and injuries of Iraqis, \nwe are still paying the price.\n  Some have insisted this resolution is a ploy to embarrass the \nPresident. This is clearly not our goal. This is not a discussion about \npolitics. It is a debate about policy. Any soldier will tell you there \nare no politics in a foxhole. The American people, Republicans and \nDemocrats, are asking us to look long and hard at what we are doing in \nIraq. We were not elected to stand silently by while our fellow \ncitizens demand answers.\n  We can't even have a full debate because of the vote that happened. \nThe American people are asking us not only to debate but to come to the \nright answers, the responsible answers for the direction and strategy \nin Iraq. Our soldiers deserve that, and we have in front of us a \nresolution that we couldn't even get enough votes to bring up to \ndiscuss, to debate it fully and have a vote. I believe the simple fact \nis very clear that escalation is not the answer, and I want the \nopportunity to vote on that, to say that on behalf of the people of \nMichigan. Putting more Americans in harm's way will not bring our men \nand women home any sooner. Why would we go further down the path that \nhas led us to this point? Why would we repeat our previous mistakes and \ncall it a new strategy?\n  A free and stable Iraq can only be secured by the Iraqis. They must \nembrace responsibility for their collective future and decide that \nliving and dying at the hands of sectarian violence is not the future \nthey want for their children and their grandchildren. We must support \ntheir efforts--and I do--but we cannot substitute American troops for \nIraqi resolve. With the freedom of self-determination comes the \nresponsibility of collective security.\n\n  We must continue to train our friends in Iraq. We must equip them and \nprovide sensible military support based on the advice of our generals \nand military experts. We must lead them by example, by embracing the \nrealities of our own democratic process as we attempt to collectively \nsolve the challenges in the war in Iraq. How can we be talking to them \nabout the democratic process when that process is stopped right here in \nthe Senate in the ability to openly debate and vote on the resolution?\n  I stand in support of the Warner-Levin resolution and to say that \nescalation is a grave mistake. I am certain when judged by our fellow \nAmericans, the votes that many Members will cast, if we have the \nopportunity to do so, to say ``enough is enough'' to this White House \nwill be greeted with sober support.\n  With heaviness in my heart, I am also sadly confident that when \njudged by history, those who have questioned the reasoning and the \nexecution of this war will have our concerns justified.\n\n[[Page S1569]]\n\n  We can't change how we got here. We can't change the fact we are in \nIraq. That chapter of history is written, set in stone, and paid for \nwith the lives of Americans and Iraqis, and the lives of many other \nindividuals around the world. However, we can learn from the path we \nhave walked. We have the ability to reassess and to change course, to \nget it right, to put forward our collective best wisdom from everyone \nwho has been involved. On behalf of our soldiers, they deserve that. \nThey deserve a full debate in the Senate, to be able to state our \npositions on policy, on policy that right now at this moment they are \ncarrying out in Iraq. They deserve the very best debate and very best \ndecisions.\n  That is what this is about. That is what we were hoping to get \ntonight, the opportunity to go forward, to work together in a \nbipartisan way to put forward a statement that says we believe there is \na better way, a better strategy than what the President has begun to \nexecute.\n  I hope we will have an opportunity to vote on this resolution. I \nwelcome other resolutions that colleagues have put forward in good \nfaith. I may not agree with them--and that is all right; that is how \nthe process works--but they deserve debate just as our resolutions \ndeserve debate.\n  In Iraq, we are talking about their setting up a democracy, the \nability to fully debate and participate in their government. We need to \nshow by example that we are not afraid of debate, of involvement, we \nare not afraid to stand and say what we think and put our own vote and \nopinions on the line on something so critical to the future of our \ncountry, most particularly to our men and women in the armed services \nand their families, and, frankly, to the world.\n  We need the opportunity to vote. We need the opportunity to debate. \nThe American people are calling on the Senate to do nothing less. \nTonight was not an example of our listening.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, in my home State of Vermont and all \nacross this country, the American people are deeply concerned about the \nwar in Iraq. They want real debate here in Washington on this issue \nand, more importantly, they want real action.\n  Frankly, I have a hard time understanding why some of my colleagues, \nregardless of what their position on the war might be, would try to \nprevent a vote on what is at best a very modest proposal that was \nbrought forth this afternoon. If you like the Warner bill, you should \nvote for it. If you do not like it, you should vote against it. But in \nfairness to the American people, we should have a serious debate and a \nvote on this issue.\n  Let me be very clear in giving you my perspective on this war. In my \nview, President Bush's war in Iraq has been a disaster. It is a war we \nwere misled into and a war many of us believed we never should have \ngotten into in the first place.\n  This is a war which the administration was unprepared to fight. The \nadministration has shown little understanding of the enemy or the \nhistorical context or the cultural context in which we found ourselves. \nWho will forget President Bush declaring ``mission accomplished'' \naboard the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln when, in fact, the mission \nhad barely begun? Who will forget Vice President Cheney telling us that \nthe insurgency was in its ``last throes,'' just before some of the \nbloodiest months of the war took place? Who will ever forget those Bush \nadvisers who predicted that the war would be a cakewalk--nothing to \nworry about--and that we would be greeted in Iraq as liberators?\n  This war in Iraq has come at a very, very high price in so many ways. \nThis is a war which has cost us terribly in American blood. As of \ntoday, we have lost some 3,100 brave American soldiers, twenty-three \nthousand more have been wounded, and tens of thousands will come home \nwith post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  This is a war which, with the President's proposed increase, will \ncost us some $500 billion, with the price tag going up by $8 billion \nevery single month. This cost is going to add to the huge national debt \nwe are already leaving to our children and grandchildren. And it is \ngoing to make it more difficult for us to fund health care, education, \nenvironmental protection, affordable housing, childcare, and the \npressing needs of the middle class and working families of our country, \nnot to mention the needs of our veterans, whose numbers are rapidly \nincreasing as a result of this war.\n  This is a war which has caused unimaginable horror for the people of \nIraq. People who had suffered so long under the brutality of the Saddam \nHussein dictatorship are suffering even more today. There are estimates \nthat hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have been killed or wounded and \nalmost 2 million have been forced to flee their country--some 8 percent \nof their population.\n  While civil war tears neighborhoods apart, children are without \nschools, and the Iraqi people lack electricity, health care, and other \nbasic necessities of life. The doctors and nurses, teachers and \nadministrators who have provided the professional infrastructure for \nthe people of Iraq are now long gone.\n  This is a war which has lowered our standing in the international \ncommunity to an all-time low in our lifetimes, with leaders in \ndemocratic countries hesitant to work with us because of the lack of \nrespect their citizens have for our President. Long-time friends and \nallies are simply wondering what is going on in the United States \ntoday. This is a war which has stretched our active-duty military to \nthe breaking point, as well as our National Guard and Reserve forces. \nMorale in the military is low, and this war will have lasting impacts \non the future recruitment, retention, and readiness of our Nation's \nmilitary. This is a war which has in many respects lowered our \ncapability to effectively fight the very serious threats of \ninternational terrorism and Islamic extremism.\n  Five years after the horrific attacks of 9/11, Osama bin Laden \nremains free. Using the presence of United States troops in Iraq as \ntheir rallying call, al-Qaida's strength around the world continues to \ngrow and the situation in Afghanistan is currently becoming more and \nmore difficult.\n  Tragically, this administration has refused to listen to the American \npeople who, in this last election, made it very clear that they want a \nnew direction in Iraq, and they want this war wound down, not \nescalated.\n  This administration has refused to listen to the thoughtful \nsuggestions of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, which included two \nformer Secretaries of State, including President Bush's own father's \nSecretary of State, as well as a former Presidential chief of staff and \na former Secretary of Defense, that it was time for a change in \ndirection. This administration has refused to listen to the advice of \nour military leaders in Iraq who told us that increasing troops from \nthe United States would make it easier for the Iraqi Government and \nmilitary to avoid their political and military responsibilities.\n  This administration has refused to listen to the Iraqi people who, \naccording to a number of polls, have told us very strongly that they \nbelieve, in the midst of all of the horror and turmoil and violence \nwithin their country, that they would be safer and more secure if our \ntroops left their country.\n  In fact, this administration has tragically refused to listen to \nalmost anybody except that same shrinking inner circle, led by the Vice \nPresident, who has consistently been wrong on this issue from day one.\n  As most everybody understands and as the recent National Intelligence \nEstimate has confirmed, the situation today in Iraq is extremely dire. \nThe sad truth is there are now no good options before us; there are \nsimply less bad options. In Iraq today, according to Secretary of \nDefense Bob Gates, there are now at least four separate wars being \nfought, wars that our soldiers who have fought with incredible bravery \nand skill find themselves in the middle of.\n  Let me quote Secretary Gates, who has recently stated:\n\n\n[[Page S1570]]\n\n\n       I believe there are essentially four wars going on in Iraq. \n     One is Shia on Shia, principally in the south; the second is \n     sectarian conflict, principally in Baghdad but not solely. \n     Third is the insurgency, and fourth is Al Queda.\n\n  The reality today, as described by the Secretary of Defense, has \nnothing to do with why President Bush got us into this war in the first \nplace. In March of 2002, he told us Iraq had weapons of mass \ndestruction and that they were poised to use those weapons against us. \nThat was not true and certainly has no relevance to the war today. In \n2002, the President told us Iraq was somehow linked to al-Qaida and \nbore some responsibility for the horrific 9/11 attack against our \ncountry. That also turned out not to be true and has no relevance to \nthe situation we find ourselves in today.\n  In the 2006 elections, the American people, in a loud and \nunmistakable voice, told us they no longer had confidence in the Bush \nadministration's handling of the war in Iraq. In my view, they told us \nthey wanted Congress to begin asserting its constitutional authority \nover this war, and they wanted us to rein in the administration. Most \nimportantly, they told us they wanted us to begin the process of \nbringing our troops home as soon as possible. And as a Vermont Senator, \nthat is exactly the effort I intend to make.\n  In my view, the Warner resolution is far too weak. It is a baby step \nforward. Whether it is passed or not, it must be followed with much \nstronger legislation, legislation that has real teeth. Instead of just \nvoicing our disapproval of President Bush's escalation of the war with \na nonbinding resolution, we should now be considering legislation that \nprovides for the safe and orderly redeployment of virtually all of our \ntroops out of Iraq within the next year, even as we continue to give \nsupport to the Iraq Government and their military for the purpose of \nhelping them accept their political and military responsibilities. That \nis the legislation we should be debating. That is the legislation we \nshould be passing.\n  How can we accomplish this withdrawal and redeployment? Regardless of \nwhat happens with the nonbinding Warner bill, in the very near future \nwe must bring forth legislation on to the floor of the Senate that \nwould prohibit the use of funds for an escalation of United States \nmilitary forces without a specific new authorization from the Congress. \nSecondly, we must consider legislation to require a schedule for the \nreturn home of a majority of American forces and the redeployment of \nthe rest of the American forces from Iraq to other places. Finally, we \nmust vote against any additional funding to increase troop levels. In \naddition, we must set conditions in any future funding bill so that the \nPresident is obliged to begin winding down this war.\n  We are mired in a war that has gone on longer than American \ninvolvement in either the First World War or the Second World War. We \nwill spend more money on this war in real dollars than we spent on \neither the Korean war or the war in Vietnam. Our standing in the \ninternational community has declined, and our ability to combat \ninternational terrorism has been seriously compromised. It is time to \nsay no to this ill-conceived escalation. It is time to deploy our \ntroops out of harm's way. It is time to end this war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1570-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING CHARLES H. RAMSEY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Charles H. Ramsey, \nwho retired as chief of the Metropolitan Police Department at the end \nof December.\n  A Chicago, IL, native, Chief Ramsey began his career in law \nenforcement with the Chicago Police Department in 1968. Over the course \nof nearly three decades, Ramsey proved himself a dedicated and capable \nmember of the force. He was promoted to Deputy Superintendent of the \nBureau of Staff Services in 1994. The position brought with it many new \nresponsibilities and put him in charge of the Department's education \nand training programs, an area in which Charles Ramsey excelled.\n  During his tenure with the CPD, Chief Ramsey played an instrumental \nrole in the creation and implementation of the Chicago Alternative \nPolicing Strategy, the city's innovative model of community policing. \nCAPS was designed to help police officers better understand the \ncommunities they were patrolling, rendering them more effective in \npreventing crime.\n  Chief Ramsey comanaged the Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy \nprogram, which promoted the cooperation of police, community, and city \nservices. The training program to support the CAPS operation model \nprovided guidelines for working with city agencies, and encouraging \nresidents to become involved in their neighborhoods and communities \nthrough local meetings with law enforcement officials.\n  Chief Ramsey brought many of the strategies he piloted in Chicago to \nWashington when he was appointed chief of the Metropolitan Police \nDepartment in April of 1998. Chief Ramsey has said that when he came to \nthe MPDC he found ``outstanding people who were frustrated by \nantiquated technology, vehicles and equipment and perhaps most of all, \nan overall sense of organizational pride and purpose that needed to be \nrestored.'' Chief Ramsey made it his goal, over the next 8\\1/2\\ years \nnot only to update the Department's resources, but to restore the \nDepartment's sense of pride and to build public confidence in the \npolice.\n  Under his leadership, the Metropolitan Police Department saw a shift \nin strategic vision, with a new emphasis on community policing and \ncrime prevention. Chief Ramsey created a system of Regional Operations \nCommands, designed to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy and enhance \naccountability. In eight and a half years, the Department has achieved \nmuch success. The crime rate in the District of Columbia is close to 40 \npercent lower than when Chief Ramsey joined the force. Meanwhile, the \ndepartment received acclaim for its handling of a number of major \nevents, including the 1999 NATO 50th Anniversary summit and the 2000 \nprotests against the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group.\n  Throughout his career, Chief Ramsey has received numerous accolades \nand been presented with many honors. He received the Gary P. Hayes \nAward from the Police Executive Research Forum, the 2001 Robert Lamb \nHumanitarian Award from the National Organization of Black Law \nEnforcement Executives and the 2001 Civil Rights Award from the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police. But Chief Ramsey is sure \nto be remembered for an unlikely partnership that developed shortly \nafter he arrived in Washington.\n  It began, when Chief Ramsey visited the United States Holocaust \nMuseum at the invitation of the Anti-Defamation League. Following his \nvisit, he considered the ways in which his Department could learn from \nthe history of the Holocaust, in particular the vital role law \nenforcement must play in protecting civil liberties. Chief Ramsey \nenlisted the help of the Museum and the ADL in drafting a curricula and \ntraining program for his officers. In 1999, ``Law Enforcement and \nSociety: Lessons from the Holocaust'' was introduced. Since its \ninception ``Law Enforcement and Society'' has been used by more than a \ndozen other departments and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In \n2001, the Anti-Defamation League recognized Chief Ramsey's efforts, \npresenting him with the Sigmund Livingston Award and Chief Ramsey was \nhonored by the Holocaust Museum in 2005.\n  I congratulate Chief Charles Ramsey on his many accomplishments \nthroughout his long and distinguished career. I thank him for his \nleadership in the Metropolitan Police Department and his commitment to \npublic service. I wish him and his family the very best in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1570-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PUBLICATION OF COMMITTEE RULES IN CONGRESSIONAL RECORD\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Written notices of committee meetings will normally be \n     sent by the committee's staff director to all Members of the \n     committee at least a week in advance. In addition, the \n     committee staff will telephone or e-mail reminders of \n     committee meetings to all Members of the committee or to the \n     appropriate assistants in their offices.\n       4. A copy of the committee's intended agenda enumerating \n     separate items of legislative business and committee business \n     will normally be sent to all Members of the committee and \n     released to the public at least 1 day in advance of all \n     meetings. This does not preclude any Member of the committee \n     from discussing appropriate non-agenda topics.\n       5. After the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member, \n     speaking order shall be based on order of arrival, \n     alternating between Majority and Minority Members, unless \n     otherwise directed by the Chairman.\n       6.

In general, testimony will be restricted to 5 minutes \n     for each witness. The time may be extended by the Chairman, \n     upon the Chair's own direction or at the request of a Member. \n     Each round of questions by Members will also be limited to 5 \n     minutes.\n\n                           Title II--Quorums\n\n       1.

The results of roll call votes taken in any meeting upon \n     any measure, or any amendment thereto, shall be stated in the \n     committee report on that measure unless previously announced \n     by the committee, and such report or announcement shall \n     include a tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the \n     votes cast in opposition to each such measure and amendment \n     by each Member of the committee. (Paragraph 7(b) and (c) of \n     rule XXVI of the Standing Rules.)\n       4. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and \n     matters before the committee. However, the vote of the \n     committee to report a measure or matter shall require the \n     concurrence of a majority of the Members of the committee who \n     are physically present at the time of the vote. Proxies will \n     be allowed in such cases solely for the purpose of recording \n     a Member's position on the question and then only in those \n     instances when the absentee committee Member has been \n     informed of the question and has affirmatively requested that \n     he be recorded. (Paragraph 7(a) (3) of rule XXVI of the \n     Standing Rules.)\n\n                          Title IV--Amendments\n\n       1. Provided at least five business days' notice of the \n     agenda is given, and the text of the proposed bill or \n     resolution has been made available at least five business \n     calendar days in advance, it shall not be in order for the \n     Committee to consider any amendment in the first degree \n     proposed to any measure under consideration by the Committee \n     unless such amendment has been delivered to the office of the \n     Committee and circulated via e-mail to each of the offices by \n     at least 5:00 PM the day prior to the scheduled start of the \n     meeting.\n       2. In the event the Chairman introduces a substitute \n     amendment or a Chairman's mark, the requirements set forth in \n     Paragraph 1 of this Title shall be considered waived unless \n     such substitute amendment or Chairman's mark has been made \n     available at least five business days in advance of the \n     scheduled meeting.\n       3. It shall be in order, without prior notice, for a Member \n     to offer a motion to strike a single section of any bill, \n     resolution, or amendment under consideration.\n       4. This section of the rule may be waived by agreement of \n     the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member.\n\n         Title V--Delegation of Authority to Committee Chairman\n\n       1.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Gang \nAbatement and Prevention Act, introduced by Senator Feinstein. Before \ndiscussing the details of this bill, I want to state how pleased I am \nthat it has such broad bipartisan support. With 13 sponsors, 7 \nDemocrats and 6 Republicans, I am hopeful that this bill can move \nquickly through Congress.\n  Gang-related violence is on the rise, in Colorado and throughout the \nNation. Just by way of example: according to the Colorado Bureau of \nInvestigation, Denver is home to roughly 12,470 gang members, who are \naffiliated with 110 gangs. Nationwide, there are roughly 730,000 gang \nmembers. Since 1999 the number of crimes investigated by the Denver \ngang unit has risen 35 percent; gang members were responsible for fully \n35 percent of Denver's firearm-related homicides;\n\n[[Page S1572]]\n\n  As these statistics show, gang violence is still a serious problem--\nand we in Congress have an obligation to respond. This bill is a good \nfirst-step, because it focuses on four key pillars of effective law \nenforcement policy: prevention; investigation and prosecution; firm and \njust penalties; and effective law enforcement training.\n  On prevention, the bill would authorize $250 million for intervention \nprograms focused on at-risk youth. These funds would be administered \nthrough a new High Intensity Interstate Gang Activity Area program, or \nHIGAA, which would be designed to facilitate cooperation between \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement in identifying, targeting, \nand eliminating violent gangs.\n  I have firsthand experience with the effectiveness of \nmultijurisdictional law enforcement efforts: the Rocky Mountain High \nIntensity Drug Trafficking Area program, and the various local \nmultijurisdictional drug task forces in Colorado, have successfully \nleveraged Federal, State, and local resources to fight crime. I support \napplying this model to the fight against gangs.\n  On the investigation and prosecution front, I am pleased that the \nbill would increase funding for the Justice Department, Federal \nprosecutors, and FBI agents to coordinate Federal enforcement against \nviolent gangs.\n  In regards to penalties for gang-related activity, this bill takes a \nsensible approach. It would replace the current sentencing enhancement \nfor gang-related conduct with a new Federal antigang law that directly \ncriminalizes gang crimes--and related conspiracies and attempts to \ncommit crimes in furtherance of a criminal gang. The bill would also \ncreate new Federal offenses prohibiting the recruitment of minors into \na criminal gang.\n  Finally, the bill would authorize $3-$5 million per year for the \ncreation of a national gang violence prevention training center and \nclearinghouse, which would assist local law enforcment with training \nand the implementation of effective gang violence prevention models. \nSince my time as attorney general, I have been acutely aware of the \nimportance of effective law enforcement training--and I am pleased that \nthis bill contains provisions which would directly address this \nimportant issue.\n  This is a sensible, comprehensive bill. By focusing on prevention, \ninvestigation, prosecution, punishment, and training, I am hopeful that \nit will give our law enforcement agencies--Federal, State, and local--\nthe resources they need to effectively fight the growth of gangs and \ngang activity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1572-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PASSAGE OF FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, this weekend marked the 10th anniversary \nof the Kennedy Center's Millennium Stage, a remarkable milestone for \nthe center and its special commitment to reach out to the community and \nexpand opportunities for citizens and visitors to enjoy exceptional \nperformances.\n  At 6 p.m. every evening, 7 days a week, the center presents a free \nconcert with live performers on the Millennium Stage. Former chairman \nof the board Jim Johnson conceived the idea and guided the center \nthrough its early performances. Ever since, a remarkable series of \ntalented musical artists and performing artists have been a part of \nthis effort, from classical to rock and roll, from Sweet Honey in the \nRock, KC and the Sunshine Band, to Norah Jones.\n  More than 3 million people have enjoyed these free performances at \nthe center, and countless more have enjoyed them on the Web casts. It \nis a wonderful tradition in the Nation's Capital, and I know that there \nwill be many more brilliant performances in the years ahead.\n  I urge my colleagues to let their constituents know about these \nexciting performance opportunities. I ask unanimous consent that an \neditorial from today's Washington Post and an article from the \nWashington Post on February 2 about the Millennium Stage anniversary be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 5, 2007]\n\n         Concerted Effort--An Anniversary at the Kennedy Center\n\n       Walk into the Kennedy Center around 6 on any given night, \n     and, for only the price of your time, you might hear the \n     National Symphony Orchestra interpreting Mussorgsky, the \n     Joffrey Ballet executing a pas de deux or the Shakespeare \n     Theatre Company soliloquizing from ``Twelfth Night.'' If \n     those offerings are too elevated for you, the Kennedy \n     Center's programmers also atrract a range of artists with \n     alternative styles, from folk musician Pete Seeger to punk \n     legend Patti Smith to vocalist and recent Grammy winner Norah \n     Jones.\n       Tonight's performance will be especially memorable. Ten \n     years ago today, the Kennedy Center held its first free \n     performance on its Millennium State, and every night since, \n     tourists and locals alike--more than 3 million so far, by the \n     Kennedy Center's reckoning--have had the opportunity to enjoy \n     world-class performing arts, no expensive tickets required. \n     That's 41,000 artists from all 50 states and 50 countries to \n     date. At a time when metropolitan performing arts centers \n     around the country are coming up short on cash, it is \n     refreshing to see Washington's center prioritize free, \n     consistent and quality performances accessible to the general \n     public. The Kennedy Center's administrators should be proud \n     of this milestone.\n       Equally impressive is the Millennium Stage's nightly \n     turnout, which programmers estimate at about 350 on average. \n     And crowds at bigger shows range from 500 to several \n     thousand, according to the Kennedy Center's Garth Ross, who \n     credits extensive community outreach for the success of the \n     Millennium Stage. It's what Kennedy Center President Michael \n     Kaiser calls great art well-marketed.\n       Tonight's anniversary concert promises to be particularly \n     memorable. The National Symphony Orchestra, the Alvin Ailey \n     American Dance Theater and rocker Sufjan Stevens will \n     perform. Tickes for those capacity-filling acts are already \n     gone. But you can watch them on video screens in the Grand \n     Foyer, catch the webcast on the Kennedy Center's Web site or \n     show up any other day of the year to experience more free, \n     live art.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 2, 2007]\n\n                  The Kennedy Center's Open Invitation\n\n                        (By Richard Harrington)\n\n       With apologies to Joni Mitchell, people have been playing \n     real good for free for the past decade on the Kennedy \n     Center's Millennium State. And though nobody stopped to hear \n     Mitchell's street clarinetist, that hasn't been a problem at \n     the Millennium Stage since guitarist Charlie Byrd and pianist \n     Billy Taylor christened it in March 1997 in front of a couple \n     of thousand well-heeled Washingtonians.\n       Ten years and more than 3 million visitors later, the \n     Millennium Stage remains without equal: the only cultural \n     institution in the\n\n[[Page S1573]]\n\n     world to offer free performances of jazz, classical, dance, \n     folk and more 24-7-365. And if you can't make it there, you \n     can watch it anywhere. Since April 1, 1999, almost all \n     Millenium Stage performances have been streamed live on the \n     Internet.\n       In the early days, when the concept of a free-concert-a-day \n     was still catching on, a little-known artist might attract a \n     small crowd; on rare occasions, a choir might even outnumber \n     the audience.\n       But crowds numbering in the hundreds have long become the \n     norm in the Kennedy Center's Grand Foyer, where folding \n     chairs are set up to hold several hundred people, with an \n     equal number sitting on the carpeted stairs leading to either \n     the Concert Hall or the Eisenhower Theater.\n       The Grand Foyer lives up to its name. It's one of the \n     world's largest rooms--someone came up with the fact that \n     were the Washington Monument laid horizontally inside, it \n     would fit with 75 feet to spare--and can accommodate about \n     4,500 people. But more than 6,000 showed up in 2003 to see \n     Colombian superstar Juanes perform. Seating for the 6 p.m. \n     concerts begins about 5:30 p.m., and for that concert, queues \n     stretched from Hall of Nations and Hall of States all the way \n     around the building. As people entered the Grand Foyer, they \n     could look through the huge glass wall and observe the River \n     Terrace line moving as well--a gigantic, festive snake.\n       Whatever the program, the setting is splendid, particularly \n     before daylight saving time kicks in. At sunset, light \n     streams through the glass wall facing the Potomac, through \n     landscaped willow trees on the River Terrace, a great \n     location for before- or after-performance strolls. The \n     terrace overlooks Theodore Roosevelt Island and \n     the Georgetown waterfront, and you can watch boats \n     floating downriver or the endless chain of planes \n     approaching Reagan National Airport. (The latter can be \n     disconcerting for first-timers; planes seem to be heading \n     directly at the Kennedy Center before banking left for a \n     landing.)\n       According to Garth Ross, director of the Kennedy Center's \n     Performing Arts for Everyone initiative, the Millennium Stage \n     sometimes makes use of the center's other venues, as when the \n     Concert Hall hosts the National Symphony Orchestra's free \n     performances because ``it's the only place we can accommodate \n     them.'' Last year's inaugural country music festival \n     concluded with 4,000 people crowding the South Plaza for a \n     Western swing dance by Asleep at the Wheel.\n       But nothing has ever been as complicated as Monday's 10th \n     anniversary celebration of the Millennium Stage, with the \n     center's three major halls offering free performances by the \n     Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in the Eisenhower Theater, \n     the NSO in the Concert Hall and indie rock icon Sufjan \n     Stevens and members of the Kennedy Center Opera House \n     Orchestra in the Opera House. The U.S. Navy jazz ensemble, \n     the Commodores, kicks things off at the regular Millennium \n     Stage. Tickets for the three shows were distributed last \n     week, but you won't need a ticket for the Grand Foyer, where \n     all the performances will be projected on large screens.\n       Ross calls Monday's celebration ``an endeavor to be all \n     things to all people in one night in a way that's \n     representative of the scope of our commitment and what we've \n     represented artistically over all these years. We're going to \n     be welcoming audiences into our three largest theaters, \n     hopefully cementing the notion that Millennium Stage is a \n     concept first, and not only a venue, but also knowing that \n     the experience of being in those theaters is part of the \n     Kennedy Center experience.''\n       It's the culmination of a decade-long effort to bring the \n     performing arts to the widest possible audience, to reduce \n     the venue's elitist image and to open its doors to younger, \n     more economically and racially diverse audiences that might \n     not otherwise venture near the marble-and-glass edifice.\n       ``It certainly feels to me that it has a much, much broader \n     constituency now than 10 years ago,'' says James A. Johnson, \n     chairman emeritus of the Kennedy Center and the man most \n     responsible for the Millennium Stage, figuratively and \n     literally. Johnson and his wife, Maxine Isaacs, were founding \n     donors to the Millennium Stage Endowment Fund (to the tune of \n     $1 million the first year), and he continues to attract \n     donors to cover the Millennium Stage's annual $1.5 million \n     budget, including current sponsors Target and the Fannie Mae \n     Foundation.\n       Johnson was chief executive of Fannie Mae before he began \n     his tenure as the Kennedy Center's fourth chairman in 1996, \n     and there is a link between his old job and the Performing \n     Arts for Everyone initiative he introduced that year. A \n     populist approach, Johnson says, ``was very much central to \n     my mind. At Fannie Mae, I had tried to be a leader in \n     diversity, in outreach to the community, particularly the \n     minority community. The phrase we used to use is we've got to \n     be unmistakably clear that this institution is not focused on \n     `white people in black tie.' ''\n       Johnson notes extensive outreach to Washington's diplomatic \n     enclaves and diverse ethnic communities and to schools. ``We \n     can't say we're doing our jobs with an appropriate memorial \n     to John F. Kennedy unless it is clearly for everyone, and \n     clearly welcoming to everybody, and we take down the barrier \n     of cost so we don't have an invisible barrier to coming to \n     the institution.''\n       And, Johnson adds, the Millennium Stage was never just an \n     experiment. ``We always saw it as an essential, core \n     commitment of the institution, to reach out to the city, to \n     the international community, to people visiting Washington \n     from around the country. It's essential that the program be \n     diverse; it's also essential that nobody need to plan or \n     arrange to do it.''\n       There is, after all, a Washington tradition of free access: \n     The Smithsonian Institution's many museums don't charge \n     admission; neither does the National Gallery of Art.\n       ``But museums don't change their collection every day,'' \n     Johnson says, adding that the Millennium Stage concept ``was \n     at a level of ambition that was substantial: Every single day \n     of the year, there will be a quality performance in the Grand \n     Foyer at 6 o'clock; no ticket required, nor reservation \n     required. Everyone's welcome.''\n       Such ambition was in keeping with the national cultural \n     center chartered by Congress in 1958 under President Dwight \n     D. Eisenhower and envisioned by President John F. Kennedy as \n     a place belonging to every American. Since its opening in \n     1971, it has become the nation's busiest arts facility, \n     presenting more than 3,300 performances a year, and became \n     home to the National Symphony Orchestra, the Washington Opera \n     and the Washington Ballet.\n       The Kennedy Center is also a major destination for \n     tourists: Three million people visit the center each year, \n     and 1.2 million stay for paid performances.\n       Although many cultural institutions offer free performances \n     in some fashion, only London's National Theatre approaches \n     the Kennedy Center, offering free pre-performance concerts in \n     its Djanogly Concert Pitch Monday through Saturday and at \n     lunchtime Saturdays. Those concerts predate the Millennium \n     Stage but are mostly chamber classical and jazz. In 1998, \n     Christopher Hogg, chairman of Reuters and the National \n     Theatre, sent a note to Johnson thanking the Kennedy Center \n     and Millennium Stage for pointing the way to ``doing what's \n     new and innovative with free programming.''\n       Hogg was acknowledging the broad spectrum of performing \n     arts offered, from chamber music and jazz to folk, comedy, \n     country and bluegrass, and loads of dance and theater both \n     homegrown and international. Ross notes the ``increased \n     presence of American roots and traditional music and world \n     roots and traditional music, areas of strength that weren't \n     areas the center already had a strong demonstrated commitment \n     to.''\n       ``It's performing arts for everyone, but not at the same \n     time,'' Ross says. ``Avant-garde jazz or new classical or \n     really traditional folk, from one show to the next, and one \n     audience to the next, it's not everyone's cup of tea, and \n     that's, in fact, our intent. That allows us to be many things \n     to many people, whereas, as an institution, we have more of \n     [a defined] vision of what we are. Millennium Stage \n     can supplement that in a sort of micro-approach.''\n       Take the Conservatory Project, which presents young artists \n     in classical music, jazz, musical theater and opera from 14 \n     leading undergraduate and graduate conservatories, colleges \n     and universities, including the Juilliard School, Berklee \n     College of Music, New England Conservatory of Music and \n     Baltimore's Peabody Conservatory of Music. Two weeklong \n     celebrations in February and May will feature top young \n     artists making their debuts in the Terrace Theater; many \n     others will appear in the Grand Foyer. As part of the 2005 \n     Festival of China, 100 pianists performed together on the \n     South Plaza; 96 of them were conservatory students.\n       ``Our commitment to presenting students is tied in to our \n     commitment to arts and education and the role that a national \n     arts organization, can, should and, in this case, does play \n     in that,'' says Ross, adding that it doesn't hurt for people \n     to be able to say they've performed at the Kennedy Center. \n     Although the focus is on a mix of graduate, undergraduate and \n     postgraduate students, Millennium Stage also works with top \n     public school arts programs across the country and a dozen \n     regional school districts during March's Music in Our Schools \n     programs.\n       Ross says the Millennium Stage is also a platform for \n     partnerships with embassies and presenting organizations that \n     ``highlight Washington's role in the cultural fabric of \n     America and the world.'' That has allowed for performances by \n     such great artists as Juanes, Senegal's Youssou N'Dour and \n     Nigeria's King Sunny Ade, France's Les Nubians and the \n     Congolese ensemble Konono No. 1.\n       Roland Celette, cultural attache at the Embassy of France, \n     says the Millennium Stage has presented a wide variety of \n     French performers--``from very classical music and \n     contemporary dance to folk music, jazz and a cappella \n     ensembles''--as part of, and apart from, the 2004 Festival of \n     France. Celette says the French Embassy invites groups ``that \n     are not so famous but are very good, so it's a good way for \n     them to get through. . . . Of course, it's very nice for them \n     to have on their resume an appearance at the Kennedy Center--\n     it has a big prestige--and they very much appreciate that \n     everything is recorded and put on the Web site.''\n       Other partners include the American Folklife Center at the \n     Library of Congress, which annually presents ``Homegrown: The \n     Music of America'' at the library and the Millennium Stage, \n     and the Smithsonian's annual Folklife Festival. There is some \n     theater and storytelling and a good amount of dance. Much of \n     the latter comes via international programming, but the \n     Millennium Stage commissions three new modern dance works \n     every year.\n\n[[Page S1574]]\n\n       According to Ross, a father of two, Millennium Stage events \n     are perfect starter concerts. ``Since there are no tickets \n     involved, they offer families flexibility because they do not \n     have to commit to a performance ahead of time. It's at a \n     family-friendly hour, and the hour [length] is family-\n     friendly. The [6 p.m. start] was not instituted specifically \n     for families but around the start times of [regular] \n     performances, usually 7:30 or later, but it's a big reason it \n     has been so attractive to families. And it's real performing \n     arts in a real environment.'' And should anyone get \n     restless--that applies to kids and parents--they can take a \n     walk on the River Terrace and come back.\n       A Millennium Stage audience can swell to several thousand \n     for well-known artists such as Patti Smith, Frank Sinatra Jr. \n     or Los Lobos. Certain annual events draw huge crowds, such as \n     the Merry TubaChristmas concert (which can feature as many as \n     100 tubas) and the All-Star Christmas Day Jazz Jam, now \n     dedicated to Keter Betts, the genial bassist who hosted the \n     concert and helped turn it into a Washington tradition that \n     draws overflow crowds every year. Those crowds can be quite \n     active--whether led in rousing scat song by Bobby McFerrin, \n     250 hand drummers loudly supporting the Hong Kong Chinese \n     Orchestra or the summer parties that set feet flying to all \n     sorts of dance rhythms.\n       Washington jazz drummer and vibraphonist Chuck Redd has a \n     long history with the Millennium Stage: He played its opening \n     night with Billy Taylor and Charlie Byrd and has performed \n     there more than two dozen times with his own group, as a \n     guest artist with others and as part of the Christmas Day \n     jams.\n       ``I always enjoy it,'' Redd says. ``It's been one of the \n     best things about the arts scene in Washington for many \n     years, and they're very receptive to booking local and \n     regional musicians.'' Redd points out that people going to \n     the Kennedy Center for an opera or dance performance may be \n     exposed to a jazz concert for the first time, ``so it's been \n     absolutely wonderful for the [jazz] community.''\n       For far-flung family, too: Redd's 15-year-old son, Charlie, \n     a guitarist, has been a guest with dad in recent years, ``and \n     all our relatives and friends around the country can watch'' \n     on the Internet. Also able to watch are club owners and \n     concert presenters, Redd says, adding that archived Internet \n     performances serve as ``an instant demo video around the \n     country. Also, the sound is always excellent, and it's rare \n     you get that in what's not actually a concert hall. I hope we \n     celebrate the 40th anniversary some day.''

S.B. WOO\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge and \ncommend the efforts of Dr. Shien Biau ``S.B.'' Woo.\n  Dr. Woo was born in 1937 in Shanghai, China. On October 1, 1949, Mao \nZedong and the Communist Party took control and established the \nPeople's Republic of China. After living under communist rule for \nnearly 6 years, S.B. Woo and his parents came to the United States in \n1955 to begin a new life in America.\n  S.B. Woo took full advantage of this opportunity and earned bachelor \nof science degrees in mathematics and physics from Georgetown College \nin Kentucky.\n  In 1963, S.B. married his wife, Katy, a gifted and accomplished \nperson in her own right. The Woos have been married for nearly 44 years \nand they have two children, Chi I. and Chi Lan.\n  S.B. Woo continued his academic career by attaining his Ph.D. in \nphysics from Washington University in St. Louis in 1964. Two years \nlater, he joined the faculty at the University of Delaware, where he \nbecame a professor of physics and astronomy.\n  Dr. Woo has authored numerous scholarly works in the cutting-edge \nfield of physics, with such titles as ``Role of Core Size in the \nPhotoelectron Spectrum of Ions with Multiple Detachment Orbitals'' and \n``Zero Core Contribution Calculation of Photodetachment Cross Sections \nand Photoelectron Spectra of Transition Metal Anions.'' Now, I'm not \nexactly sure what these texts are about, but I am sure that S.B. could \nnot only explain them, but that he could explain them in such a way \nthat we would all understand.\n  In 2002, Dr. Woo retired from teaching, capping a nearly 36-year \ncareer at the University of Delaware. He is still rightfully considered \nby many to be one of the leading experts in the field of physics in our \nNation.\n  While his academic prowess is to be admired, Dr. Woo's greatest \ncontribution has been his steadfast commitment to advancing the cause \nof Asian Americans in Delaware and across America.\n  Dr. Woo became the first Asian American to serve in statewide office \nin Delaware when he was elected lieutenant governor in 1984. With this \nvictory, Dr. Woo became the highest ranking Chinese-American public \noffice holder in the Nation.\n  Dr. Woo's experience as an immigrant from China gave him a firsthand \nview of what it is like to come to a new land and begin to build a new \nlife from scratch. While many people would have been satisfied with the \nsuccess that Dr. Woo found in his chosen fields of physics and \npolitics, he continues his work to improve the way of life for his \nfellow Asian Americans.\n  He has worked tirelessly to bring people into the political fold, \nworking to increase voter turnout by reaching out to Asian Americans \nacross the country and encouraging them to become active in the \npolitical process.\n  Today, he also serves as a trustee of the University of Delaware; an \nInstitute Fellow at the Institute of Politics, the Kennedy School of \nGovernment, Harvard University; and as the National President of the \nOrganization of Chinese Americans.\n  I honor and commend my good friend Dr. S.B. Woo for his continued \nservice to the State of Delaware and to Asian Americans across this \ngreat country. He is a remarkable yet humble man who has overcome many \nobstacles to reach the top of his chosen fields, and he continues to \nthis day work to improve the lives of others. I consider it a privilege \nto know S.B. and Katy Woo and to be able to stand here today to speak \non their behalf in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1574-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF ROBERT CRAWFORD\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment \ntoday to honor the distinguished civil service career of a particularly \nremarkable Iowan. Mr. Robert ``Bob'' Crawford will be retiring shortly \nfrom his civilian service to the Department of the Army and in doing so \nwill leave behind a legacy of exceptional support and dedication to his \nwork and to his country.\n  Over the years, Bob Crawford has amassed a series of professional \naccomplishments that are truly outstanding. His commitment to his work \nhas earned him a Commander's Award for Civilian Service and he has \ntwice been awarded the Superior Civilian Service Award. Bob's hard \nwork, honesty, and leadership have become defining characteristics of \nhis career and he has earned the respect of his colleagues and peers \nfor his many years of expertise.\n  Bob Crawford currently works as the Deputy to the commander for the \nU.S. Army Joint Munitions Command, JMC, where he is entrusted to \nmaintain the development and production of the ammunition supply for \nour brave service men and women overseas. Before serving in this \ncapacity, Bob worked in a number of different roles within the \nammunition production industry, ranging from a production engineer, to \na production director, to a deputy for operations, and finally to his \ncurrent position. While his responsibilities have shifted and grown \nover the years, Bob Crawford's commitment to the values of the \nDepartment of the Army has remained as steadfast and unwavering as \never.\n  As early as his time at the University of Illinois and then at St. \nAmbrose University, Bob has been distinguishing himself within his \nfield and I am glad to be able to congratulate him and honor his \nmagnificent career as it now comes to a close. I wish Bob and his wife \nSharon and their children in Bettendorf, IA, the very best of luck for \nthe future and I thank him for his 25 years of public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1574-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1574-S1575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HERMAN COLEMAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to honor the life of Mr. Herman Coleman. Herman was an \noutstanding and dedicated public servant whose influence, knowledge and \nachievements were widely\n\n[[Page S1575]]\n\nknown and highly regarded. Over the course of more than 30 years, \nHerman held several important positions within the State of Michigan, \non the national level and in the private sector. His efforts have made \na broad impact.\n  Herman began his career with the Michigan Education Association, \nwhere he would ultimately become the Association's first African-\nAmerican executive director/ chief administrator. Among other \nachievements, Herman was an integral part of statewide deliberations \nregarding the desegregation of Michigan's school districts.\n  His successful tenure with the MEA led to his appointment as \nAssistant to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education. As \nAssistant Secretary, Herman drafted Executive Order No. 12232, which \nprovided the framework for increased Federal assistance to historically \nBlack colleges and universities. This order remains in effect today. \nHerman would continue his efforts to improve and reform education \npolicy after leaving the U.S. Department of Education.\n  In 1985, Herman was appointed by Governor Blanchard as the first \nAfrican-American chief executive officer of the State of Michigan \nInsurance Department. After a successful tenure with the department, \nHerman sought to make his mark in the private sector as vice president \nof corporate relations for AAA Michigan, where he oversaw AAA's \ncommunity relations and governmental affairs departments. Herman then \nmoved to the health care arena as a consultant for the Potomac Group \nConsultants, and, in 1994, began service as both partner/marketing \ndirector and managing partner of the Insured Vehicle Identification \nNetwork, IVIN.\n  Herman Coleman's strong leadership and pioneering efforts throughout \nhis lifetime are evidenced by his many achievements and by the many \nawards and honors bestowed upon him. His legacy will reverberate for \nmany years. I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in honoring the \nlife of Mr. Herman Coleman and in offering the most sincere condolences \nto his daughters, Hope and Heather, the rest of his family and to his \nmany colleagues and friends. He will truly be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1575-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  The following messages from the President of the United States were \ntransmitted to the Senate by one of his secretaries:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1575-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO THE INTERDICTION OF AIRCRAFT ENGAGED IN ILLICIT DRUG \n                           TRAFFICKING--PM 3\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with the authorities relating to official immunity in the \ninterdiction of aircraft engaged in illicit drug trafficking (Public \nLaw 107-108, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2291-4), and in order to keep the \nCongress fully informed, I am providing a report prepared by my \nAdministration.

Throughout our history, we have \novercome great challenges by drawing on the strength, creativity, and \nresolve of the American people. We have adapted to change--while \nmaintaining our commitment to freedom and an open economy.\n  Our economy is strong and growing, Federal revenues are robust, and \nwe have made significant progress in reducing the deficit. The Budget I \nam presenting achieves balance by 2012. My formula for a balanced \nbudget reflects the priorities of our country at this moment in its \nhistory: protecting the homeland and fighting terrorism, keeping the \neconomy strong with low taxes, and keeping spending under control while \nmaking Federal programs more effective.\n  As Commander in Chief, my highest priority is the security of our \nNation. My Budget invests substantial resources to fight the Global War \non Terror, and ensure our homeland is protected from those who would do \nus harm. We will transform our military to meet the new threats of the \n21st Century and provide the brave men and women on the front lines \nwith the resources they need to be successful in this decisive \nideological struggle. The Budget will support a new strategy in Iraq \nthat demands more from Iraq's elected government, and gives American \nforces in Iraq the reinforcements they need to complete their mission. \nAnd it will continue to provide the tools necessary to keep America \nsafe by detecting, disrupting, and dismantling terrorist plots.\n  The U.S. economy is strong. Since August 2003, 7.2 million jobs have \nbeen created. Unemployment is low. Wages are growing. Productivity is \nstrong. Inflation and interest rates are low. And we have seen \ntremendous progress despite a series of challenges, including \nrecession, the terrorist attacks of 2001, corporate scandals, the \ncostliest natural disaster in our Nation's history, energy price \nspikes, and a temporary slowdown in the housing sector. The resilience \nof our economy is a tribute to America's workers and entrepreneurs. And \nwell-timed, pro-growth tax policies helped create the right climate for \ninnovation and entrepreneurship.\n  The Federal deficit is declining and on a path to elimination. Last \nyear, we successfully met our goal of cutting the deficit in half, \nthree years ahead of schedule. This occurred because tax relief helped \nthe economy to recover and grow, resulting in record-high revenues \nwhile we restrained non-security discretionary spending. With continued \nstrong economic growth and spending discipline, we are now positioned \nto\n\n[[Page S1576]]\n\nbalance the budget by 2012, while providing for our national security \nand making tax relief permanent.\n  My Budget proposes to keep non-\nsecurity discretionary spending below inflation for the next five \nyears. My Budget also reforms projects and spending that don't get the \njob done. We need lawmakers' support to help us accomplish this goal--\nincluding reforms that will improve the Congressional budget process.\n  To bolster public confidence in the Government's ability to manage \ntaxpayers' money successfully, Congress should adopt earmark reform. \nThe earmark process should be made more transparent, ending the \npractice of concealing earmarks in so-called report language never \nincluded in legislation. The number and cost of earmarks should be cut \nby at least half by the end of this session. I have also called on \nCongress to adopt the legislative line-item veto, which gives the \nLegislative and Executive Branches a tool to help eliminate wasteful \nspending. These common-sense reforms will help prevent billions of \ntaxpayers' dollars from being spent on unnecessary and unjustified \nprojects.\n  To keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of \nentitlements. Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are commitments \nof conscience, and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound. If \nwe do not address this challenge, we will one day leave our children \nwith three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and \nimmediate cuts in benefits.\n  In the short term, my Budget works to slow the rate of growth of \nthese programs, saving $96 billion over five years. This Administration \nis also actively working with Congress to comprehensively reform and \nimprove these vital programs so they will be strong for the next \ngenerations of Americans.\n  I am optimistic about the future of our country. We are an \nentrepreneurial and hard-working Nation. And while we face great \nchallenges, we enjoy great opportunities. This Budget reflects our \nhighest priorities while reducing the deficit and achieving a balanced \nbudget by 2012. I am confident that this approach will help make our \ncountry more secure and more prosperous.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to improve efficiency in the Federal Government \nthrough the use of green buildings, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President. I rise to introduce the Green Buildings \nAct of 2007. This bill is intended to continue the hard work of our \nformer colleague\n\n[[Page S1578]]\n\nfrom Vermont, Senator Jim Jeffords, and would place an emphasis on \nenergy efficient and healthy building environments.\n  In the opening weeks of this 110th Congress we have seen a \nsignificant focus on the future energy security and environmental \nhealth of our Nation and indeed the world. Much attention has been paid \nto the issue of global climate change and it is my firm belief that not \nonly are the energy and environmental challenges that we face today \nvaried, but that our solutions must be multi-faceted. In order to meet \nthe rising demands of a growing world population and its expanding \neconomies, we need to address the way we create energy, conserve \nenergy, and preserve the environment.\n  Green Buildings are structures that are designed and built with \nenergy-efficient and renewable materials to conserve energy and \nenvironmental resources. These buildings last longer, use less energy, \nand promote a healthier environment for those who may work or live in \nthem. Green buildings have reduced electricity, heating, and cooling \nrequirements; use less water; and may even use renewable sources of \nwater and electricity. Recent volatility in energy costs and \nconstraints on the electricity grid in much of the U.S. have led \ndevelopers to explore the potential economic benefits of these \nefficient buildings as well. It is my belief that green buildings will \nbecome a significant contributor to America's energy conservation \nefforts and that is why I am introducing this bill today.\n  The proposal I offer today is one small step in the right direction \nand draws upon a bill approved by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee in 2006. The federal government is already setting an example \nin energy efficiency under the leadership of the White House and \nDepartment of Energy. This bill will take the next step and create an \noffice within the General Services Administration (GSA) to oversee \ngreen building initiatives within the Federal Government and provide \nsupport for information to State and local governments as well as the \nprivate sector. With almost 9,000 buildings and 340 million square feet \nof space, the GSA has the experience and expertise to manage this \neffort for the Federal Government. The Office of Green Buildings at the \nGSA will be advised by a Green Buildings Council to be comprised of \nFederal, State, local, and private sector participants to establish \nguidelines and create resources for public and private builders across \nthe country. It is my hope that the use of green buildings in the \nFederal real estate portfolio will contribute to increased health of \nthe public, productivity of work, and conservation of energy.\n  While some portions of the private sector have caught on to the many \nbenefits of green or ``sustainable design,'' this bill's establishment \nof grants through the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) to assist \nschool systems in their school construction efforts will bring these \nbenefits to the places our children spend so much of their time and the \nfacilities that consume a significant amount of energy in our \ncommunities. In addition to grants to school systems, the bill would \ncreate an indoor air quality program for Federal buildings, encourage \nincentives for Federal agencies, and authorize research and \ndemonstration projects in each of the four climatic regions of the \nUnited States. The bill is modest in scope, authorizing $50 million \nover 5 years to begin this most important effort in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I know many of you share in my desire to advance our Nation's \nconservation agenda. Indeed, many have supported the efforts of our \nrecently retired colleague from Vermont and have your own ideas. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee as we move this proposal \nforward. Green Buildings will be a significant part of our country's \nenergy and environmental future and this bill will help us in that \neffort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 490. A bill to provide for the return of the Fresnel Lens to the \nlantern room atop Presque Isle Light Station Lighthouse, Michigan, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lester \nNichols Presque Isle Light Station Act of 2007.\n  The Presque Isle Light Station Act requires the return of the \nhistoric third order Fresnel lens to the lighthouse in Presque Isle, \nMI. The lens was removed four years ago for restoration work, but now \nit is time to replace it and preserve the historic integrity of the \nbeautiful Presque Isle lighthouse.\n  Michigan has more lighthouses than any other State. Not only are \nthese historic structures symbolic of our maritime heritage, they are \nthe heart of Michigan's coastal communities. Lighthouses are a key part \nof the tourist economy of many small Michigan towns, and the historic \ncharacter of our lighthouses brings tourists from all over the country. \nSo it is imperative that we protect, restore, and preserve the Presque \nIsle lighthouse and all of Michigan's 120 lighthouses.\n  I am pleased to introduce this legislation with Senator Levin. In the \nHouse of Representatives, Congressman Stupak is the sponsor of a \ncompanion bill. So the Michigan delegation is united in our resolve to \nrestore the Fresnel lens to the Presque Isle lighthouse for the \nenjoyment and education of future generations.\n  Finally, I want to say a word about the man for whom we have named \nthis bill: Lester Nichols. Without Les Nichols' dedication we would \nnever have been able to restore Presque Isle's Fresnel lens. Last fall, \nLes lost his courageous battle against cancer. He was a pillar of his \ncommunity. He was passionate about the Presque Isle lighthouse and he \nwill be truly missed. Naming this bill for him is the least we can do \nto show our gratitude for all of his work. And I hope that we will soon \nbe able to put the Fresnel lens back in the lighthouse and give Les the \nvictory that he so wanted to see.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1578-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1578-S1579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 69--RECOGNIZING THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN SPIRITUAL AS A \n                           NATIONAL TREASURE\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Obama, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Biden, Mr. Levin, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Dole, Mrs. Clinton, \nMr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Kennedy) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 69\n\n       Whereas since slavery was introduced into the European \n     colonies in 1619, enslaved Africans remained in bondage until \n     the United States ratified the 13th amendment to the \n     Constitution in 1865;\n       Whereas during that period in the history of the United \n     States, the first expression of a unique American music was \n     created by enslaved African-Americans who--\n       (1) used their knowledge of the English language and the \n     Christian religious faith, as it had been taught to them in \n     the New World; and\n       (2) stealthily wove within the music their experience of \n     coping with human servitude and their strong desire to be \n     free;\n       Whereas as a method of survival, enslaved African-Americans \n     who were forbidden to speak their native languages, play \n     musical instruments they had used in Africa, or practice \n     their traditional religious beliefs, relied on their strong \n     African oral tradition of songs, stories, proverbs, and \n     historical accounts to create an original genre of music, now \n     known as spirituals;\n       Whereas Calvin Earl, a noted performer of, and educator on, \n     African-American spirituals, remarked that the Christian \n     lyrics became a metaphor for freedom from slavery, a secret \n     way for slaves to ``communicate with each other, teach their \n     children, record their history, and heal their pain'';\n       Whereas the New Jersey Historical Commission found that \n     ``some of those daring and artful runaway slaves who entered \n     New Jersey by way of the Underground Railroad no doubt sang \n     the words of old Negro spirituals like `Steal Away' before \n     embarking on their perilous journey north'';\n       Whereas African-American spirituals spread all over the \n     United States, and the songs we know of today may represent \n     only a small portion of the total number of spirituals that \n     once existed;\n       Whereas Frederick Douglass, a fugitive slave who would \n     become one of the leading abolitionists in the United States, \n     remarked that spirituals ``told a tale of woe which was then \n     altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones \n     loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint \n     of souls boiling over with the bitterest\n\n[[Page S1579]]\n\n     anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery and a \n     prayer to God for deliverance from chains.''; and\n       Whereas section 2(a)(1) of the American Folklife \n     Preservation Act (20 U.S.C. 2101(a)(1)) states that ``the \n     diversity inherent in American folklife has contributed \n     greatly to the cultural richness of the Nation and has \n     fostered a sense of individuality and identity among the \n     American people'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that African-American spirituals are a \n     poignant and powerful genre of music that have become one of \n     the most significant segments of American music in existence;\n       (2) expresses the deepest gratitude, recognition, and honor \n     to the former enslaved Africans in the United States for \n     their gifts to the Nation, including their original music and \n     oral history; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to reflect \n     on the important contribution of African-American spirituals \n     to United States history and to recognize the African-\n     American spiritual as a national treasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1579-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 70--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nCOMMANDER OF MULTINATIONAL FORCES-IRAQ AND ALL UNITED STATES PERSONNEL \n    UNDER HIS COMMAN SHOULD RECEIVE FROM CONGRESS THE FULL SUPPORT \n        NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT THE UNITED STATES MISSION IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Graham, Mr. Cornyn, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Thune, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Roberts) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 70\n\n       Whereas more than 137,000 members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States are currently serving in Iraq, like \n     thousands of others since March 2003, with the bravery and \n     professionalism consistent with the finest traditions of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States, and deserve the support of \n     all Americans;\n       Whereas past mistakes in United States strategy, aggression \n     by various groups that reject peace, and other difficulties \n     have contributed to a dire security situation in Iraq \n     characterized by insurgent activity and sectarian violence;\n       Whereas a failed state in Iraq would present a threat to \n     regional and world peace, and the long-term security \n     interests of the United States are best served by an Iraq \n     that can sustain, govern, and defend itself;\n       Whereas no amount of additional United States forces in \n     Iraq can effect this outcome in Iraq unless the people and \n     Government of Iraq take difficult political steps toward \n     reconciliation;\n       Whereas the establishment of a basic level of security in \n     Baghdad and throughout Iraq is an essential precondition for \n     reconciliation and political and economic progress in Iraq;\n       Whereas these steps must include the fulfillment of \n     military, political, and economic commitments that the \n     Government of Iraq has made to the United States and to the \n     people of Iraq;\n       Whereas Iraqi political leaders must show visible progress \n     toward meeting specific benchmarks, including--\n       (1) deploying a significant number of new Iraqi security \n     forces to partner with United States units in securing \n     Baghdad;\n       (2) assuming responsibility for security in all provinces \n     in Iraq in a timely manner;\n       (3) disarming individual militias as circumstances warrant \n     and ensuring that security forces are accountable to the \n     central government and loyal to the constitution of Iraq;\n       (4) ensuring equitable distribution of the resources of the \n     Government of Iraq without regard to the sect or ethnicity of \n     recipients;\n       (5) enacting and implementing legislation to ensure that \n     the oil resources of Iraq benefit Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, \n     Kurds, and other Iraqi citizens in an equitable manner;\n       (6) building an effective, independent judiciary that will \n     uphold the rule of law and ensure equal protection under the \n     law for all citizens of Iraq;\n       (7) pursuing all those who engage in violence or threaten \n     the security of the Iraqi population, regardless of sect or \n     political affiliation;\n       (8) enacting and implementing legislation that reforms the \n     de-Ba'athification process in Iraq;\n       (9) conducting provincial elections in Iraq;\n       (10) ensuring a fair process for amending the constitution \n     of Iraq; and\n       (11) expending promised funds to provide basic services and \n     employment opportunities for all Iraqis, including a \n     $10,000,000,000 fund for reconstruction, and ensuring that \n     these funds reach both Sunni and Shia areas, including Sunni \n     neighborhoods in Baghdad and largely Sunni Anbar Province;\n       Whereas the United States Ambassador to Iraq and the \n     Commander of Multinational Forces-Iraq should report each \n     month to the Senate on the progress being made by Iraqis \n     toward achieving the benchmarks specified in the preceding \n     clause and on their own progress in achieving their missions \n     in Iraq;\n       Whereas leaders in the Administration of President George \n     W.

Res. 71\n\n       Whereas, after the collapse of the Somali government in \n     1991, the main judicial system in Somalia devolved into a \n     system of sharia-based Islamic courts, which have increased \n     their power to include security and enforcement functions;\n       Whereas, in 2000, the courts consolidated to form the \n     Islamic Courts Union (ICU), which came into conflict with \n     secular warlords in the capitol city of Mogadishu by \n     asserting its ever increasing power;\n       Whereas, the ICU is known to have links to Al-Qaeda and has \n     provided a safe haven for members of Al-Qaeda;\n       Whereas, by June 2006, ICU forces controlled Mogadishu and \n     much of southern Somalia, creating a potential haven for \n     Islamic terrorists;\n       Whereas, in 2004, the Transitional Federal Government of \n     the Somali Republic (TFG) was formed in Kenya;\n       Whereas, in 2006, the TFG army joined forces with the army \n     of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to sweep the \n     ICU from power and, after a string of swift military \n     victories, enter Mogadishu; and\n       Whereas, the current situation is still volatile, creating \n     a short window of opportunity to positively affect Somalia's \n     stability and future status:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Senate expresses its support for the Transitional \n     Federal Government of the Somali Republic;\n       (2) the Senate recognizes Ethiopia, particularly Prime \n     Minister Meles, and Kenya for the noble efforts aimed toward \n     pursuing peace in Somalia and support for the United States \n     in the War on Terror;\n       (3) the United States should support and push efforts for \n     serious multi-party talks aimed at establishing a national \n     unity government in Somalia;\n       (4) the United States should take several measures, at an \n     appropriate time, to promote stability;\n       (5) assistance from the United States will better equip the \n     TFG to face the challenges of restoring peace to this war-\n     torn country;\n       (6) the United States should promote foreign investment in \n     Somalia and facilitate financial and technical assistance to \n     the TFG; and\n       (7) the United States should aid the TFG to--\n       (A) locate and free Somali-owned financial assets \n     throughout the world;\n       (B) solicit support from other friendly countries; and\n       (C) encourage nongovernmental organizations to commit more \n     resources and projects to Somalia.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, recent events in Somalia have opened a \nunique window of opportunity. The Islamic Courts have been militarily \ndefeated. However, the Ethiopian troops that are currently maintaining \norder have stated that they have no intention of remaining. There are \nreports of\n\n[[Page S1580]]\n\ntroop withdrawals back to the Ethiopian border. Without outside support \nI fear that the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and Somalia as a \nwhole will be swept back into the cycle of violence and chaos that has \ndefined the country for the past 15 years.\n  I believe that the United States can make great progress in securing \nthe Horn of Africa by what actions we take right now. First and \nforemost is security. Until the government troops can offer sustainable \nstability, we need to assist them. This solution need not include U.S. \ntroops; I am aware of negotiations for the deployment of 8,000 troops \nfrom other African countries, including a force of about 1,000 from \nUganda. Any efforts in this direction should be greatly encouraged.\n  The United States has no formal representative to the Somali \nRepublic. The Transitional Federal Government has requested creating \nsuch a position.\n  We need to offer assistance and aid at this most crucial juncture. At \nan appropriate time the U.S. should encourage public and private \ninvestment, possibly through a trade mission. Other areas where help is \ngreatly needed include security training, basic sanitation, water \npurification, and tax collection.\n  Perhaps most importantly, we should assist in any steps that can be \ntaken to establish a national unity government. This will require \ngroups from all sides of the spectrum getting together and working out \nserious solutions.\n  The United States can make great progress in securing the Horn of \nAfrica by what actions we take right now. I am submitting a resolution \nexpressing the following: support for the Transitional Federal \nGovernment; recognize Ethiopia, particularly Prime Minister Meles, and \nKenya for the noble efforts aimed toward pursuing peace in Somalia and \nsupport for the United States in the War on Terror; and the U.S. should \nsupport and push efforts for serious multi-party talks aimed at \nestablishing a national unity government.\n  There are a number of measures that should be taken at an appropriate \ntime by the United States to promote stability. With the assistance of \nthe U.S., the TFG will be better equipped to face the challenges of \nrestoring peace to this war-torn country.\n  While I understand that the situation is volatile and some forms of \nassistance may not be immediately appropriate, I believe it is \nnecessary to raise awareness that there are definite ways that we can \naffect progress. Please join me in supporting Somalia and bringing \npeace to this war-torn region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/05/senate-section/article/S1580-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 231.
