Mr. President, on January 11, 2 months ago--it seems \nincredible it has been that long ago, but it has been--President Bush \nannounced his new war plan, the so-called surge. At that time, \nadministration officials gave the American people the strong impression \nthe President's plan would require the temporary--temporary--deployment \nof 21,500 new troops in Iraq. During the last several days, news \nreports confirm this new plan was nothing more than a bait and switch, \na new name for an old, failed policy.\n  First we learned that 21,500 troops cited by the President did not \ninclude support in other elements and the true number of additional \ntroops associated with his proposal could have been as many as 40,000 \ntroops. Then, over the weekend, we learned two other troubling facts \nabout the President's plan.\n  In the wake of continued violence in Iraq that prompted one of our \ntop generals there to call for more troops, the American commander in \nIraq, General Petraeus, made it clear still more troops are needed. \nEven more disconcerting, according to a recent New York Times report:\n\n       Military officials in Iraq have indicated they would need a \n     large American troop presence for at least a year and \n     probably for longer to achieve lasting stability.\n\n  President Bush is not surging; he is sustaining his failed policy. \nThe consequences of the President's flawed policy in Iraq are \nstaggering. Yesterday, three more American troops were killed. We are \nfast approaching 3,200 dead Americans. We may be there; last count was \n3,195. More than 25,000 now have been wounded. It has stretched our \nmilitary, it has eroded our veterans health care system, and plunged \nIraq deeper and deeper into chaos. No matter how one looks at it, \nAmerica is less safe today because this President has waged war in \nIraq. We must change course, and it is time for the Senate to demand he \ndo it.\n  Soon, the Senate will again have that opportunity to tell the \nPresident to change course. We have been blocked in efforts to have the \ndebate on Iraq.\n\n[[Page S2992]]\n\nLast week we offered the Republicans yet another opportunity to debate. \nIt is my hope they will agree to this debate on Wednesday morning.\n  I appreciate very much the Republican leader voting for cloture. We \nare going to finish that bill tomorrow.\n  It is my hope they will agree to this debate so we can complete this \nimportant work; that is, the 9/11 bill, and then turn our attention to \nthe war.\n  America is losing about 20 soldiers a week, about 3 a day, and \nspending $280 million a day in Iraq. It is a downward spiral that will \ncontinue unless the Senate joins the American people in demanding a new \ndirection in Iraq.\n  The war hangs over all we do in the Senate this year. Even if we \ndebate this week, we will not be done. We are getting something from \nthe House on the supplemental and we will return to this issue of the \nsupplemental, very likely, and we will continue until there is a change \nof course. There is very much work to do--the priorities everyone knows \nabout, such as immigration, stem cell; we have the budget ahead of us. \nThere are also issues such as the crisis in the judiciary and the \nintelligence authorization bill, that will demand our attention in the \nweeks ahead. I hope we can promptly complete action on the 9/11 bill \ntomorrow, and I am confident we will do that. We have so much to do.\n  There is a lot of negativity about what we do here in the Senate, but \nwhen you sort through all of it, and I recognize the war in Iraq is \nhanging over everything we have done--but when you look at what we have \ndone these past few weeks in the history of the 110th Congress, we have \ndone OK. We have been able to do the work on ethics and lobbying. We \nhave done the minimum wage bill. We completed the continuing resolution \nand we are going to complete 9/11 legislation soon. It appears we are \ngoing to be able to do the reform of the Attorney General's problems \nthat have been so much in the press recently. We have confirmed the \nonly appellate court judge who has been brought to the floor. We hope \nto do another one within the next week or so. We now have another one \non the calendar, so we will do that. The Judiciary Committee has three \nover there they are looking at now. I know the distinguished Republican \nleader is very concerned about moving appellate judges. We are going to \ndo our best to cooperate with him in that regard.\n  Simply in closing my remarks today, I recognize we have a difficult \nsituation with Iraq. Sometimes we need to sort through all that and \nrecognize we have been able to accomplish a lot, and it has been done--\nthe only way it can get done--on a bipartisan basis. We have had a few \nbumps in the road, but if we are patient and willing to recognize there \nwill be bumps in the future, even having both sides not hold any \ngrudges--legislative grudges, at least--I think we have the ability to \ndo a lot more in this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/12/senate-section/article/S2992-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are fortunate it has been almost 6 \nyears since we have been attacked here at home. There is only one \nreason for that: We have been on the offense in Afghanistan and in \nIraq. A lot of the terrorists who murdered over 3,000 of our innocent \ncivilians in New York on that fateful day are dead. Others of them are \nincarcerated in Guantanamo Bay, and many others are on the run and \ndodging our military. That part of the war on terror has been an \nextraordinary success.\n  Iraq has not come together in terms of the Government as quickly as \nwe had hoped, and Afghanistan is still a challenge. But I wonder if our \ngood friends on the other side of the aisle have any answers to the \nquestion: What happens if we precipitously leave? I gather the most \nrecent--in fact, the 17th--different version of Iraq resolutions we are \ngoing to see later this week anticipates basically telling the enemy a \ndate on which we will depart. I can remember when most of our friends \non the other side of the aisle thought that was a bad idea, but I \ngather their views must be evolving as to what kind of strategy might \nbe helpful. One thing is clear: If we announce to the enemy when we are \nleaving, they will come back on that day.\n  So we will have another Iraq debate this week, and as the majority \nleader indicated, there will be yet another Iraq debate when the \nsupplemental is before us in a few weeks. This is a debate we are more \nthan willing to engage in.\n  I would say to the majority leader, as I indicated last week, it \nwould have been possible, I think, to have gotten a unanimous consent \nagreement to deal with the stem cell issue in a rather short period of \ntime had we chosen to take up another issue that was in the six in 2006 \nlist of commitments the new Democratic majority made to the American \npeople. Having said that, I will be in discussions with the majority \nleader today and tomorrow about how we might go forward on the Iraq \ndebate. It is certainly his prerogative as the leader of the majority \nto determine what issue we proceed to, and he and I will meet later \ntoday and be discussing that today and tomorrow.\n  As far as the 9/11 bill is concerned, I supported cloture on that \nbill. We are anxious to go on and finish it and we should be able to do \nthat after lunch tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/12/senate-section/article/S2992-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for weeks, I have been coming to the floor to \ndiscuss the signs of progress we are beginning to see as the military \nimplements our new strategy in Iraq. Recent developments are \nencouraging. They include the following:\n  First of all, the Iraqi Cabinet approved a national oil compact, \nwhich is the beginning of a resolution of what to do with the revenues \nthat are produced from the oil that is produced in Iraq. It is a vital \nstep in ensuring a united Iraq, and Prime Minister Maliki called it a \n``gift to all of the Iraqi people.'' This is expected to be approved by \nthe Iraqi legislature this spring.\n  Next is the capture recently of Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the leader of \nal-Qaida in Iraq, the successor to al-Zarqawi, in the western outskirts \nof Baghdad. This represents a continuing increase in the number of \nterrorist chiefs who have been killed or captured.\n  Just last week, the Iraqi neighbors meeting was held. It generated a \nlot of press because both U.S. and Iranian representatives were \npresent. It involved all 16 nations involved in the conflict. It was \nthe neighbors of Iraq, as well as countries such as Great Britain and \nthe United States. It was the largest meeting of foreign countries in \nIraq since the summit meeting of the Arab League members in March of \n1990. There were working groups established to work on various problems \nall the countries had--for example, refugees from Iraq who have gone \ninto Syria or Jordan. A special working group was created to try to \ndeal with that issue.\n  This represents a step forward, all of which illustrates the fact \nthat not only is the new strategy being implemented a military one but \nit involves diplomatic and economic and political factors as well.\n\n[[Page S2993]]\n\n  It was interesting that the Prime Minister toured Baghdad to \nillustrate the security part of the new strategy that is beginning to \nwork. He had been largely confined to the relatively safe Green Zone, \nas it is called, but on Sunday, he was able to go outside the wire to \ntour a power station, visit with police, and shake hands with ordinary \nBaghdad citizens. He attributed his newfound freedom of movement to the \nsuccess of the Baghdad security plan, and he committed to redouble his \nefforts, saying: This operation will be accelerated at all levels in \nnumbers and weaponry; we will not back down.\n  You have also seen successes in places such as Sadr City, where it is \npretty clear that the Shiite militias have decided to stand down and \nnot contest the Iraqi and American forces.\n  In fact, at the conclusion of my remarks, I will have printed in the \nRecord two newspaper articles. One was written for the Washington Post \non March 11, called ``The `Surge' is Succeeding,'' by Robert Kagan. \nWhile the leaders in Iraq are not yet willing to publicly say the surge \nis succeeding, clearly evidence of that is on the ground, and at least \nthe media--journalists--are entitled to conclude from what is happening \nthat it is succeeding.\n  I was in Iraq a couple of weeks ago and was briefed by General \nOdierno and General Petraeus, as well as others. They all were \ncautiously optimistic that things were looking better on the ground. \nThey just wanted to caution that there would be good days and bad; that \nthe enemy has a say in this and they will strike back, certainly, all \nthey can. And if the administration were to claim too much in the way \nof success too early and there was some kind of event that resulted in \na lot of violence, there might be a suggestion that the administration \nwas trying to put too nice a gloss on it. So the administration is \ntrying to downplay the successes. But the reality is that there is news \nof success.\n  I think that makes all the more distressing and puzzling the effort \nby a lot of our colleagues not only to downplay the potential for \nsuccess there but to develop strategies to undercut that success with \nresolutions that would micromanage the war from the Senate and, indeed, \nbind the hands of our commanders and our military as they begin to \nimplement this program.\n  It is hard for me to fathom the amount of time and energy that has \nbeen put into the development of these various resolutions--at last \ncount, some 17 different resolutions--that would, in one way or \nanother, criticize the President's plan or try to find some way to stop \nit from occurring.\n  What is further puzzling and distressing is the degree to which this \nappears to be resulting from political considerations. Another one of \nthe pieces I am going to ask to print in the Record is an article from \nMarch 12--that is today's Roll Call magazine--in which leaders on the \nDemocratic side are quoted as referring to the political aspects of \nthis strategy to try to get resolutions adopted.\n  The article talks about the Democratic leader's ``abandoning efforts \nat crafting a bipartisan deal'' and ``instead look to directly tie \nRepublicans to the unpopular conflict. . . .''\n  The articles goes on to talk about ``the decision to ratchet up their \npartisan rhetoric''--``their'' meaning Democratic partisan rhetoric--by \na resolution that sets ``specific dates for a mass redeployment of \ntroops in Iraq and creating new restrictions on the war effort,'' and, \nindeed, that is what the latest resolution of the majority leader would \ndo.\n  But the article goes on to talk about this ``more aggressive push to \ntar vulnerable Republicans up for re-election in 2008.'' That is not \nwhat we should be all about in debating the war in Iraq and designing \nsolutions to ensure that war can be resolved successfully. It should \nnot be about trying to tar vulnerable Members of the opposition party \nto diminish their reelection prospects in the year 2008.\n  The chairman of the Democratic Campaign Committee, the distinguished \nsenior Senator from New York, has, according to this Roll Call article, \n``warned that Democrats would use the issue as a bludgeon on \nRepublicans up for reelection next year,'' and they quote him as \nsaying:\n\n       The heat on these Republican Senators that are up in '08 is \n     tremendous.\n\n  Adding:\n\n      . . . this is a campaign . . . we are going to keep at [it].\n\n  To me, that is an illustration of something very wrong with the \nDemocratic Party's approach to this war. Reasonable people can differ \nabout whether we should be there and how we should conduct the \noperations once there. But we ought to be able to agree that our \nresponsibility is to provide the funding or to cut it off. The \nPresident's responsibility as Commander in Chief is to do his best to \nsee that the mission is achieved. That is what we are sending the \ntroops over there to do. That is what General Petraeus was sent there \nto do. He was confirmed unanimously by this body a month or so ago.\n  When I was in Iraq, General Petraeus told us: Please see to it that \nwe have what we need to fulfill our mission. Pass the supplemental \nappropriations bill to fund our effort and don't tie our hands with \nmicromanagement from the Senate.\n  This is the message from the person we sent over to do the job. It \nseems to me this would be the wrong time to pull the rug out from under \nhim and pull the rug out from under the troops just as there are signs \nof success, as I discussed earlier.\n  It is interesting, too, that there seem to be so many different \napproaches to this effort to criticize the President and his plan. I \nmentioned that at last count there are some 17 different resolutions. \nSomebody called it the ``Goldilocks'' strategy, with the Democratic \nleader searching for a solution that is neither too hot nor too cold. \nThe real question is: In the House of Representatives, are they going \nto lose people on the left or the right or did they get it just right, \nwith sufficient numbers of projects in the supplemental appropriations \nbill to appeal to those who may not like the end result with respect to \nthe Iraq part of the resolution?\n  Some have labeled it a ``slow bleed'' because it appears to be a \nsolution that doesn't cut off all the funding for the troops at this \nmoment but, rather, over time makes it impossible for us to succeed.\n  The resolution, as I understand it, says we have to begin withdrawing \nour troops by a specific date and complete the withdrawal by another \nspecific date. In the past, there has been a fairly good bipartisan \nconsensus for the proposition that is the worst of all worlds, that you \ndon't want to set a timetable for withdrawal because it gives the enemy \nprecisely what they need to calibrate how long they have to hang in \nthere until you are gone and then they can move in and take over and \nfill the vacuum. So it is a bad proposition, even apart from the \npolitical motivation behind it.\n  It is worth, taking a look at some of the iterations.\n  We started with S. 2, a nonbinding resolution, that it wasn't in the \nnational interest of the United States to proceed. That was criticized \nas being nonbinding.\n  Then we move on to S. Con. Res. 7 that expressed disagreement with \nthe plan. That didn't have sufficient support, so that was replaced by \nS. 470, the Levin bill. It expressed disagreement with the strategy but \nin a form the President would be forced to veto.\n  Then we moved on to the Reid-Pelosi proposal, S. 574. Not \nsurprisingly, this approach had no more support than the others, and so \nwe then moved on to the Biden-Levin proposal. That bill never even saw \nthe light of day. It wasn't even debated.\n  Now we are down to S. J. Res. 9, a nonbinding resolution encouraging \nthe President to redeploy all, or almost all, of the troops by the end \nof 2008. This has been described as a goal, and yet the resolution \nitself provides that it is much more than that; that the troops would, \nin fact, have to begin being redeployed and be fully redeployed by the \nend of March of 2008. I don't think this resolution will pass either \nbecause, as I said, most people agree setting a timetable for \nwithdrawal is absolutely the worst thing you want to do, even if you \ndon't agree with the troops being there in the first place.\n  As I said earlier, the amount of time and effort consumed in trying \nto craft the perfect Iraq resolution is difficult to square with all \nthe other important business we have to do. The majority\n\n[[Page S2994]]\n\nleader, the chairmen of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations \nCommittees, and other important Members of this body have devoted hours \nand hours to making grammatical edits to this legislation, even though \nnone of it is going to pass.\n\n  Frankly, it is a good illustration of why wars should not be \nmicromanaged by Congress. We are not good at conducting wars. That is \nwhy we have a Commander in Chief, that is why we have a Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, that is why we have our military commanders, such as General \nPetraeus, in whom we have placed a great deal of confidence, who have \nthe experience to conduct these kinds of operations.\n  I daresay, there are not many of us who have the experience of the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, and it is important for us not to be \narmchair quarterbacks when lives are on the line.\n  Iraq is perhaps the most critical issue facing our country at the \nmoment, and my comments are not meant to suggest that Iraq deserves \nanything less than a full and fair debate on the floor. It is one \nthing, however, to have a debate and let each side make its position \nknown and then vote on competing proposals. It is quite another to \ndevote this kind of energy to attempts which appear to be purely \npolitical attempts to undercut the President and undercut the mission \nin Iraq.\n  I believe the President has chosen a course that has the potential \nfor success. That is why I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks \nsome of the events which have been reported in the media that \ndemonstrate early success. I, frankly, urge my colleagues to turn their \nenergies to find ways to amplify these successes rather than to \nundercut them.\n  It is interesting that Lee Hamilton, the chairman of the Baker-\nHamilton commission, who has been cited many times by Members on both \nsides of the aisle, in testimony before the Congress has been insistent \nthat now that the President has laid out a plan, that strategy should \nhave a chance to succeed, that we should give it a chance to succeed.\n  By the way, even though the President at the time did not indicate \nwhat he would be doing specifically, since that report has come out, \nseveral of the recommendations have, in fact, been a part of what the \nadministration strategy is following. For example, the strategy of \nmeeting with people in the neighborhood is a followup on one of the \nBaker-Hamilton recommendations.\n  I agree with cochairman Lee Hamilton that we should give the strategy \nin Iraq a chance to succeed and not undercut it at the very moment it \nappears there are early signs of success with a resolution which, as I \nsaid, there had been a bipartisan consensus for that we shouldn't be \nsetting a timetable for withdrawal since that simply plays into enemy \nhands.\n  The final document I will ask unanimous consent to be printed in the \nRecord when I conclude is a piece from the L.A. Times, dated today, \nMarch 12. Headline: ``Do we really need a Gen. Pelosi?'' It refers, of \ncourse, to the distinguished Speaker of the House of Representatives, \nwho is supporting the plan that has been put forth in the House of \nRepresentatives by the Democratic leadership there. To quote from this \nL.A. Times.com piece:\n\n       After weeks of internal strife, House Democrats have \n     brought forth their proposal for forcing President Bush to \n     withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq by 2008. The plan is an unruly \n     mess: Bad public policy, bad precedent and bad politics. If \n     the legislation passes, Bush says he'll veto it, as well he \n     should.\n\n  This comes from the Los Angeles Times, no particular friend of this \nadministration. The Times goes on to say that this kind of \nmicromanagement ``is the worst kind of congressional meddling in \nmilitary strategy.''\n  They go on to say:\n\n       By interfering with the discretion of the commander in \n     chief and military leaders in order to fulfill domestic \n     political needs, Congress undermines whatever prospects \n     remain of a successful outcome.\n\n  Then they go on to criticize the Speaker and others for trying ``to \nmicromanage the conflict . . . with arbitrary timetables and \nbenchmarks.''\n  Concluding:\n\n       Congress should not hinder Bush's ability to seek the best \n     possible endgame to this very bad war.\n\n  So a paper that does not like the war or support the administration \ngenerally, nevertheless, recognizes it should not be micromanaged from \nthe Congress; that if there are any possibilities for it to succeed, we \nshould be following those possibilities.\n  To sum it up, I simply say this: There is a chance for this strategy \nto succeed. We should give it a chance to succeed. Early signs are \npositive. We should not try to micromanage the war from the Congress. \nTherefore, when these resolutions come before us, we should reject them \nand allow our military commanders the opportunity that we have asked \nthem to engage in to bring a successful conclusion to this war.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the articles to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 11, 2007]\n\n                       The `Surge' Is Succeeding\n\n                           (By Robert Kagan)\n\n       A front-page story in The Post last week suggested that the \n     Bush administration has no backup plan in case the surge in \n     Iraq doesn't work. I wonder if The Post and other newspapers \n     have a backup plan in case it does.\n       Leading journalists have been reporting for some time that \n     the war was hopeless, a fiasco that could not be salvaged by \n     more troops and a new counterinsurgency strategy. The \n     conventional wisdom in December held that sending more troops \n     was politically impossible after the antiwar tenor of the \n     midterm elections. It was practically impossible because the \n     extra troops didn't exist. Even if the troops did exist, they \n     could not make a difference.\n       Four months later, the once insurmountable political \n     opposition has been surmounted. The nonexistent troops are \n     flowing into Iraq. And though it is still early and horrible \n     acts of violence continue, there is substantial evidence that \n     the new counterinsurgency strategy, backed by the infusion of \n     new forces, is having a significant effect.\n       Some observers are reporting the shift. Iraqi bloggers \n     Mohammed and Omar Fadhil, widely respected for their straight \n     talk, say that ``early signs are encouraging.'' The first \n     impact of the ``surge,'' they write, was psychological. Both \n     friends and foes in Iraq had been convinced, in no small part \n     by the American media, that the United States was preparing \n     to pull out. When the opposite occurred, this alone shifted \n     the dynamic.\n       As the Fadhils report, ``Commanders and lieutenants of \n     various militant groups abandoned their positions in Baghdad \n     and in some cases fled the country.'' The most prominent \n     leader to go into hiding has been Moqtada al-Sadr. His Mahdi \n     Army has been instructed to avoid clashes with American and \n     Iraqi forces, even as coalition forces begin to establish \n     themselves in the once off-limits Sadr City.\n       Before the arrival of Gen. David Petraeus, the Army's \n     leading counterinsurgency strategist, U.S. forces tended to \n     raid insurgent and terrorist strongholds and then pull back \n     and hand over the areas to Iraqi forces, who failed to hold \n     them. The Fadhils report, ``One difference between this and \n     earlier--failed--attempts to secure Baghdad is the \n     willingness of the Iraqi and U.S. governments to commit \n     enough resources for enough time to make it work.'' In the \n     past, bursts of American activity were followed by withdrawal \n     and a return of the insurgents. Now, the plan to secure \n     Baghdad ``is becoming stricter and gaining momentum by the \n     day as more troops pour into the city, allowing for a better \n     implementation of the `clear and hold' strategy.'' Baghdadis \n     ``always want the `hold' part to materialize, and feel safe \n     when they go out and find the Army and police maintaining \n     their posts--the bad guys can't intimidate as long as the \n     troops are staying.''\n       A greater sense of confidence produces many benefits. The \n     number of security tips about insurgents that Iraqi civilians \n     provide has jumped sharply. Stores and marketplaces are \n     reopening in Baghdad, increasing the sense of community. \n     People dislocated by sectarian violence are returning to \n     their homes. As a result, ``many Baghdadis feel hopeful again \n     about the future, and the fear of civil war is slowly being \n     replaced by optimism that peace might one day return to this \n     city,'' the Fadhils report. ``This change in mood is \n     something huge by itself.''\n       Apparently some American journalists see the difference. \n     NBC's Brian Williams recently reported a dramatic change in \n     Ramadi since his previous visit. The city was safer; the \n     airport more secure. The new American strategy of'' getting \n     out, decentralizing, going into the neighborhoods, grabbing a \n     toehold, telling the enemy we're here, start talking to the \n     locals--that is having an obvious and palpable effect.'' U.S. \n     soldiers forged agreements with local religious leaders and \n     pushed al-Qaeda back--a trend other observers have noted in \n     some Sunni-dominated areas. The result, Williams said, is \n     that ``the war has changed.''\n       It is no coincidence that as the mood and the reality have \n     shifted, political currents have shifted as well. A national \n     agreement on sharing oil revenue appears on its way to \n     approval. The Interior Ministry has been purged of corrupt \n     officials and of many suspected of torture and brutality. And \n     cracks\n\n[[Page S2995]]\n\n     are appearing in the Shiite governing coalition--a good sign, \n     given that the rock-solid unity was both the product and \n     cause of growing sectarian violence.\n       There is still violence, as Sunni insurgents and al-Qaeda \n     seek to prove that the surge is not working. However, they \n     are striking at more vulnerable targets in the provinces. \n     Violence is down in Baghdad. As for Sadr and the Mahdi Army, \n     it is possible they may reemerge as a problem later. But \n     trying to wait out the American and Iraqi effort may be \n     hazardous if the public becomes less tolerant of their \n     violence. It could not be comforting to Sadr or al-Qaeda to \n     read in the New York Times that the United States plans to \n     keep higher force levels in Iraq through at least the \n     beginning of 2008. The only good news for them would be if \n     the Bush administration in its infinite wisdom starts to talk \n     again about drawing down forces.\n       No one is asking American journalists to start emphasizing \n     the ``good'' news. All they have to do is report what is \n     occurring, though it may conflict with their previous \n     judgments. Some are still selling books based on the premise \n     that the war is lost, end of story. But what if there is a \n     new chapter in the story?\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From Roll Call, Mar. 12, 2007]\n\n                         Reid To Attack on Iraq\n\n                   (By John Stanton and Susan Davis)\n\n       With the GOP maintaining a unified front against Democratic \n     efforts to end the Iraq War, Senate Majority Leader Harry \n     Reid (D-Nev.) and other party leaders are abandoning efforts \n     at crafting a bipartisan deal on the issue and will instead \n     look to directly tie Republicans to the unpopular conflict, \n     senior leadership aides said Friday.\n       The decision to ratchet up their partisan rhetoric followed \n     Thursday's announcement of a joint resolution by House and \n     Senate Democrats setting specific dates for a mass \n     redeployment of troops in Iraq and creating new restrictions \n     on the war effort. Reid is expected to bring the resolution \n     to the floor this week following completion of the 9/11 bill, \n     aides said.\n       According to Democratic leadership aides, Reid, Democratic \n     Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Charles Schumer (N.Y.) \n     and other party leaders hope that a more aggressive push to \n     tar vulnerable Republicans up for re-election in 2008 with \n     the prospect of an open-ended commitment to the war will \n     force enough defections to pass legislation forcing Bush to \n     begin bringing the war to an end.\n       ``If they want to follow Bush over the cliff, that's fine \n     with us,'' one Democratic leadership aide said, adding that \n     Democrats will continue to push the issue between now and the \n     2008 elections in the hopes of eventually forcing a change in \n     the administration or Congressional Republicans.\n       Saying Democratic Members ``are close to unanimity in both \n     Houses,'' Schumer accused Republicans of being torn between \n     ``their president who says 'stay the course,' and the \n     American people who demand change'' and warned that Democrats \n     would use the issue as a bludgeon on Republicans up for \n     reelection next year.\n       ``The heat on these Republican Senators that are up in '08 \n     is tremendous,'' Schumer maintained, adding that ``this is a \n     campaign . . . we are going to keep at'' until Reid has \n     enough GOP defections to pass a bill.\n       According to leadership aides, Democrats have thus far \n     tried to walk a careful line of criticizing GOP opposition to \n     efforts to end the war while not being so harsh as to \n     alienate potential GOP allies. But over the past several \n     weeks ``it's become evident that Republicans have decided to \n     march in lockstep with the president'' and that, at least at \n     this point, a bipartisan solution is unlikely.\n       As a result, Reid, Schumer and other leaders have decided \n     to pivot to a more confrontational--and partisan--approach \n     starting this week and will attempt to portray opposition to \n     the joint resolution as de facto support for Bush's war \n     plans.\n       ``They have made a politically perilous decision to stand \n     with the president,'' a Democratic aide said, and Reid will \n     attempt to use Bush's low poll numbers and public concern \n     with the war to pressure Republican Members to break ranks.\n       Senate Republicans, meanwhile, will continue to make the \n     case that Democrats are in disarray on the war and that any \n     efforts to bring about an end to the war amount to a \n     dangerous micromanaging of the war by Congress.\n       One GOP leadership aide noted that despite early jitters \n     within the Conference, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-\n     Ky.) has done an excellent job of keeping his Members \n     together and in reasserting Republicans' vaunted discipline. \n     ``Part of our strength in this debate has been staying on \n     message'' and not being dragged in to fights over specific \n     Democratic proposals or process questions, the aide said.\n       But despite their successes in recent weeks, McConnell and \n     other Republicans acknowledge Iraq is a politically perilous \n     issue for them because of its unpopularity with voters.\n       In an interview with Roll Call reporters and editors \n     Friday, McConnell said Democrats appear intent on keeping the \n     focus on the war, arguing that Democrats' success with the \n     issue in 2006 has convinced many in the new majority that it \n     is ``the gift that keeps on giving.''\n       He also said that Senate Democrats appear intent on making \n     it a cornerstone of their 2008 campaign strategy. Pointing to \n     the fact that Democrats have proposed some 17 different Iraq \n     resolutions or bills since November, McConnell maintained \n     ``the best evidence of that is that they keep moving the goal \n     post'' on how they want to deal with Iraq.\n       ``Would I like the election to be about something else? You \n     bet,'' McConnell said, arguing that Republicans would have \n     much better terrain in a fight over the economy.\n       ``We are the economic engine of the world in many ways'' \n     but that fact has become lost in public concern over Iraq, \n     McConnell argued. Iraq has ``just put people in a kind of \n     funky mood,'' he lamented.\n       But even McConnell--one of the White House's staunchest \n     supporters on the war--acknowledged that conditions on the \n     ground must change and that Iraq will need to demonstrate \n     improvements.\n       ``This is the Iraqis' last chance to get it right. . . . \n     They need to show they can govern right now. Not next year. \n     Not this fall. Now. Right now,'' a clearly upset McConnell \n     said.\n       Meanwhile, unburdened by having to craft their own policy \n     on funding the Iraq War, House Republicans appear to be \n     unified against the supplemental in its current form.\n       ``There is nearly unanimous opposition in the Republican \n     Conference to any proposal that undermines the troops' \n     ability to fight and win the war on terror,'' said Brian \n     Kennedy, a spokesman for Minority Leader John Boehner (R-\n     Ohio). ``Our Members are committed to sustaining a united \n     front against anything short of full and unqualified funding \n     for the troops.''\n       The House Republican Conference held a special meeting \n     Friday morning to discuss the spending bill. Multiple Members \n     and aides in attendance said almost all of the chamber's 201 \n     Republican lawmakers are prepared to take the potentially \n     risky vote against a war-funding bill.\n       House Republican leaders are united in opposition, and \n     Appropriations ranking member Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.) also \n     told the Conference he would vote against the measure.\n       Much of the rank and file are looking to veteran Rep. Bill \n     Young (R-Fla.) for guidance on how to vote. Young is Rep. \n     John Murtha's (D-Pa.) counterpart on the Appropriations \n     subcommittee on Defense and the most senior Republican in the \n     House.\n       Young told his colleagues Friday that he was--at that \n     point--prepared to vote against the measure. He said he was \n     reluctant to vote against any funding bill for the military, \n     but that the Democratic bill was unacceptable.\n       However, Young left open the possibility that he could \n     ultimately support the bill if Democrats remove date specific \n     provisions on troop withdrawal. That appears unlikely, as \n     doing so would result in anti-war Democrats voting against \n     the bill.\n       Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Texas), a Vietnam War veteran and \n     former prisoner of war, gave the most stirring speech at \n     Conference, attendees said. ``He said, `We need to call this \n     what it is--a piece of crap,' '' recalled a GOP leadership \n     aide.\n       House Minority Whip Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) was unusually candid \n     in his whip count last week, stating that he expected all \n     Republicans who voted against the mid-February Iraq \n     resolution to oppose the supplemental, ``give or take one or \n     two.''\n       There were 17 Republicans who voted with Democrats on that \n     resolution, and two Democrats who voted with Republicans. Of \n     those 17 Republicans, several already have indicated they are \n     likely to oppose the supplemental, including GOP Reps. Tom \n     Davis (Va.), Mark Kirk (Ill.) and Howard Coble (N.C.), and \n     GOP leaders are confident they can whittle that number into \n     the single digits if the underlying bill is not substantially \n     changed before it hits the House floor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Mar. 12, 2007]\n\n                    Do we really need a Gen. Pelosi?\n\n       After weeks of internal strife, House Democrats have \n     brought forth their proposal for forcing President Bush to \n     withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq by 2008. The plan is an unruly \n     mess: bad public policy, bad precedent and bad politics. If \n     the legislation passes, Bush says he'll veto it, as well he \n     should.\n       It was one thing for the House to pass a nonbinding vote of \n     disapproval. It's quite another for it to set out a detailed \n     timetable with specific benchmarks and conditions for the \n     continuation of the conflict. Imagine if Dwight Eisenhower \n     had been forced to adhere to a congressional war plan in \n     scheduling the Normandy landings or if, in 1863, President \n     Lincoln had been forced by Congress to conclude the Civil War \n     the following year. This is the worst kind of congressional \n     meddling in military strategy.\n       This is not to say that Congress has no constitutional \n     leverage--only that it should exercise it responsibly. In a \n     sense, both Bush and the more ardent opponents of the war are \n     right. If a majority in Congress truly believes that the war \n     is not in the national interest, then lawmakers should have \n     the courage of their convictions and vote to stop funding \n     U.S. involvement. They could cut the final checks in six \n     months or so to give Bush time to manage the withdrawal. Or \n     lawmakers could, as some Senate Democrats are proposing, \n     revoke the authority that Congress gave Bush in 2002 to use \n     force against Iraq.\n       But if Congress accepts Bush's argument that there is still \n     hope, however faint, that\n\n[[Page S2996]]\n\n     the U.S. military can be effective in quelling the sectarian \n     violence, that U.S. economic aid can yet bring about an \n     improvement in Iraqi lives that won't be bombed away and that \n     American diplomatic power can be harnessed to pressure \n     Shiites and Sunnis to make peace--if Congress accepts this, \n     then lawmakers have a duty to let the president try this \n     ``surge and leverage'' strategy.\n       By interfering with the discretion of the commander in \n     chief and military leaders in order to fulfill domestic \n     political needs, Congress undermines whatever prospects \n     remain of a successful outcome. It's absurd for House Speaker \n     Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) to try to micromanage the \n     conflict, and the evolution of Iraqi society, with arbitrary \n     timetables and benchmarks.\n       Congress should not hinder Bush's ability to seek the best \n     possible endgame to this very bad war. The president needs \n     the leeway to threaten, or negotiate with, Sunnis and Shiites \n     and Kurds, Syrians and Iranians and Turks. Congress can find \n     many ways to express its view that U.S. involvement, \n     certainly at this level, must not go on indefinitely, but it \n     must not limit the president's ability to maneuver at this \n     critical juncture.\n       Bush's wartime leadership does not inspire much confidence. \n     But he has made adjustments to his team, and there's little \n     doubt that a few hundred legislators do not a capable \n     commander in chief make. These aren't partisan judgments--we \n     also condemned Republican efforts to micromanage President \n     Clinton's conduct of military operations in the Balkans.\n       Members of Congress need to act responsibly, debating the \n     essence of the choice the United States now faces--to stay or \n     go--and putting their money where their mouths are. But too \n     many lives are at stake to allow members of Congress to play \n     the role of Eisenhower or Lincoln.\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, this morning I held a hearing in Chicago \nat the University of Illinois, Chicago medical campus. It was a hearing \nto discuss the challenges we face with returning veterans from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. It was clear from the turnout at that hearing there is an \nintense interest in this subject. Much of it was brought on by the \nWashington Post front-page story of a few weeks ago about the now \ninfamous Building 18 at Walter Reed Hospital.\n  Like many Members of Congress, I have visited Walter Reed many times \nto see Illinois soldiers and to check in to see how things were going. \nNone of us were ever taken across the street to Building 18. I didn't \nknow it existed. But the graphic images of the building, which was \nworse than a flophouse motel with mold on the walls and rat droppings \nand evidence of roaches and bugs, where we were housing men and women \nwho had just returned from battle with their injuries, has really \nstruck a nerve across America and here on Capitol Hill. It has caused \nus to ask important and difficult questions about whether we are \nmeeting our obligations to our soldiers and to our veterans, also to \nask whether Walter Reed's Building 18 was an isolated example of \nneglect or symptomatic of a much larger problem and a much greater \nchallenge.\n  Today in Chicago we talked about the returning vets and soldiers from \nour perspective in the middle of the country. With the Hines VA \nHospital being one of the larger VA hospitals, and with a lot of \nveterans heading back to that part of the country, we have a real \ninterest in this issue.\n  It goes without saying we all support our troops. In fact, it is said \nso often on the Senate floor it becomes an almost empty cliche. Those \nsoldiers, the families, the voters, people of this country have a right \nto ask each of us: Great. If you support them, what are you doing for \nthem?\n  We can talk--and I might at the end of these remarks--about our \npolicy in Iraq, but for a moment I want to focus on those who serve our \ncountry overseas and come home injured and need a helping hand.\n  Many of the soldiers who were featured in the Washington Post expose \non Walter Reed had been living in deplorable conditions for months, \nsometimes years. They have lived in that condition waiting to receive a \ndisability rating to begin rebuilding their lives. So after they fight \nthe enemy, they come home to fight the bureaucracy. Papers are thrown \nat them. Some of them are in compromised positions because of their \nphysical or mental weakness and they have to become advocates in a \nsystem that is not always friendly.\n  The Washington Post brought to light poor conditions at Walter Reed, \nbut we have to ask the larger question: What about the rest of the \nhospitals? What about the rest of the soldiers and the veterans?\n  I joined several of my Democratic colleagues last week in \ncosponsoring the Dignity for Wounded Soldiers Act of 2007. Our new \ncolleague, Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri, who has become a \nleader on this issue, joined with Senator Obama of my State in \nintroducing a bill that calls for more homes for service members who \nare still recovering, less paperwork for recovering service members, \nbetter case management to cut through the redtape, better training for \ncaseworkers, better support services, including meal benefits, for \nrecovering service members and their families, and job protections for \nhusbands and wives, moms and dads of wounded service members who have \ncome to stay with and help take care of their loved ones while they are \nrecovering.\n  Mr. President, you served in Vietnam. At the time of your service, \nthe men and women in uniform were much younger and usually single. Now \nthe soldiers, guardsmen, and reservists who serve in Iraq and \nAfghanistan are older and usually have a family. So when they come \nhome, their misfortune, their illness, and their injury turn out to be \na family concern.\n  This bill says we should be sensitive to the family needs of these \nreturning service members. Many of the returning troops who are injured \nneed medical attention long after they are discharged. In fact, more of \nour service members sustain serious brain injuries in Iraq and \nAfghanistan than in any recent conflict we have known. I have seen \nseveral figures about how many Americans serving in the Middle East \nhave suffered head and brain injuries that require a lifetime of \ncontinual care. The estimates run from 2,000 to 3,000. When you think \nof over a million service men and women who have served in that \ntheater, it appears to be a small number but it is a dramatically \nlarger number than we have seen in any previous conflict.\n  In Vietnam, in previous wars, brain injuries accounted for 1 out of 8 \nor 12 percent of the injuries. In Iraq and Afghanistan, brain injuries \naccount for 22 percent of the injuries--almost 1 out of 4. Of course, \nwe understand why, with the roadside bombs, the blasts, and the \nconcussions to which these service men and women are subjected. It \ntakes its toll. As many as 2 out of every 10 combat veterans from Iraq \nand Afghanistan are returning with concussions in varying degrees of \nintensity, and 1.6 million vets have served already in the war. That \nmeans 320,000 people require some sort of screening and treatment for \ntraumatic brain injury or head-related injury. That number grows with \nevery new soldier, sailor, marine, and airman deployed.\n  I am working on legislation now, and I will invite my colleagues to \njoin me, to focus on brain injury because I think that is the \nsignificant wound of this war that we cannot ignore. The bill which I \nam preparing will, among other things, speed up medical research so we \ncan do a better job of diagnosis and treatment. I might add \nparenthetically that treatment will inure to the benefit of many other \npeople across America dealing with brain injuries or brain-related \nproblems.\n  We also in this bill encourage the VA to do more outreach to find \nveterans whose brain injuries may have caused problems in their lives \nand help bring them back into a system of care and support. The bill \nrequires the Department of Defense and the VA to work more closely \ntogether to capture and track returning troops with combat-induced \nbrain trauma and to put money into better equipment for VA medical \ncenters to improve their testing and treatment.\n  During Vietnam, one in three Vietnam service members who were injured \ndied. In Iraq and Afghanistan, it is one in seven. Battlefield medical \ncare is\n\n[[Page S2997]]\n\nsignificantly better. The trauma teams in the field who treat our men \nand women who are injured are performing miracles every day. But those \ninjured veterans, once surviving, come home to more challenging medical \ncare needs.\n  Let's speak for a moment about post-traumatic stress disorder. With \nVietnam veterans, it is estimated it was as high as 30 percent. That \nestimate is given on Iraq and Afghanistan veterans as well. But during \nthe Vietnam war, it was not discussed.\n  Today, I had a young man who was a Vietnam veteran stand up. His name \nis Ramon Calderon. Ramon has been fighting post-traumatic stress \ndisorder almost single-handedly since Vietnam. There are so many other \ncases of men and women who served there who came home haunted by the \nexperience. It wasn't considered appropriate to raise that issue when \nthey returned, so they suffered in silence and many times paid a price: \na failed marriage, self-medication with drugs and alcohol, despondency, \nhomelessness, and problems that follow when these psychological scars \nare not healed. Today we know that many of our returning service men \nand women from Iraq and Afghanistan bring home those demons of war in \ntheir heads, and they are trying to purge themselves of that haunting \nillness.\n  A new study that will be released later today by the Archives of \nInternal Medicine says we are looking at the high end of the estimate \nof 30 percent. About one-third of those who have served in Iraq and \nAfghanistan come home in need of post-traumatic stress disorder \ncounseling, and the sooner the better. The longer this situation \nfesters, the worse it becomes. Early intervention, early help can save \na life, save a marriage, and turn a life around. The study reports that \none-third of veterans coming back from war who seek care in the VA have \nmental health or social issues.\n  Several months ago I went to the Hines VA Hospital and I was invited \nto attend a counseling session. The soldiers who were back from war \nsaid it was OK if I sat in on it. It was late on a Friday afternoon. \nThese were vets, mainly young men, who had just returned from war. They \ncame filing into the room, about a half dozen of them, and I could tell \nby the look on their face that we had the whole spectrum of emotions.\n  There were some who were nearly in tears the minute they crossed the \nthreshold into the room, and there were others with clenched fists and \nangry looks on their faces who were suffering from the same problem. \nThey needed to sit down and talk to somebody to try to get through \nanother day, another week before they had another counseling session.\n  That is the reality. The statistics tell us a vivid story. More \ninjured servicemembers are surviving. More injured soldiers, marines, \nsailors, and airmen are coming home, and a larger percentage of them \nneed help from brain injuries, both traumatic injuries as well as \npsychological injuries. The VA needs to be prepared to treat this large \ninflux of people.\n  Our medical and benefit systems are not keeping pace with reality. \nRemember the promise we made to these men and women? If you will \nvolunteer to serve America, if you will risk your life, we will stand \nby you. We will protect you in battle, and we will stand by you when \nyou come home. That was the basic promise. But we know, sadly, we are \nnot keeping that promise at the VA hospitals and even the military \nhospitals across our country. Injured troops come home to find in too \nmany cases substandard outpatient care and a big fight on their hands \nto justify the need for ongoing care.\n  A recent New York Times article featured 2005 data from the Veterans \nAffairs that showed a big difference between the average compensation \npaid in my home State. It is not news. It has been there for a couple \nyears now. For 20 years, for reasons no one can explain, a soldier who \nwas disabled in Illinois received the lowest compensation for an injury \nin comparison to another soldier with the same injury in another State. \nI was pretty angry about it. Senator Obama, who is on the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, joined me in demanding an inspection to find out why \nthis was going on, an investigation to get to the bottom of it, and \naction. We got a report back from Veterans Affairs, and it wasn't very \nsatisfying.\n  It turns out that if a veteran tried to walk through this system \nalone without someone by his side, someone from his family or someone \nfrom a veterans organization, they were likely to recover 50 percent \nless for their disability than one who took an advocate with him. It \ntells you what the bureaucracy does. The bureaucracy shortchanges the \ninjured veterans. It takes an advocate to stand by their side, and I \nwill tell you the story of one in just a moment.\n  Last year we required the Veterans' Administration to send letters to \n60,000 veterans in Illinois explaining how they might have been \nshortchanged in their disability claims for a variety of reasons. I \nwant to make sure the VA is tracking those letters and responses and \nthat they are doing it in a timely fashion. The VA, the Veterans \nAffairs Department, is inundated at this point: 1.6 million new \nveterans they may not have anticipated just a few years ago. Higher \nrates of PTSD and brain injury complicate their task. The VA \nCompensation and Pension Claims Division reports a backlog--a backlog--\nof 625,000 cases. The average wait to process an original claim at the \nVA is about half a year--177 days. Six months to process a VA claim, \nand if you are unhappy with the result and decide you want to appeal \nit, it will take 2 years--657 days--before you will get an answer on \nthe appeal.\n  One of the things I think we should acknowledge is that there are \nmany wonderful things happening at VA hospitals. The criticisms that we \nhear for their shortcomings, notwithstanding there are many dedicated \nmen and women serving in the Veterans' Administration. I can't tell you \nhow many returning soldiers have said good things about military \nhospitals and the VA. But the fact is, we need to do much more, and we \nneed to do better.\n  If we could have gathered together the leaders of the Veterans' \nAdministration 10 years ago and asked them to predict where they would \nbe in the year 2007 in terms of their caseload and the requirements \nthey would face, I don't think any one of them could have predicted \nwhat they face today. By and large, they were dealing with an aging \npopulation of World War II vets and Korean vets, Vietnam vets and \nothers who had chronic conditions that needed attention.\n  They were conditions related to their injuries. But they were also \nconditions such as diabetes and blood pressure. They were prepared to \ndeal with the aging veteran population. Then comes the invasion of \nIraq, and everything changes. Thousands of men and women are now in the \nVA system with new challenges. Instead of chronic conditions such as \ndiabetes and blood pressure, the VA now faces the need for acute \nrehabilitation. This is a specialty in which there are very few centers \nin America on the civilian side that really get high marks.\n  The VA is being asked to create this kind of specialty in a hurry. It \nis not working out very well. I will speak to that in a moment.\n  I had excellent people speaking today at the hearing.\n  We had Scott Burton, a former marine who was part of the initial Iraq \ninvasion. He was discharged in 2004, and he suffers from PTSD. He is \nvery open about it and is looking for help. He will do just fine, but \nhe has become an advocate for other soldiers who need to step forward \nand acknowledge their need.\n  We had Katy Scott. Katy's son Jason lost his right eye and right arm \nin an IED attack in Iraq. She lost her job because she gave it up \nbasically to stand by her son's bed at Walter Reed and fight for him \nevery day. She is a passionate advocate not only for her son but for \nall the returning servicemen.\n  Then we had Edgar Edmundson. He was featured today on the front page \nof the New York Times. It is a feature he and his family really were \nnot looking for. It is entitled ``For War's Gravely Injured, a \nChallenge to Find Care.''\n  The article tells the story of a number of veterans, including SSG \nJaron Behee, who suffered a traumatic brain injury and went to the \nVeterans Affairs hospital in Palo Alto, where they said it was time for \nhim to pick out his wheelchair, which he would be in for the rest of \nhis life. They told him he wasn't making progress and that the next \nstep for him was a nursing home. His wife said, ``I just felt that it \nwas\n\n[[Page S2998]]\n\nunfair for them to throw in the towel on him. I said, `We're out of \nhere.' ''\n\n       Because Ms. Behee had successfully resisted the Army's \n     efforts to retire her husband into the VA health care system, \n     his military insurance policy, it turned out, covered private \n     care. So she moved him to a community rehabilitation center, \n     Casa Colina, near her parents' home in Southern California, \n     in late 2005.\n       Three months later, Sergeant Behee was walking, unassisted, \n     and abandoned his government-provided wheelchair.\n\n  Three months before, he had been told by the VA there was no hope--\npick out your wheelchair, we are sending you to a nursing home.\n\n       Now 28, he works as a volunteer in the center's outpatient \n     gym, wiping down equipment and handing out towels. It is not \n     the police job he aspired to; his cognitive impairments are \n     serious. But it is not a nursing home either.\n\n  There are other stories. Some were referred to today in the hearing \nwe had in Chicago. The one I mentioned earlier is one that I think \nbears repeating. This involves Edgar Edmundson, 52 years old, from New \nBern, NC. His son, SGT Eric Edmundson, sustained serious blast injuries \nin northern Iraq in the fall of 2005.\n\n       Mr. Edmundson [the father] was aggressive, abandoning his \n     job and home to care for his son, calling on his \n     representatives in Washington for help, ``saying no a lot.'' \n     But even he did not come to understand his son's health care \n     options quickly enough to ensure that his son was not \n     ``shortchanged'' in the critical first year after his injury.\n\n  Mr. President, this is an element we cannot overlook. We cannot play \ncatchup in this game. Many soldiers with traumatic brain injuries will \ndeteriorate, and it will be sometimes impossible to recover the ground \nthey lost if they don't get the right care at the right moment.\n\n       Two days before Sergeant Edmundson was wounded near the \n     Syrian border, he visited with his father on the telephone. \n     Mr Edmundson urged his son, then 25 with a young wife and a \n     baby daughter, to ``stay safe.''\n       In an interview last week, Mr. Edmundson's voice cracked as \n     he recalled his son's response: ``He said, `Don't worry, \n     because if anything happens, the Army will take care of me.' \n     ''\n       While awaiting transport to Germany after initial surgery, \n     Sergeant Edmundson suffered a heart attack. As doctors worked \n     to revive him, he lost oxygen to his brain for half an hour, \n     with devastating consequences.\n       A couple weeks later, at Walter Reed in Washington, on the \n     very day Sergeant Edmundson was stabilized medically and \n     transferred into the brain injury unit, military officials \n     initiated the process of retiring him [from the active \n     military].\n       ``That threw up the red flag for me,'' Mr. Edmundson said. \n     ``If the Army was supposed to take care of him, why were they \n     trying to discharge him from service the minute he gets out \n     of intensive care?''\n\n  Still, he didn't understand that his son's insurance policy covered \nprivate care. He wasn't aware of it.\n\n       When Walter Reed transferred Sergeant Edmundson to the \n     polytrauma center in Richmond, Mr. Edmundson believed that he \n     was, more or less, following orders.\n       Mr. Edmundson was disappointed by what he considered an \n     unfocused, inconsistent rehabilitation regimen at what he saw \n     as an understaffed, overburdened VA hospital filled with \n     geriatric patients. His son's morale plummeted and he refused \n     to participate in therapy. ``Eric gave up his will,'' he \n     said. In March 2006, the VA hospital sought to transfer \n     Sergeant Edmundson to a nursing home.\n       Mr. Edmundson chose instead to care for his son himself, \n     quitting his job [altogether and he spent full-time with his \n     son.] For almost eight months, Sergeant Edmundson, who was \n     awake but unable to walk, talk, or control his body, received \n     nothing but a few hours of maintenance therapy weekly at a \n     local hospital.\n       One day, by chance, Mr. Edmundson encountered a military \n     case manager who asked him why his son was not at a civilian \n     rehabilitation hospital. That is when Mr. Edmundson learned \n     that his son had options. He did some research and set his \n     sights on the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago.\n\n  He decided that the best place to go--and I agree--was the Rehab \nInstitute of Chicago, which I think is one of the best in the world.\n\n       Sergeant Edmundson is now the only Iraq combat veteran \n     being treated there.\n       The first step in his treatment in Chicago, Dr. Smith said, \n     was to use drugs, technology and devices ``to reverse the ill \n     effects of not getting adequate care earlier, somewhere \n     between Walter Reed and here.''\n       For example, she said, Sergeant Edmundson's hips, knees and \n     ankles are frozen ``in the position of someone sitting in a \n     hallway in a chair.'' They are working to straighten out his \n     joints so that he can eventually stand, she said. They have \n     taught him to express his basic needs using a communication \n     board, and they hope to loosen his vocal cords so he can \n     start speaking.\n\n  At least he can communicate. Doctor Smith said, ``He has profound \ncognitive disability, but he can communicate, albeit not verbally, and \nhe can express emotions, including humor and even sarcasm.''\n  When Sergeant Edmundson's father testified today, along with Eric's \nsister, he could not get the words out. This man had given almost 3 \nyears of his life for his son. He knows his son has a major uphill \nstruggle to make progress. He tried to be as kind as he could to \neverybody who helped, but he was also very honest. He expressed the \nfeelings of a heartbroken father who believes that along the way, \nsomebody should have told him his son was entitled to even better \nspecialized care.\n  Last week, the head of the Rehab Institute of Chicago came to \nWashington. I met with her--Dr. JoAnn Smith. She was with Dr. Henry \nBetts, who is legendary in our town for his leadership in this \ninstitute. She came with a simple message from the Veterans' \nAdministration, to tell them that: This is our specialty, this is what \nwe do--take those who are acutely injured and need rehab and work with \nthem effectively. She asked if the Veterans' Administration would \nplease send some patients to the Rehab Institute of Chicago--patients \nwho could be helped like those I have described in my remarks today. \nShe said she was heartened.\n  Dr. Smith was trained in the VA system. She has no prejudice against \nthem. There was a high degree of acceptance that there is a gap in the \nmilitary system's current ability to take care of particularly the \nprofoundly injured, she said. However, there is still resistance. The \nVA doesn't believe there is a problem or any need for rescue by the \nprivate sector.\n  Should we be debating this at all? If you had a seriously injured \nperson in your household, would you not look for the best doctor you \ncould find? Would you not want to send that severely injured person you \nlove to the best place for them? Don't we so many times express on the \nfloor of the Senate how much we care for and love these soldiers who \nserve our country? Why are they not getting the same thing?\n  I think that is a challenge we all have to face. We know the VA does \nmany things and does them well. They can do a lot better when it comes \nto traumatic brain injury--the serious injuries the soldiers are \nbringing home and the post-traumatic stress disorder. We need to \nappropriate the funds. No excuses. We need to make sure the billions of \ndollars are there to take care of these soldiers.\n  Just 2 weeks from now--maybe sooner--the administration will ask us \nfor a huge sum of money, in the range of $100 billion, a supplemental \nappropriation to be spent for soldiers in Iraq. It is likely that at \nthe end of the day, they will receive every penny they have asked for, \nwhich has been the case for the 4 years of this war. This Senator, as \ndo many others, believes we have to also consider the funding for our \ninjured veterans as well. We cannot stand by and allow these vets to \nstay in the ``Building 18s'' or those wards where they cannot receive \nthe specialized care and to deteriorate to a point where their lives \nare compromised forever.\n  We only have a limited opportunity for many of these brave men and \nwomen. We cannot use our own excuses here about budgets and priorities \nto slow down our obligation and meet our obligation to serve veterans \nand serve them well.\n  So this hearing today was an eye-opener for me and for Congresswoman \nJan Schakowsky, who joined me, to be in that room with the parents and \nthe veterans, to hear the stories of the bureaucracy they fought, and \nto understand we can do something about it here in Washington.\n  I know of the personal interest of the occupant of the chair in this \nissue. After the Presiding Officer was first elected, after being sworn \nin, he came to my office and said he wanted to work on a new GI bill. I \nam anxious to work with him in that regard. Having served our country \nas he did, he understands better than I do, and better than most, the \nobligation we have to the men and women who have served.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will take this experience of the Washington \nPost\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\nexpose and our own personal experiences back home to heart when we \nconsider the measures that are coming before us. I don't want another \nscandal on this watch. I want to make sure this Building 18 doesn't \nbecome another Hurricane Katrina, the ninth ward of New Orleans, LA. It \nwas an indication of lack of skill, lack of management, and lack of \ncommitment that led to this situation. Now it is time for Congress and \nthe President to step up for these men and women who serve us so well.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/12/senate-section/article/S2999-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    ROSENBAUM FAMILY'S SELFLESS ACT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the front page of The Washington \nPost Friday delivered the remarkable news that the family of David \nRosenbaum has entered into an agreement with Washington's city leaders \nunder which the family will withdraw a $20 million lawsuit--a lawsuit \nin which they were said to have an excellent chance of prevailing--if \nthe city lives up to a promise to fix the city's troubled emergency \nresponse system.\n  David Rosenbaum, the retired New York Times reporter, was fatally \nbeaten last year near his home in Washington. He was a good husband and \nfather, a kind friend and neighbor, and a talented and respected \njournalist. He had a passion for making government more effective in \ndoing its job. He was a good and a kind man. Those who knew or knew of \nthe Rosenbaums were further saddened last year when David's widow, \nVirginia Rosenbaum, succumbed to cancer.\n  How fitting, how constructive, and how typical of David Rosenbaum and \nhis life and his work that his family has taken this selfless step. Our \nbest wishes--and our admiration and gratitude--go out to them.\n  The material follows.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, March 9, 2007]\n\n              Journalist's Family Wants Reform, Not Money\n\n                          (By David Nakamura)\n\n       The family of a slain New York Times journalist yesterday \n     agreed to forgo the potential of millions of dollars in \n     damages in exchange for something that might be harder for \n     the D.C. government to deliver: an overhaul of the emergency \n     medical response system that bungled his care at nearly every \n     step.\n       David E. Rosenbaum's family said it will give up a $20 \n     million lawsuit against the city--but only if changes are \n     made within one year.\n       Under a novel legal settlement, the city agreed to set up a \n     task force to improve the troubled emergency response system \n     and look at issues such as training, communication and \n     supervision. A member of the family will be on the panel.\n       Although legal experts said the family could have won \n     millions had it pursued the case, Rosenbaum's brother Marcus \n     said he and other relatives were more interested in making \n     sure that the city enacted measurable changes.\n       ``As details of the case started to come out, we decided \n     among ourselves to do something for all the citizens so that \n     things would be improved,'' Marcus Rosenbaum said, standing \n     next to a dogwood sapling planted near where his brother was \n     mugged in January 2006. David Rosenbaum was pounded on the \n     head with a metal pipe by robbers who accosted him during an \n     evening walk. He then was mistakenly treated as a drunk by \n     D.C. firefighters and other emergency workers, who failed to \n     notice his severe head wound.\n       Rosenbaum, 63, died of a brain injury two days after the \n     attack on Gramercy Street NW. He had recently retired after \n     nearly four decades at the New York Times, where he covered \n     economic policy and other issues, but continued to work in \n     the Washington bureau on special assignments.\n       The D.C. inspector general's office issued a blistering \n     report in June that faulted firefighters, emergency workers, \n     police and hospital personnel for an ``unacceptable chain of \n     failure'' and warned of broader problems with emergency care. \n     The report called for stronger supervision and training, \n     clearer communication and more internal controls for \n     emergency workers and hospital personnel.\n       D.C. Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), who joined the Rosenbaum \n     family at the announcement, said that he was pleased with the \n     settlement but that it was just the start of a long process \n     of reform. He did not identify potential changes.\n       ``This was a failure of the government, the most tragic \n     kind of failure the government can have,'' said Fenty, \n     flanked by Acting D.C. Attorney General Linda Singer. ``A \n     settlement does not let anyone off the hook, especially the \n     District government.''\n       Fenty, who took office in January, pledged last year to \n     oust the chief of the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical \n     Services Department, Adrian H. Thompson, who many officials \n     felt did not act quickly or aggressively enough to address \n     the failures. Among other things, Thompson issued a statement \n     three days after Rosenbaum's death that said ``everything \n     possible'' had been done to provide care. He later changed \n     course, saying he had been misled, and dismissed or took \n     disciplinary action against at least 10 employees.\n       This week, Fenty nominated Atlanta Fire Chief Dennis L. \n     Rubin to head the department. Rubin said he is familiar with \n     the Rosenbaum case and intends to make changes after studying \n     the D.C. response system more closely. Among issues likely to \n     be on the table: the creation of a separate city department \n     for emergency medical response.\n       Marcus Rosenbaum said he is hoping for the best. ``We are \n     really happy with the way things have gone with the \n     District,'' he said. ``It's like we are adversaries on the \n     same side. We hope this settlement will lead to something \n     good.''\n       The lawsuit was filed in November on behalf of Rosenbaum's \n     adult children, Daniel and Dottie.\n       Family attorney Patrick Regan praised Fenty for reaching \n     out to the family even before he was sworn in and then \n     instructing his staff to work closely with the Rosenbaums to \n     forge a settlement. But Regan had harsh words for Howard \n     University Hospital--which remains a defendant in the lawsuit \n     in D.C. Superior Court.\n       The city's ambulance bypassed the closest hospital and took \n     Rosenbaum to Howard because one of the emergency medical \n     technicians had personal business to attend to near there. \n     Rosenbaum was not seen by a hospital physician for more than \n     90 minutes and did not get a neurological evaluation until he \n     had been there almost four hours, the family's lawsuit \n     alleges.\n       ``Howard University's performance was unacceptable, \n     atrocious. It was Third World service in the nation's \n     capital,'' Regan said. ``While the District has stepped up \n     and said, `Work with us,' Howard has refused to step up. \n     They've covered up what they did. . . . At every turn, Howard \n     has offered excuse after excuse.''\n       A spokeswoman for Howard did not respond to a request for \n     comment.\n       D.C. police also were faulted in the case for failing to \n     thoroughly investigate an earlier robbery that could have led \n     to the suspects. Two men have been convicted in the killing: \n     Percey Jordan, who was sentenced to a 65-year term, and his \n     cousin Michael C.

A bill to authorize funding for eligible joint ventures \nbetween United States and Israeli businesses and academic persons, to \nestablish the International Energy Advisory Board, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the United States-\nIsrael Energy Cooperation Act, which is cosponsored by Senators \nBingaman and Landrieu. This bill will help foster cooperation on \nrenewable energy projects between the United States and our democratic \nally in the Middle East.\n  Israel has some of the most advanced facilities in the world for \nconcentrated solar. Israel is developing technology to use unsorted \nmunicipal waste to produce biogas, an alternative ``green''\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\nenergy for transportation and power plants. Israel has also developed \nrooftop systems for electricity and hot water supplies.\n  This bill will help implement an existing agreement between the two \nnations entitled, ``Agreement between the Department of Energy of the \nUnited States of America and the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure \nof Israel Concerning Energy Cooperation,'' dated February 1, 1996. The \nSecretary of Energy, acting through the Assistant Secretary for Energy \nEfficiency and Renewable Energy, will establish a grant program to \nsupport research development and commercialization of alternative \nrenewable energy sources.\n  Eligible projects must be joint ventures between an entity in the \nU.S. and an entity in Israel, or between the U.S. government and the \ngovernment of Israel. Eligible projects include those projects for the \nresearch, development or commercialization of alternative energy \nfacilities, improved energy efficiency or renewable energy sources. \nUnder certain circumstances, the Secretary may require repayment of the \ngrant.\n  The bill also establishes an advisory board to provide the Secretary \nwith advice on the criteria for grant recipients and on the appropriate \namount of total grant money to be awarded. Finally the bill authorizes \n$20 million annually for fiscal years 2008 through 2014 to carry out \nthis program.\n  At this time when issues related to energy security and to greenhouse \ngas emissions are receiving so much attention by the Congress, I hope \nthat my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this bill. This will \nenable the United States and Israel to build upon the important work \nbeing done in both countries to reduce our dependence on imported oil \nthat too often comes from politically unstable or hostile nations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 841. A bill for the relief of Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and Maria \nDel Refugio Plascencia; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am offering today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Alfredo \nPlascencia Lopez and his wife, Maria del Refugio Plascencia, Mexican \nnationals living in San Bruno, CA.\n  I have decided to offer legislation on their behalf because I believe \nthat, without it, this hardworking couple and their four United States \ncitizen children would endure an immense and unfair hardship. Indeed, \nwithout this legislation, this family may not remain a family for much \nlonger.\n  In the 18 years that the Plascencias have been here, they have worked \nto adjust their status through the appropriate legal channels, only to \nhave their efforts thwarted by inattentive legal counsel.\n  Repeatedly, the Plascencia's lawyer refused to return their calls or \notherwise communicate with them in any way, thereby leaving them in the \ndark. He also failed to forward crucial immigration documents, or even \nnotify the Plascencias that he had them.\n  Because of the poor representation they received, Mr. and Mrs. \nPlascencia only became aware that they had been ordered to leave the \ncountry 15 days prior to their deportation.\n  Although the family was stunned and devastated by this discovery, \nthey acted quickly to fire their attorney for gross incompetence, \nsecure competent counsel, and file the appropriate paperwork to delay \ntheir deportation to determine if any other legal action could be \ntaken.\n  For several reasons, it would be tragic for this family to be removed \nfrom the United States.\n  First, since arriving in the United States in 1988, Mr. and Mrs. \nPlascencia have proven themselves to be a responsible and civic-minded \ncouple who share our American values of hard work, dedication to \nfamily, and devotion to community.\n  Second, Mr. Plascencia has been gainfully employed at Vince's \nShellfish for the past 14 years, where his dedication and willingness \nto learn have propelled him from part-time work to a managerial \nposition. He now oversees the market's entire packing operation and \nseveral employees. The President of Vince's Shellfish, in one of the \nseveral dozen letters I have received in support of Mr. Plascencia, \nreferred to him as ``a valuable and respected employee'' who ``handles \nhimself in a very professional manner'' and serves as ``a role model'' \nto other employees. Others who have written to me praising Mr. \nPlascencia's job performance have referred to him as ``gifted,'' \n``trusted,'' ``honest,'' and ``reliable.''\n  Third, like her husband, Mrs. Plascencia has distinguished herself as \na medical assistant at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in the Bay Area. \nNot satisfied with working as a maid at a local hotel, Mrs. Plascencia \nwent to school, earned her high school equivalency degree, improved her \nskills, and became a medical assistant.\n  For 5 years, Mrs. Plascencia was working in Kaiser Permanente's \nOncology Department, where she attended to cancer patients. Her \ncolleagues, many of whom have written to me in support of her, commend \nher ``unending enthusiasm'' and have described her work as \n``responsible,'' ``efficient,'' and ``compassionate.''\n  In fact, Kaiser Permanente's Director of Internal Medicine, Nurse \nRose Carino, wrote to say that Mrs. Plascencia is ``an asset to the \ncommunity and exemplifies the virtues we Americans extol: hardworking, \ndevoted to her family, trustworthy and loyal, [and] involved in her \ncommunity. She and her family are a solid example of the type of \nimmigrant that America should welcome wholeheartedly.'' Nurse Carino \nwent on to write that Mrs. Plascencia is ``an excellent employee and \nrole model for her colleagues. She works in a very demanding unit, \nOncology, and is valued and depended on by the physicians she works \nwith.''\n  The physicians themselves confirm this. For example, Dr. Laurie \nWeisberg, the Chief of Oncology at Kaiser Permanente, writes that Mrs. \nPlascencia ``is truly an asset to our unit and is one of the main \nreasons that it functions effectively.''\n  Together, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia have used their professional \nsuccesses to realize many of the goals dreamed of by all Americans. \nThey saved up and bought a home. They own a car. They have good health \ncare benefits and they each have begun saving for retirement. They want \nto send their children to college and give them an even better life.\n  This private relief bill is important because it would preserve these \nachievements and ensure that Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia will be able to \nmake substantive contributions to the community in the future. It is \nimportant, also, because of the positive impact it will have on the \ncouple's children, each of whom is a United States citizen and each of \nwhom is well on their way to becoming productive members of the Bay \nArea community.\n  Christina, 14, is the Plascencia's oldest child, and an honor student \nat Parkside Intermediate School in San Bruno.\n  Erika, 10, and Alfredo Jr., 8, are enrolled at Belle Air Elementary, \nwhere they have worked hard at their studies and received praise and \ngood grades from their teachers. In fact, the principal of Erika's \nschool recognized her as the ``Most Artistic'' student in her class. \nErika's teacher, Mrs. Nascon, remarked on a report card, ``Erika is a \nbright spot in my classroom.''\n  The Plascencia's youngest child is 3-year-old Daisy.\n  Removing Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia from the United States would be most \ntragic for their children. These children were born in the United \nStates and, through no fault of their own, have been thrust into a \nsituation that has the potential to alter their lives dramatically.\n  It would be especially tragic for the Plascencia's older children--\nChristina, Erika, and Alfredo--to have to leave the United States. They \nare old enough to understand that they are leaving their schools, their \nteachers, their friends, and their home. They would leave everything \nthat is familiar to them. Their parents would find themselves in Mexico \nwithout a job and without a house. The children would have to acclimate \nto a different culture, language, and way of life.\n  The only other option would be for Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia to leave \ntheir children here with relatives. This separation is a choice which \nno parents should have to make.\n  Many of the words I have used to describe Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia are \nnot\n\n[[Page S3003]]\n\nmy own. They are the words of the Americans who live and work with the \nPlascencias day in and day out and who find them to embody the American \nspirit. I have sponsored this private relief bill, and ask my \ncolleagues to support it, because I believe that this is a spirit that \nwe must nurture wherever we can find it. Forcing the Plascencias to \nleave the United States would extinguish that spirit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the private relief bill and \nthe numerous letters of support my office has received from members of \nthe San Bruno community be entered into the Record immediately \nfollowing this statement.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 841\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR ALFREDO PLASCENCIA \n                   LOPEZ AND MARIA DEL REFUGIO PLASCENCIA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Alfredo \n     Plascencia Lopez and Maria Del Refugio Plascencia shall each \n     be eligible for the issuance of an immigrant visa or for \n     adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted \n     for permanent residence upon filing an application for \n     issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of that Act \n     or for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and \n     Maria Del Refugio Plascencia enter the United States before \n     the filing deadline specified in subsection (c), Alfredo \n     Plascencia Lopez and Maria Del Refugio Plascencia shall be \n     considered to have entered and remained lawfully and shall be \n     eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act as of the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application \n     for issuance of immigrant visas or the application for \n     adjustment of status are filed with appropriate fees within 2 \n     years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of immigrant visas or permanent residence to Alfredo \n     Plascencia Lopez and Maria Del Refugio Plascencia, the \n     Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to \n     reduce by 2, during the current or next following fiscal \n     year, the total number of immigrant visas that are made \n     available to natives of the country of the aliens' birth \n     under section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     or, if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that \n     are made available to natives of the country of the aliens' \n     birth under section 202(e) of that Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Kaiser Permanente,\n\n                              San Francisco, CA, January 10, 2007.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       To Whom It May Concern: I am writing to attest to the \n     character and work ethic of Marla Del Refugio Plascencia. I \n     am the Director of Medicine at Kaiser Permanente, South San \n     Francisco. I have known Maria since she was hired as a \n     medical assistant into my department in July 2000.\n       Maria is an excellent employee and role model for her \n     colleagues. She is extremely dependable; She works in a very \n     demanding unit, Oncology, and is valued and depended on by \n     the physicians she works with. Maria is flexible, thorough \n     and proactive. She pays attention to detail and identifies \n     potential problems before they occur. In addition, her \n     bilingual skills enhance the patient care experience for our \n     members who speak Spanish.\n       In her short tenure here, Maria found time to volunteer \n     with our community outreach programs. She served as a \n     volunteer interpreter for our recent Neighbors in Health \n     event, wherein free health care was provided to uninsured \n     children in our local community.\n       I can't say enough about Maria and the type of person she \n     is. I feel fortunate to have her in my department. She is an \n     asset to the community and exemplifies the virtues we \n     Americans extol: hardworking, devoted to her family, \n     trustworthy and loyal employee, involved in her community. \n     She and her family are a solid example of the type of \n     immigrant that America should welcome wholeheartedly.\n       It would be an incredible miscarriage of justice if Maria \n     and Alfredo are deported. They came to this country to pursue \n     a better life and afford their children opportunities that \n     they wouldn't have in Mexico. They have begun to do just that \n     by establishing roots in the community and purchasing a home. \n     Deporting Maria and Alfredo would rip their family apart and \n     result in either depriving their children of a loving family \n     or depriving them of their rights as American citizens if \n     they leave the country of their birth with their parents.\n       I pray that you will allow them the opportunity to live in \n     this country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Rose Carino, RN,\n     Director, Department of Medicine.\n                                  ____\n\n     Sen. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       My name is Rosa Mendoza, and I am a resident of San Bruno, \n     my letter is with the purpose of presenting my observations \n     on Maria and Alfredo Plascencia whom I have known for about 6 \n     yrs, when Maria started to work for Kaiser Permanente, as I'm \n     a Kaiser Permanente employee myself.\n       Maria is a very respectful person, and owns very good moral \n     principles; she likes to help people according to each other \n     necessities. I support the private legislation introduced in \n     their behalf, as this type of people is what each country \n     needs. Here by I'm asking Senator Feinstein to please keep \n     working on their case for them to become residents of this \n     country, as this family needs to stay together. If there \n     should be any questions please do not hesitate to contact me \n     at (650) 303-8930.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rosa Mendoza.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 10, 2007.\n     Re: Alfredo Plascensia Lopez and Maria Del Refugio Plascencia\n\n     Sen. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Washington, DC.\n       To Whom It May Concern: The purpose of this letter is to \n     present my observations on Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and Maria \n     Del Refugio Plascencia's character and work ethic.\n       I have worked with Maria Del Refugio Plascencia for the \n     past six years and in that time I have gotten to know her as \n     a person and a friend. Maria is always willing to help in any \n     situation. She shows great compassion to the patients, as she \n     is always willing to assist them. In the past year, I have \n     also gotten to know Alfredo Plascencia Lopez as well as their \n     five children. Maria and Alfredo have invited my daughter and \n     me to their home on many occasions and while visiting there, \n     I have always felt very welcomed as my daughter feels the \n     same. They treat my daughter as if she were one of their own.\n       In the past six years, I have also observed how hard \n     working both Maria and Alfredo are. But while working as hard \n     as they do both still find time to create a balance between \n     work, home, family, friends and church. Maria and Alfredo do \n     all they can for their family, employers and anyone who is in \n     need of a helping hand. As a mother, I can't imagine having \n     to go through what Maria and Alfredo are going through right \n     now. It would be unfair to the Plascencia family if Maria and \n     Alfredo were to be deported at this time in their lives. It \n     would also cause a great loss to the Oncology department as \n     Maria offers tremendous support to all of us here at Kaiser.\n       Hereby I want to express my gratitude to Senator Feinstein \n     for the great work that she is doing on the private \n     legislation, and at the same time I want to ask to please \n     keep helping them by renewing the introduction of the \n     legislation. I hope that there is justice in this case and \n     some consideration of everyone involved in this situation. \n     Not only will Maria and Alfredo be affected by being deported \n     but also this could change the lives of their children, \n     family, friends, co-workers and the patients here at Kaiser. \n     We need more people like the Plascencia's in our country, as \n     they are a model family.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Erika Hidalgo,\n\n                                   Medical Assistant/Receptionist,\n                                                Kaiser Permanente.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 842. A bill to authorize to be appropriated $9,200,000 for fiscal \nyear 2008 to acquire real property and carry out military construction \nprojects at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nauthorizing new construction at Cannon Air Force Base, NM.\n  I am proud to offer this bill because Cannon has a variety of \nmilitary construction needs because of a June 2006 decision by the \nSecretary of Defense to use Cannon Air Force Base as an Air Force \nSpecial Operations base.\n  Two of these needs are an MC-130 Flight Simulator facility and \nrenovations to an existing Hangar to accommodate C-130 aircraft. The \nDepartment of Defense budgeted for both of these items in its fiscal \nyear 2008 Defense budget request, and in keeping with that request my \nlegislation authorizes $7.5 million for the MC-130 Flight Simulator \nfacility and $1.7 million for hangar renovations.\n  Our special operations forces are a part of some of the most \nimportant missions in the Global War on Terror, and we have more \nspecial operations warfighters deployed now than ever before. I am \nproud to support those soldiers, and I look forward to working on this \nbill and taking other actions to support our special operations forces.\n\n[[Page S3004]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 842\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the protection of unaccompanied alien \nchildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the \nUnaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2007, along with Senators \nHagel, Kennedy, Feingold, Cantwell, and Kerry. This important \nlegislation will govern the way the Federal Government treats \nundocumented immigrant children who end up or show up all alone at our \nborders or within the United States.\n  I first introduced legislation similar to this bill in January 2001. \nIt has now passed twice out of the Senate. Yet, unfortunately, both \ntimes it stalled in the House of Representatives.\n  Despite the passage of time, this bill remains vital to the proper \ntreatment of young undocumented children who get caught within our \nFederal system. My hope is that this is the year that this bill will \nbecome law.\n  Every year, more than 7,000 undocumented and unaccompanied children \nare apprehended. Most are from Central America, but others come from \nMexico, India, China, Somalia, Sierra Leone, and remote places around \nthe world. Some have parents or other relatives who the child is trying \nto find in the United States, but many have no one.\n  These children come to the United States for many reasons: reuniting \nwith family, pursuing education or employment, escaping family violence \nor abuse, fleeing political or religious persecution, and seeking \nprotection from gang violence or recruitment.\n  Some children are brought here by adults seeking to exploit them for \ncommercial sex work, domestic servitude, or other forced labor. \nSometimes they're too young to understand why they've been sent to the \nUnited States at all.\n  These children are the most vulnerable immigrants who come to this \ncountry and I believe we have a special obligation to ensure that they \nare treated humanely and fairly.\n  Historically, U.S. immigration law and policies have been developed \nand implemented without regard to their effect on children. This result \nhas been similar to trying to fit a square peg in a round hole--it just \ncannot work.\n  Under current immigration law, these children are forced to struggle \nthrough a system designed for adults, even though they lack the \ncapacity to understand nuanced legal principles, let alone courtroom \nand administrative procedures. Because of this, children who may very \nwell be eligible for relief are often deported back to the very life-\nthreatening situations from which they fled--before they are even able \nto make their cases before the Department of Homeland Security or an \nimmigration judge.\n  For example, the New York Times recently reported the story of Young \nZheng, who was 14 years old when his parents sent him from China to the \nUnited States.\n  He was first detained for a year at a facility that was later closed \ndue to abysmal conditions. Fortunately, he was then transferred to \nChicago, where he was assigned a child advocate who spent time with him \nand urged his release to his relatives.\n  Six months later, Young was released to live with his uncle in Akron, \nOH. Then, immigration authorities suddenly attempted to deport Young in \nApril 2005.\n  Young so feared being deported that he tried to hurt himself. Young \nwas terrified that he would be subject to torture by the Chinese \ngovernment or that the traffickers would exact physical revenge. The \ntraffickers had already threatened retribution against his family if \nthey did not repay the trafficking fee of $60,000.\n  With the help of a team of pro bono attorneys and the child advocate, \nYoung's removal was stayed. In April 2006, Young received his green \ncard and is now a model high school student.\n  This example dramatically highlights why this legislation is still so \ncritical. It was only because Young was lucky enough that pro bono \nattorneys and a child advocate happened to intervene in his case that \nhe was not deported. And, they intervened only after he was detained \nfor 1 year in squalid conditions in the United States.\n  According to an analysis of Department of Justice data in 2000, those \nchildren fortunate enough to find representation, usually through a pro \nbono attorney, are more than four times as likely to be granted asylum.\n  Sadly, many children never get the help of a child advocate or a pro \nbono lawyer. Worse, for those children who are victims of human \ntrafficking, their only advice may come from lawyers hired by the \ntraffickers who care nothing for the child's best interest.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today builds on the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002, which adopted components of the bill that I first \nintroduced during the 107th Congress.\n  The Homeland Security Act transferred responsibility for the care and \nplacement of unaccompanied alien children from the now-abolished \nImmigration and Naturalization Service to the Office of Refugee \nResettlement within the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  This change finally resolved the conflict of interest inherent in the \nformer system that pitted the enforcement side of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service against the benefits side of that same agency in \nthe care of unaccompanied alien children.\n  I am pleased that the provision transferring responsibility for the \ncare and custody of unaccompanied alien children was included in the \nHomeland Security Act, and that by all accounts, the transition in the \ncare of children between the affected agencies has gone well.\n  Yet, because the Homeland Security Act was crafted quickly, it left \nthe Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Refugee \nResettlement without clearly distinguished mandates and \nresponsibilities in some key areas, including legal custody, age \ndetermination procedures, and State court dependency proceedings.\n  Congress now has a responsibility to go beyond the simple transfer of \nchildren from one agency to another to actually laying out the process \nand steps to ensure that unaccompanied alien children are treated \nfairly and humanely.\n  We must provide the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the Department of \nHomeland Security and the Department of Justice with the tools they \nwill need to succeed in their missions regarding the care of \nunaccompanied alien children after the transfer of jurisdiction took \nplace.\n  First of all, I want to stress that this bill is not about benefits, \nas it provides no new immigration benefit to unaccompanied alien \nchildren. Rather, this bill is about the process of how we treat these \nchildren under the current system.\n  The ``Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act'' provides guidance \nand instruction to the Office of Refugee and Resettlement, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice in the \nfollowing areas: first, in the custody, release, family reunification \nand detention of unaccompanied alien children; second, it provides \naccess by unaccompanied alien children to child advocates and pro bono \ncounsel; third, it streamlines the Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) \nprogram and provides guidance on the\n\n[[Page S3005]]\n\ntraining of federal government officials and private parties who come \ninto contact with unaccompanied alien children; fourth, it requires the \nissuance of guidelines specific to children's asylum claims; fifth, it \nauthorizes appropriations for the care of unaccompanied alien children; \nand, sixth, it amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide \nadditional responsibilities and powers to the Office of Refugee \nResettlement with respect to unaccompanied alien children.\n  Central throughout the ``Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act'' \nare two concepts: (1) The United States government has a fundamental \nresponsibility to protect unaccompanied children in its custody; and, \n(2) In all proceedings and actions, the government should have as a \npriority protecting the interests of these children who are not \ncriminals or do not pose a risk to our national security.\n  Imagine the fear of an unaccompanied alien child, in the United \nStates alone, without a parent or guardian. Imagine that child being \nthrust into a system he or she does not understand, provided no access \nto pro bono counsel or a child advocate, placed in jail with adults or \nhoused with juveniles with serious criminal convictions.\n  I find it hard to believe that our country would allow children to be \ntreated in such a manner.\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation today.

A bill to amend the Longshore and Harbor Workers' \nCompensation Act to improve the compensation system, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today, I introduce the Longshore and \nHarbor\n\n[[Page S3011]]\n\nWorkers' Compensation Act Amendments of 2007. The Longshore Act \nprovides medical, physical rehabilitation and lost wage replacement \nbenefits to thousands of workers nationwide for work-related injuries, \nillnesses and deaths. The Act is long overdue for attention from \nCongress, and I am eager to engage with my colleagues from both sides \nas to how we can improve the system for our workers, their employers, \ntaxpayers and our economy as a whole.\n  We all can agree that the workers covered under this program play a \nkey role in our national security and in our vital international trade. \nLongshore and harbor workers labor on the piers of Portland, ME, in the \ndead of winter, just as they toil in the hot Southern sun in Savannah, \nGA. Their work is undoubtedly difficult and often dangerous. It is \nimpossible to underestimate the extent to which Americans rely on the \nmyriad of products these workers move in and out of our nations' ports. \nEvery year, over 15 billion tons of freight moves through our ports, \nwith a total value of $9 trillion.\n  These workers deserve a fair and effective workers' compensation \nprogram. Since 1927, longshore and harbor workers have had a unique \nprogram all their own. Congress enacted the Act in response to Southern \nPacific Company v. Jensen, a ruling by the Supreme Court in 1917. The \nCourt held that the Maritime Clause in the Constitution forbids states \nfrom covering shore-based maritime workers who may become injured while \nworking on vessels anchored in navigable waters. Now, nearly 90 years \nlater, not only are private stevedoring companies covered by the Act, \nbut so are virtually all maritime construction folks, builders and \nrepairers of U.S. Naval and Coast Guard vessels, Federal contractors \nwith overseas employees, oil rig workers, and even civilian employees \nat the Post Exchanges on U.S. military bases.\n  As many of us have learned if we ever spent time in our State \nlegislatures, States nationwide regularly amend their programs to \nincorporate the most modern and best workers' compensation practices. \nHowever, unlike these responsible state legislatures, Congress has not \naddressed the Longshore Act in over two decades.\n  Since the last amendments to the Act, States from California to Rhode \nIsland have found numerous methods of improving their workers' \ncompensation programs, saving taxpayers' dollars, and eliminating \nwaste, fraud and abuse, while always ensuring that workers have \nappropriate medical care. We must bring these State-level innovations \nin workers' compensation to the Longshore Act system.\n  Technology, events, and even Congressional interventions have \ncontinued to dramatically change our nations' seaports and shipyards. \nIndeed, since 2002, per Congress's instruction, U.S. Customs has begun \nlocating so-called ``VACIS machines'' at U.S. terminals. These machines \nare truck-mounted gamma ray imaging systems that produce radiographic \nimages of the contents of containers and other cargo to determine the \npossible presence of many types of contraband. Eventually, EVERY port \nin the country will have the machines on sight. Will maritime workers \nbe exposed to radiation? If so, will they file claims against their \nemployers when the machines are owned and operated by the Federal \nGovernment?\n  The bill I introduce today will foster a sound and fair workers' \ncompensation system for maritime workers with a clear, exclusive remedy \nfor their workplace injuries and illnesses. It will guarantee fairness \nfor workers, and in the event of death, their survivors. It will make \nour ports and shipbuilders more competitive. It will ensure fair \ncompensability, in that it will hold employers responsible for only \nthat which is caused by employment under the Longshore Act system. It \nwill fix, once and for all, the so-called ``Special Fund,'' an archaic \nand problematic vestige of early 20th Century public policy.\n  In May 2006, I chaired a hearing of the Subcommittee on Employment \nand Workplace Safety, at which we heard about many different problems \nwith the implementation of this 80-year-old Act. I have incorporated \nsuggestions from both sides in crafting the bill I introduce today.\n  Since I began dealing with this issue last year, I have talked with \nmore and more workers, port operators, and administrators from the Port \nof Savannah in my home State of Georgia. Savannah is the Nation's \neleventh busiest waterborne freight gateway for international trade. \nEvery year, over $20 billion of international freight move through it \nand its neighboring port of Brunswick. The folks I talk to at Savannah \nand Brunswick tell me that they can't emphasize enough the importance \nof revising the Longshore Act to make it more efficient.\n  I hope we can move on this bill, for the sake of taxpayers, for \nworkers in Savannah and Brunswick and at ports and ship building \nfacilities nationwide, and for the international commerce that is vital \nto our Nation's economy and way of life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/12/senate-section/article/S3011-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TO REVISE UNITED STATES POLICY ON IRAQ--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID.

Before I do so, I would like to state for the \nrecord there are ongoing discussions about this bill and we have \noffered to the Republicans a proposal that would have a very limited \nnumber of amendments and debate time. I feel fairly confident at this \ntime we can reach that agreement. There has been cooperation on both \nsides. If we are able to reach that agreement, then it will not be \nnecessary to have a cloture vote.
