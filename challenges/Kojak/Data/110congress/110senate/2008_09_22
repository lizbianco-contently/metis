Mr. President, when there is a fire in your kitchen \nthreatening to burn down your home, you don't want someone stopping the \nfirefighters on the way and demanding they hand out smoke detectors \nfirst or lecturing you about the hazards of keeping paint in the \nbasement. You want them to put out the fire before it burns down your \nhome and everything you have saved for your whole life.\n  The same is true of our current economic situation. We know there is \na serious threat to our economy. We know we must take action to try to \nhead off a serious blow to Main Street.\n  Over the weekend, Congress received a straightforward four-page Main \nStreet rescue plan aimed at protecting millions of American families \nand small businesses from the potentially devastating effects of a \ncredit meltdown. We are told that inaction could make it impossible for \nordinary Americans to take out loans for college tuition, cars, new \nhomes, and everything else, triggering a corresponding collapse in \nmanufacturing and services that could wipe out savings and lead to \nmassive job losses. The final cost of the plan is unclear, but the \npotential consequences of inaction are not.\n  This proposal was designed to contain a spreading crisis, and urgent \naction is needed. That is why Republicans have resisted the impulse to \ntry to add permanent tax relief and other aid to families and \nbusinesses that we believe is critical to the long-term health of our \nNation's economy. And we ask our colleagues across the aisle to show \nsimilar restraint so that whatever action we take can be done quickly \nand in time to make a real difference.\n  This stabilization plan gives us an opportunity to prevent long-term \ndamage to Americans' savings, home values, and livelihoods--to contain \nthe problem from spreading to Main Street. Surely we can all agree to \nwork with each other and stand up for the American people instead of \nusing the bill as fly paper for partisan add-ons.\n  Republicans have many serious questions about this plan, but this is \nthe only concrete plan we have seen so far that aims to protect \nAmericans on Main Street--to protect their homes, their savings, their \nretirement plans, protect endangered jobs and small businesses--and we \nshouldn't jeopardize that effort by delaying urgent action or playing \npartisan politics.\n  Americans want to know their savings and retirement accounts are \nsafe. They want the security of knowing the problems on Wall Street are \nnot going to spread to Main Street. The only way we can give them that \nsecurity and that assurance is by putting partisan interests aside.\n  There will be many more questions about this plan. I have many \nmyself. But we owe it to the American people to do our due diligence \nquickly and act swiftly, Democrats and Republicans alike, to contain \nthis crisis before it is too late.\n  I am confident that we can work together. The American people are \ncounting on us. Let's not disappoint them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/22/senate-section/article/S9170-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9170-S9171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Master Sergeant Thomas L. Bruner\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nKentucky's great heroes in uniform. MSG Thomas L. Bruner of Owensboro, \nKY, was tragically lost while serving his country in Afghanistan on \nOctober 28, 2007. A proud member of the Army Reserves for many years, \nhe was 50 years old.\n  For his valor in uniform, Master Sergeant Bruner received several \nmedals, decorations, and awards, including the Meritorious Service \nMedal, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, two Army Commendation \nMedals, two Army Achievement Medals, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the \nNational Defense Service Medal with two Bronze Service Stars, and two \nArmed Forces Reserve Medals with ``M'' device.\n  Those who knew him will remember Master Sergeant Bruner--or, as \nfriends called him, ``Tommy''--as a family man. ``Family was first to \nhim,'' says his brother, Robert Bruner. ``It was all the time family, \nfamily, family, everywhere he went.''\n  He was devoted to his wife Jane Bruner, to whom he was married for 27 \nyears. They met in a club where she served bar. Night after night, he \nwould walk in and notice her. Jane was skeptical at first, but \neventually Tommy convinced one of her friends to trick Jane into going \nout with him after the club closed. ``He spoiled me rotten,'' Jane \nrecalls. ``He would do everything for me. He was my everything . . . my \nlife.''\n  Jane's two sons, Tom-Tom and Brian Sanefur, became Tommy's stepsons, \nand he loved them like his own. ``He was always there,'' Brian \nremembers. ``He was a good father, husband, and friend.''\n  Perhaps even better than fatherhood was grandfatherhood. Tommy had \nthree grandkids--T.J., Jacob, and ``Baby'' Grace--and loved playing \nwith them. ``He lived for those grandkids,'' Jane says. She remembers \nhow it was not uncommon for Tommy to crawl down on the floor with them \nand watch cartoon after cartoon.\n  The most exciting holiday in the Bruner household was Christmas \nbecause Tommy outdid everyone on decorations. He was able to spend each \nChristmas at home. ``He had reindeer, he had lights, a snowman, a \nsled,'' Jane recalls. ``We've always had big Christmases.'' While \nserving in Afghanistan, Tommy even told Jane that he had gone to a \nbazaar there and done some Christmas shopping for her and the children.\n  Soon before his passing, Tommy and Jane built a new house together in \nOwensboro, and Tommy helped pick out the colors. The couple saved up \ntheir money until they could build a home of their dreams. Jane has \nplanted a white dogwood tree now at the house in Tommy's memory.\n  In that house, Tommy turned the garage into what Jane calls his ``war \nroom,'' where he put up pictures of battles from the Revolutionary War \nto Operation Enduring Freedom. It was his little getaway, and Jane has \nleft it just as it was.\n  Tommy was a veteran soldier, having served on Active Duty from 1975 \nto 1979 and then joined the Army Reserves in 1981. He volunteered to \nserve in Afghanistan because he wanted to help train the younger \nsoldiers and was deployed with Headquarters, 2nd Brigade, 100th \nDivision, U.S. Army Reserve, based out of Owensboro, KY. ``He wanted to \ngo, and I said, `There's no way I'm going to stop you from doing what \nyou want to do,' '' Jane says. ``He was just a soldier doing his job, \nand he loved it.''\n\n  Jane also recalls that Tommy said he loved it in Afghanistan. He \nthought the country was beautiful, and he was trying to learn the \nlanguage. He told Jane the mission in Afghanistan was the highlight of \nhis career.\n  Patrick Rowe, the training coordinator at the Owensboro Army Reserve \nCenter, recalls Tommy's bond with his fellow soldiers. ``He knew his \nguys,'' Patrick said. ``You could ask him anything about anybody.''\n  At home, Tommy attended Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church and \nworked as manager at the Don Moore Auto Mall. They appreciated him \nthere because he was ``so picky,'' Jane says. He paid attention to \nevery detail. He had been planning to retire after his latest tour, but \nJane thinks he still would have worked there to give himself something \nto do.\n  Tommy died of a heart attack while serving his country in \nAfghanistan. Jane knew something was wrong because Tommy called her \nevery day, until one day he did not call.\n  Our thoughts are with his many loved ones after such a loss. We are \nthinking of his wife Jane; his stepsons, Tom and Brian Sanefur; his \nmother Martha; his grandmother Virginia; his grandchildren, T.J., \nJacob, and Grace Sanefur; his brother Robert; and many other beloved \nfriends and family members.\n  Jane received an insurance settlement after Tommy died. She decided \nshe already had everything she wanted, so she gave the money to the \ngrandchildren. ``It is what he would have wanted,'' Jane said.\n  I express my deepest sympathies to Jane Bruner and to all of her and \nTommy's family. I would like them to know this Senate honors MSG Thomas \nL.

Mr. President, this weekend the Bush administration sent to \nCongress its plan to address our country's growing economic crisis. All \nmy Democratic colleagues in the Senate understand the need to take \naction to steady our economy, and we are prepared to act swiftly and \nresponsibly to pass legislation that puts interest in the security of \nthe American people first. We know, for example, that last year 2\\1/2\\ \nmillion Americans secured mortgages, and nearly half of all college \nstudents secured loans so they could go to school. The consequences of \na broken banking system, devoid of loans for homes, college tuition, \nautomobiles, and business investment would be devastating. We are \nprepared to do what is necessary to avoid these unacceptable \nconsequences, but we will not let haste abandon good judgment in the \nprocess.\n\n  The Bush administration has called on Congress to rubberstamp its \nbill without serious debate or efforts to improve it. We can't let that \nhappen. The legislation sent to the Congress by the Treasury Department \nrecognizes the scope of the crisis the Bush administration created, a \nview that we share with Secretary Paulson. The Bush administration's \nbill is a starting point but by no means the final product.\n  Democrats believe there should be protection for the taxpayers who \nare footing the bill for this legislation. That begins with more \noversight, more transparency, more accountability, and more controls to \nprevent conflicts of interest. Democrats believe there should be limits \non compensation for company executives who benefit from this \nlegislation so the American people don't see their tax dollars spent on \nexorbitant corporate pay and even golden parachutes. The American \npeople earn their pay through honest hard work and so should CEOs.\n  What is a golden parachute? It is a method of compensating executives \nwhen they leave their companies. It would be wrong for these \nemployees--these managers who are leaving their companies--to get huge \namounts of money for simply leaving. This legislation should prevent \nthat.\n  We believe that in exchange for shouldering the enormous burden of \nthe Bush plan, taxpayers should reap any future economic rewards. That \nis what happened when we bailed out the savings and loans. It should \nhappen here. That means this plan should not permit taxpayer money to \npurchase an asset at an inflated price exclusively for the benefit of \nprivate shareholders.\n  Democrats believe this legislation affects not just the American \neconomy but the global economy, and we will call upon other nations to \ndo their part. But one of the provisions suggested in this bill is that \nwe would spend money to bail out foreign banks. I think we have to be \nvery careful with that.\n  We believe this legislation should provide aid for Americans at risk \nof losing their homes to foreclosure. As the law currently stands, the \nwealthiest Americans can seek mortgage assistance from a bankruptcy \njudge to help keep their second, their third, their fourth, their \nfifth, their sixth, even their seventh home, but working families can't \nseek mortgage relief from a bankruptcy judge for their first and only \nhome--their primary residence. That makes no sense, and we should \nchange it. Bankruptcy court should have the authority to reach mutually \nbeneficial arrangements to allow families to keep their homes and \nprevent more foreclosures.\n  We believe it is not enough to fund a Wall Street bailout. We need an \neconomic recovery plan to create jobs, provide better unemployment \ninsurance, and invest in our country's infrastructure. Now, such a plan \nhas to be voted upon before we adjourn, either as part of this \nlegislation or separately. These steps will help catalyze long-term \neconomic growth once the dust on Wall Street settles.\n  Democrats in Congress fully understand the severity of the situation \nand the need to pass legislation, but we are not willing to give \nPresident Bush a blank check. We are now seeing 8 years of reckless \nBush economic policies come crashing down with unimaginable speed and \nseverity. This crisis puts our economy and the well-being of the \nAmerican people in serious jeopardy.\n  President Bush said on Friday we should assign blame later. What else \nis he going to say? Of course, he would say exactly that because he is \nthe culprit of the crisis. What else would the culprit say?\n  The American people have a right to know what brought us to this \ngrave economic danger. The answer is the President and a Republican \nCongress determined to repeal all reasonable oversight and \naccountability and ignore what they couldn't repeal and allow corporate \ngreed and recklessness to saturate our economy. Democratic and \nRepublican Presidents who served before President Bush all understood \nthat demanding accountability from the financial sector is not somehow \nanticapitalist but the opposite: It maintains balance, protects \ntaxpayers, and keeps our economy running smoothly.\n  The greed-fueled Bush-Cheney economy thought they knew better. They \nput cronies and idealogues in charge of our most critical regulatory \nagencies, people who disdain Government oversight of any kind and \nsystematically put Wall Street ahead of Main Street.

But now we find an article \nwritten by Senator McCain in one of the health journals saying he \nthinks the health care industry should be deregulated just like the \nbank industry. How about that. It is in writing. President ``Wannabe'' \nMcCain has written an article saying we should treat the health \nindustry just like the banking industry. Now, that is enough said about \nhow Senator McCain is going the take care of the problems of this \ncountry economically.\n  This hands-off, business-first, Bush-Cheney economic philosophy \ninfiltrated nearly all aspects of the economy--from mortgages to \nconsumer safety to the airline industry--and the people of America are \nnow left to suffer the consequences. This morning, Monday, the first \nday of autumn, President Bush released a statement preemptively \ncriticizing Democrats for working to improve his plan.

We Democrats understand the value of each and every dollar \nspent on this plan because we know each and every dollar comes from the \nAmerican people.

Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent to take up, if we \nhave someone here on the other side. We have been working for this \nentire Congress, especially hard the last 6 months, to complete \nlegislation that one Senator has held up--34 different bills dealing \nwith very important issues: stroke victims, people who are paralyzed, \npostpartum depression.\n  We have situations dealing with very serious issues. In fact, the \n``Oprah'' show has dealt with one issue that this one Senator has held \nup dealing with sexual predators, pornography. But one Senator has held \nup 34 different bills. Now, remember, these are authorizations. There \nisn't a single penny spent in any of these bills.\n  We have legislation being help up which deals with Emmett Till, \ngiving some recognition to what has gone on in years past about people \nof color and how they were treated.\n  So I am going to take a few minutes to make a series of unanimous-\nconsent requests to try to get some important bills passed. I will \nstart with S. 3297, the Advancing America's Priorities Act. And then if \nRepublicans block that, I am going to break it into various parts and \nseek unanimous consent to pass these.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has said he has no problem with eight or so \nbills. We will see. It is hard for me to comprehend how, each day that \ngoes by, these very important pieces of legislation are held up. We \nhave tried to get these passed. I have filed cloture on two separate \noccasions, and it has been blocked by Republicans. This is regrettable \nobstructionism, but it has plagued this Congress. We have had \napproximately 95 filibusters used this Congress.\n  We all know the Senate was not built for speed. That is the way the \nFounding Fathers set this up. But what has happened is ridiculous. The \nSenate rules give rights to the minority, as they should, and even \nindividual Senators. The Senate rules sometimes make things move slowly \nand don't allow the majority to run roughshod over the minority, and I \nagree with that. The rules promote bipartisanship. They promote a \ndeliberative process and policies with broad support throughout the \ncountry.\n  At the same time, however, these rights come with some \nresponsibilities. Traditionally, the rules of the Senate have not been \nabused by the minority or by individual Senators. When a policy has \nbrought bipartisan support and the Senate committees have acted, \nindividual Senators would not hold up important pieces of legislation \nin years past because, otherwise, one Senator is saying: I know best. \nThat is what has happened here. I know better than the committee. I \nknow better than the Congress, better than the Senate, better than the \nbroad bipartisan majority. The Senate rules were meant to promote \ncentrism, not egocentrism.\n  It used to be that if one Senator was trying to abuse the Senate \nrules, then his or her caucus would set them straight--they would vote \nfor cloture, to end the filibuster of the one who was halting progress \non broad bipartisan legislation. Unfortunately, we have a minority now \nthat is not interested in keeping the trains running in America. In \nfact, they are interested primarily in obstructing the process on \nimportant legislation. There is no better example than what has \nhappened on these bills.\n  Remember, these bills have passed the House of Representatives, they \nhave been reported out of the committees of jurisdiction. We have seen \nan unprecedented number of filibusters by the Republicans. It is not a \nfew more than previous Congresses. The Republicans have shattered the \nrecord for obstructionism. At each step of the legislative process, we \nhave seen delay, obstruction, delay, obstruction. We have had to waste \nweeks and weeks of Senate floor time before we could vote on \nlegislation which ends up passing by a huge margin.\n  We are told by the Secretary of the Treasury, we are told by the head \nof the Federal Reserve System that the No. 1 problem that caused the \nstart of the financial meltdown was the housing crisis. Let's go back \nand look at that: Seven filibusters were initiated to pass the housing \nlegislation that we ultimately passed. Seven filibusters. In that \nprocess, more than 100,000 people went into foreclosure.\n  We have seen delay, delay, delay. It is regrettable. It is an abuse \nof the process, and it is shameful. The height of the ridiculousness \ncame on the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 3297, these 47 \nbills, this package of legislation made up exclusively of bills with \nbroad bipartisan support. These bills all passed the House with huge \nbipartisan votes--an average of about 380 votes in the House. Almost a \nthird of the package has been introduced by Republican Senators. All \nthe bills had bipartisan lists of cosponsors--every one of them. The \nbills had seen extensive legislative action. All had been marked up by \nthe House committee, voted on by the House, marked up by the Senate \ncommittee, and reported to the floor. The vast majority had seen all \nthree processes. Scores of amendments had been considered and disposed \nof during the legislative process.\n  In Congresses past, these bills would have passed with unanimous \nconsent with minimal floor time or at least gotten the support of the \nminority to stop this abuse of process. But here, no. In fact, some \nversion of the six bills had passed by unanimous consent in previous \nCongresses. Those six bills, plus scores of others, with over $1.3 \ntrillion of new authorizations, passed under Republican rule last \nCongress with no offsets. How foolish it is to have offsets for \nauthorizations--and that is just counting the bills that passed by \nunanimous consent or with the ``yes'' vote of Senator Coburn. But not \nthis Congress. This Congress, the Republicans allowed each of these \nbills to be held up by the whimsy of one Senator of their caucus, and \nthen, to show the height of how the Republican minority doesn't help, \nnow I am being asked to wait until 6:30 or 7 o'clock today, until he \nshows up, holding up the entire Senate, holding up the passage of these \nbills. These bills are not just naming of courthouses. These are bills \ndealing with the Christopher Reeve paralysis bill, helping people who \nare paralyzed, stroke victims; setting up a registry for Lou Gehrig's \ndisease.\n  What were the bills the Republican Congress allowed Senator Coburn to \nhold up? I will talk about each one at greater length later, perhaps, \nbut here is a quick rundown of each of these bills: a bill to stop \nexploitation of children by Internet predators, which has been held up \nfor months and months; bills to promote research and education about \nstrokes, paralysis--including helping paralyzed veterans. We have seen \nit on their license plates--``paralyzed veterans.'' That is what they \nhave in Nevada. I don't know if they have it other places. Paralysed \nveterans--held up; Lou Gehrig's disease; postpartum depression; a bill \nto promote Internet broadband access throughout the country; bills to \nimprove research into knowledge about oceans; a bill to improve the \nhealth and safety of America's beaches; a bill to improve treatment \noptions for mentally ill criminals; a bill to help keep America's kids \noff the streets and extend a helping hand to children who have already \nrun away from home; a bill to reauthorize an agency that operates at a \nnet profit to the U.S. Government, that has helped promote U.S. exports \nfor years; bills to promote important U.S. foreign policy and diplomacy \nprograms.\n  Each of these bills has broad bipartisan support and has seen \nextensive legislative action. Yet Republicans are allowing one person \nto hold up these bills. They vote with him. They vote with him. They \nare just as responsible as he is because they let him get away with it.\n  One of the worst things about this obstructionism is that it was \nbased on false and disingenuous arguments. The primary argument made by \nSenator Coburn was the package of bills would spend over $10 billion; \nit costs too much. There is not one penny spent. To show how absolutely \nfoolish this is, he wrote me a letter and said what he would like me to \ndo is for me to pick $10 billion out of this, delete it from the bill, \nand then offer an amendment to put it back in--that I would do that. \nThe argument that it would cost $10 billion is simply false. It is not \ntrue. It is erroneous. The package of bills included only \nauthorizations. There was not a dime of appropriations to the package.\n  Everyone in the institution knows an authorizing bill does not spend \na\n\n[[Page S9173]]\n\npenny. Just to hammer the point home, we had the independent CBO \nconfirm that the package did not result in any new spending--which \ndidn't take a Ph.D. at CBO to figure that out. Authorizations allow \nprograms to be created and funded. When we pass an authorizing bill, we \nhope the authorized level will be looked at it in appropriations \ncommittee--as I did as a longtime member. But we realize there are \ncompeting priorities, and full funding doesn't come very often.\n  There is an entirely separate process that determines actual spending \nlevels; that is, the budget and appropriations process. The budget and \nappropriations process determines total spending and sifts through \ncompeting priorities to determine how much money each program should \nget.\n  Further, even when a new program is funded, that money does not just \nappear out of thin air. The appropriators make tough choices. Sometimes \nthey will cut one program to the bone to accommodate a new program. \nOther times they will take a little bit here or there to accomplish \nwhat they want. But in all cases the spending decisions are made \nthrough budget and appropriations, not through the authorizing process.\n  Unfortunately, pesky little things like facts and the truth have not \nbeen much of an obstacle to obstructionism this year, especially on \nthese 34 bills. It is an old playbook. If you repeat a lie enough, then \ngullible people, I guess, believe it. But facts are facts and truth is \ntruth. The main argument against this package is false.\n  I am going to try again. Due to Republican obstructionism, we simply \ndo not have time to spend a full week of Senate floor time on these \nbills. I filed cloture on a motion to proceed once before. The \nRepublicans voted against it, so we would have to do that. It takes 2 \nyears--2 days, I am sorry; it seems like 2 years--2 days to get to that \nfirst vote, and then there is 30 hours, and then on the bill I have to \nfile cloture again; 2 more days, 30 more hours. That has happened \nalmost 95 times this year, but on these bills, that is what they did. \nWe do not have time to do that. If we have a lameduck session, perhaps \nso.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 3297\n\n  I am going to seek unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nCalendar No. 894, all 34 bills, that the bill be read three times, \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nobject on behalf of Senator Coburn, the majority leader is correct, he \nwill be here a little later this afternoon and will speak to each of \nthese issues. In the meantime, he has asked that I respond to the \nmajority leader's unanimous-consent request. The only other thing I \nwould say is that his primary objection, as the majority leader is \naware, is that there have been 35 bills combined into one. Instead of \nhaving different votes on different bills, you get one vote on 35 \nbills, and Senator Coburn has already indicated his willingness to \nallow votes on several of these bills: the Drug Endangered Children \nAct; child pornography prosecutions--Enhancing the Effective \nProsecution of Child Pornography Act; the Appalachian Regional \nDevelopment Act Amendments of 2008; the Prenatally and Postnatally \nDiagnosed Conditions Awareness Act; the Christopher and Dana Reeve \nparalysis bill that the majority leader mentioned; the Vision Care for \nKids Act; the Preservation of Records of Servitude, Emancipation, and \nPost-Civil War Reconstruction Act; and with some changes the ALS \nRegistry Act; the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act; and the \nPROTECT Our Children Act.\n  As I said, the majority leader is aware of Senator Coburn's \nobjections to considering these bills as one, and therefore I would be \nrequired to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, with all the many days, \nweeks, and months they have been held up, you cannot blame Senator \nCoburn alone because there has been the complicity of these people on \nthis side of the aisle allowing him to do this. It is shameful. There \nis no other way to say it. Everyone knows this doesn't cost a single \npenny. To say they are objecting because we lump them together--did \nthey want us to file cloture on every one of these 34 bills? Every one \nof them? Remember what it takes; I have gone over it: 2 days to get to \ncloture, 30 hours after that, get on the bill, 2 more days, 30 more \nhours--it is outrageous what has happened to this country with this \nRepublican status quo. And look what the status quo has gotten us. We \nare now in a financial meltdown.\n\n  The objection is unfortunate. These are broadly bipartisan bills, \nthese are good bills, these are important bills, but we are not going \nto let obstruction go that easy. I am going to enter a series of \nunanimous-consent requests here to try to move pieces of this package.\n  I repeat, the outrageousness of all of this--do you think I might \nhave something else to do tonight at 7 o'clock while we are waiting for \nhim to jet in from Oklahoma or wherever he comes from? Do you think \nother people have other things to do than to meet his schedule, so he \ncan be here to do a few things?\n  The first unanimous-consent request is the entire health care portion \nof this package. This portion consists of very important bills covering \na range of diseases and conditions. I venture to say that every \nAmerican, every family in America is touched by some portion of the \nhealth care provisions of this package.\n  I see in this body the Senator from Maryland. With her help--we were \nnew in this body. I had three women come to visit me in Nevada. They \nwere all very sick. They had a disease called interstitial cystitis. I \nhad never heard the words in my life. Those women did not want to see \nme. They were sick. More than 90 percent of the people who get this \ndisease are women. Because we are a male-dominated legislature--not as \nmuch as we used to be--she was here alone, the only woman. I said we \nhave to do something about this because people say this was a \npsychosomatic disease. Fortunately, one of the women who got this \ndisease was an orthopedic surgeon. She said: It is not psychosomatic. \nIt is like slivers of glass being shoved up and down in my bladder. It \nis not psychosomatic.\n  I got the Senator from Maryland to help me. First of all, we \nestablished a registry for this disease. Now 40 percent of the people \nwho get this disease are symptom free. There is a medicine that has \ncome about that helps these people.\n  In addition to that, because of the advocacy of the Senator from \nMaryland, the National Institutes of Health now have a protocol, so \nthat everything that is done to study disease, women have to be \nincluded. She knows they studied 10,000 people to find out what effect \naspirin would have on heart disease. We looked at the study and not a \nsingle woman was tested. They were all men. We have been a male-\ndominated legislature, so we ignored them. But because of Senator \nMikulski, we have not done that.\n  What we are trying to do with this registry is the same thing, with \ninterstitial cystitis; that is, start having someplace where a doctor \nin Las Vegas or a doctor in Baltimore or a doctor in Chicago or in \nPhoenix can send to a place: Here is what happened with ALS. We were \nable to diagnose it; she got it; he got it; here is how long they \nlived; here are the symptoms--put something together so the great minds \nof America can work to deal with this disease. It doesn't cost any \nmoney. But Dr. Coburn has held it up, and he is going to continue to \nhold it up. He said this is one he will not agree to.\n  As I mentioned, every one of these deals with some problem that \npeople within the sound of my voice--either their families, friends, or \nneighbors have a situation that encompasses this. The Christopher and \nDana Reeve Paralysis Act has been held up for 2 years by this guy--2 \nyears. I mentioned that also includes paralyzed veterans and the STOP \nStroke Act. We have the Melanie Blocker Stokes MOTHERS Act--that is \npostpartum depression. Postpartum depression is serious. People are \nhospitalized as a result of that.\n  We need do some work on it. Dr. Coburn said this would not accomplish \na thing, doctors know what to do now. All it would do is create a lot \nof bureaucracy. We do not need to worry about these people. Doctors \nknow what to do.\n\n[[Page S9174]]\n\n  Vision care for kids, and the Prenatally and Postnatally Diagnosed \nConditions Awareness Act. Three of the six bills on here, on the health \ncare title package, were introduced by Republicans. All of these bills \npassed the House with strong bipartisan support and have strong \nbipartisan support in the Senate. But they will not let us go forward, \nthe Republicans, even though there are an equal number of bills \nbasically on both sides of the aisle. The Republicans are supporting \nDr. Coburn in helping us get nothing done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/22/senate-section/article/S9174-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--TITLE I OF S. 3297\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a bill at the desk which is word for \nword identical to title I of our bill, which is the health care \nprovisions. I ask unanimous-consent the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of the bills at the desk, which consists of title I of S. \n3297, the health care title of that bill, the bill be read three times \nand the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nobject on behalf of Senator Coburn, I would note two things: First, \nthat we do not have to wait until 7 o'clock tonight. I came over to the \nChamber so the majority leader could posit his unanimous-consent \nrequests and there would be somebody here to speak on behalf of my \ncolleague Senator Coburn. That is why I am here.\n  Secondly, as I said, some of these bills, there are eight of them, \nthat Senator Coburn has said, let's pass them right now. We do not have \nto go through the whole rigmarole of filing cloture and 30 hours of \ndebate and all of the things the majority leader talked about.\n  One or two of those are on the list he spoke about. There are eight \nin total here. So I would note that it boils down to ``take it or leave \nit,'' either all 35 or none, whereas Senator Coburn's view is that some \nof these bills could be passed without the necessity of filing cloture; \nlet's just do it. But he and the majority leader have not been able to \nagree on which ones they are. Therefore, the objection must be made.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, through the Chair, then are you saying \nthat if I offer unanimous-consent on the Stop Stroke Act, the Mothers \nAct, ALS Registry, Downs Syndrome Support, Christopher Reeves, do these \nindividually, that you will allow those to pass?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there are eight \nbills on the list Senator Coburn has developed that do not need \nmodification. There are three, at least, one of which was mentioned, \nthe ALS Registry, that he believe need changes. I assume he and the \nmajority leader have discussed that.\n  Mr. REID. So you say there are eight we can pass right now?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think it is important, since I am speaking \non behalf of another Senator, that staffs make sure what I have said is \naccurate. But my understanding is there are eight bills Senator Coburn \nhas no objection to proceeding with. Obviously, he and the majority \nleader, you and he have been discussing how to put these together and \nget them done, but there may be changes necessary in the ALS Registry \nand Emmett Till Unresolved Civil Rights Crime Act, and the Protect Our \nChildren.\n  Mr. REID. So what I say, if there are eight of them that we can pass, \nlet's do it right now.\n  Mr. KYL. Well, I am speaking on behalf of someone else. I want to \nmake sure what I have represented here is accurate. I am perfectly \nwilling at this time to get the two staffs together to see if that can \nbe done.\n  Mr. REID. I say respectfully, our staffs have spent, with his staff, \nunending hours. And I will be anxious to see, whenever he shows up, \nbecause it is always, when you get right down to it, you cannot do it. \nIf there are eight we can do right now, let's do them right now; do \nthem one at a time.\n  I will ask unanimous-consent. We will do them right now. The ones we \ncannot do, we will wait until next year when we get a new Congress and \na new President. And the people who are sick and need this help will \nhave to wait until we have a Congress that is willing to pass those.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in further clarifying with staff, we know \nthere are some that could be cleared right now, at least three. There \nare others where someone else has posed an objection, and I do not know \nwho that might be, or which side it is on.\n  But our staff indicates if the two staffs can get together, they \nthink at least on some of these it can be resolved very quickly.\n  Mr. REID. We have gone in the last minutes--this is what I have dealt \nwith--from eight to three. I will take the three. What are the three?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, with all due respect, that is not fair to \nwhat I said. I am not in the middle of this. There are staff on both \nsides who have been working on these. My understanding is that Senator \nCoburn is not the sole objector with respect to some. There are three \nwhere he was the sole objector. He is willing to let them go.\n  I cannot speak to anyone else, to whatever objections might exist. \nBut staff informs me they believe if we were to sit down and have the \ntwo staffs of the majority and minority work together, that perhaps up \nto eight of these bills could be cleared today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say with all due respect to my friend, the \njunior Senator from Arizona, he is in the middle of this. Every \nRepublican Senator is in the middle of this, because we could not move \nforward on these bills previously. So you cannot--because someone is \nobjecting, it does not mean that is grounds for your not being a part \nof it. People on the Republican side of the aisle voted overwhelmingly \nnot to move forward. So I tell you what, Mr. President. I will be happy \nto take the suggestion of my friend from Arizona. In the next hour or \nso we will sit down, my staff--I do not know about Senator Coburn's \nstaff, maybe they are in Oklahoma also. But we will be happy to sit \ndown and work to get some of these bills passed, so I will return at a \nlater time.\n  Mr. KYL. Would the majority leader indulge me one moment here? My \nstaff has indicated there are four ready to go right now. I will read \nthe title and then your staff will have those. One is the Prenatal \nConditions Bill; another is the Child Pornography bill, that is S. \n4136; another relates to Child Pornography, S. 4120; and then there is \na House message accompanying S. 496. Apparently all four of those are \nready to go. That is the Appalachian Development bill.\n  Mr. REID. We will take the first three. Let me think about this for a \nmoment. Are these all Republican bills?\n  We will do them all, except for the Appalachian whatever it is.\n  Mr. KYL. If the majority leader wishes, I will ask unanimous-\nconsent----\n  Mr. REID. And the language has not been changed in any way?\n  Mr. KYL. Let me combine the three then to make it simpler.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent, since these are different \ncommittees----\n  Mr. REID. If I can interrupt my friend, there are a couple different \nversions of the bills floating around. On these three, which I am very \nhappy to get done, we will make sure that the minority and majority \nstaff agree it is the right piece of legislation so we do not make \nanother mistake.\n  Mr. KYL. What we will do is have your staff confirm that this is, in \nfact, the version, and then either you or I or someone else can ask \nunanimous-consent to clear these three bills?\n  Mr. REID. We will wait for Senator Coburn's arrival.\n  Mr. KYL. That is certainly fine.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, you can now announce morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/22/senate-section/article/S9174-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to speak about this bailout we \nhave been asked to do. Starting last week, we were told by the powers \nthat be in the Bush administration we needed to do a $700 billion \nbailout to stabilize our economy.\n  When we heard that, Americans became scared. People who save for \ntheir retirement, those who have been faithful in paying their \nmortgage, those who have worked hard to pay for college, are wondering \nwhat is going on. People who have worked hard and played by the rules \nare wondering, are they being asked to bail out those who did not? \nAmericans are mad as hell and they want to know what about them. They \nwatched Wall Street executives pay themselves lavish salaries. They \nwatched them do irresponsible lending practices. They watched them do \ncasino gambling on risky investment mechanisms. And now those very same \nAmericans who worked hard and played by the rules, were prudent \ninvestors, prudent savers, prudent citizens, are asked to pay the bill \nfor those who did not.\n  Now, it is for those people that I know the Government must do \nsomething. We must protect our economy and we must protect our way of \nlife and we must protect our middle class. Sure, the economy is in a \ncrisis. And, yes, we do have a credit crisis. Wall Street did make very \nbad decisions. But now they are asking Main Street to pay the bill. We \nmust act to restore our confidence in our economy. I agree, we must act \npromptly. But this Senator will not be stampeded into voting for this \nBush administration bill.\n  So far during the last 7 years, every time there is a crisis, they \ngenerate fear and they generate bad ideas. Do you remember after the \nhorrific days of 9/11 when we all came to the floor and pledged our \npatriotism? I said, we needed to put politics aside because we needed \nto be the red, white, and blue party. Well, they took advantage of \nthat. And in that process we passed something like the PATRIOT Act, \nallowing our Government to act with undue secrecy with no parameters. \nWe created the dysfunctional Department of Homeland Security.\n  Now we are being asked to deal with the fiscal crisis and the \nfinancial crisis. I am concerned we are going to create a fiscal FEMA. \nWe must act with resolve, but we cannot be a rubberstamp for the \nadministration's proposal. This proposal gives sweeping authority to \nthose who were asleep at the switch in the first place.\n  Remember the Fed? Remember the maestro at the Fed who plunged down \ninterest rates, and now helped create the housing bubble? Then there is \nthe Treasury. There is the Secretary of the Treasury. A couple of \nmonths ago he said, no problem--like our President ``fundamentally \nsound.''\n  Then a couple of months later they said, oh, there is a problem. And \nwe have lurched from one bailout to another: Bear Stearns, the \ninsurance company, oh, no, not to Lehman, then after that failed, so we \nhave gone from ``no problem'' to lurching around, to now $700 billion \nand a blank check.\n  We have seen those George Bush plans before. Now this one is a three-\npage bill. It gives the Secretary of the Treasury unlimited power to \nintervene in our financial markets without any review by Congress, \nagencies, or courts. They make the Secretary of the Treasury a \nfinancial czar, a financial potentate, because it says: Give us a blank \ncheck with no balances.\n  Well, I say: No checks without balances. Even the President of the \nUnited States of America has to come to us to declare war. I believe \nthe Secretary of the Treasury should be accountable to the Congress and \nto whether mechanisms--if he is going to intervene with $700 billion in \nhis pocket. I say no regulations without any safeguards. No way. No \nblank check. There must be regulations. There best be safeguards. If \nthey do not want regulation, no way. If they do not want safeguards, no \nway.\n  We are in uncharted waters, so we need to ask tough questions. First, \nhow do we know it will work? What guarantees are there it will work? \nCould this bankrupt our Treasury because it has no parameters? Could it \ncause runaway inflation, further eroding our economy? What are the \nsafeguards?\n  Also, who is going to benefit? Is it going to be the same Wall Street \ngo-go guy, the same Wall Street casino types who are going to benefit \nnow? Whatever we do, we have to insist that those who created this \nscandal do not benefit from the bailout: no golden parachutes.\n  Let them feel the hard landing that my constituents faced when they \nwere laid off at Bethlehem Steel. Let them feel the hard landing of \nwhat it is like to have your mortgage foreclosed upon. Let them feel \nthe hard landing my constituents are facing right now. We do not need \nto subsidize bad behavior.\n  Now George Bush said he was the first MBA President. Well, hello, I \ndo not have confidence in this administration. Remember, this was the \nsame crowd that brought us Katrina, FEMA, and ``hey, you are doing a \ngood job, Brownie.''\n  Well, is this what we are now supposed to say to those who are \nmanaging our finances? I don't think so.\n\n  We also have to prudently ask ourselves, are there better \nalternatives? Let me be clear: I do believe we need to act promptly but \nwith safeguards. We need to act with resolve, but we need to have \nregulation and even retribution. If we have stabilization, which I \nbelieve we must do, we must also have reform. We are all looking at the \nadministration's plan, but I want everyone to know where I stand. At a \nminimum, the plan must, first, be limited and temporary. It cannot be \nopen-ended. There also must be a plan for those who have had those hard \nlandings on Main Street. We need to put people first, to keep people in \ntheir homes, those who have had some of the most significant mortgage \npayment challenges, no golden parachutes that reward top executives for \ntheir excesses, their recklessness, and their sheer stupidity and \ngreed, no blank checks. There must be accountability and oversight. \nRescue does require reform, regulation, and a strong possibility of \nretribution. It must be transparent. I am for prompt action, but I will \nnot be stampeded the way I have been stampeded in this institution by \nthis administration in the past.\n  We need to make sure we do it right. That means not handing over a \nblank check or getting rid of the balances. We have to ask tough \nquestions and be sure we have the right principles. If not, then the \ntaxpayers will be on the hook. If we make the wrong decisions, \ntaxpayers will be on the hook not only for Wall Street's bad decisions, \nbut I don't want to set this up for Government's bad decisions. We need \nto get Government back on the side of the people who need it. We need \nto put the public good over private profits. This means we need to take \na look at a 21st century regulatory system. I am tired of seeing this \nlaxity where what emerges when we deregulate is the emergence of sharks \nand whales. Either way, the minnows get swallowed up. We don't want our \neconomy to sink, and I think it is time to swim. But when we do, we \nneed to make sure we are asking the right questions. We need to fight \nfor the middle class. We need to fight for the people who go by the \nrules. We need to have a legislative framework that rewards those who \ndid their very best and might be having a temporary spill.\n  I look forward to hearing more about this plan, but right now I need \nto know more. I need to be reassured more, and I need to be absolutely \nsure that those who created the crisis don't benefit from it and we \ndon't leave the middle class with all of the responsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I begin by complimenting the senior Senator \nfrom Maryland on her statement. I know many of us on this side of the \naisle are going to be asking a lot of the same questions. We have the \nsame sense of urgency about helping the country while at the same time \nwe protect the people who have had no voice and no power, as this \nproposal was put together. I was with our colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle during the conference call on Friday when this situation was \nexplained. I have a number of the same types of questions as those \nraised by the senior Senator from Maryland. This is why I rise today.\n  This is a very complicated issue, and we are being asked to resolve \nit on a tight time-line. The American people want some reassurance. \nThey do want us to represent them and do something about the systemic \nflaws that allowed\n\n[[Page S9176]]\n\nthis debacle to occur, not simply to vote on a mechanical fix, but to \naddress the issues and policies that allowed this massive financial \ncrisis to emerge.\n  Americans are also interested, as the senior Senator from Maryland \npointed out, in preventing those who benefitted and contributed to the \nproblem, from unjustly enriching themselves.\n  We are seeing in this proposal the possibility of a huge transfer of \npower to the executive branch--not simply to the executive branch, to \none official in the executive branch--with very few strings attached. \nThis individual, whose career I respect, spent that career in the \nmarkets. Now, we are going to empower this individual and the \nDepartment of the Treasury to get directly involved in the stock market \nin a discretionary way that has very little precedent in our history. \nAt the same time, there are potential conflicts of interest that are \nunavoidable and will need to be examined.\n  However we sort out this problem over the next several days or \nlonger, there are a couple of areas where I believe that without the \nright type of guarantees, it will be very difficult for me personally \nto vote in favor of the proposal that came from the administration.\n  First, we must put regulation and accountability back into the \nsystem. It is inarguable that the regulatory structure now in place has \nnot protected either our financial system or the American taxpayer. The \nadministration is asking for unprecedented rescue, and that rescue \ncannot come without fixing the system.\n  Second and equally important, there should be guarantees in any \nlegislation that address the issue of executive compensation. I have \nbeen speaking about this issue for many years. I mentioned this in \nevery single meeting I had when I was campaigning for the Senate. It is \nnot inaccurate to say that executive compensation in American business \ntoday is wildly out of sync with our history, and with other countries \nin the world. When I graduated from college, the average corporate CEO \nmade 20 times what the average worker made. Today the average CEO makes \n400 times what the average worker makes. This is not a global \nphenomenon; this is an American phenomenon. If you go to Japan, whose \neconomic system works quite well in terms of the health of its economy \nand its balance of trade, the average corporate CEO makes 10 times what \nthe average worker makes. Again, ours make 400 times. If you look at \nGermany, which has one of the highest balances of trade in the world, \ntotaling $280 billion last year, the average corporate CEO makes 11 \ntimes what the average worker makes. Yet presently, our corporate CEOs \nmake 400 times.\n  The principles should be clear. If, in solving the problem, we are \ngoing to take tax money from Americans, many of whom do not own stock, \nthen the executives involved should get a Federal salary. This issue \nwas raised with Mr. Paulson over the weekend.\n  I have an article that came from today's Financial Times, in which he \nsaid the Treasury Department fears that if we reduced executive \ncompensation, it would ``undermine banks' willingness to take part'' in \nthe program because it would be punitive in nature. I must say, I have \na hard time figuring that out. We were told on Friday that we are in a \ncrisis that, and that if we do not resolve it within the next week or \nso, it is going to undermine the entire banking system around the \nworld, the entire global financial system. Yet we are told that if we \nask these corporate CEOs to take a salary in line with what Federal \nofficials receive, they won't participate. What are they saying? We \nhave a crisis that is going to affect us all; we are all going to have \nto take some sort of a hit. It is certainly punitive to the American \ntaxpayers, who did not participate in these decisions, and who did not \nreceive any of the profits. How is it punitive to an individual to say: \nAll right, if we are bailing you out, you reduce your pay. We are \ngiving you Federal tax dollars. You take Federal pay until this is \nsolved. You make the American taxpayer whole. We will make you whole. \nIf you increase the profitability, as you say you will be able to do, \nthen you can increase your compensation commensurately.\n  The legislation we are considering must have a provision in it that \ncreates fairness for the people who are going to foot the bill. We are \nsent here, those of us who believe in the traditional precepts of the \nDemocratic Party, to make sure that the health of society is measured \nnot at the top, not at the apex, but at the base, by the well-being of \nthe people who are doing the hard work of our society. It is our \nmission, it is our duty, to look after their needs.\n  If we can't get to the bottom of this by the end of this week, as \nsome seem to be worrying about, maybe we need to take another week. \nMaybe we need to stay with this until we can get it done. When you are \nbetting $700 billion to a trillion dollars, we need to figure out a \nformula we are all comfortable with.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Virginia for his comments. I \nknow when he spoke in response to the State of the Union a little over \na year ago, he raised the issue of executive compensation. If I am not \nmistaken, he made the point that the average worker, in the course of a \nyear's work, made what the average executive makes in a day. Maybe it \nwas even more of a contrast. But it is a clear indication of how things \nhave gotten completely out of line. I ask the Senator from Virginia if \nhe could recount what that comparison was between pay for CEOs and the \npay for workers?\n  Mr. WEBB. The Senator from Illinois is correct. I mentioned earlier \nthat executive compensation in our country is wildly out of control, in \nterms of our own history and in terms of what is going on in the rest \nof the world. I do not believe it is punitive or unreasonable to ask \nfor a fair measure when tax dollars are being used to help bail these \ncompanies out. When the Senator from Illinois and I were finishing \ncollege, the average corporate CEO made 20 times what the average \nworker makes. Today it is 400 times. If we take that multiple and apply \nit to what I was saying in response to the State of the Union address a \nyear and a half ago, in one year the average worker in this country \nmakes what his boss makes in one day. There is plenty of room to be \nfair to the system and fair to the individuals who are asking for the \nbailout, but ultimately we must be fair to the taxpayers who are asked \nto dig down in their pockets and help us straighten out this problem.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have been in on these meetings, and some were historic \nand ominous. Secretary Paulson, Chairman Bernanke of the Federal \nReserve, and Chairman Cox of the SEC came to us last Thursday night to \ndiscuss what we faced. They were using words such as ``meltdown'' and \n``collapse,'' talking about the very severe economic crisis which we \nare facing. Certainly, the events of the last few weeks and months back \nup the concern.\n\n  When we raised the question of executive compensation, though, the \npush back from the administration was: Listen, don't mess with the \nsalaries of these CEOs, even if their banks are failing because they \nmay not do business with the Government. They may not let the taxpayers \nbail them out if we restrict their annual bonuses and restrict their \ngolden parachutes.\n  I struggle with this concept, I say to the Senator from Virginia. Is \nthe administration suggesting they would rather see their banks fail, \nwould rather see their hedge funds fail, their mortgage operations fail \nthan not receive their annual bonus? Is that the argument that is being \nmade to us?\n  I do not know if the Senator from Virginia can recall any other \naspects of public or private life where we pay such rich rewards for \nincompetency. Where the businesses fail, it seems these executives take \naway the most money. In the Financial Times or in the Wall Street \nJournal this morning--one of these publications--they talked about \nBarclays riding to the rescue of part of Lehman Brothers. They said, \nincidentally, just before Lehman Brothers went belly up, they brought \nin $2.5 billion for executive compensation and bonuses, momentarily \nbefore they were about to go out of business. That is unconscionable.\n  Now we are asking the taxpayers to come in with hard-earned tax \ndollars to rescue these companies and subsidize the compensation of \nexecutives so they do not have any interruption in their\n\n[[Page S9177]]\n\nannual bonuses or any interruption in their parachutes and rewards? \nThere has been an interruption in the lives of most taxpayers.\n  I say to the Senator from Virginia, is there a parallel here of a \nsimilar example that I am missing?\n  Mr. WEBB. I say to the Senator from Illinois, I also heard Secretary \nPaulson say something similar in the conference call in which we were \nparticipating on Friday, and I find his comments very puzzling--I am \nnot violating confidentiality because Secretary Paulson said it at \nleast three times over the weekend on different television shows. When \nhe was asked, on the one hand, whether this is a crisis that threatens \nto undermine all of the financial markets within a few days, and on the \nother, if it would be punitive to ask the executives to take a pay hit. \nAnd, in fact, Secretary Paulson indicated that some of these banks \nmight not participate if they are asked to do that.\n  I would suggest there are plenty of competent officials who may have \nlost their jobs over the past few weeks who could step in if these \nparticular individuals do not think this is a good formula. What I was \nsaying in concept is, if you take in a Federal dollar to bail yourself \nout, you ought to get a Federal salary until the taxpayer is made \nwhole.\n  If you show managerial skills to pull us out of this, such that the \nassets you are requiring us to purchase improve in value, then, you \ncould get some commensurate compensation because this is compensation \nfor actual performance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So you are saying pay for performance, in other words, \ninstead of pay for title or pay for past performance. That is a radical \nconcept, but most workers in America would be able to identify with \nthat. That is kind of what they face when they go to work.\n  Mr. WEBB. I would say to the Senator from Illinois, very quickly, \nwhen we use the word ``punitive,'' we should keep in mind that there \nare many people in this country who are teaching school or out driving \na truck who are going to have to pay more taxes for this, but who have \nnot had the benefit, in many cases, of even owning stock. They are \ngoing to have to pay a penalty for the malfeasance that has brought us \nto this situation.\n  If the administration and Secretary Paulson and others truly want to \nsolve this problem--and I think they do--then they ought to be able to \nyield on this point simply because of the logic of it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the Senator from Virginia, the $700 \nbillion represents roughly about $2,000 of indebtedness for every man, \nwoman, and child in America to make up for the mistakes of these banks.\n  There is another thing that troubles me. There is great potential for \nconflicts of interest because decisions have to be made by the \nSecretary of the Treasury under his proposal about where the Federal \ntaxpayers will step in with their money and buy illiquid assets; in \nother words, buy the mistakes, the mortgage securities, for example. \nThose decisions will have a direct impact on the survival of \ninstitutions and on the jobs of the people who are affected by those.\n  We want to make sure there is no conflict of interest, that the \ndecisions are made by those who have no skin in the game, no investment \nin the decision, and it has to be at least subject to some review. \nThere is no one in this country, thank goodness, above the law, and yet \nin the proposal given to us by the Treasury Department, there is no \njudicial or administrative review of decisions being made about where \nthe $700 billion is going to be invested. We are being asked--in a \nhurry--to get this done in a hurry, to give more authority to this \nadministration, specifically to this Secretary of the Treasury, a man \nwhom I respect, but to give more authority to him than anyone has ever \nhad in the history of the United States, and to say that his actions \nare not subject to review by any court, any administrative body, when \nthere is such a great potential for conflict of interest. That concerns \nme.\n  Mr. WEBB. I say to the Senator from Illinois, first, I wholly agree \nwith you on that point. I mentioned in my comments a little while ago \nabout the potential for conflict of interest. This is the continuation \nof a trend that disturbs me greatly, that is the movement of power \ntoward the executive branch.\n  I was a committee counsel in the U.S. Congress 30 years ago. If you \nexamine the balance between the executive branch and the legislative \nbranch over those 30 years, it has steadily, particularly since 9/11, \nmoved toward the executive branch. This is another example of that \nmovement.\n  I would make one other point. I and a number of other people, Senator \nBayh among them, have been very worried about sovereign wealth funds. I \nhave talked about them and have been able to participate in some \nhearings on other committees about a foreign government directly \ninvesting in our economy. One of the points I made several times is \nthat the U.S. Government has never directly invested in a discretionary \nmanner in our markets.\n  So we are seeing two different trends that are disturbing and that we \nshould be thinking about. One is, if we do transfer this amount of \nauthority to the Secretary of Treasury, the Federal Government, on a \ndiscretionary basis--one individual, on a discretionary basis--is going \nto invest in parts of the economy. All this in their own discretion, \ndecided without review, as the Senator from Illinois mentioned. That is \na kind of a sovereign wealth fund in our own country, but with the bad \nassets.\n  The second trend we are now seeing is the movement, particularly from \nthe Government of China over the last 10 days, of massive investments \nfrom a country that on one level is potentially a great strategic \nadversary, and certainly an economic competitor, directly into our \neconomy. There is a 49-percent purchase proposal for Morgan Stanley \nfrom the sovereign wealth fund of the Chinese Government.\n  So there are many pieces in motion. We have the gravest duty to sort \nthem out. I congratulate the Senator from Illinois for his comments.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  There are so many questions that have been raised by this proposal \nfrom the administration. I have to say at the outset, for those of us \nwho have been here a number of years, this has an eerie resemblance to \nsomething I have seen before. It was on the floor of this Senate 6 \nyears ago when we were told by this administration in October, before \nan election, that we had to give to the President of the United States \nthe authority to invade Iraq. Oh, he did not say he was going to do it. \nHe just needed the authority to invade Iraq because of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Of course, the pressure was building on Members of Congress: Do \nsomething. Saddam Hussein may have nuclear weapons. Condoleezza Rice \ntalked about mushroom-shaped clouds. It was in that environment and \natmosphere that the President said: Give me the authority; I will make \nthe decision about whether we should invade Iraq.\n  The pressure was on. Some of us were up for reelection at the time. I \ncan recall going to editorial boards in Chicago, and I can tell you, I \nlost their endorsements because I said there is something that concerns \nme about this. We are delegating so much power to this President. It is \nfar easier to get in a war than it is to get out of one.\n  Here we are 6 years later. We are still in it. Mr. President, 4,183-\nplus American lives have been given in this conflict, 20,000, 30,000 \nhave returned with serious wounds and injuries--amputations, paralysis, \ntraumatic brain injury. I cannot tell you how much money we have spent \nthere. It is almost as much as the President is asking now for the \nbanks, maybe more.\n  We are being told again, as we approach another election: Give the \nauthority to the administration, to the President, and step aside; in \ntheir wisdom, they will handle it. I worry about that. As I said, I \nrespect Henry Paulson. I really do. I do not think he is a politician \nat heart. I think he is a patriot, a citizen who wants to do the best \nfor his country. But his actions have to be put in a constitutional \ncontext. We have the balance of powers in this country because that is \nwhat America is. It is not because of what this current crop of \npoliticians dreamed up. It is what the Founding Fathers said we are all \nabout. We do not want to give too much power to any branch of \nGovernment. We want other branches to be involved.\n\n[[Page S9178]]\n\n  A proposal is coming from this administration now, a few weeks before \nthe election, with ominous clouds gathering over the financial \ninstitutions of America, and we are being told: Trust us. Trust us to \ngive to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to take $700 \nbillion and to buy assets in banks without the review of any court or \nany administrative body.\n  I do not see in here the protections against conflict of interest. \nWhy should I worry about conflicts of interest? Have we had any \nconflicts of interest with the war in Iraq? Let me think for a moment. \nDoes the word ``Halliburton'' spring to mind, these no-bid contracts \nfor billions of dollars that shortchanged our troops and our taxpayers? \nExcuse me if I am cynical and skeptical, but I have seen this movie, \nand I don't like the ending. The taxpayers pay too much money. The \ntroops do not get protection. Halliburton gets billions of dollars in \ncontracts.\n  So should I be concerned that there is going to be one person in the \nadministration or a handful allocating $700 billion without anybody \nlooking over their shoulder? Yes, I am concerned.\n  Then there is a question about the banks we are going to help. This \nstarted out about the American economy and American financial \ninstitutions, and now it has become something larger. At the last \nminute, the Treasury Department said: Oh, we are going to help foreign \nbanks too. Really? Foreign banks? I want to know more about that. I \nwant to know how much we are going to get into this in terms of these \nforeign banks. A lot of these questions have to be asked and answered \nbefore any of us in good conscience can vote for this.\n  But that is the reality of what we face. Just in case people are \nkeeping score, things have changed in the United States of America in \nthe last several weeks. Some of it was lost on the business pages, and \nsome of it most people did not focus on. But I have tried to study it a \nlittle more closely with this $700 billion request.\n  To put this into perspective, the debt of the U.S. Government is $5.4 \ntrillion. In the combined history of the United States of America, all \nof the money we have had to borrow to keep this Government moving over \nand above what we raised in taxes comes to $5.4 trillion. That debt, \nincidentally, has gone up dramatically, a record-breaking pace under \nthe Bush administration. We are now facing, this year, a $480 billion \ndeficit--I am sorry, I think it is $407 billion, but it will be $480 \nbillion next year, a record-breaking deficit.\n  So to put that in perspective, this is our mortgage, America, $5.4 \ntrillion and growing. It is a mortgage we will pay as long as we are \nalive, and so will our kids and so will their kids. That is the \nstarting point. What has happened recently?\n  Almost 2 weeks ago, the decision was made that we would assume \nliability--the Federal Government would assume the liability, a second \nmortgage, if you will--for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Now, this is a \ngovernment-sponsored entity which basically guarantees 50 percent of \nall the mortgages in America. So now our second mortgage is, we are \nstepping in--not the shareholders of the companies, the taxpayers are \nstepping in to guarantee the solvency of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \nThere was not much else we could do, I will be honest with you. We \nreached a terrible point where there were not many alternatives.\n  How much liability is involved in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Well, \nit will be easy to remember. It is exactly the same liability as \nAmerica's national debt: $5.4 trillion. The second mortgage on America \nis the same as the first mortgage. Now, don't get me wrong. Behind \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac is a lot of property--homes, businesses, \nreal estate. So it isn't as if there isn't collateral involved, but we \nare on the hook for $5.4 trillion. That is not the end of the story. \nThe story goes on.\n\n  We decided that people who have mutual funds--my family has done that \ntoo--and have taken cash and put it into money market mutual funds--\neverybody knows what I am talking about; it is not the CD at the bank \nat the corner where Uncle Sam stands and says: We are going to protect \nyou via the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, but it is the money \nmarket mutual fund where you move money out of your stocks, out of your \nmutual funds, put it into your money market mutual funds because it \nmakes a little bit better than what they are paying at the bank. It \nturns out they are in trouble. They are in such trouble now that we are \ngoing to have to step in for the mutual funds and provide a money \nmarket guarantee on the mutual funds. OK, we have our national debt and \nwe have our secondary mortgage--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--$5.4 \ntrillion more, and now we are stepping in to guarantee money market \nmutual funds. How much could that be? Well, it is much smaller than the \nother two. It is $3.4 trillion. Stay tuned, sharpen your pencil, there \nis more to follow because we are being asked now to come up with $700 \nbillion to buy illiquid assets. What is that? Something nobody wants to \nbuy. We are going to buy them.\n  Do we have to do this and try to stop the seizure of the credit \ninstitutions of America? We may have no choice, but I think it is \nreasonable to ask a few questions. Just as we should have asked more \nquestions about weapons of mass destruction 6 years ago before we found \nourselves in this war, we need to ask questions today about where this \nis leading, and we need some protection for the taxpayers of this \ncountry.\n  I walked down LaSalle Street on Friday. It is a great street in \nChicago, lined with banks and big office buildings. A lot of people \ncame and said hi, but a lot of them came to me and said: Are you going \nto do this, $700 billion for bailing out these banks? I said: I don't \nknow. At the end of the day, I don't know. I want to see what the \nadministration comes back with. Right now we have a concept. I want to \nsee a proposal.\n  I thought to myself as I walked along there and had a little press \nconference with a bunch of folks who walked by on the sidewalk \nlistening: These are the folks who are going to pay for this idea. \nThese are the taxpayers who are going to have to come up with the money \nfor this--for all of this. None of these taxpayers got a notice about \nthe annual bonus checks at these major companies that are going under. \nThey didn't receive any of that. They didn't get a parachute either. \nThey are the taxpayers. Unfortunately, it will be a bigger tax bill \nbecause of this.\n  What has happened is a fundamental failure of a philosophy that has \nbeen tested and tried for the last 10 years or so that says the \nGovernment ought to get out of the way, no questions asked, and don't \ndiminish the dynamic aspect of this economy with overregulation. That, \nto me, is something we need to take a second look at.\n  Incidentally, my staff has told me the national debt is over $10 \ntrillion. I misspoke on the primary mortgage. I got the wrong figures \nout of the paper today, and I want the record to reflect it: The \nprimary mortgage is over $10 trillion, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nis an additional $5.3 trillion in liabilities, as I said earlier. That \nshows you the amount of debt that is involved.\n  So the fundamental failure of the philosophy is this belief that \nsomehow we, as taxpayers, have a responsibility to rescue but not a \nresponsibility to regulate. That is not right. If the full faith and \ncredit of the United States of America is going to come to the rescue \nof these private institutions, we have an obligation in Government to \nthe taxpayers of this country to ask the hard questions in advance, \nbefore the disaster arrives. We should have been asking these questions \na long time ago. We should have asked them about the predatory lending \npractices of major credit institutions. We have had several votes on \nthe floor of the Senate on that issue. We should have been asking about \nhow this money was being loaned--the circumstances.\n  I guess there is not much sympathy for people facing foreclosure in \nAmerica today. A lot of us might be inclined to think: These poor \nsouls, they should have been a little more careful, until you take the \ntime to meet some of them. Some of them got carried away. Don't get me \nwrong. I can't have a lot of sympathy for them. They made big mistakes \ntrying to make big money, but some of these folks were conned. They \nsigned up for mortgages full of tricks and traps that ended up \nexploding in their faces and now they are going to lose their homes.\n\n[[Page S9179]]\n\n  At the end of the day, this crisis started with a housing catastrophe \nand disaster and continues because of it. It is up to us now to decide \nwhat we are going to do about it. We can rescue the folks at the top--\nthat is what is being proposed--but we need to do a lot more than that. \nI think we need to set up a mechanism for those who are about to lose \ntheir homes to be protected.\n  Here is an interesting thing. If you face bankruptcy today and you \nhave seven or eight homes and go into the bankruptcy court, they can \nrenegotiate the terms of all your mortgages, except one. They cannot \nrenegotiate the terms of the mortgage on your home. Why? If they can \nrenegotiate the terms on my vacation home, my farm, my ranch, my \nproperty in some other place, why not my home? There is no good \nexplanation. The fact that the bankruptcy court cannot renegotiate \nleads us, sadly, to the point where banking institutions and credit \nlenders and the others are not renegotiating terms. They would rather \nsee people fail and face foreclosure. I think we have to do something \nto make sure the bankruptcy courts have that option. I think there \nshould be incentives for those lending institutions to try hard to keep \npeople in their homes.\n  Mr. President, 340,000 Americans were foreclosed on in the month of \nAugust. It is a record-breaking number. Not since the Great Depression \nhave we seen that percentage of homeowners facing that kind of \nliability. So we have to keep the taxpayers in mind when we read this \nproposal of the Treasury. We have to keep homeowners in mind, and we \nought to keep accountability in mind. At the end of the day, there is \nno branch of this Government above the law. When it comes to $700 \nbillion in taxpayers' dollars and money--and hard-earned money, I might \nadd--they are not above the law.\n  One last point I wish to make. Senator McCain has made a name for \nhimself in the Senate, calling himself a leading deregulator. He has \nbeen opposed to regulation. In fact, he teamed up with Senator Phil \nGramm of Texas, who was his inspiration for years, and they voted \ntogether on many issues: to deregulate, get the Government out of the \neconomy. Let a thousand flowers bloom. Let's let these forces of \ncapitalism go to work. I am not going to diminish the power of the \nentrepreneurial spirit and the forces of capitalism, but they can get \ncarried away. We saw it happen with the savings and loan crisis and we \nhave seen it happen with the subprime mortgage crisis. We have seen it \nbefore. It might happen again if we don't learn a lesson.\n  I am disappointed that Senator McCain in the past took that position. \nI am troubled that, in a recent article in Contingencies magazine, he \nsaid about our health care market:\n\n       Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous \n     nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade \n     in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products \n     less burdened by the worst excesses of State-based \n     regulation.\n\n  I don't know when Senator McCain wrote that. It couldn't have been \nrecently because I have to tell my colleagues that if he is promising \nfor the health insurance market what we now face in the banking market \nafter deregulation, God help American families. I couldn't disagree \nmore with Senator McCain's position on deregulation when it came to \nbanking, and now his position on deregulation when it comes to health \ninsurance companies.\n  If the Government doesn't set the rules, the insurance companies \nwill. How would you like to throw yourself on the mercy of that \ninsurance company adjuster, when it is your health or the health of one \nof your kids on the line? Insurers compete with one another, trying to \navoid costly patients and avoid paying for procedures. We hear about it \nalmost every day. According to Senator McCain, let a thousand flowers \nbloom. Let the market work. The market works pretty well if you are \nyoung and healthy or wealthy. It doesn't work very well if you are \nolder, have a history of illness, and don't have much of an income. \nThat is why we need sensible regulation.\n  This idea that we are going to move away from employer-based health \ninsurance, as Senator McCain has said--well, I am sure there are some \npeople who buy into that. Put each one of the customers in America out \non their own buying health insurance instead of buying through pools \nwhere they work, and we know what will happen. The sickest people will \nhave the toughest time finding insurance and paying for it. That isn't \nhow it should work. We learned that, I am afraid, the hard way, and \nSenator McCain is stuck on that. I think he is wrong. I think we need a \nhealth insurance program in America which gives us all a fighting \nchance. Unfortunately, Senator McCain's approach does not. So we have \nto make sure that when it comes to banking or health insurance, Senator \nMcCain's approach is not going to be our approach. This idea of \nderegulation may at one time have had wide subscription, but today it \ndoes not. We have to move forward with the concept that there is an \nappropriate role for Government--not to go too far but to provide \nenough protection, disclosure, transparency, and accountability to make \nsure we don't find ourselves in the crisis we find today with our \nbanking institutions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 614\n\n       Whereas over-the-counter and prescription medicines are \n     extremely safe, effective, and potentially lifesaving when \n     used properly;\n       Whereas the abuse and recreational use of over-the-counter \n     and prescription medicines can be extremely dangerous and \n     produce serious side effects;\n       Whereas in a recently sampled month, 7,000,000 individuals \n     aged 12 or older reported using prescription \n     psychotherapeutic medicines for nonmedical purposes;\n       Whereas abuse of prescription medicines, including pain \n     relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives is second \n     only to marijuana, the number 1 illegal drug of abuse in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas recent studies indicate that 2,400,000 children, or \n     1 in 10 children aged 12 through 17, have intentionally \n     abused cough medicine to get high from the ingredient \n     dextromethorphan;\n       Whereas 4,500,000, or 1 in 5, young adults have used \n     prescription medicines for nonmedical purposes;\n       Whereas according to research from the Partnership for a \n     Drug-Free America, more than \\1/3\\ of teens mistakenly \n     believe that taking prescription drugs, even if not \n     prescribed by a doctor, is much safer than using more \n     traditional street drugs;\n       Whereas the lack of understanding by teens and parents of \n     the potential harms of these powerful prescription drugs \n     makes raising public awareness about the dangers of the \n     misuse of such drugs more critical than ever;\n       Whereas misused prescription drugs are most often obtained \n     through friends and relatives;\n       Whereas misused prescription drugs are also obtained \n     through rogue Internet pharmacies;\n       Whereas parents should be aware that the Internet gives \n     teens access to websites that promote medicine abuse;\n       Whereas National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month promotes \n     the messages that over-the-counter and prescription medicines \n     should be taken only as labeled or prescribed, and that \n     taking over-the-counter and prescription medicines for \n     recreational uses or in large doses can have serious and \n     life-threatening consequences;\n       Whereas National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month will \n     encourage parents to become educated about prescription drug \n     abuse and talk to teens about all types of substance abuse;\n       Whereas observance of National Medicine Abuse Awareness \n     Month should be encouraged at the national, State, and local \n     levels to increase awareness of the misuse of medicines;\n       Whereas some groups, including the Consumer Healthcare \n     Products Association and the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of \n     America, have taken important steps by creating educational \n     toolkits, including ``A Dose of Prevention: Stopping Cough \n     Medicine Abuse Before it Starts'', which provides guides to \n     educate parents, teachers, law enforcement officials, doctors \n     and healthcare professionals, and retailers about the \n     potential dangers of abusing over-the-counter cough and cold \n     medicines;\n       Whereas the Partnership for a Drug-Free America and \n     community alliance and affiliate partners have undertaken a \n     nationwide prevention campaign utilizing research-based \n     educational advertisements, public relations and news media, \n     and the Internet to inform parents about the negative teen \n     behavior of intentional abuse of medicines so that parents \n     are empowered to effectively communicate the facts about this \n     dangerous trend with teens and to take necessary steps to \n     safeguard prescription and over-the-counter medicines at \n     home; and\n       Whereas educating the public about the dangers of medicine \n     abuse and promoting prevention is a critical component of \n     what must be a multi-pronged effort to curb the disturbing \n     rise in medicine misuse: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of August 2008 as ``National \n     Medicine Abuse Awareness Month''; and\n       (2) urges communities to carry out appropriate programs and \n     activities to educate parents and youth about the potential \n     dangers associated with medicine abuse.\n\n                              S.

Res. 671\n\n       Whereas the University of Maryland School of Medicine was \n     established in 1807, making it the first public and the fifth \n     oldest medical school in the United States;\n       Whereas, in 1823, the University of Maryland School of \n     Medicine became the first teaching hospital in the Nation \n     with the construction of the Baltimore Infirmary and became \n     the first medical school in the United States to institute a \n     residency training program;\n       Whereas the School of Medicine was the founding school of \n     the University of Maryland and is an integral part of the 11-\n     campus University System of Maryland;\n       Whereas, at the Baltimore campus of the University of \n     Maryland, the School of Medicine serves as the foundation for \n     a large academic health center that combines medical \n     education, biomedical research, patient care, and community \n     service;\n       Whereas the University of Maryland School of Medicine is \n     dedicated to providing excellence in biomedical education, \n     basic and clinical research, quality patient care, and \n     service to improve the health of the people of Maryland and \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the University of Maryland School of Medicine is \n     committed to the education and training of M.D. and Ph.D. \n     students in fields including physical therapy, rehabilitation \n     science, and medical research technology;\n       Whereas the University of Maryland School of Medicine has \n     played a crucial role in helping to meet the health care \n     needs of the people of Maryland and continues to recruit and \n     develop faculty to serve as exemplary role models for \n     students; and\n       Whereas the University of Maryland School of Medicine has \n     developed a legacy of academic excellence, outstanding \n     patient care, and ground-breaking research: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the University of Maryland School of \n     Medicine on its 200th anniversary; and\n       (2) recognizes the achievements of the University of \n     Maryland, Baltimore, and the School of Medicine in providing \n     outstanding service to, and in training leaders for, the \n     local community, the State of Maryland, and the world.\n\n                              S. Res. 672\n\n       Whereas negative images, stories, and influences in the \n     day-to-day lives of Americans can detrimentally affect their \n     emotional well-being, interactions with others, and general \n     demeanor;\n       Whereas a group of teenagers participating in a leadership \n     forum at Harding University in Searcy, Arkansas, identified a \n     lack of encouragement as one of the greatest problems facing \n     young people today;\n       Whereas the youth of our Nation need guidance, inspiration, \n     and reassurance to counteract this negativity and to develop \n     the qualities of character essential for future leadership in \n     our country;\n       Whereas a National Day of Encouragement would serve as a \n     reminder to counterbalance and overcome negative influences, \n     and would also provide much-needed encouragement and support \n     to others;\n       Whereas, following the events of September 11, 2001, \n     thousands of people of the United States made sacrifices in \n     order to bring help and healing to the victims and their \n     families, inspiring and encouraging the Nation; and\n       Whereas the renewed feelings of unity, hope, selflessness, \n     and encouragement that began on September 12, 2001, are the \n     same feelings that the National Day of Encouragement is meant \n     to recapture and spread: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 12, 2008, as ``National Day of \n     Encouragement'';\n       (2) acknowledges the importance of encouragement and \n     positive influences in the lives of all people; and\n       (3) urges the people of the United States to encourage \n     others, whether it be through an act of service, a thoughtful \n     letter, or words of kindness and inspiration, and to thereby \n     boost the morale of all.\n\n                              S. Res. 673\n\n       Whereas comprehensive, culturally sensitive health \n     promotion within the workplace is essential to maintain and \n     improve the health of American workers;\n       Whereas employees who improve their health also reduce \n     their probability of chronic health conditions, lower their \n     out-of-pocket medical and pharmaceutical costs, reduce pain \n     and suffering, have greater levels of energy and vitality, \n     and experience increased satisfaction with their lives and \n     jobs;\n       Whereas health care costs in the United States doubled from \n     1990 to 2001 and are expected to double again by 2012;\n       Whereas employee health benefits are the fastest growing \n     labor cost component for employers, thus posing a serious and \n     growing challenge to business in the United States;\n       Whereas business leaders are struggling to find strategies \n     to help reduce the direct costs of employer-provided health \n     care, as well as the indirect costs associated with higher \n     rates of absenteeism, disability, and injury;\n       Whereas an effective strategy to address the primary \n     driving force of soaring health care costs requires an \n     investment in prevention;\n       Whereas some employers who invest in health promotion and \n     disease prevention have achieved rates of return on \n     investment ranging from $3 to $15 for each dollar invested, \n     as well as a 28 percent average reduction in sick leave \n     absenteeism, an average 26 percent reduction in health care \n     costs, and a 30 percent average reduction in workers' \n     compensation and disability management claims costs;\n       Whereas the Healthy People 2010 national objectives for the \n     United States include the workplace health-related goal that \n     at least \\3/4\\ of United States employers, regardless of \n     size, will voluntarily offer a comprehensive employee health \n     promotion program that includes--(1) health education and \n     programming which focuses on skill development and lifestyle \n     behavior change along with information dissemination and \n     awareness building, preferably tailored to employees' \n     interests and needs; (2) supportive social and physical \n     environments, including an organization's expectations \n     regarding healthy behaviors, and implementation of policies \n     that promote health and reduce risk of disease; (3) \n     integration of the worksite wellness programs into the \n     organization's structure; (4) linkage to related programs \n     like employee assistance programs (EAPs) and programs to help \n     employees balance work and family; and (5) screening \n     programs, ideally linked to medical care to ensure follow-up \n     and appropriate treatment as necessary;\n       Whereas employers should be encouraged to invest in the \n     health of employees by implementing comprehensive worksite \n     health promotion programs that will help achieve our national \n     Healthy People 2010 objectives;\n       Whereas business leaders that have made a healthy workforce \n     a part of their core business strategy should be encouraged \n     to share information and resources to educate their peers on \n     the issue of employee health management through initiatives \n     such as the Leading by Example CEO-to-CEO Roundtable on \n     Workforce Health and the United States Workplace Wellness \n     Alliance;\n       Whereas the employers that provide health care coverage for \n     more than 177,000,000 Americans have the potential to exert \n     transformative leadership on this issue by increasing the \n     number, quality, and types of health promotion programs and \n     policies at worksites across the Nation;\n       Whereas, for workplace wellness efforts to reach their full \n     potential, chief executive officers of major corporations, \n     company presidents of small enterprises, and State governors \n     should be encouraged to make worksite health promotion a \n     priority; and\n       Whereas Congress supports the National Worksite Health \n     Promotion goal as stated in Healthy People 2010 and \n     encourages public employers to increase their awareness of \n     the value of corporate investments in employee health \n     management to help our Nation achieve this goal: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate calls on private and public \n     employers to support workplace wellness and implement \n     voluntarily worksite health promotion programs to help\n\n[[Page S9185]]\n\n     maximize employees' health and well being and lower health \n     care costs.\n\n                              S. Res. 674\n\n       Whereas older adults value their independence and a fall \n     can significantly limit their ability to remain self-\n     sufficient;\n       Whereas falls are the leading cause of death from \n     unintentional injuries among older adults in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas older adults are by far the population at greatest \n     risk for falling unintentionally, with more than \\1/3\\ of all \n     people 65 years or older falling each year;\n       Whereas older adults who fall once are 2 to 3 times more \n     likely than adults who have not fallen to fall again;\n       Whereas, in 2000, the Bureau of the Census reported that \n     more than 34,800,000 adults older than the age of 65 live in \n     the United States, and that number is expected to grow to \n     almost 55,000,000 by 2020;\n       Whereas 20 to 30 percent of older adults who fall suffer \n     moderate to severe injuries, such as bruising, hip fractures, \n     and head traumas;\n       Whereas, in 2005, falls resulted in nearly 1,800,000 older \n     adults being treated in emergency departments and more than \n     433,000 older adults being hospitalized;\n       Whereas, in 2005, nearly 16,000 people aged 65 and older \n     died from injuries related to unintentional falls;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     report that the mortality rate from falls among older adults \n     increased 45 percent between 2000 and 2004;\n       Whereas the total in direct costs associated with both \n     fatal and non-fatal falls is more than $19,000,000,000 \n     annually for hospitalization, emergency department visits, \n     and outpatient care;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimate that if the rate of increase in falls is not \n     stemmed, annual direct treatment costs will reach \n     $43,800,000,000 by 2020, with an annual cost under the \n     Medicare program of $32,400,000,000;\n       Whereas evidence-based programs show promise in reducing \n     falls and facilitating cost-effective interventions, such as \n     comprehensive clinical assessments, exercise programs to \n     improve balance and health, management of medications, \n     correction of vision, and reduction of home hazards;\n       Whereas, on April 23, 2008, the Safety of Seniors Act of \n     2007 (Public Law 110-202) was enacted, amending the Public \n     Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 280b et seq.) to create a \n     national education campaign aimed at older adults, their \n     families, and healthcare providers, and injury prevention \n     programs that focus on the reduction and prevention of falls \n     among older adults; and\n       Whereas the Falls Free Coalition Advocacy Work Group, its \n     numerous supporting organizations and all other supportive \n     organizations, should be commended for their efforts to raise \n     awareness and to promote greater understanding, research, and \n     pilot programs to prevent falls among older adults: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 22, 2008, as ``National Falls \n     Prevention Awareness Day'';\n       (2) commends the National Falls Free Coalition and all \n     other supportive organizations for their efforts to promote \n     awareness about preventing and reducing falls among older \n     people in the United States;\n       (3) encourages the private sector, the public health \n     community, healthcare providers, advocacy organizations, and \n     Federal, State, and local governments to work together to \n     increase education and awareness about the prevention of \n     falls; and\n       (4) urges national and community organizations, businesses, \n     individuals, and the media to use National Falls Prevention \n     Awareness Day to promote awareness of this important public \n     health problem in an effort to reduce the incidence of falls \n     among older people in the United States.\n\n                              S.

Res. 676\n\n       Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign was established to \n     commemorate the service of Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena, an 11-\n     year special agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration who \n     was murdered in the line of duty in 1985 while engaged in the \n     battle against illicit drugs;\n       Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign has been sponsored by the \n     National Family Partnership and nationally recognized since \n     1988 to preserve Special Agent Camarena's memory and further \n     the cause for which he gave his life, and is now the oldest \n     and largest drug prevention program in the Nation, reaching \n     millions of young people each year during Red Ribbon Week;\n       Whereas the Drug Enforcement Administration, committed \n     throughout its 35 years to aggressively targeting \n     organizations involved in the growing, manufacturing, and \n     distribution of controlled substances, has been a steadfast \n     partner in commemorating Red Ribbon Week;\n       Whereas the Governors and Attorneys General of the States, \n     the National Family Partnership, Parent Teacher Associations, \n     Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration, and more than 100 other organizations \n     throughout the United States annually celebrate Red Ribbon \n     Week during the period of October 23 through October 31;\n       Whereas the objective of Red Ribbon Week is to promote the \n     creation of drug-free communities through drug prevention \n     efforts, education, parental involvement, and community-wide \n     support;\n       Whereas drug abuse is one of the major challenges that the \n     Nation faces in securing a safe and healthy future for \n     families in the United States;\n       Whereas drug abuse and alcohol abuse contribute to domestic \n     violence and sexual assault and place the lives of children \n     at risk;\n       Whereas, although public awareness of illicit drug use is \n     increasing, emerging drug threats and growing epidemics \n     demand attention, including the abuse of methamphetamines, \n     inhalants, and prescription medications, the second most \n     abused drug by young people in the United States;\n       Whereas, between 1996 and 2006, the percentages of \n     admissions to substance abuse treatment programs as a result \n     of the abuse of methamphetamines, prescription medications, \n     and marijuana each significantly rose;\n       Whereas drug dealers specifically target children by \n     marketing illicit drugs that mimic the appearance and names \n     of well known brand-name candies and foods; and\n       Whereas parents, youths, schools, businesses, law \n     enforcement agencies, religious institutions, service \n     organizations, senior citizens, medical and military \n     personnel, sports teams, and individuals throughout the \n     United States will demonstrate their commitment to healthy, \n     productive, and drug-free lifestyles by wearing and \n     displaying red ribbons during this week-long celebration: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of Red Ribbon Week;\n       (2) encourages children and teens to choose to live drug-\n     free lives; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to promote \n     the creation of drug-free communities and to participate in \n     drug prevention activities to show support for healthy, \n     productive, and drug-free lifestyles.\n\n[[Page S9186]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/22/senate-section/article/S9179-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9179-S9186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--RESOLUTIONS EN BLOC\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Con. Res. 96\n\n       Whereas on May 12, 2008, Irena Sendler, a living example of \n     social justice, died at the age of 98;\n       Whereas Irena Sendler repeatedly risked her life during the \n     Holocaust to rescue over 2,500 Jewish children who lived in \n     the Warsaw ghetto in Poland from Nazi extermination;\n       Whereas Irena Sendler was inspired by her father, a \n     physician who treated poor Jewish patients, to dedicate her \n     life to others;\n       Whereas Irena Sendler became an activist at the start of \n     World War II, heading the clandestine group Zegota and \n     driving an underground movement that provided safe passage \n     for Jews from the Warsaw ghetto who faced disease, execution, \n     or deportation to concentration camps;\n       Whereas Irena Sendler became 1 of the most successful \n     workers within Zegota, taking charge of the children's \n     division and using her senior position with the welfare \n     department in Warsaw to gain access to and from the ghetto to \n     build a network of allies to help ferry Jewish children from \n     the Warsaw ghetto;\n       Whereas Irena Sendler was arrested by the Gestapo on \n     October 20, 1943, tortured, and sentenced to death by firing \n     squad;\n       Whereas Irena Sendler never revealed details of her \n     contacts, escaped from Pawiak prison, and continued her \n     invaluable work with Zegota;\n       Whereas in 1965, Irena Sendler was recognized as \n     ``Righteous Among the Nations'' by the Yad Vashem Holocaust \n     Memorial in Israel;\n       Whereas in 2006, Irena Sendler was nominated for the Nobel \n     Peace Prize;\n       Whereas Irena Sendler was awarded the Order of the White \n     Eagle, the highest civilian decoration in Poland;\n       Whereas ``Tzedek: The Righteous'', a documentary film, and \n     ``Life in a Jar'', a play about the rescue efforts made by \n     Irena Sendler, chronicle the life of Irena Sendler;\n       Whereas Irena Sendler, a woman who risked everything for \n     the lives of others and\n\n[[Page S9180]]\n\n     whose bravery is unimaginable to many, expressed guilt for \n     not being able to do more for the Jewish people; and\n       Whereas the story of Irena Sendler reminds citizens of the \n     United States and the world community not only of the \n     horrible cruelty at the time of the Holocaust, but also the \n     incredible difference 1 person can make: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) mourns the loss of Irena Sendler, a woman whose bravery \n     and heroic efforts saved over 2,500 Jewish children during \n     the Holocaust;\n       (2) pays respect and extends condolences to the Sendler \n     family;\n       (3) honors the legacy of courage, selflessness, and hope \n     that Irena Sendler exhibited; and\n       (4) remembers the life and unwavering dedication to justice \n     and human rights of Irena Sendler.\n\n                              S. Res. 614\n\n       Whereas over-the-counter and prescription medicines are \n     extremely safe, effective, and potentially lifesaving when \n     used properly;\n       Whereas the abuse and recreational use of over-the-counter \n     and prescription medicines can be extremely dangerous and \n     produce serious side effects;\n       Whereas in a recently sampled month, 7,000,000 individuals \n     aged 12 or older reported using prescription \n     psychotherapeutic medicines for nonmedical purposes;\n       Whereas abuse of prescription medicines, including pain \n     relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives is second \n     only to marijuana, the number 1 illegal drug of abuse in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas recent studies indicate that 2,400,000 children, or \n     1 in 10 children aged 12 through 17, have intentionally \n     abused cough medicine to get high from the ingredient \n     dextromethorphan;\n       Whereas 4,500,000, or 1 in 5, young adults have used \n     prescription medicines for nonmedical purposes;\n       Whereas according to research from the Partnership for a \n     Drug-Free America, more than \\1/3\\ of teens mistakenly \n     believe that taking prescription drugs, even if not \n     prescribed by a doctor, is much safer than using more \n     traditional street drugs;\n       Whereas the lack of understanding by teens and parents of \n     the potential harms of these powerful prescription drugs \n     makes raising public awareness about the dangers of the \n     misuse of such drugs more critical than ever;\n       Whereas misused prescription drugs are most often obtained \n     through friends and relatives;\n       Whereas misused prescription drugs are also obtained \n     through rogue Internet pharmacies;\n       Whereas parents should be aware that the Internet gives \n     teens access to websites that promote medicine abuse;\n       Whereas National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month promotes \n     the messages that over-the-counter and prescription medicines \n     should be taken only as labeled or prescribed, and that \n     taking over-the-counter and prescription medicines for \n     recreational uses or in large doses can have serious and \n     life-threatening consequences;\n       Whereas National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month will \n     encourage parents to become educated about prescription drug \n     abuse and talk to teens about all types of substance abuse;\n       Whereas observance of National Medicine Abuse Awareness \n     Month should be encouraged at the national, State, and local \n     levels to increase awareness of the misuse of medicines;\n       Whereas some groups, including the Consumer Healthcare \n     Products Association and the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of \n     America, have taken important steps by creating educational \n     toolkits, including ``A Dose of Prevention: Stopping Cough \n     Medicine Abuse Before it Starts'', which provides guides to \n     educate parents, teachers, law enforcement officials, doctors \n     and healthcare professionals, and retailers about the \n     potential dangers of abusing over-the-counter cough and cold \n     medicines;\n       Whereas the Partnership for a Drug-Free America and \n     community alliance and affiliate partners have undertaken a \n     nationwide prevention campaign utilizing research-based \n     educational advertisements, public relations and news media, \n     and the Internet to inform parents about the negative teen \n     behavior of intentional abuse of medicines so that parents \n     are empowered to effectively communicate the facts about this \n     dangerous trend with teens and to take necessary steps to \n     safeguard prescription and over-the-counter medicines at \n     home; and\n       Whereas educating the public about the dangers of medicine \n     abuse and promoting prevention is a critical component of \n     what must be a multi-pronged effort to curb the disturbing \n     rise in medicine misuse: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of August 2008 as ``National \n     Medicine Abuse Awareness Month''; and\n       (2) urges communities to carry out appropriate programs and \n     activities to educate parents and youth about the potential \n     dangers associated with medicine abuse.\n\n                              S.

122 Stat. 1651) to reform and strengthen Federal \n     nutrition assistance programs;\n       Whereas, through the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of \n     2008 (Public Law 110-246; 122 Stat. 1651), the Senate \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry made key \n     improvements to the food stamp program, including--\n       (1) increasing the food purchasing ability of low-income \n     households by accounting for food cost inflation;\n       (2) increasing the minimum benefit;\n       (3) encouraging retirement and education savings; and\n       (4) allowing families to account for child care costs in \n     calculating food assistance;\n       Whereas, through the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of \n     2008 (Public Law 110-246;

Res. 673\n\n       Whereas comprehensive, culturally sensitive health \n     promotion within the workplace is essential to maintain and \n     improve the health of American workers;\n       Whereas employees who improve their health also reduce \n     their probability of chronic health conditions, lower their \n     out-of-pocket medical and pharmaceutical costs, reduce pain \n     and suffering, have greater levels of energy and vitality, \n     and experience increased satisfaction with their lives and \n     jobs;\n       Whereas health care costs in the United States doubled from \n     1990 to 2001 and are expected to double again by 2012;\n       Whereas employee health benefits are the fastest growing \n     labor cost component for employers, thus posing a serious and \n     growing challenge to business in the United States;\n       Whereas business leaders are struggling to find strategies \n     to help reduce the direct costs of employer-provided health \n     care, as well as the indirect costs associated with higher \n     rates of absenteeism, disability, and injury;\n       Whereas an effective strategy to address the primary \n     driving force of soaring health care costs requires an \n     investment in prevention;\n       Whereas some employers who invest in health promotion and \n     disease prevention have achieved rates of return on \n     investment ranging from $3 to $15 for each dollar invested, \n     as well as a 28 percent average reduction in sick leave \n     absenteeism, an average 26 percent reduction in health care \n     costs, and a 30 percent average reduction in workers' \n     compensation and disability management claims costs;\n       Whereas the Healthy People 2010 national objectives for the \n     United States include the workplace health-related goal that \n     at least \\3/4\\ of United States employers, regardless of \n     size, will voluntarily offer a comprehensive employee health \n     promotion program that includes--(1) health education and \n     programming which focuses on skill development and lifestyle \n     behavior change along with information dissemination and \n     awareness building, preferably tailored to employees' \n     interests and needs; (2) supportive social and physical \n     environments, including an organization's expectations \n     regarding healthy behaviors, and implementation of policies \n     that promote health and reduce risk of disease; (3) \n     integration of the worksite wellness programs into the \n     organization's structure; (4) linkage to related programs \n     like employee assistance programs (EAPs) and programs to help \n     employees balance work and family; and (5) screening \n     programs, ideally linked to medical care to ensure follow-up \n     and appropriate treatment as necessary;\n       Whereas employers should be encouraged to invest in the \n     health of employees by implementing comprehensive worksite \n     health promotion programs that will help achieve our national \n     Healthy People 2010 objectives;\n       Whereas business leaders that have made a healthy workforce \n     a part of their core business strategy should be encouraged \n     to share information and resources to educate their peers on \n     the issue of employee health management through initiatives \n     such as the Leading by Example CEO-to-CEO Roundtable on \n     Workforce Health and the United States Workplace Wellness \n     Alliance;\n       Whereas the employers that provide health care coverage for \n     more than 177,000,000 Americans have the potential to exert \n     transformative leadership on this issue by increasing the \n     number, quality, and types of health promotion programs and \n     policies at worksites across the Nation;\n       Whereas, for workplace wellness efforts to reach their full \n     potential, chief executive officers of major corporations, \n     company presidents of small enterprises, and State governors \n     should be encouraged to make worksite health promotion a \n     priority; and\n       Whereas Congress supports the National Worksite Health \n     Promotion goal as stated in Healthy People 2010 and \n     encourages public employers to increase their awareness of \n     the value of corporate investments in employee health \n     management to help our Nation achieve this goal: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate calls on private and public \n     employers to support workplace wellness and implement \n     voluntarily worksite health promotion programs to help\n\n[[Page S9185]]\n\n     maximize employees' health and well being and lower health \n     care costs.\n\n                              S. Res. 674\n\n       Whereas older adults value their independence and a fall \n     can significantly limit their ability to remain self-\n     sufficient;\n       Whereas falls are the leading cause of death from \n     unintentional injuries among older adults in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas older adults are by far the population at greatest \n     risk for falling unintentionally, with more than \\1/3\\ of all \n     people 65 years or older falling each year;\n       Whereas older adults who fall once are 2 to 3 times more \n     likely than adults who have not fallen to fall again;\n       Whereas, in 2000, the Bureau of the Census reported that \n     more than 34,800,000 adults older than the age of 65 live in \n     the United States, and that number is expected to grow to \n     almost 55,000,000 by 2020;\n       Whereas 20 to 30 percent of older adults who fall suffer \n     moderate to severe injuries, such as bruising, hip fractures, \n     and head traumas;\n       Whereas, in 2005, falls resulted in nearly 1,800,000 older \n     adults being treated in emergency departments and more than \n     433,000 older adults being hospitalized;\n       Whereas, in 2005, nearly 16,000 people aged 65 and older \n     died from injuries related to unintentional falls;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     report that the mortality rate from falls among older adults \n     increased 45 percent between 2000 and 2004;\n       Whereas the total in direct costs associated with both \n     fatal and non-fatal falls is more than $19,000,000,000 \n     annually for hospitalization, emergency department visits, \n     and outpatient care;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimate that if the rate of increase in falls is not \n     stemmed, annual direct treatment costs will reach \n     $43,800,000,000 by 2020, with an annual cost under the \n     Medicare program of $32,400,000,000;\n       Whereas evidence-based programs show promise in reducing \n     falls and facilitating cost-effective interventions, such as \n     comprehensive clinical assessments, exercise programs to \n     improve balance and health, management of medications, \n     correction of vision, and reduction of home hazards;\n       Whereas, on April 23, 2008, the Safety of Seniors Act of \n     2007 (Public Law 110-202) was enacted, amending the Public \n     Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 280b et seq.) to create a \n     national education campaign aimed at older adults, their \n     families, and healthcare providers, and injury prevention \n     programs that focus on the reduction and prevention of falls \n     among older adults; and\n       Whereas the Falls Free Coalition Advocacy Work Group, its \n     numerous supporting organizations and all other supportive \n     organizations, should be commended for their efforts to raise \n     awareness and to promote greater understanding, research, and \n     pilot programs to prevent falls among older adults: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 22, 2008, as ``National Falls \n     Prevention Awareness Day'';\n       (2) commends the National Falls Free Coalition and all \n     other supportive organizations for their efforts to promote \n     awareness about preventing and reducing falls among older \n     people in the United States;\n       (3) encourages the private sector, the public health \n     community, healthcare providers, advocacy organizations, and \n     Federal, State, and local governments to work together to \n     increase education and awareness about the prevention of \n     falls; and\n       (4) urges national and community organizations, businesses, \n     individuals, and the media to use National Falls Prevention \n     Awareness Day to promote awareness of this important public \n     health problem in an effort to reduce the incidence of falls \n     among older people in the United States.\n\n                              S.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution (H.J.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Heritage Day \n     Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Native Americans are the descendants of the aboriginal, \n     indigenous, native people who were the original inhabitants \n     of the United States;\n       (2) Native Americans have volunteered to serve in the \n     United States Armed Forces and have served with valor in all \n     of the Nation's military actions from the Revolutionary War \n     through the present day, and in most of those actions, more \n     Native Americans per capita served in the Armed Forces than \n     any other group of Americans;\n       (3) Native Americans have made distinct and significant \n     contributions to the United States and the rest of the world \n     in many fields, including agriculture, medicine, music, \n     language, and art, and Native Americans have distinguished \n     themselves as inventors, entrepreneurs, spiritual leaders, \n     and scholars;\n       (4) Native Americans should be recognized for their \n     contributions to the United States as local and national \n     leaders, artists, athletes, and scholars;\n       (5) nationwide recognition of the contributions that Native \n     Americans have made to the fabric of American society will \n     afford an opportunity for all Americans to demonstrate their \n     respect and admiration of Native Americans for their \n     important contributions to the political, cultural, and \n     economic life of the United States;\n       (6) nationwide recognition of the contributions that Native \n     Americans have made to the Nation will encourage self-esteem, \n     pride, and self-awareness in Native Americans of all ages;\n       (7) designation of the Friday following Thanksgiving of \n     each year as Native American Heritage Day will underscore the \n     government-to-government relationship between the United \n     States and Native American governments; and\n       (8) designation of Native American Heritage Day will \n     encourage public elementary and secondary schools in the \n     United States to enhance understanding of Native Americans by \n     providing curricula and classroom instruction focusing on the \n     achievements and contributions of Native Americans to the \n     Nation.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 62) was read the third time, and \npassed.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the passage of \nthe resolution congratulating the University of Maryland School of \nMedicine on its 200th anniversary. I am proud to introduce this \nresolution that recognizes the outstanding contributions the University \nof Maryland School of Medicine has made in the last 200 years to the \nmedical community, Maryland community, and entire world.\n  The University of Maryland School of Medicine is the first public \nmedical school in the country and is the fifth oldest medical school. \nSince 1789, it has been a leader in medical education--the first \nmedical school in the country to build a teaching hospital for clinical \ninstruction, the first to establish a medical library, and the first \nschool to offer courses in preventive medicine.\n  Today, the University of Maryland School of Medicine is home to 25 \nacademic departments, 7 research centers, and treats over 1 million \npatients a year. I commend the contributions the school has made over \nthe past 200 years. I know the University of Maryland School of \nMedicine will continue to blaze trails in the future as a leader in \nmedical research, patient care, education, and community service.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a resolution \nthat commemorates the Annual Red Ribbon Campaign. I am honored to again \nseek the Senate's continuing support and recognition of Red Ribbon \nWeek, which is October 23 through October 31.\n  In 1985, Special Agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena of the Drug \nEnforcement Administration was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered in the \nline of duty by drug traffickers. Shortly after Agent Camarena's death, \nCongressman Duncan Hunter and high school friend Henry Lozano launched \n``Camarena Clubs'' in the Agent's hometown of Calexico, CA. In honor of \nAgent Camarena, hundreds of club members wore red ribbons and pledged \nto lead drug-free lives. The campaign quickly gained statewide and then \nnational prominence. In 1988, what is now the National Family \nPartnership organized the first National Red Ribbon Week, an 8-day \nevent proclaimed by the Congress and chaired by then President and Mrs. \nReagan.\n  This campaign is now the oldest and largest drug prevention program \nin the Nation, reaching millions of youth through Red Ribbon Week \nevents. Red Ribbon Week memorializes Agent Camarena, and all those who \nhave lost their lives in the war on drugs, by educating young people \nabout the dangers of drug abuse, promoting drug-free activities, and \nsupporting everyone who has stood strong against illicit drugs. The Red \nRibbon that we will wear during Red Ribbon Week is a symbol of zero \ntolerance for illegal drug use and our commitment to help people, \nespecially children, make the right life-decisions.\n  In Alaska, Red Ribbon Week is a statewide celebration involving \nthousands of school children and other supporters. On October 27, the \nAlaska Red Ribbon Coalition, in conjunction with the municipality of \nAnchorage, will host a Red Ribbon Week kickoff. The Red Ribbon \nCoalition is comprised of the Anchorage School District, the Alaska \nState Troopers, the Anchorage Police Department, the U.S. Drug \nEnforcement Administration, and the U.S. Department of Justice. Forty-\nthree Boys & Girls Clubs across Alaska will help other Alaskan \ncommunities celebrate Red Ribbon Week throughout the State.\n  In addition, this year, the Red Ribbon Coalition, the Alaska National \nGuard, and the Iditarod Trail Committee are sponsoring the first ever \nAnchorage School District Idol whereby every junior high and high \nschool in Anchorage will hold local talent competitions and select one \nact to move to a final competition. The acts will be judged based, \namong other things, on their drug-free themes, and the final \ncompetition will be held as part of the Iditarod Sled Dog Race \nfestivities in March 2009. The plan is to broadcast the event to the \nstudents in all 50 States and across the globe who participate in the \nIditarod Education Program, thus extending the reach of the 2008 Red \nRibbon Week into 2009, and sharing Anchorage's Red Ribbon Week antidrug \nmessage and celebrations with the Nation and the world.\n  As we stand together against drugs, I thank my colleagues for joining \nme in what hopefully will be a continuation of the tradition of \ncongressional support and recognition of Red Ribbon Week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I stand here today to highlight my \ngrave concerns about our financial system and the American economy--a \ndisaster that has been building for months and, in fact, years and last \nweek quickly hit the breaking point.\n  The latest crisis seemed to come so suddenly, it moved so fast, it \nspread so far, and went straight to the heart of the global financial \nsystem. There is no doubt we are seeing now the biggest financial \nchallenge since the Great Depression, and we are also witnessing the \nmost remarkable degree of Government involvement into our financial \nsystem since the 1930s.\n  It is truly remarkable. Consider the list: Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, \nFreddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch,\n\n[[Page S9187]]\n\nand AIG. These names used to be confined to the business pages. Now \nthey are at the top of the front pages.\n  I have strong feelings about what happened here. During the past 8 \nyears, the financial and economic policies of this administration have \nbeen off course. They have not managed or led the economy in a \nresponsible manner.\n  We have gone from a large budget surplus, left by the Clinton \nadministration, to an even larger budget deficit. This administration \nhas been reckless in how it managed Government's finances, and it has \nbeen reckless in how it managed its responsibility to ensure a strong, \nstable financial system.\n  This administration acted as if the rules don't apply anymore. With \nloopholes here and there, they don't use the regulations. It permitted \nthe large financial institutions to run amok, to turn the economy into \na gambling hall, playing with funny money. Finally, in the 11th hour, \nthe house managers, Bernanke and Paulson, have been asked to step in to \nshut down the game.\n  It is hard to exaggerate the magnitude of what has happened. As \nfinancial journalist Steven Pearlstein observed last week:\n\n       This is what a Category 4 financial crisis looks like. \n     Giant blue-chip financial institutions swept away in a matter \n     of days. Banks refusing to lend to other banks. Russia \n     closing its stock market to stop the panicked selling. Gold \n     soaring $70 in a single trading session. Developing \n     countries' currencies in a free fall. Money-market funds \n     warning they might not be able to return every dollar \n     invested. Daily swings of three, four, five hundred points in \n     the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n       It's a painful reminder that, when you strip away all the \n     complexity and trappings from the magnificent new global \n     infrastructure, finance is still a confidence game--and once \n     the confidence goes, there's no telling when the selling will \n     stop.\n\n  In some respects, it may look as if all the action is in New York or \nWashington or London or Tokyo. But we know the consequences are being \nfelt everywhere. This is a broad-based financial crisis. Everyone is \naffected. If you are trying to buy or sell a home, you are affected. If \nyou are trying to refinance your home, you are affected. If you are \ntrying to get a student loan for tuition, you are affected. If you are \na small business owner trying to extend your credit line, you are \naffected. If you are a farmer trying to buy a new tractor, you are \naffected. Maybe the only people in America not affected are those who \nkept their money in mattresses, and we know that is not the answer.\n  Look at what has happened to the middle class in the last 8 years: \nwages down an average of $2,000 a year. Expenses up $4,400 a year. That \nis a net loss of $6,400 a year. That doesn't include people with \nbabies, and childcare, and afterschool care, and the added expenses for \ncollege--$6,400 a year. We need solutions and we need them now.\n  Secretary Paulson has presented his proposal, and I believe we need \nto change that proposal. I believe there is more we need to do.\n  First, I believe, in the long term, we need a comprehensive plan, \nincluding both a short-term rescue strategy and a long-term approach \nfor economic recovery and rebuilding.\n  Secondly, we must minimize, as much as possible, the cost to American \ntaxpayers. Private companies that get themselves into deep trouble \nshould not get a free bailout on the backs of America's middle class.\n  Third, this plan can't be limited to helping Wall Street. We must \nhelp the middle class. We must save Main Street from the mistakes of \nWall Street, and we must address head on the underlying issue of the \nhousing market and foreclosure crisis. That means providing protection \nand support to struggling homeowners and restoring confidence in the \nresidential real estate market.\n  Finally, if this plan proposes that the Federal Government come to \nthe rescue of private financial institutions, then the Government must \nsecure greater oversight of how these companies conduct their business \ngoing forward. For companies that receive assistance, there should be a \nlimit placed on dividends. Key executives should have a look-back \nplaced in their compensation package, and there should be a prohibiting \nof these golden parachutes. I cannot tell you how angry this makes me. \nLook at Lehman Brothers and their CEO, Richard Fuld. He earned about \n$45 million. This amounts to roughly $17,000 an hour--$17,000 an hour \nthat he earned. Basically, their firm has been obliterated.\n  Last year, CEOs of large public companies averaged 340 more times the \npay of the average workers. As Warren Buffet once said--and this is \nfrom an article by Nicholas Christopher in the New York Times:\n\n       In judging whether corporate America is serious about \n     reforming itself, CEO pay remains the acid test.\n\n  As he said in this article, it is a test that corporate America is \nfailing.\n  People can make their money, I suppose, but once we start, as \ntaxpayers in the U.S. Government, buying their assets and backing up \ntheir assets and bearing the risk, asking taxpayers to do that, then we \nhave something to say about this executive compensation, and we must \nsay it in any type of a rescue plan.\n  We also have to make sure going forward that the appropriate \nfinancial regulations are in place, that these loopholes are closed. \nThere should be changes in corporate governments to improve the \nindependence of corporate boards and reduce reckless behavior. There \nshould be limits on speculative behavior.\n  I know everybody is focused a lot on Wall Street. But I have to tell \nyou what is happening on Main Street. In my State of Minnesota, the \nunemployment rate is at its highest in 22 years. Minnesota's second \nquarter growth in personal income is only 1 percent--the 49th lowest in \nthe country. Even that 1-percent increase is more than wiped out by \ninflation.\n  Home values in the Twin Cities area dropped nearly 14 percent in the \nsecond quarter of this year compared to last year. Heating costs this \nwinter are expected to increase by double digits. The latest forecast \nshows that the cost of natural gas is expected to be 17 percent higher \nthan it was last winter. Prices for fuel oil are expected to be 23 \npercent higher.\n  The American people still have faith in our Nation. They know our \ncountry and our economy still have great potential. We have the talent, \nthe resources, the know-how, the entrepreneurial spirit, and a passion \nfor innovation. The public is still bullish on America, even though \nMerrill Lynch may not be.\n  Although our immediate and urgent goal must be to stabilize the \nfinancial system and restore confidence, we also must spend this week \nasking those tough questions and making sure we have some answers and \nmaking sure the proposals that go through the Congress include those \nlimits I talked about on executive pay. If we are going to be asking \ntaxpayers in this country to bear any of this risk, they must include a \nlong-term plan for better financial regulation of these companies. They \nmust include a focus not just on Wall Street but also on Main Street.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am going to address two things \ntoday. First, I wish to address an Iowan I am very proud of, a person \nwhom, if you watched the Olympics, you saw on television recently. So I \nam here today as a proud Iowan and American to tell other Americans \njust how proud I am of this Iowan.\n  Millions of Americans tuned in to the Olympics this past August and \nwitnessed phenomenal performances by American athletes. I am proud of \nall the athletes who competed in the Olympics but especially the 11-\nmember Team USA with Iowa ties who represented our country in Beijing.\n  One of those exceptional athletes was a fellow Iowan named Shawn \nJohnson. Shawn was a member of the U.S. women's gymnastics team who \nbrought home the silver in the team competition. She went on to win \nindividual honors too. She won the Silver Medal\n\n[[Page S9188]]\n\nboth in all-around competition in the floor exercise, and she also \nreceived the Gold Medal for the balance beam. And that was her favorite \nevent. All Americans were proud to see Shawn's success, but Iowans are \noverwhelmingly proud of the self-described--and these are not my words, \nbut other people described her as the daredevil with a big smile.\n  At this year's Iowa State Fair, the famous butter sculpture, which \nhas been a part of the State fair for the last 45 years--a sculpture \nmade out of butter, usually a cow--this year featured a cow but also a \nsculpture of Shawn Johnson.\n  Shawn is the reigning women's world gymnastics All-Around Champion, \nbut she is also a teenager from West Des Moines who presently attends \nValley High School when she is not competing around the world. She \nattends football games and school dances and tries to live the life of \na typical teen. She goes to class 5 hours each day and then trains at \nChow's Gymnastics in her hometown. With all of this on her plate, she \nstill manages to get straight As.\n  Her talent is anything but typical. As a baby, Shawn skipped the \ncrawling and went right to walking. She climbed out of her crib before \nshe was a year old. As a toddler, she would build a ladder out of toys, \nscale the entertainment center, and jump onto the couch.\n  After seeing their daughter's abundant energy and fearlessness, \nShawn's parents Terri and Doug enrolled her in a tumbling class at age \n3, and she showed promise early on. Her coach at Chows Gymnastics in \nWest Des Moines, Liang Chow, noticed her talents and honed those \ntalents. He even submitted a tape of Shawn to the U.S. women's \ngymnastics team coach Marta Karolyi because it is tough for a gymnast \ntraining in Iowa to get noticed by a national team.\n  Training as an elite athlete did not come cheap, though. Shawn's \nparents eventually mortgaged the family home three times so that their \ndaughter could achieve her Olympic dream, and they managed to travel \nwith Shawn to her international competitions.\n  In June of this year, the disastrous floods hit much of Iowa. Shawn \nwas training with the national team, but her heart was with her fellow \nIowans who were suffering, especially her coach. You see, Chow's \nGymnastics, which is Shawn's second home, is located near the Raccoon \nRiver in West Des Moines, and the facility suffered a great deal of \ndamage from the flood. Shawn, knowing what this sort of damage could \nmean for her coach continuing to run her business, wrote a $12,000 \ncheck from her endorsements to help get Chows Gymnastics back up and \nrunning.\n  Iowans have all known about Shawn and her extraordinary talent--and, \nof course, her big smile--for a few years now, and Iowa knew she would \nmake them proud. But the world did not really get to know Shawn until \nthese recent Olympics.\n  Despite losing the all-around competition to her U.S. teammate and \nclose friend Nastia Luikin, Shawn handled herself with grace, poise, \nand genuine happiness. And when Shawn finally won the coveted Gold \nMedal on the incredibly difficult balance beam, her joy was written all \nover her face.\n  So I take this opportunity for my colleagues and everybody in this \ncountry to commend Shawn on her extraordinary performance in the \nBeijing Olympics, not only for medals that she won but for her hard \nwork, her composure, and maturity. I compliment her. She did Iowa and \nAmerica proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/22/senate-section/article/S9188-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9188-S9189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ILLEGAL DRUGS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am going to now visit about an issue \nI often visit with my colleagues about, the issue of drugs, because I \nserved with Senator Biden as cochairman of the drug caucus.\n  As a parent and now grandparent, I remain deeply concerned about the \nhazardous environment to which our children are exposed. Every day, we \nsee more and more heartbreaking stories of a child being victimized in \none way or another. Some of the most disturbing trends involve deadly \ndrugs and our own kids. More specifically, there is an alarming number \nof kids who are being exposed to environments where illegal drugs are \nbeing manufactured and sold. Kids are also falling prey to unscrupulous \ndrug dealers who are disguising highly addictive drugs to make them \nappear as if they were candy. I believe we have a moral obligation in \nthis country to ensure our young people have every opportunity to grow \nup without being accosted by drug pushers at every turn, whether it is \non TV in the home or on the way to school.\n  As a Senator representing a State that has been among the hardest hit \nby the scourge of methamphetamine abuse, I have witnessed firsthand how \nthis horrible drug has devastated individual lives and families. I have \nseen the havoc wreaked on the environment as well as the child welfare \nsystem. I have listened to the horror stories of those caught in the \ngrips of addiction. This is why I joined a number of my colleagues in \npassing the Combat Meth Act of 2005. This landmark legislation has \nshown dramatic results in decreasing the number of clandestine meth \nlabs and increasing methamphetamine seizures.\n  While this is certainly welcome news, particularly for our first \nresponders and local law enforcement community, meth labs in our \ncommunities are still a reality. For instance, in 2006, there were \nstill over 6,400 clandestine meth lab incidents throughout the country. \nIn my home State of Iowa, we have seen an 88-percent decrease in the \nnumber of meth lab incidents since 2004 when the Iowa Legislature \npassed a very important piece of legislation cutting down on the number \nof labs. Yet there were still 240 incidents of clandestine labs last \nyear alone.\n  The Combat Meth Act has been particularly helpful in cutting down on \nmom-and-pop meth labs. However, our efforts have given rise to new and \nmore disturbing instances of meth production, trafficking, and abuse \nthat are becoming more prevalent throughout our country.\n  A case in point can be found in the State of Missouri, where police \nrecently made seven meth-related arrests in just as many hours in the \ntiny quiet town of Ozark. The house where these arrests were made \nbelonged to a 45-year-old grandmother, who was babysitting her infant \ngrandson while his mother was away at school. Upon her arrest, she \nadmitted using meth but denied that she was a dealer. However, while \npolice searched the house, six more individuals were picked up on meth-\nrelated charges.\n  When it was all said and done, three children under the age of 3 \nwatched as the police arrested their parent or grandparent for selling \nor possessing this terrible drug.\n  Sadly, this is not an unusual incident. We have here a picture of a \nbaby. Scenes such as the one depicted on this chart are seen throughout \nthe country. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration--DEA, as \nwe call it around this town--more than 12,000 children throughout the \ncountry have been affected, injured, or killed at meth lab sites since \n2002. Thousands more have been sent to foster homes or were victims of \nmeth-related abuse in the home during the same period.\n  In my State of Iowa, the Department of Human Services reports that \nover 1,000 children over the past 4 years were classified as victims of \nabuse and that nearly half of child abuse cases have been meth-related. \nIn 2006, there were 107 reported cases of child abuse where meth was \nmanufactured in the presence of a minor.\n  Due to the shocking number of children who were being victimized by \ndrugs in one form or another, I joined my colleagues in supporting a \nbill called the Drug Endangered Children Act of 2005.\n  This bipartisan legislation established a national grant program to \nsupport state Drug Endangered Children--DEC programs. These programs \nassist local law enforcement, medical services, and child welfare \nworkers to ensure that victimized children receive proper attention and \ntreatment after living in these terrible environments.\n  DEC programs greatly benefit local law enforcement by helping law \nenforcement coordinate in close cooperation with the Department of \nHuman Services. This ensures a seamless coverage of child welfare and \nlaw enforcement joint operations. I am pleased to report that since \nthis program was implemented a large number of communities throughout \nthe Nation have\n\n[[Page S9189]]\n\nformed multi-disciplinary alliances for the benefit of drug-exposed \nchildren. There are 16 communities throughout Iowa that have set up DEC \nprograms and more are in the process of setting up additional programs.\n  Unfortunately, the authorization for this grant program expired for \nfiscal year 2008. That is why Senator Feinstein and I introduced S. \n1210, the Drug Endangered Children Act of 2007. This legislation would \nreauthorize this important grant program for an additional 2 years to \nassist States in coordinating law enforcement, medical services, and \nchild welfare efforts to ensure children found in such environments \nreceive appropriate attention and care. The Senate Judiciary Committee \nunanimously reported this bipartisan legislation to the floor. I urge \nmy colleagues to join us in support of this important legislation and \npass the Drug Endangered Children Act of 2007.\n  As cochairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics \nControl, I can tell you that the most at-risk population for drug abuse \nis our young people. Research has shown time and again that if you keep \nchildren drug-free until they turn 20, chances are very slim that they \nwill ever try or become addicted to drugs. Unfortunately, unscrupulous \ndrug dealers are all too aware of statistics like these. They have \ndeveloped new techniques and marketing gimmicks to lure in younger \nusers. The DEA and the White House's Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy have recently issued warnings about highly addictive and \ndangerous drugs being colored, packaged, and flavored in ways that \nappear to attract use by children.\n  These drug dealers are flavoring drugs with additives to make them \ntaste like candy. For instance, some drugs that have been recovered by \nthe DEA and local law enforcement have been flavored to taste like \nstrawberry. I have two charts just to show you the seriousness of this \nproblem. One of these charts is of the popular novelty candy ``Pop \nRocks.'' The other is of some strawberry-flavored methamphetamine, \nwhich is known on the street as ``Strawberry Quick,'' that was seized \nby police during a traffic stop in Missouri. You can see how similar \nthese two products appear. It would be very difficult for a child to \ndistinguish between these two.\n  Other flavors, such as lemon, coconut, cinnamon and chocolate are \nclearly being used to make highly addictive and dangerous drugs seem \nless harmful and more appealing. These flavored drugs are also being \nmarketed in smaller amounts, making it cheaper and more accessible to \nchildren. According to an article in USA Today, at least eight States \nhave reported instances involving candy-flavored drugs, and many law \nenforcement officials are expecting these deadly substances to \ninfiltrate their communities in the near future.\n  Meth is not the only drug that is being flavored or disguised by drug \ndealers. The DEA recently arrested three men in an undercover operation \nin California where candy flavored cocaine was being distributed. The \nDEA seized at least four different flavors of cocaine along with other \ndangerous substances. The estimated street value of the flavored \ncocaine seized in this operation was over $272,000.\n  The DEA also arrested 12 people in connection to a marijuana-laced \ncandy operation in 2006. The marijuana-laced candy that was seized in \nthis operation was packaged to look like well-known brand name candy \nbars. You can see in this chart, all the varieties of marijuana-laced \ncandy that this operation produced. Once again, you can see how it \nwould be difficult for a child to distinguish between these marijuana \ncandies and the real product. These drug busts further illustrate the \nfact that drug dealers will stop at nothing to hook a new generation on \nthese deadly drugs.\n  Due to the growing trend of these candy-flavored drugs, I joined \nSenator Feinstein in co-sponsoring S. 1211, the Saving Kids from \nDangerous Drugs Act of 2008, a bill that ought to currently move \nforward. Currently, Federal law enhances the criminal penalties that \napply when a person sells drugs to anyone under the age of 21. When \nthis occurs, the Federal penalties are doubled--or tripled for a repeat \noffense--and a mandatory minimum of at least 1 year must also apply. \nHowever, this penalty applies only to someone who actually sells drugs \nto someone under 21.\n  The Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act, as amended in the Judiciary \nCommittee, would expand the circumstances under which these enhanced \npenalties apply to cover the entire operation. Under our bill, the \nenhanced penalties that already exist would also apply to anyone over \n18 years of age who knowingly or intentionally manufactures, creates, \ndistributes, dispenses or possesses a schedule I or II controlled \nsubstance that has been combined with a candy product, is marketed or \npackaged as if it were similar to a candy product, or has been modified \nby flavoring or coloring with the intent to distribute, or sell that \ncontrolled substance to a person under 21 years of age. The DEA busts \nare prime examples of why we need this bipartisan bill to keep drug \ndealers from pedaling their poison to our children.\n  The fight against deadly drugs is an ongoing struggle. We must \ncontinue to do all we can to protect the most vulnerable among us. We \nmust send a clear message to those wishing to prey on our youth that \nyou risk serious prison time when you target our future. The National \nNarcotics Officers Associations Coalition is strongly supporting this \nmeasure. This organization represents 69,000 law enforcement officers \nwho encounter these terrible substances on a daily basis and work \nendlessly to keep our children and communities safe. I am pleased that \nmy colleagues on the Judiciary Committee overwhelmingly voted in favor \nof reporting this important legislation to the floor. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join us in passing the Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs \nAct of 2008.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join us--meaning myself and Senator \nFeinstein, the main sponsors of the bill--in passing the Saving Kids \nFrom Dangerous Drugs Act of 2008.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Mr. President, I wish to say a few words on the crisis \nabout which everyone in America is talking. My phones, both in Vermont \nand here in Washington, have been bouncing off the hook with people who \nare outraged about the prospect of the middle class bailing out Wall \nStreet. They are telling me: No way; we should not be doing that.\n  The current financial crisis facing our country should, in fact, put \nan end to almost any support for the extreme rightwing economic \npolicies President Bush has been pursuing for the last 8 years and \nthat, in fact, were pursued even before that.\n  These policies include, of course, huge tax breaks for the very rich \nunder the guise that that money will trickle on down to ordinary people \nand create a prosperous nation. That certainly has not been the case.\n  Those policies include unfettered free trade, which says it is a good \nthing for corporate America to be able to throw American workers out on \nthe street, move to China, and bring those products back into this \ncountry and run up what is now over a $600 billion-a-year trade \ndeficit.\n  Last but not least, and pertinent to the great financial crisis we \nare facing right now--a crisis which many people believe is the most \nserious financial problem this country has had since the Great \nDepression of 1929--is the whole of deregulation, not only of financial \nservices but of energy and many other sectors in our economy, under the \nguise that we should have great faith in large financial institutions, \nthat they will do the right thing and that they will benefit the people \nof our country and, in fact, the world.\n  We have learned tax breaks for the rich do not filter down but make \nthe rich richer. We have learned unfettered free trade costs us \nmillions of good-paying jobs. We have learned that massive \nderegulation, allowing large financial institutions to do whatever they \nwant to do under the radar screen, will only hurt our economy and maybe \ndrive it to ruin.\n  In the midst of all this, it is important to understand what has been \ngoing on for ordinary people in this country. Since President Bush has \nbeen in office, nearly 6 million Americans have\n\n[[Page S9190]]\n\nslipped out of the middle class and into poverty all over this country. \nIn Vermont, as I suspect in Rhode Island, working people are working \ntwo jobs; husbands and wives who were working are now reduced to going \nto emergency food shelves in order to buy groceries they need to take \ncare of their families. Since George Bush has been President, the \nmedian family income for working Americans has declined by more than \n$2,000, a huge decrease in the income for the middle class. Since \nPresident Bush has been in office, more than 6 million Americans have \nlost their health insurance, over 4 million have lost their pensions, \nforeclosures are at an alltime high, consumer debt has more than \ndoubled, and today we have a national debt which is almost $10 \ntrillion, a debt we are going to be leaving to our kids and our \ngrandchildren. That is what is happening to the middle class under \nthese extreme rightwing economic policies.\n  But in terms of this debate about what we do with regard to the \ncurrent financial crisis we are facing, it is also important to \nunderstand not only what is happening to the middle class and the \ndecline of the middle class, it is also important to understand what is \nhappening to the people on top, the wealthiest people in this country. \nThe top one-tenth of 1 percent now earns more income than the bottom 50 \npercent of the American people: One-tenth of 1 percent, bottom 50 \npercent. The top 1 percent now owns more wealth than the bottom 90 \npercent. This country has the most unequal distribution of wealth and \nincome than since just before the Great Depression in the 1920s.\n  Mr. President, the wealthiest 400 people in our country, since \nPresident Bush has been in office, have seen their wealth increase by \n$670 billion. Let me repeat that in case people are kind of scratching \ntheir heads because this is such an extraordinary number. The \nwealthiest 400 people--that is not a whole lot of people--in our \ncountry have seen their wealth increase by $670 billion since President \nBush has been in office.\n  In the midst of all of that, while the rich become phenomenally \nricher, President Bush lowered taxes on the very wealthy so they are \nnow paying lower income tax rates than teachers, nurses, policemen, \nfiremen, than people in the middle class.\n  I raise that issue for a very simple reason. Secretary Paulson, \nrepresenting the Bush administration, which year after year until a few \nmonths ago was telling us how robust and strong the economy was--I \nremember, as a member of the Budget Committee, having Secretary Paulson \nin front of us not very long ago telling us the economy was marvelous. \nMarvelous.\n  In late July of this year, President Bush himself said the \nfoundations of the economy were strong. That was on July 31. So after \nhaving told us what most middle-class Americans knew instinctively to \nbe wrong, having told us over and over again how strong the economy \nwas, how robust the economy was, last week the Secretary of the \nTreasury basically said in so many words: I guess we made a slight \nmistake. The fundamentals are really not very strong. In fact, if we do \nnot act on the largest bailout in the history of our country, and you \nin Congress can take a few days to respond, but if you do not act, \nthere will be a financial meltdown not only in America but all over the \nworld.\n  So year after year, until very recently, either because of \nincompetence and not understanding what was going on in the economy or \nperhaps dishonesty and not wanting to let the American people know what \nwas going on in the economy, we were told everything was going well. \nThen they say: Oops, we made a slight mistake. Actually, we are on the \nverge of a major financial meltdown and we want Congress to accept a \n$700 billion bailout, and we do not want the Congress to discuss it \nvery much. We do not want the Congress to change it very much. It has \nto act immediately because if it doesn't, terrible things will happen.\n  Well, when we talk about the reasons for the possible need of a \nbailout, we cannot minimize the incredible greed, the ugly greed we \nhave seen among many of the wealthiest people in this country in the \nlast few years, not least of all the people on Wall Street.\n  Let me give you some examples. In 2005, Henry Paulson, our now \nSecretary of the Treasury, was then the CEO of Goldman Sachs. He \nreceived, in 2005, a $38 million bonus. At that time, that was the \nlargest bonus ever given to a Wall Street CEO.\n  In December of 2006, John Mack, the CEO of Morgan Stanley, broke Mr. \nPaulson's record by receiving a $40 million bonus--a bonus. This is on \ntop of other forms of compensation.\n  Not to be outdone, Lloyd Blankfein, the new CEO of Goldman Sachs, \nreceived a $53 million bonus later that month. In 2007, 1 year ago, Mr. \nBlankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs shattered his own record by \nreceiving a $68 million bonus.\n  In October of 2007, E. Stanley O'Neal, the former chief executive of \nMerrill Lynch--I think we all know what has happened to Merrill Lynch \nvery recently--collected a severance package worth an estimated $161 \nmillion.\n  Angelo Mozilo, the former CEO of Countrywide--we know what happened \nto Countrywide--received a severance package of about $110 million. \nThat was on top of $140 million in Countrywide stock that he sold off \nduring 2006 and 2007. Mozilo was also paid $48 million in 2006.\n  In 2007, here is perhaps--when we talk about Wall Street greed and \nwhen we talk about Wall Street bonuses--the most outrageous fact out \nthere, which is that in 2007 Wall Street's five biggest firms--Bear \nStearns, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan \nStanley--paid out $39 billion in bonuses to themselves.\n  Wall Street investment bank bonuses are larger, just their bonuses, \nthan the gross domestic products of Sri Lanka, Lebanon, or Bulgaria, \nand the average bonus--average--of $219,000 is more than four times \nhigher than the median U.S. household income.\n  Why do I raise those issues and give those facts? I do that for a \nvery simple reason; that is, I regard it as an outrage for anyone to \nsuggest the middle class of this country, whose standard of living is \ngoing down, should be forced to bail out Wall Street when people on \nWall Street have made huge amounts of money in recent years and, in \ngeneral, as a result of Bush's reckless and irresponsible economic \npolicies.\n  The wealthiest people have also done extraordinarily well. What \nPresident Bush would have us do is to say to the middle class that is \nsinking, you pay for the bailout caused by Wall Street's \nirresponsibility, and we do not have to ask them to do anything. They \npay no price at all.\n  I regard that as an absolutely unacceptable outrage, something we \nmust not allow to happen. I am open to other ideas on this issue, but \nfor me, the bottom line on this bailout is that the middle class should \nnot be paying. There are a number of ways we can go forward to protect \nthe middle class. I have suggested a 5-year, 10-percent tax on incomes \nover $1 million a year for couples, and $500,000 for single taxpayers. \nThat would raise more than $300 billion in revenue.\n  That begins the process of saying to the wealthiest people who have \nbenefitted from Bush's reckless policies: You have to step to the \nplate, and this is not going to be on the middle class to provide the \nmoney for the bailout--this money, by the way, which is $2,200 for \nevery woman, man, and child in this country and, a family of four, \nclose to $9,000.\n  In addition, we have to ensure that assets purchased from banks are \nrealistically discounted so companies are not rewarded for their risky \nbehavior and taxpayers can recover the amount they pay for them.\n  Thirdly, we must require that the taxpayers receive equity stakes in \nthe bailed-out companies so the assumption of risk is rewarded when a \ncompany's stock goes up. We are going to buy this stuff, and as stocks \ngo up we should benefit from that. In addition, at a time when the \nmiddle class has so many serious problems; when people in my State and \nin the State of the Senator from Rhode Island are worried about how \nthey are going to be able to heat their homes this winter; when \nmillions of middle-class families are worried about how they are going \nto be able to send their kids to college; at a time when our \ninfrastructure is collapsing, and we have the potential to create \nmillions of jobs rebuilding our bridges, our roads, our rail systems; \nat\n\n[[Page S9191]]\n\na time when we must move from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and \nsustainable energy and create large numbers of jobs in that area as \nwell; we need a major economic recovery program which puts millions of \nAmericans to work dealing with the many unmet needs facing our country.\n  In addition, to my mind, any serious piece of legislation dealing \nwith this bailout must include language which undoes the damage caused \nby excessive deregulation. That means reinstalling regulatory firewalls \nthat were ripped down in 1999. And, lastly--not lastly because I think \nmany other people have other good ideas as well, but the last point \nthat I want to make tonight is a very important point.\n  We are where we are today because of the doctrine of ``too big to \nfail.'' The assumption is that if we allow these huge institutions to \nfail, they take down the entire economy and virtually all of our people \nsuffer.\n  I would respond to that in the future by saying that if an \ninstitution is too big to fail, that institution is too big to exist. I \nshould tell you that I have serious concerns right now about the Bank \nof America swallowing up Countrywide, swallowing up Merrill Lynch. If \nthey were to be teetering, does anyone have any doubt that there would \nhave to be a massive bailout for that bank? But it is not only the Bank \nof America. I think we have to take a very hard look at these huge \ninstitutions, which, if they fail, could impact the entire economy. I \nthink we need to start doing something that was talked about in the \nearly part of the 20th century about breaking up these huge \ninstitutions.\n  There is a lot of work that has to be done in the near future. But \nfor me, the bottom line is that at a time when the wealthiest people \nmade out like bandits under Bush's reckless economic policies, while at \nthe same time the middle class declined, it would be absolutely \ngrotesque to ask the middle class of this country to pay for this \nbailout.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know the country is focusing on and we \nare all concerned about the state of the economy and some of the \nproposals that are being raised to fix that, including the proposal \nfrom the Secretary of Treasury and the administration for a $700 \nbillion expenditure. That is almost one-third of the entire \ngovernmental expenditure this year. It is more than the war in Iraq has \ncost, and it is an extraordinary thing.\n  I do not know the answer. I am not a master of the universe. I have \nused the phrase sometimes: Masters of the Universe. Understand that if \nthis legislation, as was proposed, were to become law, we would have \none single master of the universe, almost, the Secretary of Treasury.\n  I think this Congress has a responsibility here. I want to say that. \nI know now is not the time to go into a lot of detail, but I want to \nsay this Congress has a responsibility, and we are not free to dust our \nhands and say: Mr. Secretary, you have all the power you want to buy \nand sell private corporations, to spend up to $700 billion, and we are \nall going to be happy about it. We think you can fix it, and we will go \nhome and do our campaigning. I think we have a bigger responsibility \nthan that.\n  I wish to say--and I have great respect for Secretary Paulson, I do--\nI would want to know more about the nature of the crisis we are facing. \nI know we have a serious crisis. I wish to know why we cannot slow down \na little bit and think this thing through. That is the tradition of the \nSenate, the saucer that cools. But we are hearing: It is a crisis, and \nyou politicians will mess it up. Go on and get out of the way and vote \nthis thing out and we will take care of it. But that implicates the \nseparation of powers to an extraordinary degree and may well be adverse \nin the long run. The proposal certainly was not greeted by Wall Street \ntoday as an indication of a solid fix. The market dropped again, and \npeople apparently thought it would weaken the dollar and that is the \nreason oil prices increased. So this is a matter we need to think \nabout.\n\n  I urge my colleagues on the relevant committees and the leadership on \nthe Republican side in the Senate and the Democratic side: Let's not be \nstampeded here. Let's ask good questions. I am one who is not adverse \nto taking action, appropriate action, but I think we need to not be \nstampeded. It is a bit hubris to think one person can fix it all and \nsomehow that person can stand in the middle of all of the market forces \nand rebalance them. Do we believe in the market or not?\n  One socialist is reported to have said when asked: What is socialism: \nIt is the ability to control the commanding heights of the economy. \nWell, financial institutions are one commanding height of the economy. \nWho are we not giving control of that over to?\n  I think in a fundamental sense, the goals I believe we should have \nwould be first to protect the interests of the taxpayers before we \nspend in a manner of days an amount of money equal to and in excess of \nthe war in Iraq--almost one-third of our annual expenditures. Let's \nprotect the taxpayers. How do we do that? We need to find out more \nabout the problems. We are told there are grave problems, problems, \nproblems, and we have to act, act, act. Exactly what are those problems \nthat require us to act so fast?\n  Secondly, I think our action should be respectful of the marketplace, \nand let's try to do what would restore integrity in the marketplace. I \ndon't think it is necessary that we need more regulation as much as we \nneed better, more appropriate regulation. I would note that my \ncolleague, Senator Shelby, the ranking Republican on the Banking \nCommittee and former chairman, has fought for years to have more \ncontrol over Freddie and Fannie and their activities, as the Wall \nStreet Journal noted recently.\n  I urge my colleagues: Let's take some time. We got into this in large \npart by some bad government policies and actions. I think we can all \nadmit that. The government is going to have to take action. I recognize \nthat. But I think it is important that when we act on a matter of this \nsize and this importance, we take enough time to understand what is in \nit and do the right thing, not the political thing in this political \nseason.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to share those thoughts. I know \nthere are some fine Members of this Senate worried right now who are \nwrestling with these issues. I, for one, believe that maybe a little \nslower action, a little more thought, may turn out to be better in the \nlong run than a panicky response.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to call the attention of the Senate \nto the 40th anniversary of the leading Latino litigation, advocacy, \ncommunity education, and outreach organization in the United States. \nThe Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, MALDEF, \ncelebrates 40 years of\n\n[[Page S9192]]\n\nprotecting and promoting the civil rights of Latinos in the United \nStates.\n  MALDEF'S service to the Latino community is exemplary; they utilize \nmultiple strategies to foster sound public policies, laws, and programs \nthat secure the civil rights of Latinos. Their work on employment, \neducation, immigration, political access, language, and public resource \nequity issues is pivotal to the advancement and progress of the Latino \ncommunity in the United States.\n  Over its rich 40-year history, MALDEF has been led by some of the \nbest and brightest Hispanic leaders who paved the way for excellence in \nnonprofit leadership. Thanks to the fine leadership of Mario Obledo, \nMALDEF's first president and general counsel; Antonia Hernandez, who \nserved MALDEF for 23 years; and John Trasvina, MALDEF's current \npresident and general counsel, we have much to celebrate. MALDEF's \nleadership is heard throughout the nation from their headquarters in \nLos Angeles, to San Antonio, Chicago, Washington, DC, Houston, and \nSacramento.\n  During these especially hard times for our Latino brothers and \nsisters, when the anti-immigrant sentiment is at its highest, MALDEF \nhas been fighting to challenge breaches in voting rights, workplace \ndiscrimination, access to justice, and educational access. In 2006, \nMALDEF went before the U.S. Supreme Court and successfully challenged a \ncongressional redistricting plan that discriminated against Latino \nvoters in Texas. Most recently, MALDEF won a case that will require the \nTexas Education Agency to fix the State's English Language Learner, \nELL, programs in secondary schools and restore educational equity for \nour Latino students.\n  I commend the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund for \ntheir 40-year commitment to the Hispanic community. Their record of \nlegal representation, advocacy, and educational outreach has \nindisputably improved the quality of life and opportunities of all \nLatinos in the U.S. It is through the hard work of organizations like \nMALDEF that we will be able to overcome social and economic \ninequalities faced by Americans of different ethnic and racial \nbackgrounds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/22/senate-section/article/S9192-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RETIREMENT OF CHARLES MICHAEL ``MIKE'' NANNINI, JR.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my friend Charles \nMichael ``Mike'' Nannini, a dedicated public servant who retired last \nmonth after 16 years of service to Nevada as an Elko county \ncommissioner.\n  Mr. Nannini was first elected in 1992 and has since completed four \nterms as county commissioner for District 1. When he retired in August, \nMike was serving as the chair of the commission--a position he held \nnumerous times throughout his tenure.\n  A long-time resident of Nevada and a graduate of the University of \nNevada, Reno, Mike is a devoted and active member of his community. In \naddition to his time on the Elko County Commission, he has also served \non the Elko County Planning Commission and was mayor of Wells, NV. He \nhas contributed to Elko County as a 35-year business owner, a realtor, \nand a horse and cattle owner.\n  With an unyielding commitment to public safety, Mike served as the \nSheriff Department's liaison, fought to bring a juvenile justice \nfacility to Elko County, and served on the Central Dispatch \nAdministrative Authority board. He has also given his time as a U.S. \nForest Service and BLM Liaison, on the Metropolis Dam Rehabilitation \nboard, and as a board member for the Heart Project, a tire recycling \nproject.\n  Mike has also worked hard to bring the citizens of Elko County \ntogether--no matter how far-flung they may be. Good communication is \nessential in rural Nevada, and Mike made an effort to bridge gaps \nbetween larger communities and the outlying towns. As a part of this \nplan, he helped organize rural commission meetings so that the concerns \nof the unincorporated communities could be heard. Mike also served on \nthe Elko County Fair Board, and established the annual Elko County \nEmployee Picnic to recognize and thank county employees for their hard \nwork to support Elko County.\n  Elko County has prospered under Mike's leadership, and although he is \nretiring, the benefits of his service will be felt for years to come. \nOne of his long-held goals has been to see a new administration \nbuilding for the county, and ground was recently broken on this \nproject, which should be completed by 2011. Additionally, Mike \ncontinues to work on a project to restore the Bishop Creek Dam so that \nit may be used for recreational and agricultural needs in the county.\n  After many years of service, Mike will enjoy retirement with his wife \nLois and their children and grandchildren. I am grateful for his \nservice and proud to honor him and his achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/22/senate-section/article/S9192-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING HONOR FLIGHT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly about a \nspecial group of Kentuckians who visited our Nation's capitol last \nmonth. In August, 39 World War II veterans from the Commonwealth \nvisited the memorial which they inspired on the National Mall. These \nheroes were able to make this trip because of the Honor Flight Program, \na nonprofit organization which transports surviving World War II \nveterans from around the country to see their memorial free of charge. \nBecause Congress was out of session during their visit, I was back home \nin Kentucky. As a result, I was unable to participate in this Honor \nFlight event as I have in others before it. However, I hope to have the \nopportunity to meet more of these inspirational veterans on future \nBluegrass Honor Flight trips.\n  The World War II Memorial was dedicated in 2004, nearly 60 years \nafter our troops returned home. It sits, appropriately, between the \nWashington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial--reflecting the same \nprinciples of courage and valor that were embodied by these two great \nPresidents. The legacy of the World War II veterans who defended those \nprinciples from enemies of freedom is not only preserved by this \nmemorial, but it is honored each day in the sacrifices of American \ntroops who continue to do the same for our Nation in the war on terror.\n  As Americans, we are forever indebted to the brave men and women of \nthe United States military who defend this great Nation. The veterans \nof World War II made tremendous sacrifices so that we could continue to \nlive in prosperity and freedom and for that they are more than \ndeserving of their title as the ``greatest generation.''\n  I would ask that my colleagues join me in honoring these Kentucky \nveterans:\n\n                         World War II Veterans\n\n       Henry Alford; Salvator Amato; Fairel Bailey; Harlan Barton; \n     Woodrow Bryant; Wilbur Cannon; Charles Carveth; Clarence Cox; \n     Richard Dolan; Luther Drury; Francis Fleck; John Frantz; \n     William Glye; Sam Goldstein; Eugene Haag; James Harrison; \n     James Hunt; Paul Jones; James Lenihan; William Lippy.\n       Beverly Miller; Bobby Morgan; Ernest Morgan; James \n     Nicholson; Lewis Perciful; James Plummer; Carl Rapson; \n     Shirrelle Render; Harold Senior; Evan Shelby; Donald Stevens; \n     Wayne Tabor; Willard Thomas; Ernest Wagner; Phillip Wells; \n     James West, Jr.; Elmer Whitaker; Cecil Williams; Gilbert \n     Yunt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/22/senate-section/article/S9192-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9192-S9193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               INTERNET SERVICES USAGE RULES AND POLICIES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I want to take some time to remind our \ncolleagues, and indeed all Americans, that yesterday, September 21, \n2008, was the International Day of Peace. The United Nations and its \nmember states unanimously established an International Day of Peace in \n1981. However it was not until 2001 that September 21 was agreed to as \nthe permanent date. According to the U.N. resolution, the International \nDay of Peace should be devoted to commemorating and strengthening the \nideals of peace both within and among all nations and peoples. I \napplaud Governor Chet Culver for his proclamation affirming Iowa's \nobservance of International Peace Day. And, at this time, I would like \nto do my own part to mark this day, especially on the behalf of the \nmany Iowans who are committed to the ideals of peace.\n  Unfortunately, this may be International Peace Day, but sadly our \nleaders are faced with numerous challenges around the world that \nundermine the ideal of peace. The United States is in the sixth year of \na devastating war in Iraq, a war of choice that was launched \npreemptively by the current U.S. administration. The Middle East is in \nturmoil. We have an ongoing genocide in Darfur. A dictator still clings \nto power in Zimbabwe by indefinitely postponing, without explanation, \nscheduled meetings to discuss the implementation of a power-sharing \nagreement, despite the fanfare surrounding its signing. Russia \ncontinues its illegal presence in Georgia. HIV/AIDS and malaria \ncontinue to ravage the continent of Africa. Millions of children are \nforced to work in abusive conditions--in many cases, as outright \nslaves--and are denied an education. Drought and rising food prices are \ncausing even more hunger and famine in some of the world's poorest \nplaces.\n  But a true commitment to peace is not measured by a proclamation or \nby high-minded speeches on 1 day of the year. It takes more than good \nintentions and high ideals. What it takes is the hard work of \ndiplomacy, people-to-people exchanges, and active, assertive peace \nmovements in each country.\n  I agree whole-heartedly with recent remarks made by Secretary of \nDefense Robert Gates. He said our institutions of diplomacy and \ndevelopment have\n\n[[Page S9194]]\n\nbeen chronically undermanned and underfunded relative to our military \nexpenditure. I came across a sobering statistic along these lines just \nthe other day. In this country we have more musicians in military bands \nthan we do members of the Foreign Service.\n  What are our priorities? We spend nearly $1 billion a year on \nmilitary academies to train our best and brightest young people to make \nwar. But we spend almost nothing to train our cadre of diplomats to use \ndiplomacy to strengthen peace around the world.\n  Mr. President, I have long been committed to finding peaceful \nsolutions to conflicts. That is why I was present at the creation of \nthe U.S. Institute of Peace. Throughout our long history, America has \nbeen proud of its strong, well-led military. And this outstanding \nmilitary leadership is no accident. It is possible because we maintain \nprestigious, world-class military academies that train some of the best \nand brightest minds in America in the art and science of war.\n  But Americans also have a long history as a peace-loving people. Time \nand again, we have brokered peace agreements between warring nations, \nand we have intervened to head off potential conflicts. The Institute \nof Peace draws on this proud tradition and today makes a vital \nintellectual investment in the art and science of peacemaking by \nengaging with the Iraqi people to build peace from the community level.\n  Addressing worldwide hunger is crucial for ensuring the health of \npeople in developing countries and maintaining peace throughout the \nworld. The U.S. is a major contributor to international food aid by \nproviding, on average for the last 6 years, roughly 55 percent of \nannual total food aid provided to low-income and developing countries. \nI believe we can still do more. That is why I worked hard to strengthen \nfood aid programs in the 2002 and 2008 farm bills and continue to \nsupport expansion of our food aid efforts.\n  During my tenure in the Senate, I have consistently championed food \naid programs such as Public Law 480, title II, also known as the Food \nfor Peace Program. Title II is extremely important in providing U.S. \nfood developing countries meet humanitarian needs arising from \nemergencies or for use in development projects.\n  I am also a strong advocate and was a lead sponsor of the McGovern-\nDole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program \nestablished in the 2002 farm bill, which was reauthorized in the 2008 \nfarm bill. The McGovern-Dole program encourages education and provides \nfood to improve nutrition in developing countries for preschoolers and \nschool-aged children and their families through the use of both in-\nschool programs and take-home rations. I believe that it is essential \nto fully fund food aid programs which help to promote a safe and \nhealthy diet for people in developing countries, and will ultimately \nmake the world a safer place to live.\n  America is strongest when we lead not by force of arms but by our \ndemocratic and moral example. It takes a sustained effort to understand \nour adversaries and, if at all possible, to resolve our differences \npeacefully. The International Day of Peace allows people to think about \nredoubling our diplomatic efforts and reducing violence.\n  I look forward to a time, hopefully not too far in the future, that \nwill truly be a day of peace. But let us remember that peace is not \nmerely the cessation or absence of hostilities. The ideals of peace \nrequire us to practice understanding, tolerance, and honorable \ncompromise. The ideals of peace require us to look upon our fellow \nhuman beings and to see them as our brothers and sisters. The ideals of \npeace require us to reject unprovoked aggression and violence as \nacceptable instruments of national policy.\n  So, Mr. President, on this day after the International Day of Peace, \nI salute the many good people in Iowa, across America, and around the \nworld who devote themselves 365 days a year to the cause of peace and \nnonviolence. The world is a better place because of their activism and \nengagement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/22/senate-section/article/S9194-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9194-S9196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate\n.gov to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be \neasily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nthat today's letters be printed in the Record.\n       You asked for comments on how the fuel costs have affected \n     me. It has been good for my health. The high fuel prices have \n     gotten me back on my bicycle, and I am enjoying it very much. \n     I put baskets on my bike to carry supplies and groceries, and \n     it works very well. When I see people driving three or four \n     blocks to get coffee or ice cream or beer or whatever, and \n     then listen to them complain about how much fuel costs them, \n     I have a hard time with that. I drive a lot less than I used \n     to, and am hoping the rest of the country will follow suite. \n     I turned my thermostat down this past winter, and my bills \n     went down even with rising costs. Putting a sweater on is \n     easy. As people comment when they see my baskets full of \n     groceries, most of them say they should do that. I am \n     wondering why they are not. Instead they go to the gym and \n     burn gas getting there and back to get a workout. Why not \n     walk or ride a bike? Hopefully, folks will start thinking \n     about how far away their job is and try to live within a \n     short commute or bike ride away. There are lots of things \n     people can do to consume less. More public transportation is \n     a must and would be a lot cheaper in more ways than one, than \n     more nuclear power plants. More bike-friendly places and bike \n     paths would get people riding. The communities/cities of \n     Idaho would be a much better place to live that have walk/\n     bike friendly road/ shoulders. So this is how high fuel \n     prices have affected me in Idaho. We all need to get out of \n     our cars and enjoy the scenery!\n           Thanks,\n     Lynn, Rathdrum.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am an owner/operator truck driver. It is getting real \n     hard to make a living out here on the road. The price of fuel \n     is almost to the point of shutting this country down. I have \n     just a few more payments left on my truck . At this point, I \n     cannot make a full payment on my truck each month. So it is \n     going to take even longer to get the job done. When I get the \n     truck paid off, I am afraid, like many others, I will have to \n     park my truck. I cannot haul freight for nothing. I do not \n     enjoy it that much. I use to stay out 4-6 weeks at a time; \n     now, I have to stay out 2 months or longer and still cannot \n     keep the payments caught up. But I am so exhausted that I \n     have to take a few days off. This only makes me farther \n     behind. Thanks for the help!\n     Danny.\n                                  ____\n\n       Almost half our state of Idaho is rural, and much is in BLM \n     Land. So, to get to Idaho cities requires driving long \n     stretches of highway or two-lane roads. I have to drive to \n     Garden Valley every weekend from Boise, and sometimes I have \n     to go there two or three times per week. At 60 miles one way \n     and 120 miles roundtrip, we have seen our gasoline bill \n     nearly double. Next to our mortgage payment, gasoline expense \n     has become our second highest cost in our household. I get \n     raises very infrequently, so this has shot our budget. We do \n     not shop as much and we have stopped going out to eat or go \n     to any entertainment. This, in turn, has hurt our economy.\n       I listened to the Governor of Montana say he has enough \n     coal and oil along with the major oil finds in the Dakotas to \n     virtually replace the dependence we are placing on foreign \n     energy, but our own red tape has hamstrung our domestic \n     energy companies from developing these resources. Why? It is \n     past time to drill in ANWR. Let us get that rolling now--we \n     have better technology to minimize the environmental impact \n     than any other nation on earth. The time is ripe to even \n     consider re-introducing the 55 MPH speed limit again. I am \n     ready to vote for nationalizing oil, natural gas, and \n     electricity. These three resources have got to be stabilized \n     for our nation to stay in good economic health. By not \n     stabilizing these three resources, we are headed for economic \n     ruin.\n       Right now, corn is up so high for the ethanol that farmers \n     are producing that they are not selling corn for food. Cattle \n     are not getting enough feed to eat, so ranchers are planning \n     to mass sell off their herds, which will temporarily glut the \n     marketplace then beef will soar in cost. Our airplane and \n     automotive situation has nosedived, and the vacation industry \n     is failing. Private truckers are parking their rigs and even \n     selling them to Russia, so when gas and diesel prices come \n     down, the trucking industry will not recover. Of course, the \n     housing market is dying with the subprime mortgage mess, and \n     banks do not have the necessary reserves on hand to even lend \n     more money though the Fed has lowered the interest rates to \n     2%.\n       Frankly, unless some or all of the oil and natural gas \n     industry is immediately nationalized, I fear we are \n     economically doomed\n\n[[Page S9195]]\n\n     and will lead the whole world into an economic recession/\n     depression. Please kill any legislation regarding carbon \n     capping. There is no way there is enough CO2 in \n     the world to cause global warming. With CO2 only \n     comprising .05% of the atmosphere, even doubling, tripling, \n     its concentration will not cause global warming, but sunspot \n     flare activity surely can and does cause global warming. Over \n     21,000 scientists now agree this is true versus 2,500 who \n     disagree. We have got to wake up and take action together. \n     Thanks for asking for our opinion.\n     Herman.\n                                  ____\n\n       If the U.S. government reduced some of the huge amounts of \n     oil held in reserve, the price of oil would immediately fall. \n     I just cannot understand why such action has not been taken \n     and can only conclude that [partisan or illegal actions may \n     be behind the price fixing.]\n           Regards,\n     Bill.\n                                  ____\n\n       As a single father and college student, I pay over $500 per \n     month in child support. I am barely making it and I depend on \n     student loans to even survive. I cannot afford to be paying \n     outrageous prices for gas. I have errands to run everyday. If \n     this continues, I do not know what I can do to keep a roof \n     over my head and feed my children when I have them. Please, \n     we cannot ignore this price gouging.\n     Doug.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thanks, Senator Crapo, for this opportunity to share my \n     opinions and stories about the high cost of fuels and how it \n     is affecting my immediate family.\n       Two weeks ago, my husband finally broke down and called our \n     fuel oil dealer to order 100 gallons of stove oil. It has \n     been a cool spring. We have been wearing extra sweaters and \n     jackets to be warm inside our home! The price for that was \n     $450, and that did not fill up our tank. This is the end of \n     winter; what is stove oil going to cost in the fall, next \n     winter? Not so long ago stove oil was pennies on the dollar. \n     We used to burn wood, but it also takes gas for the chainsaw \n     and truck to haul it home. You also have to buy a permit to \n     gather the wood. It is no longer free! My Social Security \n     check is $515 a month. I live 16 miles to our nearest town, \n     42 miles to Couer d' Alene, our county seat where we conduct \n     a lot of our business. There is no public transportation to \n     anywhere I live.\n       People in the East have no concept of the distance to \n     places in the West!!! Back there you can visit several states \n     and we are still on our way to Boise when they have come and \n     gone to their state capitol and perhaps 5 or six bordering \n     states. Boise is 400 miles south on what is referred to as \n     the ``Goat Trail''. It is about an eight-hour trip by car. \n     Folks, it is no freeway. North Idaho's freeway is I-90 & it \n     is 75 miles wide. That is the width of the panhandle there.\n       We have driven the most economical car possible since 1985 \n     when Chevrolet came out with the Chevy Sprint that \n     consistently gives about 45 miles to the gallon. It is a 3-\n     cylinder car that is great for commuting, but it is no luxury \n     car. Our second car is a 1996 Subaru Legacy Outback. It \n     carries a month's worth of groceries and other supplies. It \n     also brings us to the top of the hill we live on when there \n     is lots of snow on the ground.\n       Chevrolet first came out with the Sprint, then the Geo and \n     now the Aveno (?I believe it is called). Each model the gas \n     mileage has decreased significantly. In our area, doctors and \n     dentists are driving them for the gas mileage, not for their \n     luxury. You see, it is affecting the professionals too!\n       I feel that the car companies and oil companies are in \n     cahoots to keep the gas flowing when they can and have \n     designed fuel efficient vehicles for the modern day public. \n     Take the time to view the DVD, ``Who Killed the Electric \n     Car?'' It tells what happened to the electric car. It is \n     available in the Kootenai/Shoshone public library system.\n       General Motors developed an electric car in the late '90's, \n     2000's that was leased to drivers in California. Each driver \n     loved their car. Had fun with it and it was economical to \n     drive with rechargeable batteries. Some models even recharged \n     as they were driven. They did not even need to be parked to \n     be recharged. They were economical, easy to maintain and \n     sensible to drive. What happened to them? They were taken \n     away from the drivers/leasee & destroyed/crushed!!!! And that \n     under much protest!\n       Some of these things we've done to ourselves, but other \n     things the American public does not have many choices when it \n     comes to what we drive. I will tell you this all these SUV's \n     on the highway are a disgrace to economy. And legislation was \n     giving a tax break if you went out and purchased one a few \n     years ago. Tell me, what kind of economic sense does that \n     make??? They're just a pack of gas guzzlers!!!\n       Thanks again for the opportunity to sound off a bit!\n     Tiffany, St. Maries.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am 63-years-old and last year, right before the prices \n     went out of control, already had purchased an electric bike \n     to use to get to work. Fortunately, I only live a little over \n     a mile away and can use this bike that goes 15 miles an hour. \n     My determination to ride this bike increased as the hot days \n     turned into colder ones and I was able to ride my bike \n     through November so I would not have to fill the pick-up with \n     gas too much. Government wants us to recycle to help the \n     environment and I am all for it, but when we try to do our \n     part, we do not get any help in return. If you do get an \n     electric car which no one can afford but the wealthy.\n       I see my single parent daughter trying to commute and make \n     ends meet and it gets increasingly difficult because with gas \n     prices she goes with less food for family, etc.\n       I think it is outrageous for our country and politicians to \n     allow these price increases when we have the means to take \n     care of this country. Twenty years ago they spoke of getting \n     alternatives and did not push this issue and had they done so \n     much more could have been done. I am afraid that before long \n     we will see violence in this country mainly because our jobs \n     are gone, price increases in every area of products, but no \n     one ever increases the wages to meet the demands of other \n     increase. What is the matter with people in government and \n     businesses?\n       I do not like to see government control but because our \n     business people will not use common sense to see what happens \n     when the jobs go there is not sufficient jobs to go and buy \n     the products. What is wrong with this picture? We need to \n     start taxing products from overseas that come here so \n     businesses will come back to the states and put our people \n     back to work. How sad our government has deserted their own \n     people.\n       I am hoping with all my heart that someone will step up to \n     the plate and really try to make a difference. We have to do \n     something as everything is getting out of control and it is \n     sad because of what our forefathers have tried to do before \n     us to make it a great country. I am angry and I do not like \n     politics, but when I see people trying to do well for their \n     families and that means is taken away from them, someone \n     needs to speak up.\n     Devera, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       I appreciate the help trying to keep energy prices at a \n     manageable level. As a lifelong Idahoan, I have grown \n     accustomed to the Idaho way of life. I travel to the same \n     hunting and fishing grounds that my father and my grandfather \n     have previously shown me, teaching my kids to enjoy what our \n     state has to offer. I am a married father of three kids, \n     hoping for a couple more. I work as an accountant and, for \n     the last two-and-a-half half years, my wife has stayed home \n     to raise our kids. It was a giant leap of faith for us to go \n     from two incomes down to one. We sacrificed a lot of the \n     little luxuries but have been blessed by being able to teach \n     our kids. As a result, my eldest daughter, who is in second \n     grade, has excelled in school. She and her siblings love to \n     learn. As the general costs of living have increased, I made \n     the decision to pick up a paper route to help build our \n     savings. I spent many years in college before finally \n     graduating from BSU in 2005. Our savings was depleted. Just \n     as we thought we were going to get ahead, the gas prices \n     started going up. The speed at which they increased has not \n     allowed wages to follow. I still throw papers, but the amount \n     of money I can earn is much lower. My route requires me \n     driving over 40 miles each day. This is on top of my 17-mile \n     each way commute to work. There is little to no public \n     transportation here, and my commute is a bit longer than a \n     bike ride. Cost of living has risen dramatically requiring me \n     to use the money earned from newspaper delivery to help \n     supplement our budget to pay bills. Travel plans this spring \n     and summer have been canceled due to the price of fuel. The \n     number of trips I will be able to take to get in some fly \n     fishing will be cut as well. What I would like to see is a \n     short term help but long term solution. While an increase in \n     domestic supply will begin to stabilize prices, it will not \n     be a long term solution due to the volatile OPEC. We need \n     alternative energy solutions and an increase in public \n     transportation. I hope that our countries leaders can keep an \n     open eye to all sources of power. INL has long been a great \n     source for nuclear power but it seems that too many people \n     are scared to work with. The Integral Fast Reactor was shut \n     down during the Clinton era and years of technology was lost. \n     We must find a better solution.\n     Joe, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I work in Hailey, which is a commute of 150 miles each work \n     day. It now costs me in excess of one hour of my wages to \n     make the drive. My gasoline costs are around $800 per month. \n     We heat our house with oil and it now costs us right at \n     $1,000 to fill our 250-gallon barrel. We cannot afford to \n     take a vacation because of the fuel, motel, and food prices. \n     My wife and I find this quite disheartening.\n       I would really like to see the United States become energy \n     self-sufficient. I know the technology is available to help \n     us get their let us offer entrepreneurs incentives to \n     accomplish this. If Congress would make all cars sold in the \n     U.S. flex fuel cars, this would drive the alternative fuel \n     market into production. If Congress would require that all \n     new cars meet the fuel economy requirements that are \n     scheduled for 2020 become a requirement by 2010, this would \n     also help. If Congress would take control over fuel and \n     energy futures trading, this would also help. Thank Congress \n     for taking away the incentives to the fuel producers.\n       We put a man on the moon in less that a decade, so I truly \n     believe we can become self sufficient if we put our minds and \n     hearts toward this goal.\n           Sincerely,\n     Walt, Kimberly.\n                                  ____\n\n       I live ten miles from town. I moved to this location for \n     solitude several years ago. Because of the greed of the \n     petroleum industry, I am to the point that I cannot take my \n     handicapped wife for a weekend drive. My\n\n[[Page S9196]]\n\n     propane heating bill has doubled since last year. If this \n     greed continues, I will have to make a choice of what I can \n     buy with the income that I have. Do I buy fuel so I can take \n     my wife to her doctors, some of which are located in \n     Lewiston, 55 miles from our house, or drive the ten miles to \n     town to get her much-needed medicine, get groceries, which we \n     cannot buy like we used to, or pay the ever-increasing \n     heating bill from this past winter?\n       There are reason why the cost of fuel are on a continuing \n     on this outragest rise. Refineries are not at capacity; there \n     are no new refineries; the environmentalists, with the help \n     of their liberal judges, stop any new drilling for oil; pure \n     greed by the petroleum industry. Whenever there is a new \n     development to increase fuel mileage, the petroleum industry \n     buys up the patents and kills them.\n     Wendell, Orofino.\n                                  ____\n\n       I cannot understand why Congress cannot see the need to \n     allow the United States to access more of our own energy \n     sources. Yes, we need new alternative fuels, but we also need \n     to become more realistic about our solutions to the energy \n     crisis. We need to combine research AND start making use of \n     our own current oil supplies. We need to start drilling in \n     the locations where oil has already been discovered. Why has \n     Congress ridiculed President Bush when he asked the Saudis to \n     produce more oil when Congress refused to do the same right \n     in our own country? He did ask Congress first. I would also \n     like to see the Congressmen invite the scientists who do not \n     agree with man-made global warming to testify and bring their \n     facts forward. Forming an energy policy on an unproven crisis \n     does not make much sense.\n     Gloria.\n                                  ____\n\n       I drive 80 miles a day round trip to work in the Sun Valley \n     area from Fairfield. ``Real'' people cannot afford to live \n     within 30 miles of the Hailey/Sun Valley area due to \n     exorbitant house prices, so the local economy is dependent on \n     those who will drive from outlying areas.

Mr. President, today I commend James Ketelsen for \nhis vision and commitment to transforming the hopes of tens of \nthousands of students and families across the country through Project \nGRAD, an education reform program that he started when he was chairman \nand CEO of Tenneco in Houston, TX. Project GRAD has helped these \nstudents realize their academic potential and many of them have \ncompleted their college education with the assistance of Project GRAD \nscholarships and mentoring support from Project GRAD staff.\n  Project GRAD evolved from a scholarship program that began under Mr. \nKetelsen's leadership at Tenneco. In 1988, the company began to fund a \n4-year scholarship program for eligible graduates of Davis High School, \nat the time Houston's lowest-performing high school. By 1992, the \nnumber of Davis graduates entering college had more than quadrupled. \nStill, high school graduation rates and college matriculation rates \ncontinued to fall short of Mr. Ketelsen's expectations. He believed \nthat Davis students--and all students from economically disadvantaged \ncommunities--were capable of much more if given the right investments \nand the right commitment. ``It's not the kids!'' he insisted. Armed \nwith that belief, Mr. Ketelsen has dedicated the last two decades to \nmaking an enormous difference for America's highest needs students.\n  Today, Project GRAD has expanded to 13 communities and reaches more \nthan 120,000 students and families from California to New York, Alaska \nto Georgia. In the longest-served group of schools, GRAD scholars are \ncompleting college at a rate 92 percent above the national average for \nstudents from similar demographic backgrounds. A statistically \nsignificant sample of GRAD scholarship recipients who have completed \ncollege shows that the proportion who graduated with majors in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics--concentrations of dire need \nfor the national economy and national security--exceeded the national \naverage for minority students by 71 percent. In the coming academic \nyear, more than 7,500 students will attend college, funded by a Project \nGRAD scholarship. GRAD has already sent high school graduates to more \nthan 100 institutions of higher education, including many of the most \nhighly selective colleges and universities in the Nation. At the \nbeginning of high school, many Project GRAD students would never have \ndreamed of attending Rice, the University of Texas, Texas A & M, \nHarvard, Yale, MIT, Cornell, Emory, Georgetown, or the University of \nVirginia. Yet, Mr. Ketelsen's Texas-sized vision, determination, and \nremarkable leadership of Project GRAD have transformed those \nexpectations.\n  I am grateful for the energy and enthusiasm with which Mr Ketelsen \nhas served America's children and families. Recently, Mr. Ketelsen \nannounced his decision to step down from his post as chairman of the \nboard of directors for Project GRAD USA. Although he is retiring from \nProject GRAD USA, he plans to remain active with the Houston chapter of \nProject GRAD. I join with my colleagues in saluting James Ketelsen for \nhis efforts to improve education and career opportunities for children \nin inner-city schools. The return on his investment in education will \ncontinue for generations to come. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/22/senate-section/article/S9196-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9196-S9197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A-H-S-T COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, in Iowa and across the United \nStates, a new school year has begun. As you know, Iowa public schools \nhave an excellent reputation nationwide, and Iowa students' test scores \nare among the highest in the Nation.\n  I would like to take just a few minutes, today, to salute the \ndedicated teachers, administrators, and school board members in the \nLinn-Mar Community School District, and to report on their \nparticipation in a unique Federal partnership to repair and modernize \nschool facilities.\n  This fall marks the 10th year of the Iowa Demonstration Construction \nGrant Program. That is its formal name, but it is better known among \neducators in Iowa as the program of Harkin grants for Iowa public \nschools. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 \nmillion for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school \ndistricts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools or renovating existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal \nfunding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it \noften has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.\n  The Linn-Mar Community School District received five Harkin grants \ntotaling $1,625,000. A 2000 construction grant for $500,000 was used to \nhelp renovate Bowman Woods Elementary\n\n[[Page S9199]]\n\nSchool to provide space for a media center, a 2002 construction grant \nfor $200,000 was used to provide classrooms for the Little Lions \npreschool at a new K-8 school and a 2005 construction grant for \n$500,000 was used to help build Linn Grove Elementary School. These \nschools are the modern, state-of-the-art facilities that befit the \neducational ambitions and excellence of this school district. Indeed, \nthey are the kind of schools that every child in America deserves. The \ndistrict also received two fire safety grants totaling $425,000 to \ninstall sprinkler systems at Excelsior Middle School and Linn-Mar High \nSchool.\n  Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. \nThey are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a \ntremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned \ncitizens. I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance in \nthe Linn-Mar Community School District. In particular, I would like to \nrecognize the leadership of the board of education--president Robert \nCrawford, vice president Ann Stark, Barry Buchholz, Bob Gilchrist, \nDavid Nicholson, Jim Green, Erik Miles and Helen Romanowsky and former \nboard members Swati Dandekar, Mark Klopfenstein, Tom Manor, David \nMeyer, Tom Miller, Lorna Richards and Steve Colton. I would also like \nto recognize superintendent Dr. Kathleen Mulholland, former \nsuperintendent Dr. Joe Pacha, business administrator Dave Nicholson, \nformer business administrator Dave DeWall, and principals Dona Miller, \nKent Stock, Dan Ludwig, Shannon Bisgard, Dr. Marc McCoy and Jerry \nVanDyke.\n  As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin school grant program in \nIowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings \nand facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation \nor replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, \nsome 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The \nharsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United \nStates is nearly 50 years.\n  Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming \nsports arenas on weekends, but during the week go to school in rundown \nor antiquated facilities. This sends exactly the wrong message to our \nyoung people about our priorities. We have to do better.\n  That is why I am deeply grateful to the professionals and parents in \nthe Linn-Mar Community School District.

A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2010 \nthrough 2014 to provide assistance to foreign countries to promote food \nsecurity, to stimulate rural economies, and to improve emergency \nresponse to food crises, to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased today to announce the \nintroduction of the Global Food Security Act of 2008. I would like to \nthank my friend Senator Casey for lending his ideas and support to this \nbipartisan effort. I also thank USAID Administrator Henrietta Fore, who \ntook an early interest in potential legislation. Her leadership is very \nmuch appreciated. Finally, I want to thank the members of USAID's \ninformal food security team, who advised us on problems and possible \nlegislative solutions.\n  As we know, food prices started a steep climb in the fall of 2007 and \ncontinued to increase during the spring of this year. The crisis has \nabated somewhat, largely due to the drop in energy prices. Nonetheless, \nthis episode demonstrated that there are significant structural \nchallenges to attaining global food security. The system is vulnerable \nto periodic disruptions that both expose and exacerbate deeper \nproblems.\n  We live in a world where nearly 1 billion people suffer from chronic \nfood insecurity. When droughts occur, hurricanes hit, or other \ndisruptions arise, transitory food insecurity can put as many as 100 \nmillion people at a time in grave danger. In fact, the World Food \nProgram reports that 25,000 people die each day from malnutrition-\nrelated causes. Health experts advise us that a diverse and secure food \nsupply has major health benefits, including increasing child survival, \nimproving cognitive and physical development of children, and \nincreasing immune system function including resistance to HIV/AIDS.\n  Food insecurity is a global tragedy, but it is also an opportunity \nfor the U.S. The U.S. is the indisputable world leader in agricultural \nproduction and technology. A more focused effort on our part to join \nwith other nations to increase yields, improve food distribution, and \nbroaden agricultural knowledge could begin a new era in U.S. diplomacy. \nSuch an effort could solidify relationships with nations where, up to \nnow, we have had few positive contacts. It could improve our broader \ntrade relations and serve as a model for similar endeavors in the areas \nof energy and scientific cooperation. Achieving food security for all \npeople also would have profound implications for peace and U.S. \nnational security. Hungry people are desperate people, and desperation \noften sows the seeds of conflict and extremism.\n  The U.S. has always stood for big ideas--from the founding of the \nRepublic on the basis of freedom to President Kennedy's vow to put a \nman on the moon. One of today's big ideas should be the eradication of \nhunger. We can bring America's dedication to science, innovation, \ntechnology, and education together to lead an effort devoted to \novercoming the obstacles to food security.\n  The Global Food Security Act of 2008, is a 5-year authorization that \nseeks to provide solutions that will have the greatest effect. First, \nit creates a Special Coordinator for Global Food Security and puts that \nperson in charge of developing a food security strategy. We call on the \ndevelopment of that strategy to take a whole-of-government approach and \nto work with other international donors, the NGO community, and the \nprivate sector.\n  Second, the bill authorizes additional resources for agricultural \nproductivity and rural development. U.S. foreign assistance for \nagriculture has declined by nearly 70 percent since the 1980s. \nGlobally, only four percent of official development assistance from all \ndonors is allocated for agriculture. This amounts to neglect of what \nshould be considered one of the most vital sectors in the alleviation \nof poverty. Food shortages are likely to recur frequently if the U.S. \nand the global community fail to invest in agricultural productivity in \nthe developing world.\n  World leaders must understand that over the long term, satisfying \nglobal demand for more and better food can be achieved only by \nincreasing yields per acre. In the 1930s, my father, Marvin Lugar, \nproduced corn yields of approximately 40 to 50 bushels per acre. Today, \nthe Lugar farm yields about 150 bushels per acre on the same land in \nMarion County, IN. The Green Revolution, from 1965 to 1985, saw the \nintroduction of high yield seeds and improved agricultural techniques \nthat resulted in a near doubling of cereal grain production per acre \nover 20 years. But yields may have to be doubled or tripled again.\n  Increasing acreage under production will not satisfy the growth in \nfood demand, and these steps come with serious environmental and \nnational security costs. We need a second green revolution that will \nbenefit developed and developing nations alike.\n  Recent studies have demonstrated that funds spent in agriculture can \nbe\n\n[[Page S9207]]\n\nup to four times more beneficial to economic growth than spending in \nother areas. It seems, therefore, that our overall foreign aid strategy \nwould benefit from restoring agriculture programs to their former \nprominence. The bill increases funding for these programs in the first \nyear by $750 million. The increase would reach $2.5 billion in year 5. \nBecause those who subsist on less than one dollar a day spend at least \nhalf their incomes on food, according to the International Food Policy \nResearch Institute, the bill highlights the need to focus on those \nliving in extreme poverty.\n  In thinking about how to approach agricultural productivity, we tried \nto draw from the experience of U.S. land grant colleges and the \ncontributions they have made to U.S. agriculture. The bill creates a \nnew program that would strengthen institutions of higher education in \nthe areas of agriculture sciences, research and extension programs. \nInvestments in human capital and institutional capacity are important \nto developing a robust agricultural sector.\n  Universities and research centers can play an important role in \nachieving technological advances that are appropriate to local \nconditions. As such, the bill calls for increasing collaborative \nresearch on the full range of biotechnological advances including \ngenetically modified technologies.\n  Third, the bill improves the U.S. emergency response to food crises \nby creating a separate Emergency Food Assistance Fund that can make \nlocal and regional purchases of food, where appropriate. Funds can be \nused for emergency food and agricultural assistance. The Government \nAccountability Office reports that it can often take 4 to 6 months from \nthe time a crisis occurs until U.S. food shipments arrive. Our \nintention is to provide USAID with the flexibility to respond to \nemergencies more quickly, without supplanting other food programs such \nas P.L. 480.\n  I hope that our bill will begin a productive dialogue on how our \ngovernment can be a more effective partner with NGO and private actors \nin promoting food security. There is no good reason why nearly a \nbillion people should be food insecure or that the world should have to \nendure the social upheaval and risks of conflict that this insecurity \ncauses.\n  I look forward to working with colleagues to improve the U.S. and \nglobal efforts to alleviate food insecurity and advance agricultural \nknowledge and technology worldwide.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3529\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nearly 1,000,000,000 people worldwide suffer from food \n     insecurity, defined as a lack of access to sufficient food to \n     meet dietary needs for an active and healthy life.\n       (2) The number of food insecure increased from 849,000,000 \n     in 2006 to 982,000,000 in 2007.\n       (3) The World Food Programme reports that 25,000 people die \n     each day from malnutrition-related causes.\n       (4) The food security situation of lower income countries \n     is projected to continue to deteriorate over the next decade.\n       (5) Nearly half of the world's food insecure live in Sub-\n     Saharan Africa.\n       (6) The agricultural sector comprises large portions of the \n     total labor force in many developing countries, as high as 70 \n     to 80 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it also \n     contributes about 35 percent of the total gross national \n     product (GDP).\n       (7) Agriculture has been shown to be an efficient engine of \n     economic growth in developing countries.\n       (8) A diverse and secure food supply has health benefits, \n     including increasing child survival, improving cognitive and \n     physical development of children, and increasing immune \n     system function including resistance to HIV/AIDS.\n       (9) Rapid increases in global food costs since 2007 \n     threaten to significantly undermine gains achieved in poverty \n     reduction and health programs.\n       (10) The poor in developing countries spend as much as 50 \n     to 70 percent of their incomes on food.\n       (11) Three out of five of those suffering from hunger are \n     rural small-scale agricultural families. One out of five is a \n     rural landless laborer, and another one-fifth are urban poor, \n     according to the United Nations Hunger Task Force.\n       (12) A comprehensive approach to food security should \n     encompass improvements in nutrition, education, agricultural \n     infrastructure and productivity, finance and markets, safety \n     net programs, household incomes, and emergency preparedness.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to establish the standard mileage rate \nfor use of a passenger automobile for purposes of the charitable \ncontributions deduction and to exclude charitable mileage \nreimbursements from gross income; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, the \nGiving Incentives to Volunteers Everywhere Act. In today's economic \nclimate, Americans need relief from sky-rocketing oil and gas prices. \nThis applies to everyone, including people who engage in much-needed \nvolunteer work. In July, I introduced a similar bill to help \nvolunteers. It gave the Internal Revenue Service authority to change \nthe mileage rate--currently set by statute at 14 cents per mile--for \ncalculating the deductible cost of operating a vehicle for charitable \npurposes. We can't let an out-of-date mileage rate exacerbate the pinch \nat the pump for volunteers who selflessly provide so many vital goods \nand services in every community across America. After working with \nCongressman Lewis and Congressman Ramstad on compromise language we \nhave improved the original bill. This compromise legislation will \nprovide immediate relief for volunteers serving our elderly, poor, \nfrail, and at-risk Americans. I am pleased that the\n\n[[Page S9210]]\n\nsenior Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, and my other colleagues, the \nsenior Senator from New York, Senator Schumer, the junior Senator from \nNevada, Senator Ensign, the senior Senator from Maryland, Senator \nMikulski, and the senior Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, and the \njunior Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, are original \ncosponsors of this bill and I thank all of them for their support.\n  The Internal Revenue Code does not fix a rate for individuals who are \nrequired to use their own vehicle for work, or for individuals taking a \nmileage deduction for moving purposes. The IRS is able to increase the \ndeduction amount for these purposes to reflect the current economic \nclimate and dramatically higher fuel prices. This is exactly what the \nIRS recently did.\n  As of July 1st, the IRS modified the standard mileage rates for \ncomputing the deductible costs of operating an automobile for business, \nmedical, or moving expenses. The revised standard mileage rate for \nbusiness purposes increased from 50.5 cents per mile to 58.5 cents. For \nmedical and moving expenses, the IRS increased the rate from 19 cents \nper mile to 27 cents per mile. I think the Nation's volunteers who \ntravel on behalf of charitable organizations deserve an increase in \ntheir mileage rate, too.\n  My bill gives the IRS flexibility in setting the rate so that \nvolunteers for charitable organizations could be given the same tax \nbenefit accruing for moving, medical, and business expenses. It also \nprovides a floor for volunteers, not allowing their rate to be set \nlower than moving and medical rate. In today's climate of increasing \nfood and fuel prices, this bill will help relieve some of the pressure \non charitable organizations and their volunteers. Additionally, this \nbill will allow the organization to reimburse the volunteer up to the \nbusiness rate without any tax impact to volunteers.\n  Take Meals on Wheels, for example. This organization delivers \nnutritious meals and other nutrition services to men and women who are \nelderly, homebound, disabled, frail, or otherwise at-risk. The services \nMeals on Wheels provides significantly improve the recipients' quality \nof life and health, and often help to postpone institutionalization.\n  Over the past year, there has been nearly a 20 percent increase in \nfuel and food prices, coupled with reduced Government funding and fewer \ndonations across the country. Nearly 60 percent of the estimated 5,000 \nprograms that operate under the auspices of the Meals on Wheels \nAssociation of America have lost volunteers, in large part because it \nis too expensive for the volunteers to drive back and forth. Nearly \nhalf the programs have eliminated routes or consolidated meal services. \nAbout 38 percent of the programs have switched to delivering frozen \nmeals, and about 30 percent are cutting personal visits from 5 days a \nweek to one.\n  In Maryland, the Central Maryland Meals on Wheels has experienced an \nincrease of 7 percent in food costs and suppliers are charging higher \ndelivery fees. The cost to fill up the vans with gas has increased. \nFuel costs averaged $72,538.70 in fiscal year 2007; this year, the \ncosts have jumped to $86,790.63. This is an organization with \nvolunteers serving over 3,100 elderly, disabled, frail and at-risk \nMarylanders.

A bill to provide for the expansion of Federal programs to \nprevent and manage vision loss, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Vision \nPreservation Act of 2008 with my colleague Sen. George Voinovich. The \ngoal of this legislation is to help Americans avoid the personal \ntragedy of unnecessary, preventable vision loss. This important \nlegislation is supported by Prevent Blindness America, the American \nFoundation for the Blind, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, and \nthe American Optometric Association\n  Right now there are an estimated 80 million Americans suffering from \npotentially blinding eye disease. Three million more Americans struggle \nwith low vision. 1.1 million more are legally blind. Glaucoma, diabetic \nretinopathy, cataract and age-related macular degeneration, AMD, and \nother vision problems are costing tens of thousands of people in the \nUnited States their ability to see each year. With the aging baby boom \ngeneration moving toward retirement age, these numbers are expected to \ngrow considerably. It is estimated that by 2030, the number of blind \nand visually impaired people will double if nothing is done.\n  Unsurprisingly, ``The Economic Impact of Vision Problems: The Toll of \nMajor Adult Eye Disorders, Visual Impairment, and Blindness on the U.S. \nEconomy,'' a study conducted by Prevent Blindness America, reveals that \nvision loss carries significant cost to individuals, private insurers, \nhealth care providers, and the Federal government. The study indicates \nthat the direct and indirect costs of vision loss among adults are \n$51.4 billion. And over a lifetime, the cost for just one\n\n[[Page S9211]]\n\nperson dealing with this terrible condition is $566,000. The lifetime \ncosts associated with just those Americans born with vision loss in \n2000 is $2.5 billion.\n  But what makes vision loss even more tragic is that half of all \nblindness is preventable if action is taken soon enough. There are many \nhealth and financial challenges our nation is facing that we may just \nhave to weather. But here is one we can do something about--and we \nshould. That is why Sen. Voinovich and I are introducing the Vision \nPreservation Act. This legislation would improve and strengthen \nimportant public health programs at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the Health Resources \nand Services Administration, HRSA. Specifically, it would expand \nexisting public education and awareness efforts to empower Americans to \ndo what is necessary to protect their own vision. This legislation \nwould also incorporate vision screening, prevention, and rehabilitation \ninto the Maternal and Child Health Block Grants and the Community \nHealth Centers so low income Americans who are most likely to go \nwithout needed prevention and screening can be alerted to the early \nwarning signs of vision loss. It would improve the training and \neducation of health professionals so that they are better prepared to \nhelp their patients identify and deal with conditions that could lead \nto vision loss.\n  These are simple steps that we in the Senate can take to help make \nsure that millions of Americans can live without fear of losing their \nsight. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3534\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Vision Preservation Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) An estimated 80 million Americans have a potentially \n     blinding eye disease, and more than 19.1 million Americans \n     report trouble seeing, even with eye glasses or contacts. At \n     least 1.1 million Americans are legally blind, and 200,000 \n     Americans experience profound vision loss. Refractive errors \n     affect approximately one third of persons 40 years or older \n     in the United States. Visual impairment is one of the 10 more \n     frequent causes of disability in the United States.\n       (2) While it is believed that half of all blindness can be \n     prevented, the number of Americans who are blind or visually \n     impaired is expected to double by 2030.\n       (3) Vision loss can, especially without appropriate \n     rehabilitation and skills training, significantly impact an \n     individual's ability to conduct activities of daily living, \n     as well as developmental learning, communicating, working, \n     health, and quality of life.\n       (4) One in twenty preschoolers experience visual impairment \n     which, if unaddressed, can affect learning ability, \n     personality, and adjustment in school.\n       (5) It is estimated that blindness and visual impairment \n     cost the Federal Government more than $4 billion annually in \n     benefits and lost taxable income, and cost the United States \n     economy approximately $51.4 billion annually in direct \n     medical costs, direct non medical costs, and indirect costs \n     such as lost productivity and wages.\n       (6) Vision rehabilitation helps people with vision loss to \n     live safely and independently at home and in the community, \n     reduce medication errors, cook and perform other daily \n     activities reliably, and avoid accidents which may lead to \n     injury or even the onset of additional disabilities, \n     especially among older persons living with vision loss.\n       (7) Recognizing that the Nation requires a public health \n     approach to visual impairment, the Department of Health and \n     Human Services dedicated a portion of its Healthy People 2010 \n     initiative to vision. The initiative set out as a goal the \n     improvement of the Nation's visual health through prevention, \n     early detection, treatment, and rehabilitation.\n       (8) Greater efforts must be made at the Federal, State, and \n     local levels to increase awareness of vision loss and its \n     causes, its impact, the importance of early diagnosis, \n     treatment, and rehabilitation, and effective prevention \n     strategies.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Nation must have a full-scale integrated public \n     health strategy to comprehensively address vision loss and \n     its causes that, at a minimum, includes the following:\n       (1) Communication and education.\n       (2) Surveillance, epidemiology, and prevention research.\n       (3) Programs, policies, and systems change.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Chris Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: The American Optometric Association \n     (AOA), representing over 36,000 doctors of optometry who are \n     the frontline providers of eye and vision care, optometric \n     researchers, educators and optometry students, deeply \n     appreciates your continued outstanding leadership on priority \n     eye and vision care issues before Congress.\n       With that in mind, it is my pleasure to inform you that the \n     AOA wholly endorses and will be working to pass the Vision \n     Preservation Act of 2008, legislation you have crafted to \n     strengthen federal vision programs designed to prevent and \n     manage vision loss.\n       Vision impairments are a growing problem in the US--\n     particularly with the aging of the babyboomer generation. \n     Approximately 80 million Americans have a potentially \n     blinding eye disease such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, \n     cataract, and age-related macular degeneration.

Res. 670\n\n       Whereas millions of Americans have benefitted from the \n     courageous service of first responders across the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the police, fire, emergency medical service, and \n     public health personnel (commonly known as ``first \n     responders'') work devotedly and selflessly on behalf of the \n     people of the United States, regardless of the peril or \n     hazard to themselves;\n       Whereas in emergency situations, first responders carry out \n     the critical role of protecting and ensuring public safety;\n\n[[Page S9213]]\n\n       Whereas the men and women who bravely serve as first \n     responders have found themselves on the front lines of \n     homeland defense in the war against terrorism;\n       Whereas first responders are called upon in the event of a \n     natural disaster, such as the tornados in Florida and the \n     blizzard in Colorado in December 2006, the flooding in the \n     Northeast in April 2007, the flooding in the Midwest in June \n     2008, and the wildfires in the West in July 2008;\n       Whereas the critical role of first responders was witnessed \n     in the aftermath of the mass shooting at the Virginia \n     Polytechnic Institute and State University, when the \n     collaborative effort of police officers, firefighters, and \n     emergency medical technicians to secure the campus, rescue \n     students from danger, treat the injured, and transport \n     victims to local hospitals undoubtedly saved the lives of \n     many students and faculty;\n       Whereas 900,000 police officers, 1,100,000 firefighters, \n     and 891,000 emergency medical technicians risk their lives \n     every day to make our communities safe;\n       Whereas these 900,000 sworn police officers from Federal, \n     State, tribal, city, and county law enforcement agencies \n     protect lives and property, detect and prevent crimes, uphold \n     the law, and ensure justice;\n       Whereas these 1,100,000 firefighters, both volunteer and \n     career, provide fire suppression, emergency medical services, \n     search and rescue, hazardous materials response, response to \n     terrorism, and critical fire prevention and safety education;\n       Whereas the 891,000 emergency medical professionals in the \n     United States respond to and treat a variety of life-\n     threatening emergencies, from cardiac and respiratory arrest \n     to traumatic injuries;\n       Whereas these 2,661,000 ``first responders'' make personal \n     sacrifices to protect our communities, as was witnessed on \n     September 11, 2001, and in the aftermath of Hurricane \n     Katrina, and as is witnessed every day in cities and towns \n     across the United States;\n       Whereas, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers \n     Memorial Fund, a total of 1,671 law enforcement officers died \n     in the line of duty during the past 10 years, an average of 1 \n     death every 53 hours or 167 per year, and 181 law enforcement \n     officers were killed in 2007;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Fire \n     Administration, from 1996 through 2005 over 1500 firefighters \n     were killed in the line of duty, and tens of thousands were \n     injured;\n       Whereas 4 in 5 medics are injured on the job, more than 1 \n     in 2 (52 percent) have been assaulted by a patient and 1 in 2 \n     (50 percent) have been exposed to an infectious disease, and \n     emergency medical service personnel in the United States have \n     an estimated fatality rate of 12.7 per 100,000 workers, more \n     than twice the national average;\n       Whereas most emergency medical service personnel deaths in \n     the line of duty occur in ambulance accidents;\n       Whereas thousands of first responders have made the \n     ultimate sacrifice;\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of \n     September 11, 2001, firefighters, law enforcement officers, \n     and emergency medical workers in the United States were \n     universally recognized for the sacrifices they made on that \n     tragic day, and should be honored each year as these tragic \n     events are remembered;\n       Whereas there currently exists no national day to honor the \n     brave men and women of the first responder community, who \n     give so much of themselves for the sake of others; and\n       Whereas these men and women by their patriotic service and \n     their dedicated efforts have earned the gratitude of \n     Congress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates September 25, 2008, as \n     ``National First Responder Appreciation Day'' to honor and \n     celebrate the contributions and sacrifices made by all first \n     responders in the United States.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution today that \nwill designate September 25 as National First Responder Appreciation \nDay. Last year I introduced this resolution with my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Robert Casey and I am pleased Senator Casey has \njoined me again in honoring our first responders. I am also pleased to \nbe joined by Senators Akaka, Bennett, Brown, Chambliss, Clinton, \nColeman, Crapo, Domenici, Durbin, Enzi, Hutchison, Inhofe, Kennedy, \nLandrieu, Leahy, Lieberman, Mikulski, Murray, Pryor, Rockefeller, \nSanders, Stabenow, Stevens, Voinovich, Whitehouse and Wicker in this \nimportant recognition of our men and women who keep us safe.\n  The contributions that our Nation's 1.1 million firefighters, 900,000 \npolice officers, and 890,000 emergency medical professionals make in \nour communities are familiar to us all. Their heroics can be seen every \nnight on our TV screens, read about in our papers, and heralded by the \nsurvivors of every modern disaster. From the wildfires in Colorado and \nCalifornia, the tragic events at Virginia Tech, and the horrific damage \nof Hurricanes Katrina, Gustav, and Ike, our first responders regularly \nrisk their lives to protect property, uphold the law, and save the \nlives of others.\n  The duty of a first responder is never without risk and requires the \ncourage to place the safety of others ahead of one's own. It is courage \nthat compels a firefighter to rush into a burning building, a police \nofficer to charge into an active shooter, and an emergency medical \nprofessional to perform precision lifesaving procedures in the most \nhazardous conditions imaginable. While all of these brave Americans \nknow the risks involved, some make that ultimate sacrifice to save \nanother, at the cost of their own life.\n  Every year over 100 firefighters and nearly 200 police officers are \nkilled in the line of duty. And while some may not consider a career in \nthe emergency medical services dangerous, EMS workers actually have an \noccupational fatality rate comparable to that of firefighters and \npolice officers. I know I speak on behalf of all Americans when I \nexpress my sincerest appreciation for their service and sacrifice.\n  While we recognize our first responders for their sacrifices, we also \nacknowledge their everyday contributions that make our communities \nthroughout America a safer place. In addition to battling fires, \nfirefighters reach out through fire prevention and public education, \nlike teaching our children about fire safety and proper emergency \nresponse. In addition to arresting criminals, police officers encourage \ncommunities to stay involved in crime prevention and cooperate with law \nenforcement to help make our neighborhoods safer and more livable. If \nwe or our loved ones experience a medical emergency, EMTs are there at \na moment's notice to provide lifesaving care.\n  In many ways, our first responders embody the very best of the \nAmerican spirit. With charity and compassion, these brave men and women \ncommit themselves to preserving the highest standard of life we all \nenjoy in this great Nation. Through their actions they have become \nheroes to many, through their examples they have become role models to \nus all.\n  While various cities and towns have recognized the contributions made \nby their local first responders, there exists no national day to honor \nand thank these courageous men and women. The time has come to give our \nfirst responders the national day of appreciation that they deserve.\n  Designating September 25 as National First Responder Appreciation Day \nprovides an opportunity for this institution and the people of the \nUnited States to honor first responders for their contributions, \nsacrifices, and dedication to public service.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting passage of this \nworthwhile resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/22/senate-section/article/S9213-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9213-S9214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 671--CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND SCHOOL \n                  OF MEDICINE ON ITS 200TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Cardin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 674\n\n       Whereas older adults value their independence and a fall \n     can significantly limit their ability to remain self-\n     sufficient;\n       Whereas falls are the leading cause of death from \n     unintentional injuries among older adults in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas older adults are by far the population at greatest \n     risk for falling unintentionally, with more than \\1/3\\ of all \n     people 65 years or older falling each year;\n       Whereas older adults who fall once are 2 to 3 times more \n     likely than adults who have not fallen to fall again;\n       Whereas, in 2000, the Bureau of the Census reported that \n     more than 34,800,000 adults older than the age of 65 live in \n     the United States, and that number is expected to grow to \n     almost 55,000,000 by 2020;\n       Whereas 20 to 30 percent of older adults who fall suffer \n     moderate to severe injuries, such as bruising, hip fractures, \n     and head traumas;\n       Whereas, in 2005, falls resulted in nearly 1,800,000 older \n     adults being treated in emergency departments and more than \n     433,000 older adults being hospitalized;\n       Whereas, in 2005, nearly 16,000 people aged 65 and older \n     died from injuries related to unintentional falls;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     report that the mortality rate from falls among older adults \n     increased 45 percent between 2000 and 2004;\n       Whereas the total in direct costs associated with both \n     fatal and non-fatal falls is more than $19,000,000,000 \n     annually for hospitalization, emergency department visits, \n     and outpatient care;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimate that if the rate of increase in falls is not \n     stemmed, annual direct treatment costs will reach \n     $43,800,000,000 by 2020, with an annual cost under the \n     Medicare program of $32,400,000,000;\n       Whereas evidence-based programs show promise in reducing \n     falls and facilitating cost-effective interventions, such as \n     comprehensive clinical assessments, exercise programs to \n     improve balance and health, management of medications, \n     correction of vision, and reduction of home hazards;\n       Whereas, on April 23, 2008, the Safety of Seniors Act of \n     2007 (Public Law 110-202) was enacted, amending the Public \n     Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 280b et seq.) to create a \n     national education campaign aimed at older\n\n[[Page S9215]]\n\n     adults, their families, and healthcare providers, and injury \n     prevention programs that focus on the reduction and \n     prevention of falls among older adults; and\n       Whereas the Falls Free Coalition Advocacy Work Group, its \n     numerous supporting organizations and all other supportive \n     organizations, should be commended for their efforts to raise \n     awareness and to promote greater understanding, research, and \n     pilot programs to prevent falls among older adults: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 22, 2008, as ``National Falls \n     Prevention Awareness Day'';\n       (2) commends the National Falls Free Coalition and all \n     other supportive organizations for their efforts to promote \n     awareness about preventing and reducing falls among older \n     people in the United States;\n       (3) encourages the private sector, the public health \n     community, healthcare providers, advocacy organizations, and \n     Federal, State, and local governments to work together to \n     increase education and awareness about the prevention of \n     falls; and\n       (4) urges national and community organizations, businesses, \n     individuals, and the media to use National Falls Prevention \n     Awareness Day to promote awareness of this important public \n     health problem in an effort to reduce the incidence of falls \n     among older people in the United States.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to submit legislation \ndesignating September 22, 2008, as National Falls Prevention Awareness \nDay. Earlier this year Senator Enzi and I worked together to pass a law \nthat expands research and education on elder falls. Passing our \nresolution is yet another way we can help raise awareness and educate \nthe Nation about this serious issue. Falls prevention helps seniors \nlive longer, healthier, and more independent lives.\n  Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among older adults. In \n2005, falls among older adults accounted for 16,000 deaths, 1.8 million \nemergency department visas, and 433,000 hospitalizations. In Maryland \nalone, falls resulted in roughly 340 deaths, 23,000 falls-related \nemergency room visits, and 13,000 hospitalizations. The resulting costs \nto the individual, their families, and the health care system are \navoidable.\n  I am pleased to continue to work with the Falls Free Coalition \nAdvocacy Work Group comprised of the Home Safety Council, the National \nCouncil on Aging, the National Safety Council, the American \nOccupational Therapy Association, the American Physical Therapy \nAssociation, AARP, and many other concerned advocates to prevent elder \nfalls. Together, I am hopeful we can continue to improve the quality of \nlife for America's seniors through awareness and prevention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/22/senate-section/article/S9215-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 675--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE GOALS OF NATIONAL \n    ADOPTION DAY AND NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH BY PROMOTING NATIONAL \n  AWARENESS OF ADOPTION AND THE CHILDREN AWAITING FAMILIES, CELEBRAT-\n    ING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES INVOLVED IN ADOPTION, AND ENCOURAGING \nAMERICANS TO SECURE SAFETY, PERMANENCY, AND WELL-BEING FOR ALL CHILDREN\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Coleman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Martinez, \nMr. Johnson, Mr. Craig, Mr. Levin, Mr. Casey, Mr. Bayh, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nInhofe, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Burr, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Smith, \nMr. DeMint, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Specter, Mr. Brownback, Ms. Collins, Mr. \nRoberts, Mr. Obama, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \nDomenici, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Thune, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Coburn, Mrs. Murray, \nMr. Rockefeller, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Salazar, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. \nMenendez (submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5834) to amend the North Korean Human Rights \n     Act of 2004 to promote respect for fundamental human rights \n     of the people of North Korea, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n[[Page S9219]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering \nH.R. 5834, a bill to reauthorize the North Korea Human Rights Act. The \nact underscores U.S. concern about the poor human rights conditions \ninside North Korea and the difficulties faced by thousands of North \nKoreans who have fled the country and become refugees. I support this \nbill because I believe our Government's approach to North Korean human \nrights and refugee issues must be seamlessly integrated into a coherent \nstrategy that promotes regional peace and stability, advances core U.S. \nnational security interests by verifiably eliminating North Korea's \npursuit of nuclear weapons, and step by step encourages North Korea to \nadhere to international norms in the areas of human rights, security, \nand trade.\n  It is essential that the United States reach out and begin a dialogue \nwith North Korea on issues related to basic human rights. Four years \nago, I was proud to work with my colleague, Senator Brownback of \nKansas, on an amendment to the North Korean Human Rights Act that \ncreated within the Department of State a Special Envoy for Human Rights \nin North Korea. In reauthorizing the act, the Congress expresses its \nintent that the envoy should be a full-time employee, and Congress \nelevates the post to the rank of ambassador, subject to the advice and \nconsent of the Senate. The incumbent special envoy has pursued his \nduties part-time while residing outside of Washington, making \ncoordination with the Department more difficult and limiting the \noverall effectiveness of his diplomatic efforts. By expressing the \nsense of the Congress that the new ambassador should be a full-time \nposition, the Congress does not preclude the possibility that the \nPresident may find it desirable to nominate as ambassador an individual \nwho already has other duties closely related to those to be pursued by \nthe Ambassador for North Korean Human Rights Issues. Indeed, such dual \nassignments are not uncommon within the State Department.\n  The bill acknowledges that the new Ambassador for North Korean Human \nRights Issues should be able to participate in policy planning and \nimplementation with respect to refugee issues, particularly given the \nfact that returning refugees are among those most likely to be \npersecuted by North Korean authorities. But it is my expectation that \nthe State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration \n(PRM) will continue to play the leading role on North Korean refugee \nissues, engaging with China and other nations to ensure humane \ntreatment in accordance with international norms. PRM has the staffing, \nexpertise, congressional authorization, and experience needed to \nspearhead U.S. efforts in this area, and they should continue to do so.\n  The new Ambassador for North Korean Human Rights Issues will have to \napproach the job with quiet determination and considerable patience. \nDiscussing human rights issues with North Korean authorities will not \nbe easy, and the new ambassador will need to have both excellent \ndiplomatic skills and a deep understanding of East Asia and the \nparticular circumstances on the Korean Peninsula. Change will not come \neasily, and is more likely to flow from dialogue and engagement than \nfrom bombast and condemnation.\n  There are many issues on the table, ranging from family reunification \nvisits for the thousands of Korean-Americans with relatives in the \nnorth, to ending the persecution of people of faith inside North Korea. \nOther humanitarian issues may also enter the mix, including food \nsecurity and public health. It is my hope that the new ambassador will \nwork with our treaty ally, South Korea, and with other countries \nneighboring North Korea to craft an approach to human rights issues \nthat can, step by step, see an improvement in the lives of average \nNorth Koreans and compassionate care for those who have fled the \ncountry. In this effort, the ambassador may find it useful to draw \nappropriate lessons from the Helsinki process in Europe, but ultimately \nthe approach will have to be one that is specifically tailored to the \nNorth Korean situation.\n  As Congress passes this legislation, we must not lose sight of the \nfact that members of the Bush administration are toiling to convince \nNorth Korea to resume the disablement of its nuclear facilities and to \nagree to a verification mechanism for its nuclear declaration. These \nefforts are of vital importance. It is regrettable that progress has \nbeen derailed over a dispute about sanctions relief and the \nverification protocol. North Korea should understand that if Pyongyang \nhonors its commitments, we stand ready to honor ours. On the basis of \naction-for-action, I hope the United States and North Korea, along with \nother members of the Six Party Talks, will work to accomplish the \ndenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the full integration of \nNorth Korea into the community of nations. In exchange for the complete \nand verifiable elimination of its nuclear weapons programs, North Korea \nstands to receive energy assistance, sanctions relief, and security \nassurances from the United States and other members of the Six Party \nTalks. I look forward to the day when North Korea is truly at peace \nwith its neighbors and enjoys normal relations with the United States. \nIt is a future that is within North Korea's grasp if it abandons its \npursuit of nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nat the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate, and that any statements relating to this \nmeasure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
