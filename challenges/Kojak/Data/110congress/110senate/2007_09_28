Mr. President, the Senate will begin consideration shortly \nof the Department of Defense authorization bill. Last night cloture was \ninvoked on the substitute amendment. Therefore, amendments in order \nneed to have been timely filed and be germane.\n  There will be no rollcall votes today, but the managers will be here \nto process amendments. Senator Kennedy is here to talk about the first \namendment.\n  The next vote will occur Monday beginning around 5:30 in the evening. \nThis week has been a very busy week, and the Senate has successfully \nconcluded action on a number of very important measures. Mr. President, \nnext week we are going to, as soon as we finish this bill, the Defense \nauthorization bill--which will be sometime Monday night--move to \nDefense appropriations. Senators Inouye and Stevens have been advised \nof that. They will start early Tuesday morning. We hope to complete \nthat bill within a couple of days.\n  The next bill we will take up prior to our October recess will be the \nCommerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. If we can finish those two \nbills, and I think we have a real opportunity to do that, we will have \ncompleted 6 of the 12 appropriations bills.\n  The House has completed all of theirs. I have had a number of \nconversations with Chairman Obey, with the Speaker, in an effort to get \nthese bills--as many as we can, as soon as we can--to the President.\n  As you know, there is a controversy with the President over his \nthreats to veto all of these bills. We hope he will see the wisdom of \nmoving forward on these appropriations bills, as we hope he will on the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program which passed overwhelmingly \nyesterday.\n  I would say that last year, for example, the President accepted bills \nfrom the Republican-dominated Congress that were $55 billion over what \nhe suggested. This year we are at $21 billion and none of that is \nextravagant spending. Most of it are things he has cut out of the \nbudget, so it would only keep up with inflation. For example, with the \ntremendous rise in crime we have all over America today--we have had a \njump this last year like we have not seen in recent decades. Aggravated\n\n[[Page S12320]]\n\ncrimes are up significantly, and we have a situation where we are \nputting in this legislation--I have talked about these appropriations \nbills--$1.5 billion to make up for what we took out of the COPS \nProgram. We have 100,000 less police officers on the street than we \ndid. That is a result of the cuts of the President. So we hope he will \nsee the light and do the right thing in regard to the appropriations \nbills.\n  But I very much appreciate the cooperation we received from the \nRepublicans with our appropriations bills to this point. We have not \nhad great difficulty with those bills. We all know we should have \ngotten to them sooner, but we have had 48 filibusters we have had to \ndeal with this year which have slowed things down significantly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/28/senate-section/article/S12320-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 2693\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman, Senator Levin, \nand I are prepared to go forward with any amendments. We are anxious to \nhave Members bring those amendments to the floor.\n  At this time, I see one of my colleagues seeking recognition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the late Arthur Helton, perhaps our \ncountry's greatest advocate for the rights of refugees, wrote:\n\n       Refugees matter . . . for a wide variety of reasons. . . . \n     Refugees are a product of humanity's worst instincts, the \n     willingness of some persons to oppress others, as well as \n     some of its best instincts, the willingness of many to assist \n     and protect the helpless. . . .\n\n  A year after he wrote those words, Arthur Helton was killed in \nBaghdad in 2003 when a bomb destroyed the U.N. headquarters in Iraq. \nHis words still resonate today, especially when we consider the immense \nhuman cost of the war in Iraq and its tragic effect on the millions of \nIraqis--men, women, and children--who have fled their homes, their \ncountry, to escape the violence of a nation at war with itself.\n  These brave and heroic Iraqis work with the American military, staff \nour embassy, and work with American organizations to support our \nmission in Iraq. They are among the 4 million Iraqi refugees who have \nbeen forced from their homes. They are the people we have an obligation \nto help.\n  Instead of protection, we have offered them bureaucracy and \ndoublespeak, false words and dubious hopes. Despite the overwhelming \nneed, the U.S. has resettled less than 2,000 Iraqis this fiscal year. \nLast night, the Senate acted and stood up to help Iraqi refugees.\n  I thank Senator Levin and Senator McCain for adopting our amendment, \nthe Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act of 2007. I thank Senator Warner as well. \nThis was cosponsored by a bipartisan group of Senators: Senators Smith, \nLevin, Hagel, Biden, Brownback, Lieberman, Leahy, Snowe, Durbin, \nVoinovich, Feinstein, Collins, Obama, Dole, Menendez, Mikulski, and \nClinton.\n  The need is especially urgent for those whose work for the United \nStates has put them in danger. Because they supported us, insurgents \nhave repeatedly threatened to kill them. Many have lost their homes, \ntheir property, their livelihoods. They face ongoing threats every \nsingle day. Some have fled the country and are waiting in refugee \ncamps, and others are in hiding. All of them hope the United States \nwill not forget their sacrifices.\n  Still others have tried to flee, only to be stopped at the border, \ntrapped in a country that cannot protect them, abandoned by a country, \nour country, that they believed would set them free. Others continue \ntheir work, living in fear of the day that the insurgents punish them \nfor working for Americans. They are women such as Sarah, whose husband \nworked as an interpreter for the coalition forces in a combat hospital. \nAlthough he kept his job secret, insurgents discovered his identity. \nThey broke into his family home, kidnapped her and released her only \nafter torturing and raping her.\n  The family fled to a neighboring country where they have waited for \nalmost a year in the hopes of qualifying for refugee status. Sarah's \nhusband has been forced to return to Iraq. Each day that passes without \nassistance brings the rest of the family closer to an involuntary \nreturn to Iraq.\n  She wrote: Dear gentlemen: I put my suffering between your hands as \nmy hope in you is great that you will hear our calling.\n\n  And there are men such as Sami who worked for USAID. He received \nseveral death threats, one in the form of a blood-soaked bullet sealed \nin an envelope. Sami pressed on, despite the threats, in order to help \nimprove local governments and strengthen civil society.\n  In June 2006, a group of men armed with machine guns attempted to \nkidnap his pregnant wife and 2-year-old son outside their home. The \nattack was thwarted, but his wife nearly miscarried and his son \nsuffered prolonged shock. Sami and his family fled to Jordan where they \nlive day to day waiting for the labyrinthine process to rule on their \nrefugee case. Our Government owes these Iraqis an immense debt of \ngratitude. Many American employees owe their lives to those Iraqis.\n  Despite the clear and present danger many Iraqis face based on their \nties to the United States, their religious affiliation, or their work \nwith media, nongovernmental and humanitarian organizations, the vast \nmajority of Iraqi refugees must go through a long and complicated \nreferral process of approximately 8 to 10 months, in which the United \nNations serves as an intermediary. There are no provisions for \nconducting refugee screenings within Iraq as there should be.\n  In a recent cable, Ambassador Crocker asked the administration to \nreconsider its practices. He estimates that under the current practices \nit would take more than 2 years to process the over 10,000 referrals \nmade by the United Nations. As Ambassador Crocker noted:\n\n       Clearly, this is too long. Refugees who have fled Iraq \n     continue to be a vulnerable population while living in Jordan \n     and Syria.\n\n  Ambassador Crocker asked for the authority to process refugees in \nIraq. He asked for the authority to provide special immigrant visas for \nthose who have worked in good faith with our Government in Iraq. He \nasked to expedite the processing of refugee claims to\n\n[[Page S12321]]\n\nsave lives. Surely, we can all agree with Ambassador Crocker that delay \nis unacceptable. But we must clearly do better by these Iraqis who have \nsacrificed so much for the United States.\n  The amendment approved by the Senate last night will cut through the \nredtape. It requires the Secretary of State to establish a refugee \nprocessing program in Iraq and in countries in the region for Iraqis \nthreatened because of their association with the U.S. Government.\n  Those Iraqis who worked with our Government will be able to apply \ndirectly to the United States in Iraq, rather than going through the \nUnited Nations referral system outside Iraq. It authorizes 5,000 \nspecial immigrant visas yearly for 5 years for Iraqis who have worked \nfor the U.S. Government in Iraq and are threatened as a result. It also \nallows Iraqis in the United States who have been denied asylum because \nconditions in Iraq changed after Saddam Hussein's government fell to \nhave cases reheard.\n  Surely, we cannot resettle all of Iraq's refugees in the United \nStates, but we need to do our part. America has a special obligation to \nkeep faith with the Iraqis who now have a bull's eye on their back \nbecause of their association with our Government.\n  I had the honor of meeting SGT Joseph Seemiller, a young man who is \nhaunted by the military motto: Leave no man behind. Sergeant Seemiller \nis dedicated to helping the translator he was forced to leave behind in \nIraq. On countless occasions, his translator helped to avoid several \nAmerican and Iraqi casualties. He braved innumerable death threats and \nthe horrific murder of his brother, finally fleeing to Syria where he \nhas waited for more than 2 years for a chance to be resettled in the \nUnited States.\n  Those words haunt us all. I am delighted the Senate has taken this \nimportant step to honor our commitment to the brave men and women whose \nlives are at risk.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I commend Senator Kennedy on his leadership on the issue \nhe has been talking about. We have a great responsibility, particularly \nto those people in Iraq who have helped us--translators, truck drivers, \npeople who put their lives and the lives of their families on the line \nto help us. Whether you agree with American policy in Iraq--and I \ndon't--whether you feel we ought to have gone there--I thought it was a \nmistake and so voted--we are there. People are putting their lives on \nthe line to help our troops and us. We surely owe them an opportunity \nto become refugees if they otherwise qualify. Instead they run into the \nhurdles, barricades, and bureaucracy Senator Kennedy talked about. He \nhas taken a very important lead on that issue. There has been a lot of \nbipartisan support on this effort.\n  There is another group I have been particularly worried about; they \nare religious minorities in Iraq, including Caldeans and Assyrians. \nThese are Christians caught in the crossfire. That group is also given \na special preference in this legislation which was adopted last night. \nIt is a modest beginning toward carrying out our responsibility--and we \nbear some real responsibility as well as obligation--for some of these \nfolks. It is a very small step. I wish to say Senator Kennedy has been \nrelentless on this refugee issue. It was off the radar. Millions of \npeople displaced inside Iraq, 2 million people outside Iraq who are \nrefugees, 4 million Iraqis left their homes, half to other places in \nIraq, half, roughly, to other countries in the region. These groups are \nso vulnerable. We must take action on it. We did last night. I thank \nand commend Senator Kennedy and Senator Brownback, who has been working \nwith me particularly on these religious refugees, these minorities, \nand, of course, Senator Warner and the Republicans who worked to put \nthis package together last night--all are entitled to our thanks but \nmainly Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might add, on our most recent trip \nvisiting Iraq, you went out of your way--as a matter of fact, I joined \nyou--in not only meeting with representatives of these Christian \nminorities who had been persecuted through the years, but then we \nincluded a trip into Jordan, where we also made some assessment of the \nrefugee situation over there. I think some credit goes to our chairman \nfor his personal initiatives.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. Of course, as my partner on these \ntrips, the Senator from Virginia was a very important part of that and \nadded his prestige to the effort. I thank him for mentioning it but \nalso for his participation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know we wouldn't be able to have made \nprogress unless we had the strong support of both the chairman and \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee. I am very grateful to \nthem. This has been a strong bipartisan effort. It is important. We \nwant to work with the Department and the agencies to make sure it is \nimplemented correctly. I am appreciative of their continuing \ninvolvement in caring about these individuals. You could hear both of \nthem speak about this measure and know they are involved, and they care \nvery deeply about our responsibilities. We are enormously grateful to \nthem for including this in the legislation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3058\n\n  I wanted to address the Senate for a few minutes on the underlying \nand pending amendment. At this critical time, when we face major \nchallenges in our national security, America relies more than ever on \nthe Department of Defense and its dedicated employees at home and \nabroad. More than 675,000 civilian workers serve our country every day \nrepairing planes, ships, tanks or overseeing the storage and \ndistribution of vital weapons and supplies. These hard-working \nAmericans are the backbone of our commitment to keep our troops safe \nand protect our Nation. But these vital civilian employees of the \nDepartment of Defense have been under sustained attack from the Bush \nadministration. Instead of honoring and fairly rewarding their \npatriotic service, the administration has gone on a binge of \noutsourcing, forcing Federal workers to fight to keep their jobs in a \ncompetition where the deck is stacked against them.\n  The Department of Defense has been an aggressive accomplice to the \nadministration's effort. More than 121,000 civilian Defense employees \ncould lose their jobs in the next 3 years. In fact, these employees are \nmore likely to lose their jobs than employees of any other Federal \nagencies. Ill-advised outsourcing has not only hurt the DOD employees \nwho are deprived of their jobs and benefits; it also has a massive \nimpact on our brave men and women in uniform. Our Armed Forces deserve \nthe very best workers supporting them. They also deserve the \nopportunity to continue serving their country after they come home from \nthe battlefield. Thirty-five percent of civilian Defense employees are \nveterans. These loyal Americans deserve to be commended and cheered for \nchoosing to continue to serve their country when they return home. Yet \nthe administration is bent on taking their opportunity away from them, \nand from Americans currently serving overseas as well, by outsourcing \ntheir jobs.\n  At the very least, we owe these patriotic Americans a fair chance to \ncompete for important work. But the administration's irresponsible \noutsourcing rules are heavily biased against Federal employees. The \npoint, it is insidious. The rules are different for contractors than \nfor Federal workers. Private companies get advantages that dedicated \nFederal workers do not. The current system is designed to promote \noutsourcing, even when it doesn't save money. One of the most appalling \nroadblocks preventing fair competition is the unjust advantage \ncontractors gain by shortchanging workers' health and retirement \nbenefits. At a time when 47 million Americans don't have health \ninsurance and only one in five Americans has a secure retirement plan, \nwe should be doing all we can to encourage more companies to provide \nfair benefits to their employees. But current Federal contracting rules \nactually discourage private companies from providing health coverage or \nhelping employees to save for retirement.\n  Firms that provide no benefits or inadequate benefits win bids to \nperform Government work, even when the cost savings from their bid are \nattributed solely to the fact that they are shortchanging workers. We \nunderstand that. These veterans have served in the Armed Forces. They \ncome back, are\n\n[[Page S12322]]\n\nworking in the Defense Department. More than a third of all workers \nhave served, been in the military, served our country. Now they are \nworking. Because they are working for the Defense Department, they get \nhealth insurance and some retirement benefits. Now a contractor comes \nin and says they want to bid for a particular job. In the bidding \nprocess, the Government has to add the cost of retirement and their \nhealth insurance, while the private contractor provides no health \ninsurance and no security for these workers in terms of pensions. They \nhave some obvious advantage in what is now a rush to the bottom, \nconstantly outsourcing and winning contracts.\n\n  This is unfair. Our amendment, spoken to brilliantly last evening by \nSenator Mikulski, says, let's exclude those and have real competition. \nLet's take the fact that they have health insurance and have retirement \nbenefits off. Let them compete and have real competition for this work. \nWe know in circumstances where they have that real competition, these \nworkers will win the jobs.\n  The unfair practice creates a dangerous race to the bottom in which \nthe private sector companies compete against each other to see who can \nprovide the fewest benefits to their workers. It penalizes companies \nthat want to do the right thing. As a result, the bidding process is \nactually increasing the number of Americans whose health and future \nsecurity are in jeopardy. That is irrational and unconscionable. It is \npatently unfair to the thousands of Federal employees who lose their \njobs every year because of irresponsible contractors. Workers should \nnot be unfairly disadvantaged and lose contracts simply because they \nreceive decent benefits. Each and every Member of Congress has good \nhealth insurance. Each and every Member of Congress has a secure \nretirement. Americans who serve our country in the Defense Department \ndeserve the same.\n  One of the key protections in the fair competition amendment corrects \nthis injustice. It prevents contractors from winning bids to perform \nGovernment contracts solely because they provide inadequate benefits or \nno benefits at all. The Department is instructed not to consider health \ncare and retirement costs in comparing contract bids. The winners of \ncompetition should be employers who operate more efficiently, not \nemployers who provide the fewest benefits. The amendment does not \ndictate the benefits that employers must provide. It does not state the \nbenefits employers have to provide or require contractors to modify \ntheir existing benefits. All it does is eliminate the perverse \nincentive that discourages contractors from providing fair benefits and \ngive Federal employees a fair chance to prove they are the best workers \nfor the job.\n  It is a realistic solution to improve the process of public-private \ncompetition, and it has bipartisan support. The health care provisions \nhave been a part of the appropriations legislation for years and a \nbipartisan Kennedy-Hatch amendment, providing the same treatment for \nretirement costs, was accepted on the Defense appropriations bill last \nyear. Members on both sides of the aisle recognized it is not good \npolicy for the Government to shift work from the public sector \nemployees to private sector employees solely because it is cheaper to \ndeny health and retirement benefits to employees. The fair competition \namendment contains other important protections to level the playing \nfield for civilian Defense employees in public-private competition. It \nallows Federal employees to appeal unfair privatization decisions, as \ncontractors can do now. We are making sure those employees have the \nright to appeal. It allows managers to extend a contract when Federal \nemployees perform well, as they can for private contractors under law. \nIt prohibits the use of outsourcing quotas so agencies aren't forced to \nsuch privatization against their will. It ensures that outsourcing will \noccur only when it produces real savings to taxpayers. Shouldn't that \nbe the criteria? Shouldn't that be the test, real savings, quality work \nfor the taxpayers?\n  It calls on the Department of Defense to stop dragging its feet and \nissue long overdue guidelines so civilian employees have a fair \nopportunity to compete for new work or work that has been outsourced \nincorrectly or unfairly in the past. This amendment is about fairness. \nAmericans understand fairness--fairness to the taxpayer, fairness to \ncivilians, fairness to Government workers, fairness to our men and \nwomen in uniform who deserve the very best possible support for their \nmissions at home and abroad.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the fair competition amendment.\n  I will take a moment to demonstrate what the challenge has been. \nCompetition: in 2004, 10 percent of the jobs were lost; 29 percent in \n2005. This is the projection for 2006 and 2007. It is a real crisis for \nmany workers. This says thousands of veterans could lose their jobs \nunder the Bush outsourcing rules. Thirty-four percent of civilian \nDefense employees are veterans. Our amendment ensures that these \n226,000 dedicated Americans who have served our country will not lose \ntheir jobs because of unfair outsourcing. That is what this amendment \nis basically about. This is the issue. We are looking at fairness--\nfairness for the taxpayer, fairness to those who have served our \ncountry as men and women in uniform and now are serving in the Defense \nDepartment, fairness to them, fairness to the civilian employees, and, \nmost of all, fairness to the men and women in the services who deserve \nto have the best trained, highly skilled, highly motivated workers \nworking on the various products that are necessary to keep our Nation \nsecure.\n\n  They deserve the best. We want the best. This decision ought to be \nbased upon the best and not about who can provide the least health \nbenefits to workers in this country. That is the issue. The issue is \nfairness. Hopefully, this amendment will be accepted.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Senator Reed and I have talked with our \ncolleague Senator Sanders. He has two very laudable amendments. It is \nour hope we can work through these amendments, but they do relate to \nthe responsibilities of other committees of the Senate, primarily the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee and the Appropriations Committee.\n  I think we have agreed that our distinguished colleague from Vermont \nwould have an opportunity this morning to discuss these amendments to \nmake a case in the Congressional Record for use by many on Monday as we \nfurther assess the amendments should they actually be brought up before \nthe body and acted upon. I would ask Senator Reed if that is a fair \nappraisal of the situation?\n  Mr. REED. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is that agreeable to the Senator from Vermont?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes, it is. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. WARNER. So the status on the floor is the Defense bill is pending \nand there is an amendment at this time, and there is no request at this \ntime to set aside that pending amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3082\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Warner very much for \nhis consideration, and Senator Reed, Senator Levin, and Senator McCain. \nI ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside, and \nthat the Sanders-Byrd-Burr-Bond-Webb-Feingold amendment No. 3082 at the \ndesk, and later the Sununu-Kerry-Brown amendment at the desk, No. 2905, \nbe called up.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, could I make a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED. I think the Senator from Virginia suggested that the \namendment is pending, so that the Senator from Vermont would not be \nrequesting to set it aside; he just wants to speak to his amendments.\n  Mr. SANDERS. That is correct.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S12323]]\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by discussing amendment No. \n3082. I appreciate the opportunity, and I look forward to working with \nSenator Warner and others early next week on this issue.\n  The amendment I am offering, along with my colleagues Senators Byrd, \nBond, Burr, Feingold, and Webb, would authorize $15 million in funding \nfor gulf war illnesses within the Department of Defense's \ncongressionally directed medical research programs. These funds would \ngo to a peer-reviewed research program open to researchers inside and \noutside of Government, focusing on the chronic effects of neurotoxic \nexposures, body functions underlying the illnesses, and the \nidentification of treatments. This funding level matches the funding \nlevel that is included in the Defense appropriations bill passed out of \nthe committee a few weeks ago.\n  This research is done by the Congressionally Directed Medical \nResearch Programs, which is a research organization focused on finding \nand funding the best research to eradicate diseases to protect the \nhealth of current, future, and former members of the Armed Forces, \nwhile also benefiting the overall health of the American public. \nImportantly, a few days ago, as a member of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I can tell my colleagues that we had a very \ninteresting hearing where we heard from the colonel at the DOD who runs \nthis program using the $5 million appropriated by Congress last year to \nthem, and the colonel described what has been happening. She reported \nto us that there was a great deal of interest in the initial \nsolicitation for research proposals. They received 80 proposals. They \nrecently granted $4.4 million to nine researchers from prestigious \nacademic institutions across the country to find treatments for gulf \nwar illnesses.\n  The truth is, this is an issue that I and many others in Congress \nhave been working on for many years. The reality is that in the first \ngulf war, as a result of service in the first gulf war, we have today \nwell over 100,000 soldiers who are suffering--veterans who are \nsuffering from a myriad of illnesses which we call gulf war illness. \nSome of these illnesses reflect themselves as fibromyalgia. Some people \nhave headaches. Some people have short-term memory loss. Some people \nhave gastrointestinal problems. We heard testimony from a young woman \nwhose life, as a result of her service in the gulf, has been radically \nchanged and her health has significantly deteriorated. There is a great \ndeal of evidence that many of the children born to those men and women \nwho served in the gulf, including this particular woman, were born with \nsignificant problems and disabilities.\n\n  I would be less than honest if I did not say that substantial sums of \nmoney went to the DOD and the VA--and believe me, as a member of the \nGovernment Reform Committee in the House, I spent dozens of hours--\ndozens of hours--along with Representative Chris Shays of Connecticut \nlistening to testimony. I have to tell my colleagues that from many \npeople in the veterans organizations, there was extreme frustration \nwith the actions of the VA and the DOD; that, in the very beginning of \nthis process, refused to even recognize the problem, and then what they \nsaid is: Well, maybe it is a psychological problem. There was a \nwidespread feeling that the VA and the DOD were not responding to the \nreal problems impacting tens and tens of thousands of our soldiers who \nreturned.\n  We have an obligation. Obviously, right now, all kinds of attention \nis being paid, appropriately enough, to our soldiers who come home from \nIraq, who come home from Afghanistan. We are worried about TBI, \ntraumatic brain injury; we are worried about post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, and we should be. But we cannot in good conscience turn our \nbacks on the tens and tens of thousands of soldiers who today are \nsuffering from their service in the first gulf war. They are hurting.\n  The good news is there is now a line of research being developed \nthrough the DOD organization that I mentioned before, and that is the \nCongressionally Directed Medical Research Program that is beginning to \nhave some results. Without going into great medical and scientific \nanalysis, what they are beginning to find is that as a result of the \nextremely toxic theater that existed in the gulf war, including burning \noil wells, bromide given as an anti-nerve gas agent, DEET being used to \nprotect soldiers from mosquitoes, and of course the saran released into \nthe air, what researchers are now beginning to find is that there \nappears to be brain damage that is the cause of some of the symptoms \nour soldiers are seeing, and we are beginning to see more, very \npromising research in this area.\n  My concern is if you talk to the veterans of the gulf war, they will \ntell you that there is a very high level of frustration about the huge \namounts of money being spent by people who didn't even acknowledge or \nappreciate the pain our soldiers were experiencing. So what this \namendment does is focuses research into those areas where we are \nalready seeing some significant progress. That is what this amendment \nis about. I look forward to discussing this issue further with the \nmembers of the relevant committees when we return next week. That is \none of the amendments we are working on.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2905\n\n  The other amendment is amendment No. 2905, which deals with a very \nimmediate crisis. The former amendment deals with what happened 16 \nyears ago. This is an amendment dealing with the problem we are seeing \ntoday. I don't have to tell anyone in this body that the studies are \nvery clear that we are likely to see a record-breaking level of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder coming from service in the theater in Iraq. \nIt appears at this point, based on several studies I have read, that \nthe numbers will be a lot higher than Vietnam, and God only knows that \nVietnam was high enough. I think the evidence is pretty clear that we \ndid not do a good job in addressing the post-traumatic stress disorder \nof those soldiers who came home from Vietnam.\n  Now, what this amendment does is it would create a $30 million pilot \nproject--and I should indicate this amendment is supported by Mr. \nSununu of New Hampshire, Mr. Kerry of Massachusetts, and Mr. Brown of \nOhio, the sitting Presiding Officer. It builds on a program, a small \nprogram we developed in the State of Vermont. Here is what the issue \nis.\n  We can put zillions of dollars into research and into treatment for \nPTSD, but it will only do a limited amount of good if we don't bring \nthose soldiers who are hurting into the facilities and into the \ncounseling for them and their families that could provide help. I can \ntell you that in a rural State such as Vermont, where you have people \nfrom the National Guard who do not have the active-duty military \ninfrastructure, a lot of these men and women will come home from Iraq, \nthey will return to their small towns, and they will be hurting, their \nkids will be hurting, their wives will be hurting, and they are not \ngoing to stand up and say: You know what. I am having nightmares or \nwhen I go through a tunnel, I am having a panic attack.\n  That is not what they are going to do. They are going to sit home and \nsuffer and not know how to reach out for counseling. Some of them will \nbe embarrassed; that is part of the problem.\n  The history of the VA and the DOD is not good in knocking on doors \nand reaching out. What we have done in Vermont, working with the \nNational Guard, in cooperation with the VA, is we established what we \ncall a door-knocking program where we have men and women who have \nserved in Iraq who are going into our communities and knocking on \ndoors, sitting down and having a cup of coffee, talking to the \nfamilies, asking them how things are going. The conversation might be: \nMy husband hasn't been able to sleep. Oh, really. And they have that \ndiscussion. It is reaching out. The problem they may be having is a \nproblem that may be experienced by tens of thousands of other people \nwho went to Iraq. That is what this program is about.\n  Some people say the VA has done a good job historically in outreach, \nbut I don't believe that. I offered an amendment when I was in the \nHouse to counteract a rule that said the VA cannot do any outreach at \nall. So we have a major problem called post-traumatic stress disorder. \nPart of the problem is people are not going to stand up and say: I am \nhurting, how can I get help? I think the answer, to some degree, is to \nhave people who served in Iraq knock on doors, and maybe they are\n\n[[Page S12324]]\n\ndressed in blue jeans, maybe they are not, but to come in an unofficial \nand informal way, sit down, have a cup of coffee, and try to assess \nwhat is going on.\n  I appreciate the support of the Presiding Officer for this amendment, \nas well as others in the Senate. It is a very important amendment. I \nbelieve we owe it to our soldiers. I look forward to continuing this \ndiscussion early next week with my colleagues.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me just, first, thank the Senator from \nVermont for his willingness to work over the next couple of days to see \nif we can figure out a way to address the issues, which are very \nimportant issues, that his amendments incorporate. I commend him also \non his extraordinary commitment to the veterans of both wars--the ones \nwe don't reach, as well as the ones we know about.\n  We are going to work with him over the next couple days to see if \nthere is a way to work these amendments out. I appreciate his \nwillingness to hold off offering them.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan. I know \nhis heart is in the right place. He will agree that we can spend \nzillions of dollars, but it doesn't do any good if it doesn't reach the \npeople we want to reach. And we cannot turn our backs on people who \nfought in another war which is not in the newspaper today.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The American people are divided on the war, but they are \nnot divided on supporting our troops and our veterans who fought in \nformer wars. This unites the American people. I commend the Senator for \nthat feeling and the strong identity he has with the men and women who \nhave represented this country and put their lives on the line and are \nnow hurting.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, can we determine from the Presiding \nOfficer the pending matters? Are we in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. No. The Senate is debating the \nbill, H.R. 1585. Pending is the Kennedy amendment.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 2640\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Leahy and Schumer, I \nask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of H.R. 2640 and that the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration; further, I ask that a Leahy-Schumer substitute \namendment at the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate, and that any statements related \nto the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I object on behalf of Senator Coburn, who \nwas unable to be here today. I understand he has spoken to the \ncolleagues enumerated in this request and they are aware of the basis \nfor his objection. So, for the moment, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nfair competition amendment proposed by my colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, to H.R. 1585, the Defense Department authorization \nbill.\n  This amendment would minimize the harmful effects that the current A-\n76 process for outsourcing federal functions to private contractors has \non Federal workers. It will do this by leveling the playing field \nbetween Federal workers and private contractors by removing several \nunfair advantages that contractors currently have in the process. I \nwant to highlight just two of the important improvements that the \namendment would make to the A-76 process.\n  First, this amendment would take away the competitive advantage that \ncontractors currently have if they deny their employees health and \nretirement benefits. I have fought to improve and protect federal \nworkers' benefits as the chairman of the Federal Workforce \nSubcommittee. At a time when more and more Americans have no health \ninsurance, it is simply wrong to give private contractors an advantage \nin winning work done by DOD employees by denying their workers the \nhealth benefits that Congress has guaranteed to Federal employees.\n  Also, this amendment would give employees the same right to protest \nunfair contract awards under the A-76 process that private contractors \nalready have. The current situation makes no sense. Private contractors \nwere given the right to protest contracting decisions in the \nCompetition in Contracting Act of 1984, a law that was written for \ncompetitions between private contractors. The same protest right was \nnever extended to Federal workers who compete against private \ncontractors under the A-76 process. Basic fairness dictates that if one \nparty can protest the results of a contest, both sides should be able \nto.\n  I believe this amendment introduces a more appropriate level of \ncaution into the process for outsourcing Federal jobs. Caution is \nespecially important for jobs related to national defense and security. \nThe recent events involving Blackwater as a contract security provider \nin Iraq remind us how difficult it can be to hold outside contractors \naccountable. The Federal Government over time has been a model for fair \nand equal employment practices, and in turn Federal workers have shown \nstrong loyalty, courage, and dedication to serving their country. When \nwe award jobs that are currently done by Federal workers to private \ncontractors, we limit our ability to demand a high level of \naccountability and fairness from the private companies that win the \ncontracts, nor can we expect the same level of dedication from their \nemployees.\n  When used properly on a limited basis, the A-76 process can improve \nGovernment efficiency by injecting competition into certain Federal \nfunctions that mirror activities performed by the private sector. \nHowever, the results of A-76 competitions suggest that there is limited \neconomic value to the process. Federal employees do their jobs more \nefficiently than private contractors in most cases. Federal employees \nwin 80 percent of the competitions under the A-76 process despite \nadvantages given to private contractors. These positive results do not \njustify keeping the advantages granted to the private sector. Leveling \nthe playing field will do more than make A-76 competitions objectively \nfairer. It can undo the harm to Federal employee morale that is caused \nby forcing them to compete for their jobs within a system that is \nrigged against them.\n  At a time when the Federal Government faces tremendous challenges in \nhiring and retaining talented workers, it is important that we act to \naddress the harmful effects that the current A-76 process has on the \nFederal workforce. That is what the fair competition amendment would \ndo, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/28/senate-section/article/S12324-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12324-S12327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, let me quickly indicate that the three \ncombatant commanders who have been nominated are part of this list. \nAdmiral Roughead, who is nominated to be the Chief of Naval Operations, \nis also on this list. I point out, particularly with Senator Warner on \nthe floor but even if he was not on the floor, not only does he play an \nactive role in moving these nominations very expeditiously--and this is \nas expeditious as any nomination could move. We had the hearings \nyesterday, I believe, and we had the markup last night and the \nnomination is on the floor today for these combatant commanders and \nCNO. Senator Warner, with his particular history with the U.S. Navy, \nwas keeping an especially keen eye on the nomination of Admiral \nRoughead. That doesn't diminish his interest in the others. As a former \nSecretary of the Navy, he had a very special personal interest in this \nnomination moving forward and avoiding any gap between the current CNO \nand the next CNO. There will not be a gap. That is in good measure \nbecause of Senator Warner's very special interest in this matter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague and \nlong-time friend of 29 years, standing here together with the Defense \nbill. It was important in this case. On Monday, the current Chief of \nNaval Operations, a man of great distinction, Admiral Mullen, as we say \nin the Navy, lowered his flag as Chief of Naval Operations and becomes \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  I felt it imperative there not be a moment's gap in the Navy for the \nnew Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral\n\n[[Page S12327]]\n\nRoughead, who is in this group of nominations confirmed by the Senate, \nand that he be in position to assume the full responsibilities as soon \nas he is able to take the oath of office.\n  I thank my good friend. I thank him kindly for his personal mention. \nI have had a long association with the U.S. Navy. I have learned more \nfrom them than they have ever learned from me, beginning as a young \nsailor a half century ago. I feel a strong obligation toward all men \nand women in the Armed Forces, as does my distinguished chairman, but \nthere is something very special about the U.S. Navy. I was privileged \nfor 5 years to serve as Under Secretary and Secretary many years ago. \nSo there will not be a gap. I thank my chairman for making that \npossible and allowing me to go forward with this nomination.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Has the Chair ruled on the request?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Consent has been granted.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank Senator Salazar for his patience. We wanted to get \nthese nominations completed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Has the Chair formally ruled on the nominations?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. And the President will be so notified?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I want to take this time to thank my good \nfriends and managers of this bill, and leaders of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Levin and Senator Warner, for moving forward and \nmoving quickly with the nomination of Admiral Roughead.\n  I mention this because I knew Admiral Roughead personally as he \nserved in the Pacific Command. I can recall how he was a great leader \nin the role of taking relief to the tsunami victims in the southeast \nAsia area of the Pacific while he was Deputy Commander of the U.S. \nPacific Command. He was recently the Commander of the U.S. Pacific \nFleet.\n  I had the great fortune to work with Admiral Roughead during his \ntenure as deputy commander, U.S. Pacific Command, and commander, U.S. \nPacific Fleet and was consistently impressed by his skills as \ncommanding officer, dedication to duty and commitment to protecting and \ndefending our Nation.\n  Since his graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1973, Admiral \nRoughead has served this country with absolute distinction in a variety \nof positions including most recently commander, U.S. Fleet Forces. In \nparticular, I want to note the leadership and compassion Admiral \nRoughead, as deputy commander, U.S. Pacific Command, displayed during \nthe United States Navy's participation in the international response to \nthe destruction following the December 2004 tsunami in South and \nSoutheast Asia. Similarly Admiral Roughead has demonstrated his deep \nunderstanding of the importance of honoring cultural diversity. In his \ncapacity as representative of our U.S. naval forces, he has truly \nembodied the true spirit of aloha in his interactions with the many \ndiverse communities in my home state of Hawaii.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with Admiral Roughead in his new \ncapacity and I am pleased to support his confirmation as chief of Naval \nOperations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/28/senate-section/article/S12327-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I, again, thank Senator Salazar.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I might ask my colleague, I think it is the intention \nof the leadership that this bill--I believe it is in the order--will be \nbrought up again on Monday, with the hope and expectation that we will \ncomplete the bill during the course of business on Monday.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. I think the unanimous consent \nagreement actually provides that all votes remaining on this bill begin \nat approximately 5:30. That is the expectation. And we again thank \neverybody who was involved in working out that unanimous consent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after Senator Salazar is \nrecognized, Senator Akaka be recognized at that point for his remarks \nin morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might add, earlier I had the \nopportunity, as did the chairman, to speak to Senator Akaka. Admiral \nRoughead served with great distinction in an assignment in Hawaii and \nis personally known to the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. \nAkaka.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to speak \nabout the Department of Defense authorization bill, which is a very \ngood bill that has been put together with the leadership of my good \nfriend, Senator Levin and Senator Warner, Senator McCain, and others, \nwho have been involved in this legislation. I come to the floor to \nspeak in support of this legislation, and I am certain when we get to \nMonday we will have a resounding adoption of this bill, which is so \nimportant to our men and women in uniform across the globe.\n  I will be supporting this legislation, but what will be missing from \nthis legislation is legislation that crafts a new way forward in Iraq, \na way forward that transitions our mission from one of combat, policing \na sectarian civil war, to one which is a limited mission that I believe \nboth Democrats and Republicans believe we should be able to attain in \nIraq.\n  It is in that context that I was proud to have been one of the \nparticipants in crafting the legislation that would have implemented \nthe recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. I thank the 17 cosponsors \nof that legislation for trying to help this body find a way out of the \nwilderness of Iraq and move forward with a bipartisan approach that \nwould unite our Nation behind an effort that we ultimately agree must \nresult in bringing our troops home from Iraq and maximizing the \npossibility for us to bring about some level of security in Iraq and \ndefend the strategic interests of the United States in that region and \naround the world.\n  But it wasn't only the 17 sponsors we had on the legislation which \nSenator Alexander and I crafted with the Iraq Study Group, there were \nalso other efforts that were underway in this Chamber during the last \nweek to try to figure out whether there was a common way forward. \nSenator Levin, Senator Voinovich, Senator Nelson, Senator Collins, and \nothers were very involved in that effort, and it is not over. My hope \nis that as we move forward in debating what is the foreign policy and \nnational security issue of our time that there may be a way in which we \ncan unite the country in a common way forward.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I want to \ncommend the Senator for the leadership he has taken in this area. I had \nthe opportunity to work with the Senator. As a matter of fact, one of \nthe amendments we jointly worked on eventually became law in the \nappropriations cycle that required Ambassador Crocker to come before \nthe Senate, General Petraeus to come before the Senate, and the \nPresident to make a report to the Nation.\n  We also created the Jones Commission. All of these matters had the \nSenator's support all along, and I wish to\n\n[[Page S12328]]\n\nsay that the Senator has been absolutely tireless in his efforts to try \nto help the Senate do the necessary oversight on this situation.\n  While we have not, in this current legislation, specific things--the \nSenator from Michigan brought up an amendment which failed. It should \nnot be looked at as a failure. The Senate is doing oversight. The \nSenate will continue every single day to give oversight on this \nsituation. But we also have to be respectful to the Constitution, which \ndelegates very carefully the responsibilities of the legislative \nbranch, i.e. the Senate and the House of Representatives, and that of \nthe President in his role as Commander in Chief, where specifically it \nis entrusted to the President to decide the strategy and the mission, \nand the Senate and the House are primarily responsible for the \nauthorization and appropriation of funds.\n  But it does not relieve in any way the obligation of this body to \nwatch what is taking place in Iraq, to give our best thought and \ncounsel to the executive branch--namely, the President--to try to bring \nabout an achievement of the basic goals of a free and sovereign and \nstable Iraq, which hopefully someday can join the other nations of the \nworld, particularly as it relates to the ongoing war with those who are \ntermed ``terrorists,'' for lack of a better term, who are challenging \nour respective countries, whether it is the United States or other \nnations in the world.\n  So I just wanted to thank the Senator for his leadership. Senator \nSalazar has done a marvelous job.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Virginia, and \nI will always remember my very first trip into that war-torn country of \nIraq was a trip that was led by Senator Warner and Senator Levin. It \nwas the Levin-Warner codel that went into Iraq to try to learn more \nabout what was happening in that country, to figure out a way in which \nwe might be able to move forward.\n  The Senator from Virginia is correct. I think the debate in this \nChamber and in this country has been helpful to bring about a better \nunderstanding and to deliver a message to the Iraqi people that we do \nnot have an open-ended commitment. I was proud to have been a part of \nsupporting the Senator from Virginia as we moved forward with \nthe legislation that included the benchmarks that are now part of our \nnational policy and that also required the General Accounting Office to \nreport on those benchmarks and created the Jones Commission to give us \nan independent assessment of the security situation on the ground. So I \nthink there has been progress that has been made.\n\n  But I would also respond to my good friend from Virginia, for whom I \nhave the greatest amount of respect, that it is important this debate \nbe one which we continue to have because it is the central foreign \npolicy and national security issue of our time. Even though we all \nunderstand we live under a constitution which has divided the powers \nbetween three branches of Government, we all know from the \njurisprudence of our past that the power of the President is, frankly, \nat its highest when, in fact, there is a relationship where he and the \nCongress agree on a way forward.\n  What we have seen over the last several years is a great division in \nthis country in terms of where many of the members of the legislative \nbranch of our Government is and where the President is. So I think our \ncontinuing efforts to try to find a way forward in a way that the \nSenator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, and others have been trying to do is \nsomething we should continue to do. I do not believe it is something \nthat at this point in time we should give up on because this issue is \ntoo important. It is too important for the 170,000 men and women \ncurrently serving in Iraq. It is too important to their families in the \nUnited States. It is too important to the fiscal consequence this war \nis bringing upon the United States.\n  So I am hopeful the dialogue that has taken place in the Senate over \nthe last week with different groups of Senators trying to find a common \nway forward ultimately will get us to success.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I assure my colleague that I fully \nanticipate we will have further debates on the very issues that have \nbeen of concern to my colleague from Colorado during the Defense \nappropriations bill, which we will be following up with at the \nconclusion of work on this bill.\n  But I point out that it has not all been lost. I will give the \nSenator specific examples. A number of us have indicated a desire to \nhave some of our troops brought home as early as possible, and the \nPresident initiated, after testimony by General Petraeus, the steps to \nstart bringing our troops home, some elements of them, before \nChristmas. He laid out a program for reduction in forces with an \nobjective to be at what we call a presurge force level by late next \nspring or very early next summer. So the voices in this Chamber are \nbeing heard.\n  I know personally that the President is quite anxious, more so than \nmost, to bring our forces home, but only after achievement of the goals \nfor which heavy sacrifices have been made. We are now crossing 3,800 \nwho have been lost and many others wounded. We must be certain that \ngreat sacrifice was not in vain.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a quick reaction?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There has been no one in this Chamber who has worked \nharder to try to bring enough Senators together to pass a resolution \ncalling for a change of course in Iraq than Senator Salazar. He has \nbeen absolutely intrepid. There is not a day that goes by when he is \nnot working with colleagues looking for a path forward where we can \naccomplish a change in course, where we could not only begin the \ntransition to a new mission--which is out of a civil war, out of the \nmiddle of this sectarian conflict--but also where there is, at a \nminimum, a goal set for the completion of that transition to those more \nlimited ambitions which would be supportive of Iraq, supportive of \ntheir army, but part of a change of policy which would force the Iraqis \nto finally take responsibility for their own country.\n  I just want to commend the Senator for his insistence. He has a \ntheme, and it is the correct theme, which is that a bipartisan solution \nand resolution is absolutely critical in foreign policy, and \nparticularly in war. There is no partisan position in war which is \nright for the Nation. It is always in the middle of a security \nconflict--as we are in the middle of now--where there has to be a \nbipartisan approach. The Senator from Colorado has pled for it, called \nfor it, worked for it, and has asserted his vast energy to try to \nachieve it.\n  We haven't accomplished it--it being 60 votes. The rules of the \nSenate are that it takes 60 votes to adopt something like this, and the \nIraq resolutions are operating under that rule, so we need to get the \n60. It is not because of a lack of effort on the part of many of us, \nbut surely Senator Salazar is at the head of that list. The Senator \nfrom Colorado has put forth such Herculean efforts to get to that mass \nof 60 who could agree on a formula that could represent those goals--to \nbegin the reduction of our troops and the transition to the new \nmissions, which are not in the middle of sectarian conflict but \nsupportive missions--and to have a binding period under Levin-Reed, and \nthen a goal under some permutation of Levin-Reed to accomplish that in \n9 months.\n  So I wanted to add my thanks to those of the Senator from Virginia, \nwho very appropriately interrupted the Senator from Colorado, and I \njoin in that interruption to thank him and to agree that the Senator \nfrom Virginia has been very much a part of an effort in this Senate to \nmove this process forward over the last few years. And I want to also \nadd my thanks to those of the Senator from Colorado of my dear friend \nfrom Virginia because he has played an important role to the extent \nthat we have been able to move this process forward. He has been in the \nmiddle of that movement.\n  It is not nearly enough from my perspective. We have obviously tried \nto get to Levin-Reed, which would change the course in Iraq, and we \nhaven't done that yet. But we are going to keep plugging away because \nit is critically important that we succeed in Iraq and that we \nrecognize that the only way we are going to succeed is if the Iraqi \nGovernment works out the political differences among them because there \nis\n\n[[Page S12329]]\n\nno military solution. And the only hope of success is if the Iraqi \nleaders finally do what they promised to do a year ago, which is to \nwork out their political differences.\n  If I could take one more minute of the Senator's time, there is a \nbook out recently about President Bush. I am trying to remember the \nname of the author, who had great access to the President. In this \nbook, in the appendix, there is a reference to the fact that I had \npreviously told the President that I and many others had taken the \nmessage to the Iraqi leaders that they have to change, they have to \nwork out their political differences; that the American people's \npatience has run out. The President was asked to refer to that and also \nto the debate on the Senate floor.\n  What was his reaction to these efforts to change course in Iraq and \nto tell the Iraqi leaders that it is their responsibility?\n  The President's response is interesting. He said, accurately, that \nwhen I told him this report, that a number of us go to Iraq repeatedly \nand tell the Iraqi leaders: You have lost the support of the American \npeople. You guys better get your political act together because, folks, \nwe are going to begin to reduce troops here. We can't save you from \nyourself--what was the President's response when I told him of that? He \nsaid:\n\n       Thank you, Senator. Thank you for carrying that message to \n     the Iraqi troops. They've got to hear that.\n\n  It was a positive response--not just to the message which many of us \nhave carried, including the Senator from Virginia, the Senator from \nColorado, and a dozen other Senators--but he thanked me and others for \ntelling the Iraqi leaders what he, I think it is clear, would like to \ntell them himself.\n  (Ms. KLOBUCHAR assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WARNER. I remember being in the Cabinet room when that dialog \ntook place.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And he confirmed it in this book.\n  Mr. WARNER. Interesting, but it is important we constantly reiterate \nthe message there is no military solution. As you well know in all the \nhearings of the Armed Services Committee, every uniformed officer has \ntold us that straightforwardly. They are carrying out their orders from \nthe President, but they are reminding us, the Congress and others, \nthere is no military solution. The solution has to come by \nreconciliation amongst the Iraqi people, and it is incumbent among the \ncurrent leadership to exercise their sovereign rights to do so.\n  I think we have generously taken up the time of our colleague.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I can take 10 more seconds, I thank the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Klobuchar, for helping me out with the name of the \nauthor. It is Robert Draper.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank my colleagues for the colloquy. I do think this \ndebate has had an impact. I do remember well the conversations we had \nin the room with the President after we came back from Iraq. There was \na conversation where the President said that our sending this message \nto the Iraqi people was a very important message, and certainly Senator \nLevin and Senator Warner have been a part of making sure that message \nis, in fact, heard.\n  Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business. Senators \nare allowed to speak up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent that I be given 10 more minutes \nto conclude my remarks on the Iraq Study Group.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, echoing off the comments of my \ncolleagues, I go back to the Iraq Study Group--some of the best that we \nhave in America--and the vision they set out in their recommendations, \nafter they spent a year, saying: We have this huge problem in Iraq. \nWhat is the best way that we move forward?\n  They came up with 79 recommendations on how we ought to move forward \nin Iraq. The heart of the recommendations is set forth in a letter that \nwas sent as part of that report by Congressman Hamilton and former \nSecretary James Baker. What they said is this, and I quote from the \nreport language that is also included in our legislation. It says:\n\n       Our political leaders must build a bipartisan approach to \n     bring a responsible conclusion to what is now a lengthy and \n     costly war. Our country deserves a debate that prizes \n     substance over rhetoric and a policy that is adequately \n     funded and sustainable. The President and Congress must work \n     together. Our leaders must be candid and forthright with the \n     American people in order to win their support.\n\n  It was in that vein that Democrats and Republicans came together to \ncosponsor the legislation on the implementation of the recommendations. \nI thank them for having stood up, in the sponsorship of the \nlegislation. They include Senator Mark Pryor from Arkansas, Senator Bob \nCasey from Pennsylvania, Senator Blanche Lincoln from Arkansas, Senator \nBill Nelson from Florida, Senator Mary Landrieu from Louisiana, Senator \nClaire McCaskill from Missouri, Senator Kent Conrad from North Dakota, \nSenator Tom Carper from Delaware. These are all good Senators who want \nto figure out a way forward in this issue that befuddles America today. \nBut it wasn't just Democrats who came with us to say we have to find a \nnew way forward in Iraq. There were Republicans who came forward and \njoined us. We saw Senator Lamar Alexander coming to the floor time and \ntime again, wanting to fashion a new way forward. He was joined by \nSenator Bob Bennett, Senator Judd Gregg, Senator Susan Collins, Senator \nJohn Sununu, Senator Pete Domenici, Senator Arlen Specter, and Senator \nNorm Coleman. At the end of the day, there were 17 cosponsors for this \nlegislation which only 10 months ago everybody would have come together \nand said this is the right way to go.\n  We remember those days before the Iraq Study Group recommendations \ncame out last December when it was highly anticipated. The President \neven delayed a speech and his own set of recommendations until he heard \nfrom the Iraq Study Group. Most people said this is a very thoughtful \nand good way forward.\n  I wanted to come to the floor today and say a few things about the \nlegislation. It is legislation which would have set forth a new state \nof law with respect to Iraq. Yes, we have had a tough time in the \nCongress, coming forward with legislation that can muster 60 votes in \nthe Senate, so not much legislation has been passed with respect to \ncreating a new direction for Iraq. Our legislation would have made it a \nstatement of policy--which in essence is a statement of law. This is \nnot a sense of the Senate, this is a statement of law. This would have \nbeen the law of the land with respect to the U.S. efforts concerning \nIraq. I wish to review a few provisions of the legislation.\n  The first of those has to do with the sense of the Congress that we \nmove forward with a major diplomatic surge in the region. That is a \nsense of Congress because, appropriately, that belongs with the \nPresident and with the State Department, in terms of what we have to do \nto reassert the international involvement to bring about a long-term \nsolution to the problem we face in Iraq. Similar to most of my \ncolleagues who traveled to Iraq in the last few years, I always wonder: \nWhere are the neighbors? Why aren't they more involved in dealing with \nthe issue that is so vitally important to the populations of all those \nin the Middle East? Where are they?\n  Some of them are sitting on their hands. Some of them who are not \nsitting on their hands are actually helping foment the violence we see \nin Iraq today, whether that is Iran or whether that is Syria. What we \nneed to do is have a diplomatic surge to move forward to help bring the \nworld together to find a solution that will work to bring about \nstability in Iraq. We set forth that as a sense of the Senate.\n  In addition to the sense of the Senate, which has some 24 measures, \nall of which were taken out of the Iraq Study Group recommendations, we \nalso include the statements of law. Those are the statements of policy. \nThe first and most important of those statements of policy is in \nsection 5 of the legislation. That section says ``it shall be''--``it \nshall be.'' Not it could be, not it might be, not it ought to be \nconsidered. It says: It shall be the policy of the United States to \nmove forward to a changed mission--to a changed mission\n\n[[Page S12330]]\n\nfrom one of combat to one of training, equipping, advising and \nproviding support for security and military forces in Iraq and to \nsupport counterterrorism operations in the country of Iraq. So we do a \nmission change with this legislation.\n  Next, also the statement of law, we call for the strengthening of the \nU.S. military. I think there is a broad, bipartisan consensus that what \nhas happened in the war in Iraq and in Afghanistan is that our military \nhas been strained. Our military has been strained because of the \nhumongous effort that has gone into prosecuting the war in those two \nplaces over the last 5\\1/2\\ years. So we, in our legislation, follow \nthe recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, requiring the \nstrengthening of the U.S. military.\n  Third, a statement of policy with respect to the police and criminal \njustice system in Iraq. On several of the codels I have taken to Iraq, \none of the things that is absolutely phenomenal to me is that there is \nnot a criminal justice system that today is working in Iraq. So the bad \nguys, when they are caught--what ends up happening to them? Are they \nprosecuted in the way that we would prosecute bad guys here in the \nUnited States of America? Is there a system of courts that is up and \nfunctioning? The police system, especially the national police in Iraq, \nis dysfunctional. It is infiltrated by members of the militias. Those \nare some of the findings of the GAO, as well as some of the findings in \nGeneral Jones' recent report. So one of the things we require as a \nstatement of policy is that the police and criminal justice system in \nIraq be transformed.\n  Also in our legislation we required the statement of policy on the \noil sector in Iraq. We know the Iraqis need to come up with a \nreformation of their law and with changes to their law that will \nrequire the equitable distribution of the oil resources in Iraq.\n  There are other measures here that are set forth in the legislation. \nOne that I will refer to briefly has to do with conditions and the \nsupport of the United States in Iraq. This is section 11 of our \nlegislation. In section 11 of our legislation we say: It shall be the \npolicy of the United States to condition continued U.S. political, \nmilitary and economic support for Iraq upon the demonstration by the \nGovernment of Iraq of sufficient political will and the making of \nsubstantial progress toward achieving the milestones that are described \nin that legislation. So the conditioning of the U.S. support for Iraq \nis based on them taking on the responsibility for achieving the \nmilestones that were set forth in the Iraq Study Group's \nrecommendation.\n  Those are major changes. I believe this legislation--although there \nis other legislation here that I have supported, including legislation \nthat called for timelines with respect to the reduction of troops--this \nlegislation also is very good and very substantive legislation.\n  Let me essentially sum up what this legislation would have done. The \nfirst thing it would have done is call for the mission change. I think \nmore and more I hear a chorus rising in the Senate, in many of the \npieces of legislation that we have seen, that it is time for us to \nchange the mission from one of combat to one of assistance; from one of \ncombat, where we are policing a sectarian civil war today, to one of \ntraining and equipping and counterterrorism within Iraq. That change of \nmission is something we ought to be able to accomplish in the Senate.\n  Second, the diplomatic surge. We know without the diplomatic surge we \nare not going to be able to succeed in Iraq. We know we need to have \nthe neighborhood, the region, much more involved in trying to bring \nabout stability in Iraq.\n  Third, the conditioning of the U.S. support on progress and on the \nmilestones set forth there.\n  I think, regarding these broad agreements, we need to keep pressuring \nthe Iraqis to move forward to adopt those, not only to adopt, implement \nthe milestones and benchmarks they themselves came up with.\n  Let me conclude by saying this debate is not yet over. There are \nstill groups, numbers of Senators, who are trying to figure out whether \nwe can bring enough of a bipartisan way forward that will help us \nchange the mission in Iraq. I look forward to working with both my \nDemocratic and Republican colleagues, seeing whether we can in fact \nachieve that end.\n  At the end of the day, there is a lot at stake in this issue for all \nof us in America. When one thinks, first of all, about the fact that we \nare approaching 4,000 of our best, our bravest men and women who have \ndied in this war in Iraq, and we know as a fact we have 30,000 American \nmen and women in uniform who have been grievously injured in that \nnation; we know the fiscal consequence of this war is now $750 billion \nand rising--expectations now are that the war costs will be at $1 \ntrillion--we as a Senate and Congress have a responsibility, in my \nview, to address this issue.\n  I hope, in the days ahead, as we address the Defense appropriations \nlegislation, as well as the supplemental which the President has \nrequested--additional money for the ongoing effort, the so-called \nbridge funding--that we can revisit this issue and see whether we can \ncome together to try to forge a new way forward in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/28/senate-section/article/S12330-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12330-S12331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AMERICA'S NORTHERN BORDER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise today to shed light on a \nserious national security vulnerability facing our Nation, a dangerous \ngap in the United States-Canadian border. For the past 2 weeks, we have \nbeen debating the Department of Defense authorization bill, a bill that \nauthorizes many of the programs that keep us safe from foreign \nterrorists on foreign soil.\n  What we have not been focused on in these 2 weeks is the threat that \ncomes when people cross our own borders without inspection. In fact, I \nwould argue we haven't been focusing on this problem enough this year. \nWe haven't taken the steps necessary to keep our borders, particularly \nthe northern border, safe.\n  That is simply unacceptable. It is no secret that today our \nimmigration system is in shambles. To say our borders are not secure is \nan incredible understatement. Although most of my Republican colleagues \nwould agree with me, they have failed to take comprehensive action. So \nour borders remain unsafe and insecure.\n  Securing our borders is a catchy political phrase, a sound bite \nguaranteed to get on the evening news. And 99 percent of the time, it \nis used in reference to our southern borders. Stories run with pictures \nof immigrants crossing the United States-Mexico border as politicians \nlament about the dangers these immigrants pose, those who would be \ngardeners, nannies, busboys, and maids.\n  It is as if no one remembers that this country has a northern border \nas well, a porous border that represents just as many problems and \ndangers. Today, I hope that will change. The Government Accountability \nOffice has released a report detailing the vulnerabilities of our \nnorthern border, and people are starting to pay attention. MSNBC is \neven showing images of people carrying bags and boxes across the border \nwithout any inspection whatsoever.\n  I hope my colleagues are as attentive as the media is on this issue. \nLet me take a moment to read some of the Government Accountability \nOffice's report.\n  It said:\n\n       Our visits [referring to the GAO's investigations of the \n     Northern border] show that Customs and Border Protection \n     faces significant challenges in effectively monitoring the \n     border and preventing undetected entry into the United \n     States. Our work shows that a determined cross-border \n     violator would likely be able to bring radioactive materials \n     or other contraband undetected into the United States by \n     crossing the United States-Canadian border at any of the \n     locations we investigated.\n\n  Think about that for a moment. The Government Accountability Office \nis saying that terrorists are currently able to smuggle radiological, \nbiological, or chemical weapons into our country without much \ndifficulty. If this were to happen, our worst nightmare scenario would \nbecome a reality.\n  Millions could be killed from a single barbaric act. Right now, this \nvery day, such an action is possible because of our lack of border \nsecurity, our lack of northern border security.\n  Now, this report may be a recent release, but the vulnerabilities it \nrevealed are old news. In July, during the\n\n[[Page S12331]]\n\ndebate over the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill, \nSenator Salazar and I introduced an amendment that was approved, \ncompelling the President and the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nimprove security at our northern border until they are able to certify \nthat they have 100 percent operational control of the border.\n  We introduced this amendment because the Bush administration was not \nliving up to the requirements of existing law. The law requires, \nrequires--does not suggest, does not allow, it requires--that 20 \npercent of all new border agents be sent to the northern border. But \nthe administration has flaunted that requirement. In fact, only 965 \nagents out of a total of 13,488 agents are stationed in the North--only \n7 percent. And that is after the number of agents actually decreased by \nnearly 9 percent from fiscal year 2005 to 2006.\n  Such numbers are ludicrous when you consider that our northern border \nspans over 5,525 miles and is almost three times as large as the 1,993-\nmile southern border; almost three times as large, yet it is allocated \nan infinitesimal amount of our overall border security.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues will argue that the risk of \nterrorism is much greater from our border with Mexico than our border \nwith Canada. But they would be flat wrong. History has proven that \ntoday. Let me recite some of it.\n  Over the last several years, nearly 69,000 individuals have been \napprehended crossing the northern border. That is the tip of the \niceberg as countless others have crossed the border illegally without \napprehension because, notwithstanding the law, the administration has \nonly got a handful of people up on the border that is almost three \ntimes as long as the southern border.\n  So we have no idea what the magnitude of this vulnerability is or \nwhat consequences will result from the administration's dereliction of \nduty. We know terrorists seek to exploit vulnerabilities. I created the \nfirst task force on homeland security when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives. I sat on the select committee that created the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. I was the chief Democratic negotiator \nfor the first element of the 9/11 bill. I have spent a lot of time on \nthis issue. The one thing we can be assured of is that terrorists don't \ncontinuously operate in the same way. They study, and seek to exploit, \nvulnerabilities. We know they study how our Nation works and where the \nholes in our security are. We can be sure they will seek out the \neasiest path of entry to the United States, and right now that path is \nthrough the northern border where it can be easy to avoid the mere 965 \nagents scattered along more than 5,500 miles.\n  Those agents are not all on duty at one time. They go through a \nrotational system. They have 8-hour shifts. That means only a third of \nthose people are covering the northern border at any given time of day.\n  I remind my colleagues that in 1999, Ahmed Ressam, the millennium \nbomber, because he came at the time we were ready to turn to the year \n2000, snuck in through the northern border to kill as many American \ncitizens in cold blood as possible. Although we were able to stop Ahmed \nRessam from carrying out his deadly plans, we do not appear to have \nlearned any lessons from this near catastrophe. That incident should \nhave been a wake-up call illustrating the vulnerabilities of our \nnorthern border and the dire need to remedy them. But instead we remain \ncomplacent, focusing the Senate and the Nation on a more politically \nattractive issue, our southern border. If I am a terrorist seeking to \ncommit an act against the United States, I am going to go to the course \nof least resistance. If I have nearly 12,500 border agents at one \nborder and 900 some odd in another border, what are my chances? Where \nam I better off, especially when that border is three times the size of \nthe southern border? Where am I better off to try to cross to the \nUnited States and do harm?\n  We must never order our security priorities based on the political \nwinds of the time. We must examine the evidence and analyze the risks \nand implement the strongest, most appropriate national defense strategy \nthat ignores the unfounded, often bigoted fears that currently \ninfluence the debate. If you are concerned about terrorists, as we all \nshould be, you should be concerned about the state of both of our \nborders.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with us in pressuring the administration \nto take its border security responsibilities more seriously and to send \nour resources out where we need them. Trying to secure our Nation by \nfocusing on only one of two borders is a recipe for disaster. You \neither protect the entire country or you have protected none of it.\n  If my Republican colleagues do not join us soon to secure our \nnorthern border, then I question their motives in past debates on \nimmigration. I wonder whether they are more concerned about the \nethnicity of immigrants crossing the border than the threats they \npresent. I hope this newly released GAO report will be a call to action \nfor my colleagues from both sides of the aisle. I hope they will \nsupport efforts to secure our northern border and make our Nation more \nsecure. This is too important an issue to allow partisan politics to \nplay a role.\n  I will continue to fight to secure the northern border, the southern \nborder, and all other points of entry, including those by water and by \naviation.

Madam President, on September 30, the people of Ukraine \nwill return to the ballot box to vote in critical parliamentary \nelections. I rise today to express my hope that Ukraine preserves and \nextends the tremendous accomplishments they have achieved in \nestablishing a stable and representative government.\n  I was privileged to represent our country as President Bush's \npersonal representative for the November 21, 2004, presidential runoff \nelection in Ukraine. I was not an advocate of either candidate in the \nelection. My focus was to stress free and fair election procedures that \nwould strengthen worldwide respect for the legitimacy of the winning \ncandidate.\n  The 2004 campaign for president in Ukraine had been marked by \nwidespread political intimidation and failure to give equal coverage to \ncandidates in the media. Physical intimidation of voters and illegal \nuse of governmental administrative and legal authorities had been \nevident and persistent.\n  Unfortunately the situation worsened on the day of the runoff \nelection. The government of then-President Kuchma allowed, or aided and \nabetted, wholesale fraud and abuse that changed the results of the \nelection. It was clear that Prime Minister Yanukovich, a position that \nhe again holds today, did not win the 2004 election despite erroneous \nelection announcements and calls of congratulations from Moscow.\n  I joined thousands of election observers who were sent by the United \nStates and European states through organizations such as the National \nEndowment for Democracy, the Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe, and the European Network of Election Monitoring \nOrganizations. Most importantly, more than 10,000 Ukrainian citizens \nwere organized by the Committee of Voters of Ukraine to carefully \nobserve individual polling stations. These observers outlined an \nextensive list of serious procedural violations.\n  Even in the face of these attempts to end any hope of a free and fair \nelection, I was inspired by the courage of so many citizens of Ukraine \ndemonstrating their passion for free expression and for a truly \ndemocratic Ukraine. As corrupt authorities tried to disrupt, frighten, \nand intimidate citizens, brave Ukrainians pushed back by continuing to \ndo their best to keep the election on track and to prevent chaos.\n  The day after the runoff election, I told the international and local \npress and the people of Ukraine through a\n\n[[Page S12332]]\n\nlive television broadcast in Kyiv that President Kuchma had the \nresponsibility and the opportunity to produce an outcome that was fair \nand responsible. I pointed out that he would enhance his legacy by \nprompt and decisive action that maximized worldwide confidence in the \npresidency of Ukraine and the extraordinary potential of that country.\n  That day, the people of Ukraine demanded change and the Orange \nRevolution was born. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians rallied and \nmarched in Kyiv and other cities around the country. There commitment \nto democracy was heard loud and clear. The Central Election Commission \nthat oversaw the flawed runoff election was fired. A new commission was \nappointed and a new election law was agreed to by all parties in an \neffort to eliminate fraud.\n  While the Orange Revolution had a few more twists and turns to \nnavigate, on December 26, 2004, Ukraine's maturing democracy held free \nand fair elections. For the first time, Ukraine enjoyed the fruits of a \ntrue democratic process and elected a representative government. The \npeople of Ukraine built upon their 2004 achievement by holding free and \nfair parliamentary elections in 2006. What made this accomplishment \neven more notable was that the 2006 results favored the party that had \nbeen voted out of office in 2004, a testament to the fairness of the \nprocess. Now it is time for the Government of Ukraine to preserve and \nextend the impressive gains and to provide a stable and representative \ngovernment by holding another free and fair parliamentary election.\n  The people of Ukraine deserve a representative government that will \nwork together to improve the quality of life in that country. In the \nyears since the Orange Revolution, Ukraine has enjoyed a strong \ncommitment to human rights and the rule of law, a growing free press, \nand a rapidly improving independent judiciary. Free and fair elections \non September 30 will mark another important step in the right \ndirection.\n  I encourage the Ukrainian people to continue their march to true \nfreedom and democracy. A democratic Ukraine is in the national security \ninterests of all parties.\n  The candidates and leaders of Ukraine must replicate their efforts of \n2004 and 2006 and conduct these elections consistent with the standards \nestablished by the OSCE. A fraudulent and illegal election would be a \nmajor defeat for democracy and leave Ukraine crippled. The new \nparliament would lack legitimacy with the Ukrainian people and the \ninternational community.\n  Free and fair elections are the first step, but they are not the \nlast. The elected leaders of Ukraine must overcome their past \ndifferences and govern together. In recent years, opportunities have \nbeen lost because of the failure of governmental leaders to unite and \nconstructively work across party and ideological lines. A government \nthat is committed to working together to improve the lives of the \npeople, despite ideological differences will assist the people of \nUkraine in reaching their full potential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/28/senate-section/article/S12332-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12332-S12333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, the rising number of Americans \nwithout health insurance is a problem that is recognized by all Members \nof this body. There are some 46.6 million Americans today who are not \nreceiving proper medical care.\n  Compounding the problem is the reality that, as my colleague from \nOregon--Senator Wyden--likes to say, we do not have a health care \nsystem in this country; we have a sick care system.\n  As we look at the growing cost to our economy that health care \nrepresents, the number one thing we can do today to reduce that cost is \npreventative medicine--making sure that Americans can access health \ncare today, so that they are not sick tomorrow.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program is an important means to \nprovide the most vulnerable of our population--our children--with \nhealth care. And we all know that when our children are sick, it is not \njust the child that is impacted but the parents as well; missing time \nat work to care for their child or catching the latest bug their child \nbrings home from the daycare center. The social and economic impact of \na sick child goes well beyond the need for cough syrup or a band-aid. \nAnd the impact is even greater in our Native communities.\n  Section 401 of the CHIP reauthorization bill provides $10 million in \ngrants for child health studies, including: preventative health care, \ntreatment for chronic and acute conditions, and discovery of knowledge \ngaps within CHIP and child health. Studies such as these will help to \nnarrow the gap in treatment disparities among native and non-White \nchildren, as well as to provide preventive health care services so our \nchildren stay healthy while reducing the expensive costs of sick care \nin America.\n  This is just one reason why it is important that programs such as \nCHIP continue their viability. If the President vetoes the bill as he \nsaid he would, the resulting straight reauthorization of CHIP at the \ncurrent baseline assumption means that 800,000 children currently \nenrolled in CHIP would lose their coverage. But under the CHIP \nreauthorization bill, those children, plus 4 million more children \nwould be able to access health care--preventive care.\n  We should not have to read about tragedies such as 12-year old \nDeamonte Driver from Maryland who died from a tooth abscess. Deamonte's \nlife could have been saved by a routine $80 tooth extraction but his \nfamily was booted from Medicaid and his mother couldn't afford to pay \nfor Deamonte to receive the necessary dental care. Deamonte Driver died \nin February of this year.\n  This heartbreaking story is just one example of why the \nreauthorization of CHIP--at the Finance Committee passed levels--is so \nimportant. 800,000 more children should not be put in a similar \nposition as Deamonte.\n  In addition, outreach programs will allow more children to be \nenrolled in the CHIP and Medicaid programs. This bill provides $100 \nmillion in grants for outreach and reenrollment efforts--$10 million \nwill provide grants to Indian organizations to improve enrollment of \nNative Americans. Another $10 million will be spent on a national \noutreach program and the remaining $80 million will target rural areas \nwith high rates of eligible but not enrolled children, racial and \nethnic minorities and populations with cultural barriers to enrollment.\n  But CHIP is only one part of the health care struggle. As I noted \nbefore, some 46.6 million Americans are without health care insurance. \nIn my State of Alaska, about one out of six people do not have health \ninsurance. And the sad reality is that most of those without health \ninsurance are employed. Only 1 in 10 of the uninsured in Alaska are \nunemployed people in the workforce.\n  For every family that is covered through an employer-based health \ncare policy or is able to purchase their own health care insurance, \nfewer adults and children will rely on Medicaid and CHIP for their \nhealth care needs, and create less of a strain on Federal resources.\n  We know that preventive care is much more effective, both medically \nand economically, than caring for an illness. Likewise, providing our \nbusinesses with the ability to offer affordable health care insurance \nto their employees is a preventative means to lower the Federal \nGovernment's costs as mandatory spending for health care programs takes \nup a greater and greater portion of the Federal budget.\n  Until we reach the point where we in Congress can agree on how to \naddress the future of our Nation's health care policies, however, \nprograms like CHIP are needed to ensure that those who are most \nvulnerable are not left out.\n  I support this reauthorization bill as a temporary fix of a long \nstanding problem, but we as a Congress must be willing to take a \nserious look at the future of our health care system, and ask ourselves \nif we are serious about fixing it. It is a decision that will impact \nmillions of Americans. I urge the President to support the CHIP bill to \nallow more American children access to the healthcare they need to stay \nhealthy, to stay alert and to function well in school. The best \ninvestment we can make is in our children and by signing the CHIP bill, \nthe President can grant our future generation of over 10 million \nchildren access to vital health care services.\n\n[[Page S12333]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/28/senate-section/article/S12332-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12332-S12333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Madam President, it is with great honor that I rise today \nin order to recognize the heroism of Marine PFC C. Stuart Upchurch, \nSr., and Marine Cpl Richard E. Vana.\n  The Battle of Okinawa, fought on the Japanese island of Okinawa, was \nthe largest amphibious assault during the Pacific Campaigns of World \nWar II. The battle lasted from late March through June 1945, and was \nthe last major campaign of the War in the Pacific. The battle has been \nreferred to as the ``Typhoon of Steel'' in English, and tetsu no ame--\n``Rain of Steel''--in Japanese. These nicknames refer to the ferocity \nof the fighting, the intensity of gunfire, and sheer numbers of Allied \nships and armored vehicles that assaulted the island. More ships were \nused, troops put ashore, supplies transported, bombs dropped, and naval \nguns fired against shore targets than any other operation in the \nPacific.\n  There were over 72,000 United States casualties at Okinawa, of which \n12,513 were killed or missing.\n  In the last days of the Battle for Okinawa, PFC C. Stuart Upchurch, \nSr., and Cpl Richard E. Vana were marines assigned to the 2nd Squad, \n3rd Platoon, Baker Company, 4th Regiment, 6th Marine Division.\n  On or about June 1, 1945, Baker Company came under heavy Japanese \nmortar fire. Corporal Vana and Private First Class Upchurch were on the \nway back to their unit, having filled in at Charlie Company's defensive \nline the night before. With no foxhole of their own, Vana and Upchurch \njumped into the first position they could find, sharing the foxhole \nwith a new lieutenant and another marine.\n  When a nearby foxhole was struck by enemy mortar fire, a marine \nmanning the position could be heard crying for help. Under the \nonslaught of constant enemy fire, and with complete disregard for their \nown well being, Vana and Upchurch ran up the hill to assist the \nmarines. Inside the foxhole that took a direct hit, they found ``Red'' \nand Richey, cousins from the Boston area. ``Red'' had been fatally \nwounded and Richey was seriously injured. Richey was suffering from a \nlife threatening arterial wound to the upper thigh.\n  Still under the barrage of Japanese mortars, Vana and Upchurch \nproceeded to drag Richey out of the foxhole and down the hill. Upchurch \nthen carried the marine while Vana provided protective cover. They made \nway for a cave which was being used as an aid station. Inside the cave, \nVana and Upchurch provided critical lifesaving first-aid until a \ncorpsman was able to assist.\n  Without the selfless and courageous actions of Vana and Upchurch, \nRichey would have perished from his severe wounds. Their actions \nexemplify the Marine Corps motto ``Semper Fidelis,'' meaning ``Always \nFaithful.''\n  PFC C. Stuart Upchurch, Sr., and Cpl Richard E. Vana's gallant \nactions in close contact with the enemy, and unyielding courage and \nbravery, are in the highest traditions of military service, and reflect \ngreat credit upon themselves, their unit, the U.S. Marine Corps, and \nthe United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/28/senate-section/article/S12333-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO JUDGE RICHARD SHEPPARD ARNOLD\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, this morning in Little Rock, \nAR, at 10 a.m. local time, the new annex to the Richard Sheppard Arnold \nUnited States Courthouse will be dedicated. In honor of that event, I \nwanted to take a moment to reflect on the life of Judge Arnold and the \ncontributions he made to Arkansas and this nation.\n  Judge Richard Arnold served his Nation with honor and distinction in \nthe Federal judiciary for a little over 25 years. Considered by some to \nbe the greatest jurist of his time not to serve on the Supreme Court, \nJudge Arnold was respected for his reasoned, straightforward decisions \nthat he rendered from the bench without any ideological bias. In short, \nhe was a brilliant, fair, effective judge.\n  His colleagues in the legal community recognized his brilliance. In \n1999, Judge Arnold was awarded the highly prestigious Edward J. Devitt \nDistinguished Service to Justice Award. This honor is presented to a \nFederal judge who has achieved an exemplary career and has made \nsignificant contributions to the administration of justice, the \nadvancement of the rule of law, and the improvement of society as a \nwhole.\n  Judge Arnold also received the prestigious Meador-Rosenberg Award \nfrom the American Bar Association for his work and dialogue with \nmembers of Congress about the problems facing the Federal courts during \nhis service as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the Judicial \nConference of the United States. The award, which has only been \npresented five times since its inception in 1994, was presented through \nthe ABA's Standing Committee of Federal Judicial Improvements.\n  Born in Texarkana, TX, in 1936, Judge Arnold and his younger brother, \nU.S. District Court Judge Morris ``Buzz'' Arnold, had many role models \nin their early life that were active in the legal community. Their \nfather, Richard Lewis Arnold, was a public utilities law specialist, \nand their paternal grandfather, William H. Arnold, Sr., was a circuit \njudge and former Arkansas Bar Association President. In addition, their \nmaternal grandfather was U.S. Senator Morris Sheppard of Texas.\n  Judge Arnold received a Classical Diploma from Phillips Exeter \nAcademy in 1953. He graduated from Yale with a B.A., summa cum laude, \nin 1957. Afterwards, Judge Arnold attended the Harvard Law School where \nhe received the Sears Prize for achieving the best grades in the first-\nyear class and the Fay Diploma for being first academically in his \ngraduating class. Judge Arnold concluded his formal education upon \nreceiving his LL.B. from Harvard magna cum laude in 1960.\n  After law school, Judge Arnold served as a law clerk to Justice \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr. Arnold then practiced law in Washington, D.C., \nand Texarkana, Arkansas. After serving the Honorable Dale Bumpers while \nBumpers was Governor of Arkansas and a United States Senator, Judge \nArnold was appointed to the federal judiciary by President Jimmy Carter \nin 1978. He served on the District Bench for the Eastern and Western \nDistricts of Arkansas and was elevated to the Eighth Circuit Court of \nAppeals in 1980. He was Chief Judge for the Circuit from 1992-1998 and \nachieved senior status in April 2001 after he turned 65.\n  In 2003, Congress renamed the U.S. District Courthouse for Eastern \nArkansas the Richard Sheppard Arnold United States Courthouse. Judge \nArnold continued to live a full life until he succumbed to \ncomplications while being treated for lymphoma in 2004. His passing has \nleft a void, but his legacy continues to live on at the courthouse that \nbears his name in Little Rock.\n  The recent addition of the annex will bring 21st Century changes to \nthe Richard S. Arnold Courthouse originally built in 1932. A beautiful \nglass atrium will connect the original structure to the new wing. The \nannex will house 12 judges' chambers, courtrooms, and a parking garage. \nIn addition, the exterior will feature a fountain and water sculpture, \nas well as a beautiful plaza. The design that is dedicated today will \nensure that Judge Arnold will be remembered and his name will continue \nto live on for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/28/senate-section/article/S12333-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12333-S12334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PAT FARR RECOGNITION\n\n Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I would like to recognize Pat Farr \nfor his service as the executive director of FOOD for Lane County. A \nveteran of the Oregon State legislature, the Eugene City Council, and \nthe Oregon Commission for Child Care, Mr. Farr has dedicated himself to \nbettering the lives of Oregonians.\n  Mr. Farr accepted his position at FOOD for Lane County with three \ngoals in mind: create financial stability, develop a strong staff, and \nrestore the agency's public image. During Mr. Farr's tenure, all of \nthese goals were accomplished. The agency has been lifted out of debt \nand into financial sustainability; a base of reserves has been created \nto increase long-term stability and improve donor confidence; and both \nthe number of volunteers and the amount of distribution have been \nincreased.\n  FOOD for Lane County is an important member of the community, \nproviding food assistance to the many Lane County residents who are \nstill unsure when their next meal will be. The\n\n[[Page S12334]]\n\norganization distributes more than 7 million pounds of food each year, \nenough for 22 emergency food pantries and more than 70 hunger relief \ncenters. The agency also plays a critical role assisting our youth, as \none out of three children in Lane County will eat from an emergency \nfood box or a subsidized meal program.\n  Mr. Farr recently left FOOD for Lane County to work as a consultant \nfor nonprofits. I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to Mr. \nFarr for his distinguished work and unwavering commitment to serving \nhis community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/28/senate-section/article/S12334-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:05 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby one of its clerks, announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3121.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat corporate tax benefits based upon stock option compensation \nexpenses be consistent with accounting expenses shown in corporate \nfinancial statements for such compensation; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is a growing chasm in our country \nbetween the amount of money paid to our corporate executives and the \nearnings of the rank and file workers.\n  J.P. Morgan once said that executive pay should not exceed 20 times \naverage worker pay. In the U.S., in 1990, average pay for the chief \nexecutive officer, CEO, of a large U.S. corporation was 100 times \naverage worker pay; in 2004, the difference was 300 times; today, it is \nnearly 400 times.\n  The single biggest factor responsible for this massive pay gap is \nstock options. Stock options are a huge contributor to executive pay. A \nkey factor encouraging companies to pay their executives with stock \noptions is a set of outdated and misguided Federal tax provisions that \nfavor stock options over other types of compensation. That is why I am \nintroducing today a bill to eliminate federal corporate tax breaks that \ngive special tax treatment to corporations that pay their executives \nwith stock options. It's called the Ending Corporate Tax Favors for \nStock Options Act.\n  This bill has been endorsed by the Consumer Federation of America, \nCitizens for Tax Justice, the Tax Justice Network--USA, OMBWatch, the \nFinancial Policy Forum, and the AFL-CIO, each of which sees it as \nneeded to eliminate federal tax breaks providing special tax favors for \ncorporations that issue large stock option grants to their executives.\n  Stock options give employees the right to buy company stock at a set \nprice for a specified period of time, typically 10 years. Virtually \nevery CEO in America is paid with stock options, which are a major \ncontributor to sky-high executive pay.\n  According to Forbes magazine, in 2006, the average pay of CEOs at 500 \nof the largest U.S. companies was $15.2 million. Nearly half of that \namount, 48 percent, came from stock options that had been cashed in for \nan average gain of about $7.3 million. In 2006, one CEO cashed in stock \noptions for about $290 million; another cashed them in for about $270 \nmillion. Forbes also published a list of 30 CEOs who, in 2006, each had \nat least $100 million in vested stock options that had yet to be \nexercised. Corporate executives are, in short, showered with stock \noptions and the millions of dollars they produce.\n  A key reason behind this flood of executive stock options is the tax \ncode which, when combined with certain U.S. accounting rules, favors \nthe issuance of stock option grants. Right now, U.S. accounting rules \nrequire companies to report their stock option expenses one way on the \ncorporate books, while Federal tax rules require them to report the \nsame stock options a completely different way on their tax returns. In \nmost cases, the resulting book expense is far smaller than the \nresulting tax deduction. That means, under current U.S. accounting and \ntax rules, stock option tax deductions often far exceed the stock \noption expenses recorded by the companies.\n  Stock options are the only type of compensation where the Federal tax \ncode permits companies to claim a bigger deduction on their tax returns \nthan the corresponding expense on their books. For all other types of \ncompensation, cash, stock, bonuses, and more, the tax return deduction \nequals the book expense. In fact, companies cannot deduct more than the \ncompensation expense shown on their books, because that would be tax \nfraud. The sole exception to this rule is stock options. In the case of \nstock options, the tax code allows companies to claim a tax deduction \nthat can be two, three, even ten times larger than the actual expense \nshown on their books.\n  When a company's compensation committee learns that stock options can \nproduce a low compensation expense on the books, while generating a \ngenerous tax deduction that is multiple times larger, it is a pretty \ntempting proposition for the company to pay its executives with stock \noptions instead of cash or stock. It is a classic case of U.S. tax \npolicy creating an unintended incentive for corporations to act.\n  The problem is that these mismatched stock option accounting and tax \nrules also shortchange the Treasury to the tune of billions of dollars \neach year, while fueling the growing chasm between executive pay and \naverage worker pay. This same mismatch also results in companies \nreporting one set of stock option compensation expenses to investors \nand the public through their public financial statements, and a \ncompletely different set of expenses to the Internal Revenue Service on \ntheir tax returns. Such huge book-tax disparities breed confusion, \ndistrust, and schemes to maximize the differences.\n  The bill I am introducing today would put an end to these \ncontradictions and to the harmful, unintended consequences that have \nresulted. It would put a stop to the stock option book-tax disparity, \nan end to the conflicting stock option expenses reported to investors \nand Uncle Sam, and an end to the special tax treatment that currently \nfuels excessive stock option compensation.\n  To understand why this bill is needed it helps to understand how \nstock option accounting and tax rules got so out of kilter with each \nother in the first place.\n  Calculating the cost of stock options may sound straightforward, but \nfor years, companies and their accountants engaged the Financial \nAccounting Standards Board, FASB, in an all-out, knock-down battle over \nhow companies should record stock option compensation expenses on their \nbooks.\n  U.S. publicly traded corporations are required by law to follow \nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles, GAAP, issued by FASB, which \nis overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC. For many \nyears, GAAP allowed U.S. companies to issue stock options to employees \nand, unlike any other type of compensation, report a zero compensation \nexpense on their books, so long as, on the grant date, the stock \noption's exercise price equaled the market price at which the stock \ncould be sold.\n  Assigning a zero value to stock options that routinely produced \nmillions of dollars in executive pay provoked deep disagreements within \nthe accounting community. In 1993, FASB proposed assigning a ``fair \nvalue'' to stock options on the date they are granted to an employee, \nusing a mathematical valuation tool such as the Black Scholes model. \nFASB proposed further that companies include that amount as a \ncompensation expense on\n\n[[Page S12336]]\n\ntheir financial statements. Critics responded that it was impossible \naccurately to estimate the value of executive stock options on their \ngrant date. A bruising battle over stock option expensing followed, \ninvolving the accounting profession, corporate executives, FASB, the \nSEC, and Congress.\n  In the end, after years of fighting and negotiation, FASB issued a \nnew accounting standard, Financial Accounting Standard, FAS, 123R, \nwhich was endorsed by the SEC and became mandatory for all publicly \ntraded corporations in 2005. In essence, FAS 123R requires all \ncompanies to record a compensation expense equal to the fair value on \ngrant date of all stock options provided to an employee in exchange for \nthe employee's services.\n  The details of this accounting rule are complex, because they reflect \nan effort to accommodate varying viewpoints on the true cost of stock \noptions. Companies are allowed to use a variety of mathematical models, \nfor example, to calculate a stock option's fair value. Option grants \nthat vest over time are expensed over the specified period so that, for \nexample, a stock option which vests over four years results in 25 \npercent of the cost being expensed each year. If a stock option grant \nnever vests, the rule allows any previously booked expense to be \nrecovered. On the other hand, stock options that do vest are required \nto be fully expensed, even if never exercised, because the compensation \nwas actually awarded. These and other provisions of this hard-fought \naccounting rule reflect painstaking judgments on how to show a stock \noption's value.\n  Opponents of the new accounting rule had predicted that, if \nimplemented, it would severely damage U.S. capital markets. They warned \nthat stock option expensing would eliminate corporate profits, \ndiscourage investment, depress stock prices, and stifle innovation. \nLast year, 2006, was the first year in which all U.S. publicly traded \ncompanies were required to expense stock options. Instead of tumbling, \nboth the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq turned in strong \nperformances, as did initial public offerings by new companies. The \ndire predictions were flat out wrong.\n  During the years the battle raged over stock option accounting, \nrelatively little attention was paid to the taxation of stock options. \nSection 83 of the tax code, first enacted in 1969 and still in place \nafter more than three decades, is the key statutory provision. It \nessentially provides that, when an employee exercises compensatory \nstock options, the employee must report as income the difference \nbetween what the employee paid to exercise the options and the market \nvalue of the stock received. The corporation can then take a mirror \ndeduction for whatever amount of income the employee realized.\n  For example, suppose a company gave an executive options to buy 1 \nmillion shares of the company stock at $10 per share. Suppose, 5 years \nlater, the executive exercised the options when the stock was selling \nat $30 per share. The executive's income would be $20 per share for a \ntotal of $20 million. The executive would declare $20 million as \nordinary income, and in the same year, the company would take a \ncorresponding tax deduction for $20 million. Although in 1993, Congress \nenacted a $1 million cap on the compensation that a corporation can \ndeduct from its taxes, so taxpayers wouldn't be forced to subsidize \nmillions of dollars in executive pay, the cap was not applied to stock \noptions, allowing companies to deduct any amount of stock option \ncompensation, without limit.\n  The stock option accounting and tax rules that evolved over the years \nare now at odds with each other. Accounting rules require companies to \nexpense stock options on the grant date. Tax rules tell companies to \ndeduct stock option expenses on the exercise date. Companies have to \nreport grant date expenses to investors on their financial statements, \nand exercise date expenses on their tax returns. The financial \nstatements report on all stock options granted during the year, while \nthe tax returns report on all stock options exercised during the year. \nIn short, company financial statements and tax returns report expenses \nfor different groups of stock options, using different valuation \nmethods, and resulting in widely divergent stock option expenses for \nthe same year.\n  To examine the nature and consequences of the stock option book-tax \ndifferences, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I \nchair, initiated an investigation and held a hearing on June 5, 2007. \nHere is what we found.\n  To test just how far the book and tax figures for stock options \ndiverge, the Subcommittee contacted a number of companies to compare \nthe stock option expenses they reported for accounting and tax \npurposes. The subcommittee asked each company to identify stock options \nthat had been exercised by one or more of its executives from 2002 to \n2006. The subcommittee then asked each company to identify the \ncompensation expense they reported on their financial statements versus \nthe compensation expense on their tax returns. In addition, we asked \nthe companies' help in estimating what effect the new accounting rule \nwould have had on their book expense if it had been in place when their \nstock options were granted. At the hearing, we disclosed the resulting \nstock option data for nine companies, including three companies that \nwere asked to testify. The subcommittee very much appreciated the \ncooperation and assistance provided by the nine companies we worked \nwith.\n  The data provided by the companies showed that, under then existing \nrules, the 9 companies showed a zero expense on their books for the \nstock options that had been awarded to their executives, but claimed \nmillions of dollars in tax deductions for the same compensation. The \none exception was Occidental Petroleum which, in 2005, began \nvoluntarily expensing its stock options, but even this company reported \nmassively greater tax deductions than the stock option expenses shown \non its books. When the subcommittee asked the companies what their book \nexpense would have been if the new FASB rule had been in effect, all 9 \ncalculated book expenses that remained dramatically lower than their \ntax deductions. Altogether, the nine companies calculated that they \nwould have claimed $1 billion more in stock option tax deductions than \nthey would have shown as book expenses, even using the tougher new \naccounting rule. Let me repeat that just 9 companies produced a stock \noption book-tax difference of more than $1 billion.\n  KB Home, for example, is a company that builds residential homes. Its \nstock price has more than quadrupled over the past 10 years. Over the \nsame time period, it has repeatedly granted stock options to its then \nCEO. Company records show that, over the past 5 years, KB Home gave him \n5.5 million stock options of which, by 2006, he had exercised more than \n3 million.\n  With respect to those 3 million stock options, KB Home recorded a \nzero expense on its books. Had the new accounting rule been in effect, \nKB Home calculated that it would have reported on its books a \ncompensation expense of about $11.5 million. KB Home also disclosed \nthat the same 3 million stock options enabled it to claim compensation \nexpenses on its tax returns totaling about $143.7 million. In other \nwords, KB Home claimed a $143 million tax deduction for expenses that \non its books, under current accounting rules, would have totaled $11.5 \nmillion. That is a tax deduction 12 times bigger than the book expense.\n  Occidental Petroleum disclosed a similar book-tax discrepancy. This \ncompany's stock price has also skyrocketed in recent years, \ndramatically increasing the value of the 16 million stock options \ngranted to its CEO since 1993. Of the 12 million stock options the CEO \nactually exercised over the past five years, Occidental Petroleum \nclaimed a $353 million tax deduction for a book expense that, under \ncurrent accounting rules, would have totaled just $29 million. That is \na book-tax difference of more than 1200 percent.\n  Similar book-tax discrepancies applied to the other companies we \nexamined. Cisco System's CEO exercised nearly 19 million stock options \nover the past 5 years, and provided the company with a $169 million tax \ndeduction for a book expense which, under current accounting rules, \nwould have totaled about $21 million. UnitedHealth's former CEO \nexercised over 9 million stock options in the past 5 years, providing \nthe company with a $318 million tax deduction for a book expense which \nwould have totaled about $46 million.\n\n[[Page S12337]]\n\nSafeway's CEO exercised over 2 million stock options, providing the \ncompany with a $39 million tax deduction for a book expense which would \nhave totaled about $6.5 million.\n  Altogether, these 9 companies took stock option tax deductions \ntotaling $1.2 billion, a figure five times larger than the $217 million \nthat their combined stock option book expenses would have been. The \nresulting $1 billion in excess tax deductions represents a windfall for \nthese companies simply because they issued lots of stock options to \ntheir CEOs.\n  Tax rules that produce outsized tax deductions that are many times \nlarger than the related stock option book expenses give companies an \nincentive to issue huge stock option grants, because they know the \nstock options will produce a relatively small hit to the profits shown \non their books, while also knowing that they are likely to get a much \nlarger tax deduction that can dramatically lower their taxes.\n  The data we gathered for nine companies alone disclosed stock option \ntax deductions that were five times larger than their book expenses, \ngenerating over $1 billion in excess tax deductions. To gauge whether \nthe same tax gap applied to stock options across the country as a \nwhole, the subcommittee asked the IRS to perform an analysis of some \nnewly obtained stock option data.\n  For the first time last year, large corporations were required to \nfile a new tax Schedule M-3 with their tax returns. The M-3 Schedule \nasks companies to identify differences in how they report corporate \nincome to investors versus what they report to Uncle Sam, so that the \nIRS can track and analyze significant book-tax differences. The first \nbatch of M-3 data, which became available earlier this year, applies \nmostly to 2004 tax returns.\n  In analyzing this data, the IRS found that stock option compensation \nexpenses were one of the biggest factors in the difference between book \nand tax income reported by U.S. corporations. The data shows that, in \n2004, stock option compensation expenses produced a book-tax gap of \nabout $43 billion, which is about 30 percent of the entire book-tax \ndifference reported for the period. That means, as a whole, \ncorporations took deductions on their tax returns for stock option \ncompensation expenses which were $43 billion greater than the stock \noption expenses actually shown on their financial statements for the \nsame year. Those massive tax deductions enabled the corporations, as a \nwhole, to legally reduce their 2004 taxes by billions of dollars, \nperhaps by as much as $15 billion.\n  When asked to look deeper into who benefited from these stock option \ndeductions, the IRS was able to determine that the entire $43 billion \nbook-tax difference was attributable to about 3,200 corporations \nnationwide, of which about 250 corporations accounted for 82 percent of \nthe total difference. In other words, a relatively small number of \ncorporations was able to generate $43 billion in tax deductions simply \nby handing out substantial stock options to their executives.\n  There were other surprises in the data as well. One set of issues \ndisclosed by the data involves what happens to unexercised stock \noptions. Under the current mismatched set of accounting and tax rules, \nstock options which are granted, vested, but never exercised by the \noption holder turn out to produce a corporate book expense but no tax \ndeduction.\n  Cisco Systems told the subcommittee, for example, that in addition to \nthe 19 million exercised stock options previously mentioned, their CEO \nholds about 8 million options that, due to a stock price drop, will \nlikely expire without being exercised. Cisco calculated that, had FAS \n123R been in effect at the time those options were granted, the company \nwould have had to show a $139 million book expense, but would never be \nable to claim a tax deduction for this expense since the options would \nnever be exercised. Apple made a similar point. It told the \nsubcommittee that, in 2003, it allowed its CEO to trade 17.5 million in \nunderwater stock options for 5 million shares of restricted stock. That \ntrade meant the stock options would never be exercised and, under \ncurrent rules, would produce a book expense without ever producing a \ntax deduction.\n  In both of these cases, under FAS 123R, it is possible that the stock \noptions given to a corporate executive would have produced a reported \nbook expense greater than the company's tax deduction. While the M-3 \ndata indicates that, overall, accounting expenses lag far behind \nclaimed tax deductions, the possible financial impact on an \nindividual company of a large number of unexercised stock options is \nadditional evidence that existing stock option accounting and tax rules \nare out of kilter and should be brought into alignment. Under our bill, \nif a company incurred a stock option expense, it would always be able \nto claim a tax deduction for that expense.\n\n  A second set of issues brought to light by the data focuses on the \nfact that the current stock option tax deduction is typically claimed \nyears later than the initial book expense. Normally, a corporation \ndispenses compensation to an employee and takes a tax deduction in the \nsame year for the expense. The company controls the timing and amount \nof the compensation expense and the corresponding tax deduction. With \nrespect to stock options, however, corporations may have to wait years \nto see if, when, and how much of a deduction can be taken. That is \nbecause the corporate tax deduction is wholly dependent upon when an \nindividual corporate executive decides to exercise his or her stock \noptions.\n  UnitedHealth, for example, told the subcommittee that it gave its \nformer CEO 8 million stock options in 1999, of which, by 2006, only \nabout 730,000 had been exercised. It does not know if or when he will \nexercise the remaining 7 million options, and so cannot calculate when \nor how much of a tax deduction it will be able to claim for this \ncompensation expense.\n  Right now, stock options are the only form of compensation in which \nthe book expense and tax deduction often take place in different years, \nand the timing of the deduction is under the control of the employee, \nrather than the employer. Under current law, it is not unusual for a \nstock option tax deduction to be claimed 3, 5, or even 10 years after \nthe year in which the stock option compensation was granted. Our bill \nwould completely eliminate this delay and uncertainty, by requiring \nstock option expenses to be deducted in the same year as they appear on \nthe company books.\n  If the rules for stock option tax deductions were changed as \nsuggested in our bill, companies would typically be able to take the \ndeduction years earlier than they do now, without waiting to see if and \nwhen particular options are exercised. Companies would also be allowed \nto deduct stock options that are vested but never exercised. In \naddition, by requiring stock option expenses to be deducted in the same \nyear they appear on the company books, stock options would become more \nconsistent with how other forms of compensation are treated in the tax \ncode.\n  Right now, U.S. stock option accounting and tax rules are mismatched, \nmisaligned, and out of kilter. They allow companies collectively to \ndeduct billions of dollars in stock option expenses in excess of the \nexpenses that actually appear on the company books. They disallow tax \ndeductions for stock options that are given as compensation but never \nexercised. They often force companies to wait years to claim a tax \ndeduction for a compensation expense that could and should be claimed \nin the same year it appears on the company books.\n  The bill we are introducing today would cure these problems. It would \nbring stock option accounting and tax rules into alignment, so that the \ntwo sets of rules would apply in a consistent manner. It would \naccomplish that goal simply by requiring the corporate stock option tax \ndeduction to equal the stock option expenses shown on the corporate \nbooks each year. Stock option deductions would no longer exceed the \nexpenses recorded on a company's publicly available financial reports. \nStock option expenses for both accounting and tax purposes would be the \nsame.\n  Specifically, the bill would end use of the current stock option \ndeduction under Section 83 of the tax code, which allows corporations \nto deduct stock option expenses when exercised in an amount equal to \nthe income declared by the individual exercising the option, replacing \nit with a new Section 162(q),\n\n[[Page S12338]]\n\nwhich would require companies to deduct the stock option expenses shown \non their books each year.\n  The bill would apply only to corporate stock option deductions; it \nwould make no changes to the rules that apply to individuals who have \nbeen given stock options as part of their compensation. Individuals \nwould still report their compensation on the day they exercised their \nstock options. They would still report as income the difference between \nwhat they paid to exercise the options and the fair market value of the \nstock they received upon exercise. The gain would continue to be \ntreated as ordinary income rather than a capital gain, since the option \nholder did not invest any capital in the stock prior to exercising the \nstock option and the only reason the person obtained the stock was \nbecause of the services they performed for the corporation.\n  The amount of income declared by the individual after exercising a \nstock option will likely often be greater than the stock option expense \nbooked and deducted by the corporation who employed that individual. \nThat is in part because the individual's gain often comes years later \nthan the original stock option grant, and the underlying stock will \nusually have gained in value. In addition, the individual's gain is \ntypically provided, not by the corporation that supplied the stock \noptions years earlier, but by third parties active in the stock market.\n  Consider, for example, an executive who exercises options to buy 1 \nmillion shares of stock at $10 per share, obtains the shares from the \ncorporation, and then immediately sells them on the open market for $30 \nper share, making a total profit of $20 million. The individual's \ncorporation didn't supply the $20 million. Just the opposite. Rather \nthan paying cash to its executive, the corporation received a $10 \nmillion payment from the executive in exchange for the 1 million \nshares. The $20 million profit from selling the shares was paid, not by \nthe corporation, but by third parties in the marketplace who purchased \nthe stock. That's why it makes no sense for the company to declare as \nan expense the amount of profit that an employee, or sometimes a former \nemployee, obtained from unrelated parties in the marketplace.\n  The bill we are introducing today would put an end to the current \napproach of using the stock option income declared by an individual as \nthe tax deduction claimed by the corporation that supplied the stock \noptions. It would break that old artificial symmetry and replace it \nwith a new symmetry more consistent with other tax code provisions, one \nin which the corporation's stock option tax deduction would match its \nbook expense.\n  I consider the current approach to corporate stock option tax \ndeductions to be artificial, because it uses a construct in the tax \ncode that, when first implemented over thirty years ago, enabled \ncorporations to calculate their stock option expense on the exercise \ndate, when there was no consensus on how to calculate stock option \nexpenses on the grant date. The artificiality of the approach is \ndemonstrated by the fact that it allows companies to claim a deductible \nexpense for money that generally does not come from a company's \ncoffers, but from third parties in the stock market. Now that U.S. \naccounting rules provide a detailed rule for calculating stock option \nexpenses on the grant date, however, there is no longer any need to \nrely on an artificial construct that calculates corporate stock option \nexpenses on the exercise date using third party funds.\n  Our bill would eliminate the existing grant date-exercise date \ndisparity between U.S. accounting and tax rules, and eliminate the \nstock option double standard by ensuring that companies' stock option \ntax deductions are equal to, and not greater than, the actual stock \noption expenses shown on their books.\n  It is also important to note that the bill would not affect in any \nway current tax provisions that provide favored tax treatment to so-\ncalled Incentive Stock Options under Sections 421 and 422 of the tax \ncode. Under these sections, in certain circumstances, corporations can \nsurrender their stock option deductions in favor of allowing their \nemployees with stock option gains to be taxed at a capital gains rate \ninstead of ordinary income tax rates. Many start-up companies use these \ntypes of stock options, because they don't yet have taxable profits and \ndon't need a stock option tax deduction. So they forfeit their stock \noption corporate deduction in favor of giving their employees more \nfavorable treatment of their stock option income. Incentive Stock \nOptions would not be affected by our legislation and would remain \navailable to any corporation providing stock options to its employees.\n  And again, as mentioned earlier, the bill would have no effect on the \ntax treatment of stock options for individuals; the bill would affect \nonly corporations.\n  The bill would make one other important change to the tax code as it \nrelates to corporate stock option tax deductions. Right now, Section \n162(m) of the tax code applies a $1 million cap on corporate deductions \nfor the compensation paid to the top executives of publicly held \ncorporations. The purpose of this cap is to eliminate any taxpayer \nsubsidy for compensation that exceeds $1 million annually and is paid \nto a top corporate executive. As currently written, however, the cap \ndoes not apply to compensation paid in the form of stock options. By \nexempting stock option compensation from the $1 million cap, the \nprovision creates a significant incentive for corporations to pay their \nexecutives with stock options. The bill would eliminate this favored \ntreatment of executive stock options by making deductions for this type \nof compensation subject to the same $1 million cap that applies to \nother forms of compensation covered by Section 162(m).\n  The bill also contains several technical provisions. First, it would \nmake a conforming change to the research tax credit so that stock \noption expenses claimed under that credit would match the stock option \ndeductions taken under the new tax code section 162(q). Second, the \nbill would authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to adopt regulations \ngoverning how to calculate the deduction for stock options issued by a \nparent corporation to the employees of a subsidiary.\n  Finally, the bill contains a transition rule for applying the new \nSection 162(q) stock option tax deduction to existing and future stock \noption grants. This transition rule would make it clear that the new \ntax deduction would not apply to any stock option exercised prior to \nthe date of enactment of the bill.\n  The bill would also allow the old Section 83 deduction rules to apply \nto any option which was vested prior to the effective date of Financial \nAccounting Standard, FAS, 123R, and exercised after the date of \nenactment of the bill. The effective date of FAS 123R is June 15, 2005 \nfor most corporations, and December 31, 2005, for most small \nbusinesses. Prior to the effective date of FAS 123R, most corporations \nwould have shown a zero expense on their books for the stock options \nissued to their executives and, thus, would be unable to claim a tax \ndeduction under the new Section 162(q). For that reason, the bill would \nallow these corporations to continue to use Section 83 to claim stock \noption deductions on their tax returns.\n  For stock options that vested after the effective date of FAS 123R \nand were exercised after the date of enactment, the bill takes another \ntack. Under FAS 123R, these corporations would have had to show the \nappropriate stock option expense on their books, but would have been \nunable to take a tax deduction until the executive actually exercised \nthe option. For these options, the bill would allow corporations to \ntake an immediate tax deduction, in the first year that the bill was in \neffect, for all of the expenses shown on their books with respect to \nthese options. This ``catch-up deduction'' in the first year after \nenactment would enable corporations, in the following years, to begin \nwith a clean slate so that their tax returns the next year would \nreflect their actual stock option book expenses for that same year.\n  After that catch-up year, all stock option expenses incurred by a \ncompany each year would be reflected in their annual tax deductions \nunder the new Section 162(q).\n  The current differences between stock option accounting and tax rules \nmake no sense. They require companies to show one stock option expense \non their books and a completely different expense on their tax returns. \nThey require corporations to report one set of\n\n[[Page S12339]]\n\nfigures to their investors and a different set of figures to the IRS.\n  The current book-tax difference is the historical product of \naccounting and tax policies that have not been coordinated or \nintegrated. The resulting mismatch has allowed companies to take tax \ndeductions that, usually, are many times larger than the actual stock \noption book expenses shown on their books, which not only shortchanges \nthe Treasury, but also provides a windfall to companies doling out huge \nstock options, and creates an incentive for those companies to keep \nright on doling out those options and producing outsized executive pay.\n  Right now, stock options are the only compensation expense where the \ntax code allows companies to deduct more than their actual expenses. In \n2004, companies used the existing book-tax disparity to claim $43 \nbillion more in stock option tax deductions than the expenses shown on \ntheir books. We cannot afford this multi-billion dollar loss to the \nTreasury, not only because of deep federal deficits, but also because \nthis stock option book-tax difference contributes to the ever deepening \nchasm between the pay of executives and the pay of average workers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in enacting this bill into law this \nyear.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of thje bill and a bill summary \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2116\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to encourage the development of research-proven \nprograms funded under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Lugar, \nto introduce the Proven Programs for the Future of Education Act of \n2007, and the Education Research and Development to Improve Achievement \nAct of 2007. These bills would encourage the use and development of \nresearch-proven programs in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965.\n  In 2002, Congress enacted the No Child Left Behind Act to close the \nachievement gap between low-income, underperforming students, and their \nmore affluent peers. Without a renewed dedication to the quality of \nprograms used in our schools, this goal, as well as providing an \nexcellent education for students, will be difficult to achieve. While \nthere is no question that we have made progress in recent years in \nadvancing educational opportunity, I remain concerned about the number \nof schools that are failing to meet the criteria set out in the No \nChild Left Behind Act. We need to look at ways to improve the quality \nof education in a meaningful and comprehensive manner.\n  The purpose of the bills that I am introducing today is to create \nincentives for schools to use the programs that meet the highest \nstandards for evidence of effectiveness and provide increased \ninvestment in the research and development to create and evaluate new \nprograms. The future of our students' success depends on the quality\n\n[[Page S12340]]\n\nof their educational experience. It is for that reason I have been \ncommitted to, and will continue to strive for, an improved educational \nsystem.\n  It is my strong belief that one of the clearest ways we can improve \nthe quality of education in our schools is to encourage schools to \nfocus on existing proven programs that meet the highest quality \nstandards. The Proven Programs for the Future of Education Act would \noffer a competitive preference of 10 percent of the total number of \npoints awarded to grant applicants who choose to use research-proven \nprograms.\n  In addition, this legislation would also provide a ten-percent \ncompetitive preference for applicants who choose research-proven \nreading programs. I believe that the goals of the Reading First program \nare important in improving students' literacy levels. While I am very \nconcerned that this program has been beleaguered by greed and \npartisanship, the program has shown to be effective, particularly in \nNew Mexico, where according to reports from the U.S. Department of \nEducation, in 2006-2007, 58 percent of New Mexico's third-grade \nstudents in Reading First programs scored proficient or above in \nreading. This is up from 39 percent in 2003-2004. That said, it is \ncrucial that states such as New Mexico have the opportunity to consider \nand use research-proven reading programs to further advance educational \nopportunity.\n  I believe that stressing quality education programs fosters greater \nacademic achievement and motivation in later years, particularly for \nchildren from low-income families. To this end, this legislation \nprovides schools the incentive to advance research-proven programs, \nraising the bar for all educational programs both now and in the \nfuture.\n  As you know, title I-A provides supplemental services to low-\nachieving students attending schools with a relatively high \nconcentration of students from low-income families. Title I-A is the \nlargest Federal elementary and secondary education assistance program, \nwith services provided to more than 90 percent of all local educational \nagencies; approximately 52,000--54 percent of all--public schools; and \napproximately 16.5 million--34 percent of all--pupils, including \napproximately 188,000 pupils attending private schools. If the national \ngoal of leaving no child behind is to be met, attention and resources \nmust also be invested in the research necessary to bring improved \nquality and increased innovation to core areas of title I.\n  The Education Research and Development to Improve Achievement Act \nwould authorize at least $100 million for rapid development and \nrigorous evaluation of practical programs for use in title I programs \ncapable of increasing student achievement in such areas as School \nImprovement and Restructuring, Supplemental Educational Services, \nReading First, and other areas determined to be in need of further \ndevelopment.\n  I want to thank Senator Lugar for his leadership and commitment to \nimproving education in this country.
