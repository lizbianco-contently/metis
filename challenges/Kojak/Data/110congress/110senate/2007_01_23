Mr. President, it is very good to have back Reverend \nOgilivie, our former Senate Chaplain. A lot of thoughts came to my \nmind. I sat here for 6 years and listened to almost every one of his \nprayers. My mind goes back to some of the tragedies that had come to \nthe Senate during his tenure, including the death of Governor Carnahan, \nthe death of Paul Wellstone, and the death of Paul Coverdell. I mention \nPaul Coverdell because I traveled to his funeral in Georgia, and the \nChaplain at that time, Chaplain Ogilivie, delivered the eulogy and was \nin charge of the services there in Georgia. I will always remember the \ndignity, compassion, and the understanding in the words of Reverend \nOgilivie. It is good to have you back. Thank you very much for all you \ndo for our country. I am sure you are doing good things in California, \nas you did here for so many years.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if the majority leader will allow me an \nobservation about Dr. Ogilivie and his extraordinary service to this \nbody and to the Nation, it was truly exemplary. I know I speak for all \nof the Members on this side of the aisle when I say to Dr. Ogilivie, \nthank you for your years of service here. It is wonderful to see you \nagain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/23/senate-section/article/S873-7", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S873-S874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this morning, we will be in a period of \nmorning business for 60 minutes. The first half of the time will be \nunder the control of the Republicans and the second half of the time \nwill be under the control of the Democrats.\n  Following morning business, we will resume consideration of H.R. 2, \nthe minimum wage bill. We will be in recess today from 12:30 to 2:15 \nfor the party luncheons. As I indicated, we have two cloture motions \nthat have been filed. The first vote, on line-item veto, will take \nplace tomorrow. If cloture is not invoked, we will then proceed to a \nvote on the underlying bill, which is S. 2.\n\n[[Page S874]]\n\n  There have been a number of amendments filed and that is very good. \nWe are looking at a number of them closely to see if we can schedule a \nvote on one of them sometime this morning.\n  Looking at the schedule, we are going to have a couple of votes \nFriday morning, and everyone should understand that. The only way I can \nsee that we will not have votes Friday morning is if we can figure out \na way to finish minimum wage on Thursday. That is certainly possible. I \nam impressed with the seriousness of the amendments that have been \noffered. To this point, five amendments have been offered, and we \ncertainly could complete this bill this week if we put our minds to it. \nI hope we can do that. If we cannot, it will spill over into next week. \nI am not sure that is good; we have so many things that we have to do. \nI have had a number of conversations with the Republican leader and we \nare going to have debate on Iraq. We are going to make that as \nmeaningful as possible. We are going to work together to see if we can \nlimit the subject matter of the debate on Iraq. We hope we can do that. \nWe also have other things that are facing us down the road, not the \nleast of which is stem cell research and negotiation on Medicare. But \nmore importantly, we have to make sure the Government has money after \nFebruary 15. That is something, again, I have had a number of \nconversations on with the distinguished Republican leader. The \nAppropriations Committee, with Democrats and Republicans, has worked \nvery well on that. Senator Cochran has been fully engaged and all of \nthe subcommittee chairs and ranking members have been engaged.\n  I think we are at a point where we have a pretty good idea of the \nsubject matter of the CR. There will be no earmarks, zero, not a single \nearmark on the CR. That is what we have agreed upon. Senator McConnell \nagrees with that, as I do, and the two appropriating bodies agree with \nthat. So we are going to move forward on the CR. It is not going to be \nfun. I have been an appropriator here for many years, as has Senator \nMcConnell. We like to do the regular process, but in my opinion we \ncannot get to that unless we get the CR out of the way and work on the \nbudget and get the appropriations bills done.\n  It is my goal to work very hard to get the appropriations bills done \nthis year. It has been done before and we can do it again. It has been \ndone under Republican leadership and under Democratic leadership in the \nSenate. We have been working on it on a bipartisan basis. I think we \ncan get it done.\n  As a reminder, first-degree amendments must be filed at the desk by \n2:30 p.m. this afternoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/23/senate-section/article/S874-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me focus my remarks on the second \ncloture vote that will occur tomorrow. Were cloture to be invoked on \nwhat is generally referred to as a ``clean minimum wage,'' the \nbipartisan compromise that has been put together between Senator Baucus \nand Senator Grassley and Senator Enzi and others would be wiped out. So \nI think it is extremely important to mention to Members, those who \nwould like to continue to go forward on a bipartisan basis, if cloture \nwere to be invoked, that would eliminate the possibility of going \nforward on a bipartisan basis on minimum wage. I hope cloture will not \nbe invoked--the second cloture vote would not be invoked, so that we \ncan proceed with the substitute, which seems to enjoy broad, bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/23/senate-section/article/S874-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is always an exciting time when a new \nCongress takes its oath of office and the President comes to Capitol \nHill to give his State of the Union Address. It is a time when our \nNation takes its pulse and checks its health.\n  As we contemplate what the President might say and the agenda that \nthis Congress might pursue, it occurs to me that this is a good time to \nexpress what I hope will be a priority of this Congress, and it relates \nto health.\n  I think, undoubtedly, the President will focus some of his remarks on \nIraq. That continues as a major focus of public attention and a \nlegitimate cause of its concern. But I think the American people would \nalso very much appreciate our turning our focus to home, on things that \naffect the lives of everyday Americans and their families and on their \nindividual concerns.\n  There is probably no greater individual concern than health care. I \ndo hope the President will address health care because I know moms and \ndads are addressing it every day.\n  There are three issues I would like to speak to as it relates to \nhealth care, to what I hope will be a focus of the 110th Congress.\n  When I think of health care in this Congress, the issues that come to \nmind are stem cells, mental health, and the uninsured. When I think of \nstem cells, I immediately think of some of the most loathesome diseases \nthat affect humankind. Obviously, Parkinson's disease, which has \ncertainly taken its toll in my family; Alzheimer's, which afflicts so \nmany of our seniors and puts incredible burdens upon their caregivers; \nand diabetes. It is heartrending to meet with children afflicted with \ndiabetes at an early age, that directs them down a path of lifelong \nsuffering and dependence upon injections.\n  I think of cardiovascular disease. Heart disease is probably our \ngreatest killer as a people. Then, of course, there are those who, \nthrough accidents or other causes, suffer spinal cord injuries. All of \nthese terrible afflictions have mystified our best and brightest minds \nin the scientific community, and yet stem cell research, in all of its \nforms--embryonic, adult stem cells, and some of the new breakthroughs \nthat have been discovered through amniotic fluid--all hold great \npromise.\n  It does seem to me that one of the first steps of this Congress ought \nto be to return to this debate. The time is now to make progress. The \ntime is now for us as a people to have the vast majority view heard and \nenacted into law. It is important for the Federal Government to show up \nto work on this issue. It is important because the Federal Government \ncan provide the seed money. The Federal Government can provide the \nmoral boundaries. The Federal Government can help to provide world \nleadership on this important biomedical ethical issue.\n  So as we enter this Congress, I do hope that by large majorities in \nthe House and the Senate, we will pass embryonic stem cell research and \nfurther those other avenues in stem cell research that hold out so much \npromise. I have always believed that an ethic of life includes concern \nfor the living as well. I believe it is time for us to unshackle the \nhands of our scientists so that we can unlock with the key of science \nthese great mysteries.\n  Next, Mr. President, I speak of mental health. It has always been \ntroubling to me, but especially in light of my family's history, that \nphysical health is held at one level but mental health has always \noccupied a subordinate level. Because of the embarrassment and then the \nshame that attends mental health, a great stigma has attached to this \nissue, and because stigma attaches to it, society has caused those who \nsuffer debilitating mental health issues not to seek treatment or to \nhide their afflictions. Yet it seems to me obvious that such issues as \nschizophrenia, bipolar condition, postpartum depression--it is hard to \nimagine anyone in this modern day and age who says these are not \nlegitimate afflictions of\n\n[[Page S875]]\n\nhumankind. And if they are legitimate, then the Congress of the United \nStates should begin to treat them as legitimate.\n  It seems to me that in all of its manifestations, these biases \nagainst mental health need to be removed. We find them in our statutes \nrelative to Medicaid and Medicare. When it comes to copays, when it \ncomes to reimbursement, the Federal Government has a prejudice against \nmental health. Why would that be? If you do not have mental health but \nyou have physical health, you do not have health. The mind and body \ninteract in a very direct way, and both are necessary if the American \npeople are to have health.\n  I do believe the Congress needs to address the biases against mental \nhealth. I do believe we should enact mental health parity in insurance \nlaw. It is a source of pride to me that my own State of Oregon this \npast legislative session enacted mental health parity, so that on \nJanuary 1 of this year, all Oregonians woke up to know that as a matter \nof law their health care covers mental health as well. And we should do \nno less as the Federal Government. We need to change this aspect. We \nneed to change it in Medicaid, Medicare, in insurance law, in teaching \nparity in our medical schools, in our pharmaceutical policies--all of \nthese things must elevate mental health to the same level as physical \nhealth.\n  Another part of mental health, in my own calculation, is a very \npersonal passion of mine; that is, the reauthorization and full funding \nof the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act. There is a plague in this \ncountry, an epidemic, if you will, of youth suicide. It begins as \ndepression and sometimes leads to the most tragic of results. It is my \nhope that this 110th Congress, the House and the Senate, united, will \nreauthorize and fully fund this great and important act. It is not the \nwhole answer, but it is an important beginning because it incentivizes \nStates to enact prevention and intervention programs--not just States \nbut tribes, colleges, universities--to be able to respond to this issue \nwhich is costing the lives of over 3,000 young people a year. I hope we \nwill do that. It is one of the actions the Congress before took which \nwas truly bipartisan, which truly has made a difference in saving \nhundreds, perhaps thousands, of lives.\n  Finally, let me speak to access. I think it is a source of some \nnational shame that 46 million Americans are uninsured. It is true that \nprobably half of that number are uninsured by choice. They tend to be \nyoung people who would want to spend their money in other ways. But of \nthat 46 million, 9 million of these are children, and that is a \nnational shame.\n  I believe we need to reauthorize the SCHIP program. SCHIP, along with \nMedicaid, is one of the central strands in our public safety net. I \nbelieve we need to do this because of the 6 million children who are \ninsured by this, some 3 million more are eligible but are not enrolled.\n  I believe, in addition to this, we need to look at all the good ideas \nwe can find in this Congress to provide insurance coverage for the \nuninsured. Senator Wyden of Oregon and I have a proposal for universal \ncatastrophic coverage. We believe that, at least in America, if you \nlose your health, you should not lose your home.\n  Mr. President, I believe my time is up. I thank you for the time, and \nI focus our Nation's attention on a most pressing and urgent family and \nnational urgency, which is health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/23/senate-section/article/S875-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S875-S877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WASTEFUL SPENDING AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment pending \non the floor, the second look at wasteful spending amendment, otherwise \nknown as the Gregg amendment, after the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire. The truth is, we might call this really the Daschle \namendment or the Byrd amendment or the Levin amendment or Murray or \nDodd, other Senators who have supported virtually this same proposal on \nprevious occasions. I will explain that more in just a moment.\n  If we look at this amendment, compared with one offered by the former \nmajority leader, Senator Tom Daschle, when the Democrats were, again, \nin leadership, we can see how the Gregg amendment corresponds \nvirtually, precisely with the proposal made by then-Democratic majority \nleader Tom Daschle. It established a fast-track congressional process \nfor consideration of Presidential rescissions. It required \ncongressional affirmation of rescissions. It allowed the President to \nsuspend funds for a maximum of 45 days. It does not permit the \nPresident to resubmit rescissions once rejected by the Congress. It \nallowed rescissions of discretionary funding and targeted tax benefits. \nIt did not allow rescissions of new mandatory programs. That is one \narea where this differs from the Daschle amendment. The Gregg amendment \nwould permit rescission of new mandatory spending.\n  I interject, if we are going to get a handle on runaway Federal \nspending, it is not going to be in discretionary spending alone. We \nhave actually--contrary, perhaps, to popular perception--done a pretty \ngood job limiting nondefense, nonhomeland security discretionary \nspending. But to paraphrase, that is not where the money is. Where the \nmoney is actually in mandatory spending--in entitlement spending, such \nas Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.\n  So the Gregg amendment quite appropriately addresses rescission of \nnew, not existing, new mandatory spending programs. We can see here \nthat in virtually every respect except two--the one I just mentioned \nand that only four rescission packages would be permitted annually \nunder the Gregg amendment--there is virtual identity between these two \namendments.\n  Why is this so important? I have to tell my colleagues that as I \ntravel around my State of Texas, there are issues people talk to me \nabout, as with other Members. They are concerned about our lack of \nborder security. They are concerned, obviously, about the war on terror \nand the way forward in Iraq. But one of the really top three issues \nthat my constituents talk to me about is Federal spending. They worry \nabout the deficit. They worry about the long-term obligation under \nSocial Security and Medicare, a bill that is going to be paid by our \nchildren and grandchildren, about the morality of basically putting \nthis burden on their backs in the future. So what this amendment does, \nthis second look at wasteful spending, it allows us to cut out some of \nthe pork, cut out some of the waste in a way that I think responds to \nthis very realistic concern by the American people.\n  You will note that in 1995, when Senator Daschle offered this \namendment, this was, of course, during the Clinton administration--I \nwant to note that--we had 21 Democratic Senators--virtually all of \nwhom, I guess, are still in the Senate--who supported that Daschle \namendment. My hope is they would vote for cloture so we can have an up-\nor-down vote on this Gregg amendment, which, as I showed a moment ago, \nis virtually identical.\n  Let's look at some of the quotes back then by distinguished Members \nof the Senate in support of the Daschle amendment. My hope would be \nthat Senators would remember, perhaps have their recollection refreshed \nby this exercise in a way that would encourage them to have at least an \nopen mind and possibly even embrace the Gregg amendment today as they \ndid the Daschle amendment back in 1995.\n  Senator Byrd, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, someone who respects congressional prerogative and \nunderstands the separation of powers perhaps better than anybody else \nin this body, said:\n\n       I have no problem with giving the President another \n     opportunity to select from appropriations bills certain items \n     which he feels for his political or for whatever reasons, I \n     have no problem with his sending them to the two Houses and \n     our giving him a vote.\n\n  That was on March 22, 1995.\n  Then there is this comment by Senator Feinstein, the distinguished \nSenator from California. She said:\n\n       Really, what a line-item veto is all about is deterrence, \n     and that deterrence is aimed at the porkbarrel. I sincerely \n     believe that a line-item veto will work.\n\n  What we are talking about, this so-called rescission provision, is in \nessence a version of the line-item veto, something Presidents have \ncalled for in\n\n[[Page S876]]\n\nthe past on both sides of the aisle and something I believe, obviously, \nthere has existed bipartisan support for in the Senate.\n  Then there is Senator Dorgan, who has said:\n\n       Fully 43 Governors have the line-item veto, which suggests \n     to me that it is a power that the President can safely wield \n     . . . That is why I voted for it, and why I am pleased it is \n     now the law of the land.\n\n  This was back on April 25, 1996.\n  Of course, we know what happened to the line-item veto. It ultimately \nwas struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. That is why we have had to \ncome back with this modification of this rescission package in order to \naddress the Court's concerns and to ensure its constitutionality.\n  Then there is the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Senator Joe \nBiden, who said:\n\n       Mr. President, I have long supported an experiment with the \n     line-item veto power for the President.\n\n  That was Senator Biden on March 27, 1996.\n  Then there is Senator Dodd who has said:\n\n       I support the substitute offered by Senator Daschle.\n\n  That is the Daschle amendment.\n\n       I believe it is a reasonable line-item veto alternative. It \n     requires both Houses of Congress to vote on a President's \n     rescission list and sets up a fast-track procedure to ensure \n     that a vote occurs in a prompt and timely manner.\n\n  There are just a couple of more. Mr. Feingold, the Senator from \nWisconsin, said this:\n\n       The line-item veto is about getting rid of those items \n     after the President has them on his desk. I think this will \n     prove to be a useful tool in eliminating some of the things \n     that have happened in Congress that have been held up to \n     public ridicule.\n\n  That obviously goes with the pork spending, the embarrassing earmarks \nthat we have heard so much about from our constituents, particularly \nleading up to this last election.\n  Senator Murray said:\n\n       I want to give the President the ability to line-item veto \n     all those portions of the appropriations bills that have not \n     been through the hearing and authorization process. All those \n     pork items contribute to our deficit.\n\n  I think we have one more from Senator Dorgan, but we have already \nheard from him. There is one last one from Mr. Levin, the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan. He said:\n\n       That so-called expedited rescission process, it seems to \n     me, is constitutional and is something which we can in good \n     conscience, at least I in good conscience, support.\n\n  My point is obvious, perhaps, but let me, at the risk of beating a \ndead horse, say it again. If this was good policy back in 1995 and \n1996, what has changed in 2007? I submit the only thing that has \nchanged is that our deficit has increased for many years, part of which \nis porkbarrel spending which can be eliminated with the kind of \ncooperation that this particular amendment would allow. I suggest to \nour Democratic colleagues--in the spirit of bipartisanship in which we \nhave started this new Congress with the overwhelming bipartisan passage \nof an ethics and lobby reform bill and consideration of this minimum \nwage bill with appropriate relief for small businesses when it comes to \nregulations and tax relief that will attenuate some of the blow--this \nis an appropriate amendment for us to consider and pass.\n  I hope the spirit of bipartisanship does not end so early on in this \nsession of the Senate. I know there are many cynics who believe it will \ndie an early death. I am not one of them. I remain hopeful and \noptimistic that our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will embrace \nthis opportunity to do the right thing for the people of this great \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first of all, I commend the Senator from \nTexas on his remarks. I commend Senator Judd Gregg on the submission of \nthis amendment. I commend Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, for \nhis insistence on bringing this amendment to the floor of the Senate \nearly. It had been my preference that it be debated during the lobbying \nreform and ethics bill, S. 1, which we debated last week because the \nremarks I am going to make tell you how much I think the enhanced \nrescission and a second look at wasteful spending is so important to \nend, curb, and finally do away with what has been an abuse in this body \nfor a long time, and that is the abuse of earmarks.\n  In fact, I want to tell a story. When I first came to the Congress of \nthe United States in 1999, the first budget that I voted on and was \npassed was a voluminous, huge budget--appropriations bill. It had \nspending in thousands of different categories, many of which I never \neven looked at, A, because I was not on the committee that had \njurisdiction or, B, because so much of it went into last-minute \nnegotiations in the conference committee on the appropriations bill.\n  I will never forget a telephone call I got at 8 o'clock in the \nmorning from a reporter, shortly after--about 2 weeks after the passage \nof an Omnibus appropriations bill. A newspaper reporter called and said \nto me:\n\n       Congressman, why did you vote for a $50,000 appropriation \n     for a tatoo removal parlor in California?\n\n  I said:\n\n       I didn't vote for any such a thing.\n\n  The reporter said:\n\n       Yes, you did. Didn't you vote for the Omnibus budget?\n\n  I said:\n\n       Yes, I did.\n\n  The reporter said:\n\n       Well, it was right there in clear view.\n\n  I said:\n\n       Well, it wasn't in clear view to me.\n\n  Well, it turned out, after going through that embarrassing \nexperience, which all of us in this business go through from time to \ntime, I started digging around trying to find the $50,000 appropriation \nfor a tatoo removal parlor in California. Finally, I found it. It went \ninto the budget on the appropriations bill on the last night of \nnegotiations. It was on something like page 1186, line 33, in small \nprint. The appropriations act we voted on was put on our desk about 8 \nhours before we voted on it.\n  I am not a fast reader anyway, but I couldn't read 1,100 pages in 8 \nhours. I would go blind. And the fact is, Congress was embarrassed, the \nRepresentative who put it in there was very embarrassed, but this \nRepresentative was very embarrassed. So I introduced legislation the \nnext year to basically put an end to the last-minute earmark that said \nthe earmark had to be in bold type, large fonts, and on the front page \nof each appropriations act, and had to lay on the desk for 24 hours to \nat least give us a chance to look at it.\n  What Senator Gregg has proposed today is the opportunity for us to \nnot only get a second look, but in the case of a lot of these earmarks \na first look, at wasteful appropriations. That is why I thought it \nshould have gone on the previous bill we debated last week, the \nlobbying reform and ethics bill for, you see, if a President of the \nUnited States had gotten that omnibus budget and had the right of \nrescission, that President could have said: I think we ought to strike \nthe $50,000 for a tatoo removal parlor in California. And under the \nGregg proposal, it would come back to the Senate and the House, and we \nwould have to affirm that. I do not think there is a single person in \neither party, including the author of that earmark 9 years ago, who \nwould not have voted to affirm the President's rescission.\n  The light of day, sunshine, the power of knowledge, facts are \nstubborn things. But so often in the appropriations process facts get \nobliterated or not seen. Appropriations get written in late at night in \nnegotiations between conferees, and we end up with wasteful spending.\n  This is an outstanding proposal by Senator Gregg. As Senator Cornyn \nhas said, and others who have spoken today have said, it actually \nreflects what has been approved by Members of both parties in this \nSenate before. But it makes good, common, horse sense and passes the \nconstitutional test, which is so important.\n  The President gets four times a year to send rescissions to the \nCongress. The Congress has to fast-track its response within 8 days. \nThe Congress has to affirm the rescission, which is the\n\n[[Page S877]]\n\nkey point in the balance of power between each of the bodies of \nGovernment that are so important to our Constitution. It does not give \na President unilateral authority, but it forces the light of day on a \nPresidential decision for us to take a second look at what was probably \na mistake that this body might have made.\n  Lastly, I have had some experience with this process. I had the \nprivilege of representing the great State of Georgia for 17 years in \nits statehouse, in its State senate. At the time I was in the minority, \nand the Democratic Party in Georgia was in the majority. A dear friend \nof mine, a fellow against whom I ran for Governor of Georgia in 1990, \nand who came to this Senate, Zell Miller, and whom I later replaced in \nthis Senate, a great Georgian--I watched him use the line-item veto, \nwhich is legal in Georgia, to cause accountability on the part of \nlegislators, to let the light of day shine on appropriations and, most \nimportantly, to see to it that Georgia was run in a fiscally sound way \nand we didn't get away with things that we should not have gotten away \nwith.\n  If it is good enough for the States, it is good enough for the \nFederal Government. If it passes the constitutional test of the \ndivision of power in our Government--legislative, executive, judicial--\nit ought to be a part of the body of law, and this proposal does.\n  Most important of all, although all the promotion pieces I have read \ncall this a second look at the budget process, in many cases because of \nthe volume it gives us, as individuals, a first look at a mistake we \nmade. Instead of current law, where once that mistake is made it is \nthere, under this right of recision we have a second chance at what was \na first impression, and we can make the right decision and do the right \nthing.\n  The money, when it is struck, goes where it ought to go--to deficit \nreduction. This country has a serious deficit problem, and it has had a \nserious spending problem. Enhanced rescission places the responsibility \non the President to delineate a mistake and forces us to affirm if \nthat, in fact, was a mistake, and the benefit from that savings goes to \nreduce the deficit, which is the mortgage on our children's future and \nthe future of our grandchildren.\n  I am delighted to come to the floor today as a cosponsor of the \nenhanced rescissions amendment proposed by Senator Gregg to speak in \nits favor, and I encourage every Member of the Senate to take a second \nlook at this proposal.\n  It makes sense. It is constitutional. It is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/23/senate-section/article/S877-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S877-S879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is one moment each year when America \ncomes together, when the leader of our country, our President, in his \nState of the Union Address, speaks of our experience in the past, our \nhistory, and his vision of our Nation's future. It is a rare moment on \nCapitol Hill, House and Senate together on a bipartisan basis, the \nSupreme Court, the Cabinet, the diplomatic corps. It is quite a festive \nand historic--sometimes solemn--gathering. Tonight will be an \nopportunity for us to gather again for the State of the Union Address. \nI am looking forward to it.\n  It comes at a moment in American history when there is a strong \nemotion across this country, a strong feeling about the war in Iraq. It \nis a feeling that was made even more intense by the events of this last \nweekend where we lost so many of our brave soldiers: a helicopter crash \nfrom the sky, lives were taken on the ground. At the end of the day, we \nhad lost 3,059 of our best and bravest soldiers, marines, airmen, and \nsailors in this war in Iraq.\n  The President will speak of many things this evening. That is his \nresponsibility--from energy to health care to education and beyond. But \nthe issue most dominant in the minds of America is the issue of Iraq. \nIt was certainly the most dominant issue in the November election when \nthe message came through loudly and clearly that it was time to change, \nit was time for America to step back and reassess our role in Iraq and \nwhere we go from here.\n  Since that election, many important things have happened. The \nSecretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, resigned, replaced by Robert \nGates. The military leadership in Iraq was changed and the President \ncame forward, after a time of deliberation, with his own proposal. That \nproposal, which we heard a little over a week ago, called for adding \nmore troops in the theater of war in Iraq, some 21,000 more Americans, \nto join the 144,000 soldiers who are there today.\n  Most of us have spoken publicly about that in disagreement with the \nPresident: our belief that the escalation of the number of troops in \nIraq is the wrong way, the wrong direction for our Nation; our belief \nthat 21,000 soldiers cannot stop the civil war that has 14 centuries of \nfighting behind it; and our belief that 21,000 American lives are too \nmany to ever lose in this kind of dangerous situation.\n  The President, undoubtedly, will speak to Iraq this evening and the \nAmerican people will listen closely. But that is not the end of the \nconversation. The conversation will continue in the Senate where men \nand women representing States, as I have the honor to do in \nrepresenting Illinois, will engage for the first meaningful debate on \nthe war in Iraq in more than 4 years since we passed the use-of-force \nresolution.\n  Circumstances have changed dramatically. Reading the resolution \ntoday, one would wonder if it even justifies our current presence \nbecause it spoke of removing Saddam Hussein, dealing with weapons of \nmass destruction, stopping the march of nuclear weapons into Iraq. We \nnow know all of those things were either wrong in that original \nresolution or have become moot by the events that have transpired.\n  There is an effort underway to make sure this debate on Iraq \nrepresents the bipartisan feeling of America, represents the fact that \nthere are Democrats and Republicans and Independents who feel intensely \nthat the current strategy, the current plan the President is pursuing \nis not the right plan.\n  The first resolution will be considered by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee this week and is sponsored by Senators Biden and Levin on the \nDemocratic side and Senator Hagel on the Republican side.\n  Yesterday, there was another resolution brought to the attention of \nthe American people, introduced by three Members I respect. Senator \nJohn Warner, former chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, a \nRepublican Senator from Virginia, the lead sponsor, Senator Ben Nelson, \na Democrat from Nebraska, and Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from \nMaine, are about to introduce a resolution that clearly expresses the \nsense of Congress about this strategy in Iraq. Much has been written \nabout it. The resolution should speak for itself because these \nSenators, two Republicans and a Democrat, resolve:\n\n       That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Senate disagrees with the ``plan'' to augment our \n     forces by 21,500, and urges the President instead to consider \n     all options and alternatives for achieving the strategic \n     goals set forth below with reduced force levels than \n     proposed.\n\n  The important thing about these resolutions, though they are \ndifferent in wording, is they all reach the same conclusion. The \nconclusion is the President's policy, the escalation or augmentation, \nvirtually the same word, is the wrong way to move in Iraq today.\n  I hope at the end of the day we can come together on a bipartisan \nbasis, that we can cooperate in finding ways to blend these resolutions \nso we do speak as much as possible with a common bipartisan voice in \nthe Senate. We need to call for the kind of change in the President's \npolicy that the American people asked for in this election.\n  Our call is not based on politics but based on reality--the reality \nof the deaths which American troops have endured in this conflict and \nthe reality of the war on the ground, a war which becomes more serious \nand more violent by the day.\n\n[[Page S878]]\n\n  We know the military experts have disagreed with the White House for \na long time. GEN Eric Shinseki in 2003, as Army Chief of Staff, said we \nwould need many more troops than the administration was prepared to \nsend and more allies to secure peace ultimately in Iraq. Not only did \nthe administration ignore General Shinseki's advice, they invited him \nto leave. We now know he was the one who had the insight they should \nhave followed.\n  General Abizaid, the commander of all our forces in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, has told us that every divisional and corps commander in \nthe theater has told him we should not send more troops. That is what \nthe President has chosen to do despite this advice from his top \ngenerals. General Abizaid testified before Congress that he is \nconvinced that:\n\n     . . . more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing \n     more, from taking more responsibility for their own future.\n\n  General Abizaid and others have also repeatedly stated that the \nsolution to the violence in Iraq is not military, it is political. We \nhave to turn to Prime Minister Maliki and his Cabinet to make the \npolitical decisions which will make the difference.\n\n  General Abizaid is not alone. The Iraqis themselves appear to agree \nwith his conclusion. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki stated on \nNovember 27 last year:\n\n       The crisis is political, and the ones who can stop the \n     cycle of aggravation and bloodletting of innocents are the \n     politicians.\n\n  The Iraqi Prime Minister has said what he needs most is weapons and \nequipment, not American soldiers. When Prime Minister Maliki met with \nPresident Bush in Jordan in November, he didn't ask for more American \ntroops; rather, he said he needed support by way of equipment and \nweapons. In fact, Prime Minister Maliki suggested we should reduce the \npresence of American troops in his country. The President has done just \nthe opposite.\n  A United States official was quoted as saying that ``The message in \nAmman was that Maliki wanted to take the lead and put an Iraqi face on \nit. He wanted to control his own forces.''\n  The answer to all of Iraq's problems is not simply to deliver more \nAmerican soldiers. But American weaponry and equipment can be helpful. \nPresident Bush has disagreed. Although he steadfastly said as the \nIraqis stand up, our forces will stand down, exactly the opposite has \noccurred. As the Prime Minister of Iraq has offered to stand up more \nforces to defend his own country, the President of the United States \nhas said we are going to send 21,000 more of our best and bravest into \nthe face of danger.\n  Our troops have fought brilliantly and courageously. Over the \nweekend, Senator John McCain, a man whom I respect and count as a \nfriend, made a statement on one of the talk shows, I believe it was \n``Meet the Press,'' that he felt the resolutions we were debating were \na vote of confidence on whether we trusted America's troops to get the \njob done. As much as I respect Senator McCain, I could not disagree \nmore. This vote is not about our faith in our troops. Trust me, if a \nvote came to the Senate on our commitment and respect for our American \nmilitary service men and women, it would be 100 to 0. We all stand in \nawe and admiration of the contributions they have made to our country \nand the courage they show every day. We have confidence that given an \nassignment that can be physically accomplished, they will do it better \nthan any military force in the world.\n  But the debate is not over our troops. The debate is over the \nPresident's policy. Those troops didn't write the policy that sent too \nfew troops to Iraq initially. Those soldiers didn't write the \nrequisitions to send humvees that have become, sadly, opportunities for \nroadside bombs to maim and kill our soldiers. Those troops didn't make \nthe critical decisions about disbanding the Iraqi Army. They didn't \nmake the political decisions along the way. They did their duty. And \nthey continue to do so.\n  What we are debating here is the policy decisions being made by this \nadministration, and a larger and larger number of Democratic and \nRepublican Senators are speaking out that these decisions have been \nwrong and that the President's plans continue to make the wrong \ndecision.\n  The Iraq Study Group was a bipartisan effort to try to find a way \nthrough this, to come out with a plan that will work so we can truly \nbring our troops home successfully. They talked about the fact that \nadding more troops would not be a good move. In fact, bringing troops \nhome should be our goal. They established the date of April 1, 2008, \nfor most of those troops to be gone. And they called for something that \nthis administration continues to ignore: They called for a surge in \ndiplomacy--not a surge in the military but a surge in diplomacy.\n  Baker and Hamilton, a Republican and a Democrat, with credentials of \nreal experience at the highest levels of our Government, said it is \ntime for us to open a dialog with the Syrians and with the Iranians \nabout the stability of the Middle East and to try to find common \nground. There are no guarantees of success with diplomatic dialog, but \nthere is a guarantee that if you don't try, you won't succeed.\n  Sadly, this administration has refused to try at the diplomatic \nlevel. Their responses continue to be military when we know time and \nagain the solution is political within Iraq and diplomatic outside \nIraq.\n  The Baker-Hamilton study group issued its report. It was received \ncordially by the White House and then ignored. Many Members believe we \nshould return to it, begin the redeployment of American forces, start \nthem coming home, as Prime Minister al-Malaki has asked, start moving \nthe Iraqis into a position of more responsibility and leadership, call \non the al-Malaki government in Iraq to make the political concessions \nto try to bring an end to the sectarian strife, the civil war that has \ncaused all this violence and continues to on a day-to-day basis.\n\n  There is one thing we should stop and assess as well. That is the \nreal cost of this war. I have come to the floor of the Senate many \ntimes and talked about $2 billion a week that is not being spent in \nAmerica, $2 billion being spent on this war. I voted for the money to \nsupport our troops, and I will continue to, but we have to be honest \nabout the costs of the war. Our Defense bill for the coming year, \naccording to the Wall Street Journal last week, may top $600 billion. \nThat figure does not include the extra $100 billion in emergency \nappropriations that Congress will soon be asked to vote on to sustain \ncurrent operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The costs of the war in Iraq have been extraordinary, whether \nmeasured in dollars or human lives. I went through a long list last \nweek of what we could have done in America with $400 billion, the $400 \nbillion we have spent in Iraq, what we could have done by way of \nextending the opportunity for health care and health insurance to \nmillions of Americans currently uninsured, offering to pay for college \neducation for students coming out of high school who are accepted at \nthe best colleges. All of these things could have been done and weren't \ndone because, instead, we have invested the money in this war.\n  The administration's view is, we will continue with no end in sight \nto spend these dollars at great expense to America and lost \nopportunities to our people. An open-ended commitment, as this \nadministration has suggested, means these costs are also open-ended. It \nis time to break this cycle, to address our real security needs in \nAmerica, to implement the 9/11 recommendations at some expense but, \nreally, to protect our people from any future possible terrorist \nattack. The bipartisan resolution that will come before the Senate in \nthe coming days states that our goal in Iraq should be to maximize our \nchances of success. An open-ended commitment of U.S. forces in Iraq \nreduces these chances rather than increasing them. Here in the safety \nand comfort of Washington, we owe to it our troops not to forget that \ntoday they stand in danger risking their lives.\n  Soon we will vote on whether we support the escalation of the war \nthat the President has called on. Let no one confuse that issue with \nthe question of whether we support our troops, whether we have \nconfidence in our troops.\n  Let me make something else clear: The resolution we are debating is \nnot a vote of confidence on the President,\n\n[[Page S879]]\n\nnor on the troops. It is about a policy. It is a deliberation about a \npolicy and a strategic decision. That is why we are here. That is why \nwe were elected. We cannot shy away from that responsibility. We all \nsupport our men and women in uniform. But like a majority of Americans, \nwe also support the changes in policy that will lead to the \nredeployment of U.S. forces, ultimately bringing them home to safety.\n  That is the change that was called for in the last election. That is \nthe new direction that is needed at this point in our history.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to discuss \nan amendment that is pending before the Senate, which was offered by \nthe ranking member of the committee, Senator Enzi, which I have \nintroduced along with Senators Enzi and Landrieu. It is a bipartisan \namendment to enhance compliance assistance for small businesses. Before \nI address the amendment, I wish to make a few comments about the \nminimum wage package we are currently considering on the floor.\n  I thank the leadership on both sides of the political aisle for \nworking together to develop a bipartisan consensus to raise the minimum \nwage. From the outset, Senator Reid and Senator McConnell set a \nbipartisan tone in forging a path to increasing the minimum wage. I \nalso thank Chairman Kennedy and the ranking member, Senator Enzi, for \nworking together to develop this bipartisan legislation as well. I \nthink this is a very encouraging beginning to the 110th Congress and \nhopefully a time we can reach across partisan divides to enact \nmeaningful legislation.\n  I also commend Chairman Baucus of the Finance Committee, along with \nSenator Grassley, for working to draft the small business tax package \nthat is also incorporated in the minimum wage bill. It was especially \nrefreshing to see both Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley \nworking so closely together to forge a compromise that addresses \nconcerns on both sides of the aisle.\n  By enacting the minimum wage, we will accomplish a legislative win-\nwin by increasing the minimum wage but also at the same time providing \nsmall businesses with significant tax and regulatory relief in a way \nthat does not add to our Nation's deficit. That is a great example of \nthe social and fiscal responsibility we must embrace.\n  Small business tax and regulatory relief and increasing the minimum \nwage do not have to be mutually exclusive. I believe it is time to \nraise the minimum wage. It is certainly long overdue, since the last \ntime the minimum wage was raised was back in 1997. Given the \nsignificant increases in the cost of living since then, most notably \nthe rise in prices in housing, energy, and health care, families need \nto support themselves, and they certainly cannot do it on less than \n$11,000 annually.\n  I am deeply concerned as well about the widening wage gap in America, \nwhich is creating a burgeoning economic divide when it comes to income. \nAs the chart behind me shows--and I think it is very important because \nhopefully one of the priorities in this Congress will be to explore \npolicies that will narrow the wage gap in America--according to the \nlatest census data, in 2005, a household in the 90th percentile earned \n$114,000 more--or 11 times as much--than a family in the 10th income \npercentile. Moreover, income for households at the top has grown over \nthe last 30 years, while income for households at the bottom has \nremained flat.\n  A recent BusinessWeek article reported that increasing the minimum \nwage to $7.25 an hour could raise the pay for 16 percent of the \nNation's workforce. So I am unequivocally supportive of this \ninitiative. I also believe, as the ranking member of the Small Business \nCommittee and previously chair of the committee, that we need to \nbalance the minimum wage increase with a robust package of small \nbusiness tax and regulatory reform to relieve many of the burdens small \nbusinesses continue to face.\n  The fact is, small business is the engine that is driving the \neconomy. It is the one segment of the economy that is actually creating \njobs. Three-quarters of all of the net new jobs are created by a small \nbusiness; therefore, it is in our interest to make sure we can \nguarantee for the future that this segment of the economy is going to \ncontinue to create jobs and to restore the long-term economic vitality \nof small businesses.\n  Over the past 20 years, which is the subject of this amendment today, \nthe number and complexity of Federal regulations has multiplied at an \nalarming rate. In 2004, for example, the Federal Register contained \n75,675 pages, an all-time record, and 4,101 rules. These rules and \nregulations impose a much more significant impact on smaller businesses \nthan larger businesses. As illustrated by the chart behind me, it \ndemonstrates unequivocally the disproportionate burden borne by small \nbusinesses versus large corporations in order to absorb the impact of \nmore regulations and more rules. It illustrates the conclusion found in \na recent report that was prepared by the Small Business \nAdministration's Office of Advocacy that said in 2004 that the per-\nemployee cost of Federal regulations for small businesses with fewer \nthan 20 employees was $7,647. In contrast, the per-employee cost of \nFederal regulations for firms with 500 or more workers was $5,282. This \nresults in a 44-percent increase in burden for smaller businesses \ncompared to their larger counterparts. Clearly, we must find ways to \nease the regulatory burden for our Nation's small businesses so they \nmay continue to create jobs and drive economic growth.\n  As the leading Republican on the Small Business Committee, I continue \nto hear from small businesses across the country, in addition to my \nhome State of Maine, which is essentially a small business State where \n98 percent of all employers are small businesses. But to give an \nexample of the impact of the regulatory burden, I cite one company, \nHammond Lumber Company, which faces the increased cost of regulatory \ncompliance. It is a shining example of the American dream come true. It \nhas been a family-owned company for three generations. They have been \nthriving in the State of Maine and serving not only Maine but all of \nNew England for more than 50 years. It grew from a company of 41 \nemployees in 1976 to over 300 employees in 2006. Hammond Lumber \nexemplifies the tremendous spirit of the American entrepreneur. It also \ndemonstrates the pivotal role small businesses play in creating jobs \nand driving our Nation's economy. However, as Hammond Lumber has grown, \nso has its regulatory burden. In 1976, its total regulatory cost per \nemployee equaled $98. Last year, it was $441 per employee. I had the \nopportunity to tour the company. I talked to the owners and talked to \nthe employees. Unquestionably, it is a thriving company. They told us \nthat the burden they were enduring as a result of the regulatory \ncompliance was clearly having adverse consequences.\n  So we need to level the playing field for small businesses and make \nit easier for them to comply with complex regulations. All too often, \nsmall businesses don't maintain staff, don't have the financial \nresources to comply with Federal complexities, rules, and regulations. \nThis places them at a disadvantage compared to larger companies. It \nalso reduces the effectiveness of the agency's regulations. If the \nagency cannot describe how to comply with its regulations, how can we \nexpect a small business to figure it out? That is why I have offered \nthis amendment, along with Senator Enzi and Senator Landrieu, which \nwould clarify the small business requirement that exists under Federal \nlaw.\n  Our amendment is drawn directly from recommendations put forward by \nthe GAO and is intended only to clarify an already existing requirement \nwhich\n\n[[Page S880]]\n\npassed unanimously in the Senate, became law, back in 1996 when we \npassed the model legislation to ease the impact on small businesses \nwith respect to the Federal bureaucracy creating rules and regulations. \nThat legislation that became law was intended to ensure that the \nFederal Government and all of the agencies consider the impact to small \nbusinesses of these proposed rules and regulations.\n  One of the most important provisions of this act was a requirement \nthat Federal agencies work to produce compliance assistance materials \nto help small businesses satisfy their regulatory obligations. \nUnfortunately, the GAO has discovered that Federal agencies have \nignored these requirements or failed miserably in their attempt to \nsatisfy them. GAO also discovered that the language of the act is \nunclear in some places about what is actually required of small \nbusinesses. Consequently, small businesses were forced to figure out \nall these complicated regulations on their own. Obviously, this makes \ncompliance that much more difficult to achieve. So my amendment is \ndrawn specifically and directly from the GAO. It clarifies when a small \nbusiness compliance guide is required, how a guide shall be designated, \nhow and when a guide shall be published, and that the agency make the \nguide available on the Internet. These are commonsense, good government \nreforms, which will provide major relief for small businesses at \nvirtually no cost to the Federal Government.\n  I think it is very important that this amendment be adopted because \nall too often we have discovered--as underscored by GAO in their recent \nreport--that the agencies find ways or discover loopholes to circumvent \nthe requirement. It is that much easier because they don't want to have \nto bother to help small businesses comply with regulations, and they \nuse the rationale--or the excuse, I might say--of the ambiguity in law \nthat doesn't allow them to be clear or to provide the assistance \ndirectly to small businesses. So we want to remove the ambiguity and we \nwant to be sure that the amendment as represented here today, which \nwould be translated into the statute, will be abundantly clear and \nspecific in terms of how the agencies are going to allow small \nbusinesses to comply with these regulations, with the assistance that \ncould be provided by these agencies as well.\n  I think it is also important to stress that this amendment does not \nplace any additional arduous requirements on small businesses. There \nare no additional enforcement measures. We are just saying that this is \nimportant to clarify, so that agencies don't have an excuse for \navoiding compliance with this regulation and also providing assistance \nto small businesses, and doesn't undercut an agency's ability to \nenforce its regulation to the fullest extent they currently enjoy.\n  Furthermore, this amendment was introduced in the form of a bill that \nenjoyed broad bipartisan support. It was also included last year in the \nSmall Business Reauthorization Act that was unanimously reported out of \nthe Senate Small Business Committee in the 109th Congress. This isn't \nany new ground. It is straightforward. It will help small businesses, \nwhich are doing so much to create jobs in our economy. Frankly, we \nought to do more for small businesses. I think this is a sector of our \neconomy which we have overlooked and ignored.\n  There are so many resources that we could make available to small \nbusinesses for a minimal cost that I think could leverage job creation \nthroughout this country. I know, in working with the new chair of the \nSmall Business Committee, Senator Kerry, that we are going to look to \nthe future to see what kind of programs we can build upon, what kind of \nefforts we can make that can help small businesses thrive and flourish \nand create the jobs that so many parts of our country desperately need \nand require.\n  I am looking forward to working with Chairman Kerry in that regard, \nalso with Chairman Baucus and the Senate Finance Committee because the \nunderlying bill includes some very significant tax relief measures. \nUnfortunately, they will expire in the future. In the short term, in \nsome cases, such as small business expensing, I think we have to \nconsider ways to make that expensing requirement permanent because \nsmall businesses clearly deserve to have continuity of that provision \nand the certainty that it is going to be there.\n  I applaud Chairman Baucus for undertaking this initiative as the \nfirst action as chair of the Finance Committee in the markup, and it \nclearly is going to go a long way toward helping to bolster a very \nsignificant part of our economy, and that is, of course, small business \ngrowth.\n  We want to do more, we should do more, and we can do more.\n  Again, I urge Members of the Senate to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/23/senate-section/article/S880-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will take a moment or two to thank the \nSenator from Maine and thank the Senator from Wyoming. If one will take \na few moments and look through this amendment and the modification, \nthey will understand what the good Senators have been talking about. It \ntalks about posting to make sure the information is going to be \navailable to small businesses. It talks about distribution, to make \nsure there is going to be a generous distribution. It talks about a \ntimely distribution, so we are not going to have a final date, and then \nthe Agency is going to delay in terms of posting and distribution.\n  It explains what is necessary for small businesses to be able to \ncomply with the rules and the regulations. It doesn't affect those \nregulations that have been set and established. And it makes the \nrequirement that it be put in plain English language so that any person \nis able to understand what is intended and what the rule is covering, \nand then it has the provision to inform Congress, the appropriate \ncommittees, as to what they have done over previous years.\n  This makes a lot of good sense. I commend the Senator from Maine and \nthe Senator from Wyoming, and my colleague, Senator Kerry, who has been \ninvolved in this effort, and Senator Landrieu as well. I am very \ngrateful to all of them for working with us. This is a very useful and \nextremely important and valuable addition to the legislation.\n  I know the Senator from Pennsylvania is desirous to address the \noverall issue. Mr. President, as I understand it, under the previous \norder, at noontime, we are going to vote on this amendment; is that \ncorrect?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no order to that effect.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand, shortly, there will be, I expect. At \nthe appropriate time, we will ask for the yeas and nays. We intend to \nhave the vote, for the information of offices, at that time.\n  I see both the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from \nPennsylvania are here.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 112\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 112 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Sununu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 112.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prevent the closure and defunding of certain women's \n                           business centers)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RENEWAL GRANTS FOR WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS.\n\n       Section 29 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 656) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(m) Continued Funding for Centers.--\n       ``(1) In general.--A nonprofit organization described in \n     paragraph (2) shall be eligible to receive, subject to \n     paragraph (3), a 3-year grant under this subsection.\n       ``(2) Applicability.--A nonprofit organization described in \n     this paragraph is a nonprofit organization that--\n       ``(A) has received funding under subsections (b) and (l); \n     and\n       ``(B) is not eligible under the programs under such \n     subsections for the first fiscal year after the end of the \n     period of financial assistance under subsection (l).\n       ``(3) Application and approval criteria.--\n       ``(A) Criteria.--The Administrator shall develop and \n     publish criteria for the consideration and approval of \n     applications by nonprofit organizations under this \n     subsection.\n       ``(B) Notification.--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     of the deadline to submit applications for each fiscal year, \n     the Administrator shall approve or deny any application under \n     this subsection and notify the applicant for each such \n     application.\n       ``(4) Award of grants.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, the Administrator shall make a grant for the \n     Federal share of the cost of activities described in the \n     application to each applicant approved under this subsection.\n       ``(B) Amount.--A grant under this subsection shall be for \n     not less than $90,000 and not more than $150,000, for each \n     year of that grant.\n       ``(C) Federal share.--The Federal share under this \n     subsection shall be not more than 50 percent.\n       ``(D) Priority.--In allocating funds made available for \n     grants under this section, the Administrator shall give \n     applications under this subsection priority over first-time \n     applications under subsection (b).\n       ``(5) Renewal.--The Administrator may renew a grant under \n     this subsection for additional 3-year periods, if the \n     nonprofit organization submits an application for such \n     renewal at such time, in such manner, and accompanied by such \n     information as the Administrator may establish.''.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, this is an important debate and important \ndiscussion, especially in regard to the points made by Senator Snowe of \nMaine; that is, if we raise the minimum wage, we need to understand \nboth the potential impact on small businesses and recognize those small \nbusinesses are creating most of the job opportunities in our country. \nThey fuel our economy. Over the long term, as those smaller \nentrepreneurial firms grow, they provide support for a growing wage \nbase, for benefits, and for support of the families who depend on those \nsmall businesses for their jobs.\n  I welcome her amendment that deals with small business regulation. It \nis an important step in the right direction, and I certainly hope it \ncontinues to receive bipartisan support in the Senate. I think many of \nthe provisions that are in the substitute that deal with support for \nsmall business will receive bipartisan support.\n  Senator Snowe also mentioned the importance of tax treatment for \nsmall business investments and capital spending, and that they be \nallowed to expense that, in turn, allowing them to find additional \nresources to continue that pattern of investment.\n  The amendment I have called up also deals with the issue of small \nbusiness, entrepreneurship and job creation and a small, but important, \nprogram in our Government called the Women's Business Centers. There \nare about 100 Women's Business Centers across the country. There is one \nin Portsmouth, NH, that was among the very first created in the United \nStates, and it deals with a range of issues from providing an incubator \nfor women entrepreneurs just starting out a firm, to providing training \nand counseling, support for marketing services, information about \nGovernment procurement, so many of the issues that have already been \naddressed on the floor.\n  What this amendment does is to simply ensure that those high-\nperforming Women's Business Centers that have continued to serve a \nstrong, important\n\n[[Page S882]]\n\nclientele and have supported entrepreneurship and investment in their \ncommunity continue to be eligible for funding.\n  Under the current restrictions, some of those centers, after 5 years \nof sustainability grants, lose the opportunity for additional funding. \nMy amendment would create a new program within the WBC program that \nallows those centers to apply for a 3-year continuation of Federal \nfunding, provided they continue to meet high standards, serve their \nclients effectively, and attract sources of funding from the community.\n  I think it is a reasonable approach, one that makes sense. Look at \nthe great example that has been set in Portsmouth. With the limited \namount of Federal funding and other community resources, in the past \nyear, it has served over 1,300 individual entrepreneurs. That, as we \nlike to say in Washington, is real leverage, real performance.\n  This does not require additional funding. It is a straightforward way \nto ensure that an important need continues to be met and that this bill \nhas the appropriate balance and support for the small business \ncommunity.\n  I commend the work of the Senator from Maine, for her work on small \nbusiness generally within the Small Business Committee. This is \nsomething they have tried to address before and the Senate has \nsupported in the past. I hope it is something that will continue to \nreceive bipartisan support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with regard to the amendment of the \nSenator from New Hampshire, it seems by both the explanation and a \nfirst look, this is something that will be very useful and valuable. If \nthe Senator will work with us--I am not prepared, at this time, to \nrecommend the amendment, but we will work on it with him and indicate \nwhat our position is in the very near future. But it certainly seems, \ntrying to give some focus and attention to small businesses that are \ninitiated by women, to make a good deal of sense, and it is subject to \nan authorization, so there is no point of order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his comments. \nObviously, I just called up the amendment. I don't expect him to \nendorse it wholeheartedly. I think he will find he has supported it in \nthe past and many in the Chamber have supported it in the past and it \nis worthy of our consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 115 to Amendment No. 100\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I seek recognition for the purpose of laying \ndown an amendment and not speaking to it. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending amendment be laid aside for that purpose.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment that deals \nwith extending some current provisions and adding additional provisions \nto assist small businesses to pay for a minimum wage increase, should \none be adopted. I will speak to this later. I appreciate others \nallowing me to lay it down.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 115 to amendment No. 100.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To extend through December 31, 2008, the depreciation \n   treatment of leasehold, restaurant, and retail space improvements)\n\n       On page 4, line 21, strike ``April 1, 2008'' and insert \n     ``January 1, 2009''.\n       On page 6, lines 5 and 6, strike ``April 1, 2008'' and \n     insert ``January 1, 2009''.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 2 which, as \nwe know, will increase the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an \nhour. I thank my colleague, Senator Kennedy, and the bipartisan work \nthat went into developing this issue.\n  I speak today of an issue which I believe is one of economic justice. \nThose earning the minimum wage have not had an increase in 10 years. We \nshould ask ourselves today not only about the information in the bill \nand the data, as important as that is, we should ask ourselves who are \nthese Americans who have not had an increase in 10 long years?\n  Most, of course, we know are adults working full time. In fact, in my \nhome State of Pennsylvania, 71 percent of the workers whose wages would \nbe raised directly by an increase in the minimum wage are adults ages \n20 and older.\n  Also, these Americans in many cases are women. Sixty percent of those \nwho would be affected by an increase in the minimum wage are women, \nworking every day to make ends meet, to support their children. In \nfact, if the minimum wage is raised, 6 million children will benefit.\n  Recently, the Children's Defense Fund reported that a single parent \nworking full time at the current minimum wage of $5.15 an hour earns \nenough to cover only 40 percent--just 40 percent--of the cost of \nraising children.\n  Those who earn the minimum wage are not people who are connected to \nthe wealthy and the powerful. They don't have high-paid lobbyists in \nWashington advocating for them. No, these people are Americans who lead \nquiet, triumphant lives of struggle and sacrifice, overcoming hardships \nand setbacks every day. They do hard work, very hard work, such as the \nwaitresses we see every day carrying heavy trays, on their feet hour \nafter hour, as they dream of a better life for themselves and for their \nchildren. And at the end of a long day, these Americans return to work \nand go home at the end of a long day often exhausted, often working not \none job but two jobs or three, and the dignity of their labor gives \nmeaning to their lives. We know, and they would tell us that if they \nwere standing here today next to me. So that work they do gives meaning \nto their lives without a doubt.\n  But no one, no matter how hard they work, can keep pace with the \navalanche of cost increases we have seen over the last 10 years. Let me \ntake my colleagues through a couple of those cost increases.\n  Since 1997, congressional pay has increased 24 percent, about \n$31,000. This has occurred while the value of the minimum wage has been \neroded by 20 percent.\n\n  Let me say that again: Congressional pay up 24 percent, the value of \nthe minimum wage down 20 percent. We cannot say that enough. The cost \nof living is up 26 percent, the cost of food up 23 percent, the cost of \nhousing up 29 percent, the cost of gasoline up over 130 percent, the \ncost of health care up 43 percent. Families who are listening to this \ntoday know this. The average premium for a family of four costs over \n$10,000, almost $11,000, which is more than a minimum wage worker earns \nin a year.\n  The cost of raising a child since 1997 has increased 52 percent; the \ncost of educating those children has risen 61 percent; the cost of \nheating a home has increased by 120 percent.\n  What we are talking about here is an issue, indeed, of economic \njustice. Raising the Federal minimum wage will give our workers more \nthan $4,000 per year. Let's consider what that could buy for a family \nin America. You can buy almost 2 years of childcare with over $4,000, \nfull tuition at a community college, 2 years of health care, 1 year of \ngroceries, 1\\1/2\\ years of heat and electricity, and 8 months of rent. \nThat is how we affect, in a positive way, people's lives, the lives of \nhard-working men and women in America today.\n  Those who argue against an increase in the minimum wage will say that \nan increase will hurt small business and/or the economy. I do not agree \nwith that because if you look at the data, when the minimum wage was \nincreased in 1997, what happened in the aftermath? Millions and \nmillions of jobs were created and raising the minimum wage did not slow \nthat down one iota.\n  Recently, over 650 economists issued a statement calling for an \nincrease in\n\n[[Page S883]]\n\nthe minimum wage. We do not have time today to go through that, but it \nis an important statement from leading economists in America. With an \nincrease in minimum wage, employers will get a lot in return: higher \nproductivity they will get with an increase in the minimum wage; lower \nturnover; and, of course, increased worker morale.\n  Mr. President, you know as well as I do that more than 28 States now \nhave increased the minimum wage, including my home State of \nPennsylvania. In July of this year it will increase to $7.15 an hour, \nas a result of State legislation. That should not have had to take \nplace. The Federal Government long ago--we are years overdue on this--\nshould have taken the responsibility for increasing the minimum wage, \nbut that did not happen here in Washington. There were other \npriorities, other interests, more powerful interests that took \nprecedence.\n  More than 400,000 Pennsylvanians will be affected positively by an \nincrease in the minimum wage. I am thinking of them today as I am of \nfamilies across America who will be affected positively by an increase \nin the minimum wage. Yes, I do believe that small businesses across \nPennsylvania and America do need help. However, in my judgment, based \nupon the people to whom I have spoken in my State, the No. 1 priority \nor the No. 1 burden faced by small business owners, men or women, is \nthe cost, the crushing cost of health care. We need to deliver health \ncare relief to those small businesses, and that as well is long \noverdue, because those small business owners and their workers deserve \nthe same kind of economic justice I talked about today.\n  I fervently urge support for this legislation, and I appreciate this \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for \nspeaking in favor of this minimum wage amendment. This was an issue, I \nknow, out in the State of Pennsylvania during the course of the \ncampaign. Senator Casey was resolute in his commitment to the working \nfamilies in his State and I am very grateful for his comments and \nstrong support for this issue.\n  As I understand it, we expect Senator Grassley is going to speak to \nthe Senate, and my friend and colleague from Hawaii, Senator Akaka, is \ngoing to address the Senate. We are working out the consent agreement \nfor the time for the vote. It had initially been set tentatively for \nnoontime. Now, I want to tell our colleagues, it is going to be after \nthe caucuses. We are working out the final time and we will make that \nannouncement in a very few moments. But for the information of our \ncolleagues, and their schedules, we will not be voting prior to the \ncaucuses. We will be voting after the caucuses and we will be more \nprecise in a very short period of time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to address two aspects of this \nlegislation because they are necessarily connected. One is, obviously, \nthe increase in the minimum wage. The other one is the small business \ntax provisions that have come out of the committee Senator Baucus \nchairs and on which I am the ranking member, the Finance Committee. I \nwant to deal with the minimum wage part of this issue first.\n  Popular support for raising the minimum wage is based on a number of \nwidely held beliefs: First, that no one can support a family at $5.15 \nan hour; second, minimum wage earners will not get a pay raise unless \nCongress gives them one; and third, raising the minimum wage helps \nmillions of poor workers and hurts no one.\n  Unfortunately, these popular beliefs are in some cases misleading and \nin some cases outright wrong. First, minimum wage earners are not \ntrying to support a family--or you might argue a small percentage of \nthem are trying to support a family, but I want to say why most are \nnot. Those who are, of course, can get additional benefits through \nGovernment programs to supplement family income; thus, no one has to \nrely solely on the minimum wage to support a family.\n  Second, minimum wage jobs are generally entry level jobs. Most \nworkers who start at the minimum wage quickly earn more. Few workers \nremain stuck at the minimum wage for very long and, unfortunately, \nthose who do are most at risk of losing their jobs from a minimum wage \nincrease.\n  Third, the benefits of a minimum wage increase do not go exclusively \nto poor families. Only 15 percent of the proposed minimum wage increase \nwould go to those living below the poverty level, as an example. \nIncreasing the minimum wage would result in higher prices for consumers \nof minimum wage products, higher unemployment among the least skilled \nminimum wage workers--and that particularly affects minority groups \nwithin our country--increased poverty among minimum wage families, and \nin some cases it could be a combination of these three things I \nmentioned.\n  Much of the popular support for the minimum wage is based on a \nfallacy, that the Government can help the poor without hurting anyone \nelse. But if the Government can increase wages with no ill effects, \nthen why stop at $7.25, as is currently proposed? Why not make it \n$10.25? Why not make it $20.25, or even more? The fact is, this does \nhave limited impact and it does have some negative consequences, so \nthat is why these occasional increases are justified.\n  Popular support for increasing the minimum wage is tempered by the \nfact that virtually everyone agrees that there is some level at which \nthe minimum wage would produce obvious negative effects. In the past, \npolicymakers have attempted to mitigate any negative effects by \nlimiting the size of the minimum wage increase, providing tax credits \nto employers who hire at-risk workers, and providing tax or regulatory \nrelief to business generally, particularly small businesses.\n  However, additional research in recent years has cast some doubt on \nthe effectiveness of these previous efforts. First, research suggests \nraising the minimum wage does not reduce poverty among minimum wage \nearners. Instead, it most likely increases poverty.\n  Second, legislative action by various States to adopt their own \nhigher minimum wage has led to significant differences within our 50 \nStates.\n  Third, research shows that the earned income tax credit could provide \na cost-effective way to help poorest workers and be more effective than \neven increasing the minimum wage.\n  I am pleased that over the last few years we have enhanced the earned \nincome credit for many families by making the child tax credit \nrefundable. That is through the work of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Before I go on to my next point I would say parenthetically there are \nstudies that have been updated quite frequently over the last 20 or 25 \nyears, where economists have followed people in quintiles: the lowest, \nthe second, you know, for five quintiles from the lowest income up to \nthe highest income. Following people over a period of years, they have \nbeen able to study the mobility of the American worker. In other words, \nonce you are in the workforce, most people work themselves up the \neconomic ladder--some way up, some part way up. But we find that only \nabout 2 percent of our population seems to be stuck in the lowest \nquintile of income for long periods of time--a very small percentage. \nBut other people go from the second quintile--from the first to the \nsecond to the third, and we also find that there is a larger percentage \nof our population that moves up from the lower two quintiles into the \nthird or the fourth quintiles--a lot more rapidly and with a lot more \nmobility than we find people moving from the fourth to the top. While \nthere are some people moving down from the highest to a lower quintile, \nhistory proves the mobility of the workforce in America is very much \nupward.\n  Despite some serious policy concerns, public support for increasing \nthe minimum wage remains strong. That is why the Senate is taking up a \nminimum wage increase. The political reality is a majority of Senators \nsupport a minimum wage increase.\n  So a lot of economists would make an argument that you should not \nhave any increase in the minimum wage at all and that the mistakes, \ngoing back to the 1930s, were mistakes; that you should not interfere \nwith the marketplace. But Congress has decided for 70 years to do that. \nWe are in the process for doing it. Regardless of the economic \narguments, as long as this is a\n\n[[Page S884]]\n\npolitical issue, without a doubt, from time to time it is going to be \nraised and I suppose you could make an argument that, as long as it is \npolitical it ought to be raised, or else you should not even have a \nminimum wage.\n  Now I would go to the tax incentive portions we hope stay in this \nbill when it goes to the other body. Tax incentives targeted to small \nbusiness and other businesses impacted by a minimum wage increase have \nbeen linked to the minimum wage legislation. We have done this in the \npast decade. Democrats have at times joined Republicans supporting this \nlanguage.\n  I would quote from two former chairmen on this committee in their \nopening remarks on the conference agreement on the last piece of \nlegislation that went through this body to raise the minimum wage. \nSenator Roth, then the chairman of the committee, described taxes as \nthe sand that grinds the gears of small business. So he saw merit in \nsmall business tax relief as a separate matter. Senator Roth went on to \nsay:\n\n       [We will] proceed to the legislation on the minimum wage \n     and small business taxes. We're anxious to move ahead on the \n     small business tax legislation.\n  Senator Moynihan, who at times was chairman of the committee and at \ntimes the ranking Democrat, said, at the same time Senator Roth was \nspeaking:\n\n       My distinguished chairman, as always, has so stated the \n     facts. But there is a small semantic issue here. Some call \n     this a small business relief act; others on this side call it \n     the minimum wage bill. But we will not resolve that tonight, \n     nor need we.\n\n  Now, the next time the Senate deals with this, about 8 or 9 years \nsince we last dealt with it, it is still the same issue. Senators Roth \nand Moynihan were right then, and if they were still living today, I \nwould tell them they are right now.\n  To different groups of Senators, these topics carry their own \nbenefits or burdens. Many on my side don't like the idea of second-\nguessing the labor market with a federally mandated minimum wage. I \npointed out some of the related issues that should give us pause, \narguments put forth by economists when considering this legislation, \nthat it is not all positive.\n  Many on the Democratic side want a straight minimum wage hike and \nrefuse to consider the burden that policy puts on employers and \nworkers. Those Members do not want any linkage between the minimum wage \npolicy and small business tax relief. As Senator Moynihan said, \nhowever, we don't have to agree now whether the upcoming legislation \nwill be a minimum wage or a small business tax relief bill.\n  Some, mostly Democrats, will call it a minimum wage bill. Some, \nmostly Republicans, will call it a small business tax relief bill. \nStill others will call it both a minimum wage and small business tax \nrelief bill. President Bush, like President Clinton, the last President \nwho signed an increase in the minimum wage bill years ago, will \nrecognize both parts of the package. If my friends on the other side \nreview the statement made by President Clinton, they will see that he \nsaw merit in small business tax relief.\n  Our Committee on Finance chairman, Senator Baucus, recognizes the \nlinkage. I told him Republicans will insist on a small business tax \nrelief package. He, in his cooperative way, as I hope I have been \ncooperative with him in the past, has heard us. Some in his caucus, \ntheir labor union friends and sympathetic ears of the east coast media, \nattacked Senator Baucus--which I don't understand--for recognizing a \nbasic reality, as Senator Moynihan and Senator Roth worked together a \ndecade ago to do, to see that there is some negative impact on small \nbusiness from an increase in the minimum wage so you ought to offset \nthat with some benefit to small business through the tax portions of \nthe legislation.\n  Those folks who are criticizing Senator Baucus don't have the \nresponsibility to find the middle ground and evidently think we can get \na bill through the Senate that can get the votes without finding the \nmiddle ground. It can't be done.\n  Now, if I were chairman--and I am not chairman, and I am not crying \nabout that--I would have tilted this package a little bit more toward \nthe depreciation incentive and less toward the work opportunity tax \ncredits. The reality is, Republicans don't have a majority on the \nCommittee on Finance or in the full Senate, so chairman Baucus has \nstruck a balance between majority Democrats and minority Republicans.\n  I will assist Senator Baucus in defending the tax relief package that \ngoes for the offsets and the revenue-losing provisions. We should not \ndisturb the core structure of this package. I am hopeful, however, that \nwe will improve the package by enhancing the package on the \ndepreciation side, as Senator Kyl has suggested. It is important these \nincentives coincide with the time when the minimum wage increase will \ntake effect. In seeking this objective we will need to find appropriate \noffsets, obviously. There may be other improvements.\n  The bottom line is the Committee on Finance package is a well-known \nset of small business tax relief measures, things we have done before--\nextending, mostly. These proposals have merit by themselves, but a \nminimum wage increase is not likely to pass the Senate without them. I \nhope everyone understands that.\n  As many know, I am a working family farmer. For farmers, fields look \nfamiliar because we work our fields every year. This linkage, then, to \nput a commonsense touch on it, is that the linkage between minimum wage \nand small business relief is a familiar feel. I can quote Roth and \nMoynihan ad infinitum to prove it. It is not something new that is \ncoming up with Baucus and Grassley. We have plowed this ground before. \nThis is well-known common ground.\n  I referred to President Clinton in a signing ceremony about 10 years \nago. That legislation was founded on a small business tax relief \npackage twice this size. I emphasize it was twice the size of what \npeople are complaining about now that we are presenting to the Senate. \nIt was supported at that time by many seeking cloture on the bill that \nis before the Senate.\n  President Clinton singled out the work opportunity tax credit and the \ndepreciation proposals in his remarks. My friend, Senator Kennedy, \nattended the signing ceremony and was recognized by President Clinton \nfor the great product they brought to President Clinton. And John \nSweeney was recognized, the head of the AFL-CIO.\n  I ask unanimous consent the remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  The White House,\n\n\n                                Office of the Press Secretary,\n\n                                                  August 20, 1996.\n\n     Remarks by the President at signing of the Small Business Job \n                         Protection Act of 1996\n\n       The President: Thank you very much. Cathy, it may be your \n     birthday, but I would say that everybody feels that you have \n     given us a great gift today by reminding us about what this \n     is all about. And we wish you and your fine children well. \n     And I don't think being in the band will hurt them a bit. I'm \n     glad you're going to do that. (Laughter.)\n       I want to thank the members of our administration who are \n     here--Secretary Reich, Small Business Administrator Phil \n     Lader and others. I want to thank all the members of Congress \n     who are here, especially Senator Kennedy who, himself, \n     probably broke the wage in hour laws by working so hard to \n     pass this bill. If we'd been paying him by the hour we'd be \n     underpaying him in the last year. Thank you very much. \n     (Applause.)\n       There are a lot of people who worked hard on this bill who \n     aren't here--Senator Daschle, Congressman Gephardt, \n     Congressman Bonior, Congressman Clay, in particular did. I \n     want to join with others and thank the countless labor unions \n     who have championed this bill, led by the truly tireless John \n     Sweeney. (Applause.)\n       I'd like to remind the American people of something, \n     because sometimes our unions are criticized for looking out \n     for their members too much. There are very few unions in \n     America that have minimum wage workers. Most of these unions \n     did this because they thought it was the right thing to do. \n     They spent their time and their money and their energy trying \n     to help other people who do not belong to their organization, \n     and I thank you for that. (Applause.)\n       I'd like to thank the religious groups, the economists, the \n     business people who have made this their cause of concern. \n     Again, I thank the members, including members of both \n     parties, who supported this legislation.\n       I'll say more in a moment about the rest of the bill, but \n     let me just begin by saying this is a truly remarkable piece \n     of legislation. It is pro-work, pro-business and pro-family; \n     it raises the minimum wage; it helps small businesses in a \n     number of ways that I will\n\n[[Page S885]]\n\n     explain in a moment, including retirement and incentive to \n     invest; and it promotes adoption in two very sweeping ways \n     that have long needed to be done in the United States. This \n     is a cause for celebration for all Americans of all parties, \n     all walks of life, all faiths. This bill represents the very \n     best in our country.\n       It will give 10 million Americans, as Cathy said, a chance \n     to raise stronger families and build better futures. By \n     coming together across lines that have too often divided us \n     and finding common ground, we have made this a real season of \n     achievement for the people of America.\n       At its heart, this bill does reaffirm our most profoundly \n     American values--offering opportunity to all, demanding \n     responsibility from all, and coming together as a community \n     to do the right thing. This bill says to the working people \n     of America: If you're willing to take responsibility and go \n     to work, your work will be honored. We're going to honor your \n     commitment to your family, we're going to recognize that \n     $4.25 an hour is not enough to raise a family.\n       It's harder and harder to raise children today and harder \n     and harder for people to succeed at home and at work. And I \n     have said repeatedly, over and over again to the American \n     people: We must not force our families to make a choice. Most \n     parents have to work. We have a national interest in seeing \n     that our people can succeed at home where it counts the most \n     in raising their children, and succeed at work so they'll \n     have enough income to be able to succeed at home. We must do \n     both, and this bill helps us achieve that goal. (Applause.)\n       These 10 million Americans will become part of America's \n     economic success story. A success story that in the last four \n     years has led us to 900,000 new construction jobs; a record \n     number of new businesses started, including those owned by \n     women and minorities; a deficit that is the smallest it's \n     been since 1981, and 60 percent less than it was when I took \n     office; 10 million new jobs; 12 million American families who \n     have been able to take advantage of Family and Medical Leave; \n     almost 4.5 million new homeowners and 10 million other \n     Americans who refinanced their homes at lower mortgage rates. \n     And, most importantly of all, perhaps, real hourly wages, \n     which fell for a decade, have finally begun to rise again. \n     America is on the move. (Applause.)\n       But our challenge, my fellow Americans, is to make sure \n     that every American can reap the rewards of a growing \n     economy, every American has the tools to make the most of his \n     or her own life, to build those strong families and to \n     succeed at home and at work. As the Vice President said, the \n     first step was taken in 1993 with the passage of the Family \n     and Medical Leave Law and with the Earned Income Tax Credit, \n     which cut taxes for 15 million working families. Today, that \n     earned income tax credit is worth about $1,000 to a family of \n     four with an income under $28,000 a year.\n       Well, today, we complete the second half of that effort. \n     Together with our tax cut for working families, this bill \n     ensures that a parent working full-time at the minimum wage \n     can lift himself or herself and their children out of \n     poverty. Nobody who works full-time with kids in the home \n     should be in poverty. If we want to really revolutionize \n     America's welfare system and move people from welfare to work \n     and reward work, that is the first, ultimate test we all have \n     to meet. If you get up every day and you go to work, and you \n     put in your time and you have kids in your home, you and your \n     children will not be in poverty. (Applause.)\n       We have some hard working minimum wage people here today \n     supporting Cathy. Let me tell you about them. Seventy percent \n     of them are adults, six of 10 are working women, and for \n     them, work is about more than a paycheck, it's about pride. \n     They want a wage they can raise their families on. By raising \n     the minimum wage by 90 cents, this bill, over two years, will \n     give those families an additional $1,800 a year in income--\n     enough to buy seven months of groceries, several months of \n     rent, or child care. Or, as Cathy said, to pay all of the \n     bills from the utilities in the same month.\n       For many, this bill will make the difference between their \n     ability to keep their families together and their failure to \n     do so. These people reflect America's values, and it's a lot \n     harder for them than it is for most of us to go around living \n     what they say they believe in. It's about time they got a \n     reward and, today, they'll get it. (Applause.)\n       I would also like to say a very special word of thanks to \n     the business owners, especially the small business owners who \n     supported this bill. Many of the minimum wage employers I \n     talk to wanted to pay their employees more than $4.25 an hour \n     and would be happy to do so as long as they can do it without \n     hurting their businesses, and that means their competitors \n     have to do the same thing. This bill will allow them to \n     complete and win, to have happier, more productive employees, \n     and to know they're doing the right thing. For all of those \n     small businesses, I am very, very appreciative. (Applause.)\n       I would also like to say that this bill does a remarkable \n     number of things for small businesses. In each of the last \n     three years, our nation has set a new record in each \n     succeeding year in the number of new businesses stated. And \n     we know that most of the new jobs in America are being \n     created by small- and medium-sized businesses. In 1993, I \n     proposed a $15,000 increase in the amount of capital a small \n     business can expense, to spark the kind of investment that \n     they need to create jobs. Well, in 1993 we only won half that \n     increase, but today I'll get to sign the second half into \n     law, and I thank the Congress for passing that, as well. \n     (Applause.)\n       As the Vice President said, this bill also includes a Work \n     Opportunity Tax Credit to provide jobs for the most \n     economically disadvantaged working Americans, including \n     people who want to move from welfare to work. Now, there will \n     be a tightly drawn economic incentive for people to hire \n     those folks and give them a chance to enter the workforce, as \n     well. It extends the research tax credit to help businesses \n     stay competitive in the global economy. It extends a tax \n     incentive for businesses to train and educate their \n     employees. That's good news for people who need those skills, \n     and it's good news for America because we have to have the \n     best educated workforce in the world in the 21st century.\n       This legislation does even more to strengthen small \n     business by strengthening the families that make them up. It \n     helps millions of more Americans to save for their own \n     retirement. It makes it much easier for small businesses to \n     offer pension plans by creating a new small business 401(k) \n     plan. It also lets more Americans keep their pensions when \n     they change jobs without having to wait a year before they \n     can start saving at their new jobs. As many as 10 million \n     Americans without pensions today could now earn them as a \n     result of this bill.\n       I'm delighted we are joined today, among others, by Shawn \n     Marcell, the CEO of Prima Facie, a fast-growing video \n     monitoring company in Pennsylvania, which now has just 17 \n     employees--but that's a lot more than he started with. He \n     stood with me in April and promised that if we kept our word \n     and made pensions easier and cheaper for small businesses \n     like his, he'd give pensions to all of his employees. Today, \n     he has told us he's making good on that pledge. I'd like him \n     to stand up, and say I predict that thousands more will \n     follow Shawn's lead. Thank you, Shawn. Please stand up. Let's \n     give him a hand. God bless you, sir. Thank you. (Applause.)\n       I'd also like to say a special word of thanks to our SBA \n     Administrator, Phil Lader, and to the White House Conference \n     on Small Business. When the White House Conference on Small \n     Business met, they said one of their top priorities was \n     increasing the availability and the security of pensions for \n     small business owners in America. This is a good thing. It is \n     also pro-work, pro-family and pro-business.\n       Finally, this bill does something else that is especially \n     important to me and to Hillary--and I'm glad she's here with \n     us today. It breaks down the financial and bureaucratic \n     barriers to adoption, giving more children what every child \n     needs and deserves--loving parents and a strong, stable home. \n     (Applause.)\n       Two weeks ago, we had a celebration for the American \n     athletes who made us so proud in Atlanta at the Centennial \n     Olympics. Millions of Americans now know that one of them--\n     the Decathlon Gold medalist, Dan O'Brien--speaks movingly \n     about having been an adopted child and how much the support \n     of his family meant in his life. Right now, there are tens of \n     thousands of children waiting for the kind of family that \n     helped to make Dan O'Brien an Olympic champion. At the same \n     time, there are thousands of middle class families that want \n     to bring children into their homes but cannot afford it. \n     We're offering a $5,000 tax credit to help bring them \n     together. It gives even more help to families that will adopt \n     children with disabilities or take in two siblings, rather \n     than seeing them split up.\n       And, lastly, this bill ends the long-standing bias against \n     interracial adoption which has too often meant an endless, \n     needless wait for America's children. (Applause.)\n       You know, as much as we talk about strong, loving families, \n     it's not every day that we here in Washington get to enact a \n     law that literally creates them or helps them stay together. \n     This is such a day. Although he can't be with us today, I \n     also want to thank Dave Thomas, himself adopted, who went on \n     to found Wendy's and do so much for our country. Perhaps more \n     than any other American citizen, he has made these adoption \n     provisions possible, and we thank him.\n       Lastly, I'd like to point out that we do have some \n     significant number of adoptive families here with us today, \n     including some who are on the stage. And so I'd just like to \n     acknowledge the Weeks (ph.) family, the Wolfington (ph.) \n     family, the Outlaw (ph.) family, the Fitzwater (ph.) family, \n     and ask them and anyone else here from the adoptive family \n     community to stand up who'd like to stand. We'd like to \n     recognize you and thank you for being here. Thank you all for \n     being here. Thank you. (Applause.)\n       Beside me, or in front of me now, is the desk used by \n     Frances Perkins--Franklin Roosevelt's labor secretary and the \n     very first woman ever to serve in the Cabinet. She was one of \n     our greatest labor secretaries. It was from her desk that \n     many of America's pioneering wage, hour and workplace laws \n     originated--including the very first 25 cent an hour minimum \n     wage signed into law by President Roosevelt in 1938.\n       Secretary Perkins understood that a living wage was about \n     more than feeding a family or shelter from a storm. A living \n     wage makes it possible to participate in what she called the \n     culture of community--to take part in the family, the \n     community, the religious life we all cherish. Confident in \n     our ability to\n\n[[Page S886]]\n\n     provide for ourselves and for our children, secure in the \n     knowledge that hard work does pay. A minimum wage increase, \n     portable health care, pension security, welfare to work \n     opportunities--that's a plan that's putting America on the \n     right track.\n       Now, we have to press forward, giving tax cuts for \n     education and child-rearing and child care, buying a first \n     home, finishing that job of balancing the budget without \n     violating our obligations to our parents and our children and \n     the disabled and health care, to education and the \n     environment and to our future. That's a plan that will keep \n     America on the right track, building strong families and \n     strong futures by working together.\n       For everyone here who played a role in this happy day, I \n     thank you, America thanks you, and our country is better \n     because of your endeavors. God bless you. Thank you. \n     (Applause.)\n       (The bill is signed.) (Applause.)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. President Clinton said in the signing ceremony:\n\n       I want to thank all the Members of Congress who are here, \n     especially Senator Kennedy who, himself, probably broke the \n     wage in hour laws by working so hard to pass this bill.\n\n  And then in another place:\n\n       There are a lot of people who worked hard on this bill who \n     aren't here--Senator Daschle, Congressman Gephardt--\n\n  He went on to name other Members--\n\n     led by truly tireless John Sweeney.\n\n  And there was applause. Now, some of the same people are objecting to \nwhat we are doing now.\n  Another quote:\n\n       I would also like a very special word of thanks to the \n     business owners, especially the small business owners who \n     supported this bill. Many of the minimum wage employers I \n     talked to wanted to pay their employees more than $4.25 an \n     hour and would be happy to do so as long as they can do it \n     without hurting their businesses, and that means their \n     competitors have to do the same thing. This bill will allow \n     them to compete and win, to have happier, more productive \n     employees, and to know they are doing the right thing. For \n     all those small businesses, I am very, very appreciative.\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       I would also say that this bill does a remarkable number of \n     things for small businesses. . . .[a]nd we know that most of \n     the new jobs in America are being created by small- and \n     medium-sized businesses. In 1993 I--\n\n  Meaning President Clinton--\n\n     proposed a $15,000 increase in the amount of capital a small \n     business can expense, to spark the kind of investment that \n     they need to create jobs.\n       As the Vice President said--\n\n  Meaning at that time Mr. Gore--\n\n     this bill also includes a Work Opportunity Tax Credit to \n     provide jobs for the most economically disadvantaged working \n     Americans, including people who want to move from welfare to \n     work. Now, there will be a tightly drawn economic incentive \n     for people to hire those folks and give them a chance to \n     enter the workforce, as well.\n\n  Well, if Senators who were on the stage at that time thought that the \nwork opportunity tax credit was a good thing to have, why isn't it a \ngood thing to have it here, to extend it? Why not?\n  This is a win-win situation. There is a win for the workers, a win \nfor small business. Why should we chortle over a little thing such as \nincreasing the minimum wage or having a tax provision in it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:45 \ntoday the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to Snowe amendment \nNo. 103, as modified, with time from 2:15 to 2:45 equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form, with no second-degree amendments in order \nprior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Appointment of Committee to Escort the President of the United States\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that the Presiding Officer of \nthe Senate be authorized to appoint a committee on the part of the \nSenate to join with a like committee on the part of the House to escort \nthe President of the United States into the House Chamber for the joint \nsession to be held at 9 p.m. Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from Hawaii \nwishes to address the Senate on morning business time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Akaka and Mr. Kennedy are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are going to go into a recess in a \nmoment. We will come out of the party caucuses at 2:15. We are working \non some additional amendments. The amendments of the Senator from \nAlabama, the Sessions amendments, we will try to include, if necessary, \nvotes on those issues as well around the 2:45 hour. We are making some \nprogress. We have a shorter evening tonight because of the President's \nState of the Union, but we want to move this legislation. It is not \ncomplicated. Everyone in this body, new Members who have arrived here, \nunderstands what the increase in the minimum wage is all about. It is \nnot complex. Is it not difficult. It is not hard to understand. There \nis no reason we can't move this process quickly. If it is necessary to \nhave votes, we are prepared to move along on those issues.\n  We have listened this morning to those who believe that raw economic \narguments ought to control the question of the minimum wage. We as a \ncountry have moved away from that. We have accepted the great \ntraditions of Judeo-Christian teachings as well as the underlying \nteachings of all the religions that talk about responsibilities we all \nhave for the least among us. In the Constitution of the United States, \nthey have what is called the general welfare clause. The general \nwelfare clause was written into the Constitution for those very \npurposes.\n  The fact is, this country has rejected the law of the jungle as it \napplies to economic conditions for workers. In my State of \nMassachusetts, we had individuals at the turn of the last century, \nchildren, 10, 11, 12 years old, who were working 12, 15 hours a day, \n6\\1/2\\ days a week. We had the exploitation of children, of women, the \nexploitation of workers. We, as a country and a society, have \nrecognized that we can be the strongest economy in the world and treat \npeople with respect and dignity. That is why the members of Let Justice \nRoll, an extraordinary number of religious leaders representing a wide \ngroup of churches, talk about what the Scriptures say about poverty in \ntheir letter.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  January 5, 2007.\n       Dear Members of Congress, We, the undersigned religious \n     leaders, in partnership with the Let Justice Roll Living Wage \n     Campaign, call on the 110th Congress to raise the minimum \n     wage! Let Justice Roll is a nonpartisan coalition of more \n     than 80 faith, community and labor organizations working to \n     raise the minimum wage at the state and federal level. In \n     2006, we played a major role in increasing the minimum wage \n     throughout the country at the state level.\n       We strongly support the Miller/Kennedy bill that increases \n     the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour. Furthermore, we \n     strongly oppose any attempts to add provisions to the bill. \n     We urge you to vote for this clean minimum wage bill.\n       The Prophet Amos proclaims, ``Let justice roll down like \n     waters, and righteousness like an everflowing stream'' (5:24, \n     NRSV). We are morally outraged by the number of people living \n     in poverty in the United States, and believe that now is the \n     time to give hard-working low-wage workers a raise and take \n     the first step toward a true living wage for America's \n     workers.\n       It has been nearly 10 years since the last federal increase \n     in the minimum wage, and low-wage workers urgently need a \n     raise. A minimum wage employee--making $5.15 an hour, working \n     40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earns about $10,700 a \n     year--about $6,000 below the federal poverty line for a \n     family of three. This situation is unconscionable and \n     immoral, as the wealth of our nation continues to be built on \n     the backs of the working poor. Working poor families in \n     America are struggling to meet the rising costs of health \n     care, gasoline and housing, and $5.15 an hour is simply not \n     enough.\n       Minimum wage legislation in the past has stalled in \n     Congress because of attempts to attach unrelated provisions \n     such as tying the minimum wage to a repeal of the estate tax, \n     rolling back over-time protections or reducing the minimum \n     wage of tip workers. In addition, such provisions are harmful \n     to the very workers that a minimum wage increase is intended \n     to help. The strong victory on all the minimum wage ballot \n     initiatives is evidence that there is strong and widespread \n     support from Americans for a prompt, clean minimum wage \n     increase at the federal level.\n       We appreciate the commitment made by the leadership of the \n     110th Congress to address the woefully inadequate federal \n     minimum wage. We will continue to raise our\n\n[[Page S887]]\n\n     voices on behalf of ``the least of these'' and proclaim that \n     a job should keep you out of poverty, not keep you in it.\n       Signed, Rev.

Long \n     overdue, this bill provides a first step towards a dignified \n     life for low-wage workers in poverty. I urge you to support a \n     ``clean'' bill to raise the federal minimum wage--one that \n     does not attempt to add provisions of any kind and instead \n     allows it to pass as a stand-alone issue.\n       Catholic Social Teaching reminds us that all persons are \n     created by God, which is the basis for their dignity. In \n     justice and to live with dignity, each human person working \n     full time should be compensated enough to support him/herself \n     and a family. It has been almost ten years since Congress \n     voted to increase the minimum wage. Currently, a minimum wage \n     employee who works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks in a year makes \n     $10,700 for that year. For a single parent with two children, \n     that amount is thousands of dollars below the poverty line. \n     This is unconscionable. Workers who provide security, clean \n     hotels, wash dishes and haul supplies should not have to rely \n     on charity or government assistance to get by. The proposed \n     minimum wage increase to $7.25 an hour (from $5.15/hr.) would \n     give an additional $4,368 per year to a full-time worker \n     making minimum wage. This would bring them a step closer to \n     obtaining a livable wage which would provide for a family's \n     basic needs: food, shelter, health care, clothing, education \n     and recreation.\n       The minimum wage should be increased without any extra \n     provisions or tax breaks in order avoid establishing such a \n     precedent. Since the last minimum wage increase, congress has \n     passed no fewer than five tax relief packages which have \n     provided small businesses with up to $36 billion in tax \n     breaks. While congress has had no problem providing tax \n     breaks for small businesses without considering raising the \n     minimum wage, it seems impossible for some that the minimum \n     wage be raised without a tax break for small businesses. \n     Given the urgency of the minimum wage increase it is best to \n     avoid linking it to other issues and pass it as a stand-alone \n     ``clean'' bill.\n       The American people have spoken out on the urgency of this \n     bill. With strong victories in all six minimum wage ballot \n     initiatives this election, voters have shown concern for \n     hardworking people in poverty. People who work full-time \n     should earn enough to support themselves and their families. \n     Consequently, I call on you to act justly, and challenge your \n     other members to do the same. I urge you to quickly pass the \n     minimum wage bill with no extra add-on provisions as it comes \n     up this January.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. They mention Matthew's great teachings. The questioner \nsays: When did I fail to treat you well? And the Lord says: When you \nfailed to treat the least of these among us.\n  We are talking about a minimum wage, not an optimum wage. As the \ncharts show, it has declined dramatically over a period of years, now \nat $5.15, far away from what it was in the 1960s and 1970s, right \nthrough the 1980s. We believe that in this country, with the strongest \neconomy in the world, people who work hard 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of \nthe year, should not have to live in poverty. An increase in the \nminimum wage is long overdue. Hopefully, we will have an opportunity in \nthis body to express our views on this in the near future.\n  If there are no further speakers, I suggest that we recess, according \nto the leadership's earlier request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/23/senate-section/article/S888-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there are now 30 \nminutes equally divided on amendment No. 103, as modified. Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Snowe, Senator Landrieu, and others, to provide \nregulatory assistance to our Nation's small businesses.\n  This amendment requires that when Federal agencies issue new rules \nand regulations that impact small business, they also must issue \ncompliance guides for small businesses. The amendment also requires \nthat the compliance guides be written in plain English and made \navailable in a timely manner.\n  I think this is a commonsense requirement. It not only reduces the \nadministrative costs for small business, but it also increases the \nlevel of compliance with such new rules and regulations. I think the \nwork opportunity tax credit is an example. That isn't a program that a \nlot of small businesses have taken advantage of. Part of it is because \nthey don't know about it, and part is they don't know how to comply \nwith it. They don't have the opportunity to hire the specialists that \nmight be needed to understand it or to do the recordkeeping on it. So \nthey don't take advantage of it to the level they could. It is a \nprovision in the tax bill that could make quite a difference to small \nemployers.\n  Many small employers simply lack the resources, the outside \nconsultants, the experts necessary to continually advise them of \nchanges in Federal rules that impact the way they must run their \nbusiness. As it now stands, smaller businesses currently pay \ndisproportionate per employee compliance costs when compared to larger \nemployers. The average per employee cost for Federal regulatory \ncompliance in a business with less than 20 employees is 45 percent \nhigher than the same cost for a business with 500 or more employees. So \nit is about $7,600 for a small business to comply versus $5,200 for a \nbig business to comply. Those numbers stagger me--the cost for small \nbusiness to comply with Federal rules and regulations. That doesn't \ncount the cost of complying with the Tax Code, which is a whole other \nrange of costs.\n  Cost mandates, such as a minimum wage increase, impose significant \nfinancial burdens on our small employers. We must do everything we can \nto help alleviate this burden and ensure that small businesses remain \nthe well-run engine of our economy, and providing the kind of \ncompliance assistance called for in Senator Snowe's amendment is one of \nthe ways we can assist small businesses in meeting the administrative \ncosts associated with Federal regulation.\n  I commend Senator Snowe for her efforts on behalf of small businesses \nand am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation with her. She has \nput in diligent efforts to hold hearings and get this into place in the \ncommittee that she chaired, the Small Business Committee, on which she \nis now the ranking member.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that not only provides \nassistance that reduces employer costs but also assistance that \nincreases employer compliance. That is two goals. This amendment will \ndo both of those. I ask for your support.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided between the sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we still anticipate a vote at 2:45 p.m. \nAs I mentioned, we are going to urge the Senate to accept the amendment \noffered by Senator Snowe. I think it is an important contribution to \nsmall businesses and their understanding of the kinds of rules and \nregulations that have been out there and do it in ways that are \nunderstandable and in a timely way and to ensure that the relevant \ncommittee is going to find out how that is being implemented. We are \ncertainly in strong support of that concept and idea. I commend those \nwho have been involved in it.\n\n[[Page S889]]\n\n  We are going to vote at 2:45. We have amendments that are related to \nthe Finance Committee. I talked with Senator Baucus during the noon \nhour. His staff is working on some that have been offered by Senator \nSessions, and we are in the process of trying to work with the Senator \nto see what progress can be made, and the Finance Committee staff, as \nwell as Senator Baucus, is attentive to those issues.\n  Senator Roberts has an amendment dealing with childcare and small \nbusiness. It was a subject matter he talked about during our hearing in \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. He will come over \nto the floor now and address the Senate about that issue. We have been \ntrying to work with him. We think most of us have been strong \nsupporters in terms of childcare. Senator Dodd has been a real leader \nwith Senator Hatch in the past with the block grant childcare program.\n  We have a childcare program that is also tied in with the Social \nSecurity program, and we have a very effective childcare program in the \nmilitary which receives awards. It is very close, actually, to the bill \nthat was initially introduced by Senator Dodd a number of years ago.\n  We will have a chance to consider those amendments in a short period \nof time. I will take a few minutes now to review for the Senate what \nwill be the first vote tomorrow, and that will be on what we call the \nline-item veto amendment.\n  We had an excellent debate and discussion on that amendment \nyesterday. I refer any of those interested to read the Record, the \nexcellent comments that were made on this issue by the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, and also the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Conrad, enormously, I think, comprehensive \ncomments on it. I urge they read the comments of Senator Gregg as well, \nwho is the proponent of the amendment.\n  Senator Conrad and Senator Byrd made excellent presentations. We will \nbe considering that early tomorrow. I hope those who are interested in \nthe amendment will take a few moments and look back at the Record. It \nis a very complete record on that issue. I stand with Senator Conrad \nand Senator Byrd, for the reasons they have outlined, in opposition to \nthe Gregg amendment.\n  Next we will have a chance to vote on what we call a clean increase \nin the minimum wage. That means a vote on the increase in the minimum \nwage over a 2-year period to rise from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour.\n  I strongly urge our colleagues to vote for what we call a clean bill \non the minimum wage. I do so for a number of reasons.\n  First, this is the area of need. It is among workers who haven't \ngotten a raise in the last 10 years. For 10 years, the longest time \nsince we had a minimum wage increase, they have lost effectively 20 \npercent of their purchasing power, and they are working in tough and \ndifficult jobs. These are men and women of great pride and dignity. \nThey do hard, difficult, trying work, and they do it to the best of \ntheir ability. They deserve to have a raise.\n  I don't think any of us in this country thought the minimum wage \nwould be a permanent wage for millions of Americans, and yet, \nnonetheless, if one looks at the figures, effectively 40 percent of \nthose earning the minimum wage were earning the minimum wage 4 years \nago. That they have been able to make ends meet over this amount of \ntime is extraordinary, particularly when they have members of their \nfamily to look after.\n  This country has said if one works hard 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of \nthe year, one shouldn't have to live in poverty in the richest nation \nin the world. That is an issue of fairness. It is a moral issue.\n  As we demonstrated earlier, the Members of the great face of this \ncountry have all spoken about the morality of this issue. It is part of \nour Constitution that talks about the general welfare, how are we going \nto treat each other. It is as old as the Mayflower Compact. In my State \nof Massachusetts, before landing, the Pilgrims gathered together near \nProvincetown. Most people think they landed at Plymouth Rock, but they \nlanded at Provincetown, MA. Before they landed--they had been at sea \nfor close to 100 days, and many had died and many suffered from \ndisease--they got together and talked about their Compact, their \nwillingness to work together for a common purpose and common respect \nfor their fellow human beings. That was going to be the essence of \ntheir whole life experiment in the United States.\n  It is reflected in the actions that have been taken in this body with \nthe minimum wage. On only one occasion in the last nine occasions when \nwe raised the minimum wage have we added a tax provision.\n  Again, the minimum wage has lost 20 percent of all of its purchasing \npower. It was a good deal higher in the sixties, seventies, and \neighties. It has dropped and dropped significantly over time and has \nlost that purchasing power.\n  Secondly, only once in 1996 did we pair a minimum wage increase with \ntax cuts. Previous increases had strong bipartisan support, despite the \nlack of tax cuts. In 1989, the minimum wage was raised with no tax cuts \nand passed by a margin of 89 to 8. In 1977, with no giveaways, an \nincrease passed 63 to 24. We have seen what has happened. Only one \ntime--it didn't happen in 1938, 1949, 1955, 1961, 1966, 1974, 1977, \n1989--only in 1996. And look in the last 10 years what has happened in \nterms of the reduction of taxes for corporations and for small \nbusinesses. In corporations, it is $276 billion in tax breaks; small \nbusinesses, $36 billion; and no raise for minimum wage workers.\n  We didn't hesitate. We were around here to provide tax benefits to \nsmall businesses and large corporations. Where were the voices to say \nlet's give the minimum wage workers a little boost?\n  Now, all of a sudden, we are trying to get minimum wage workers a \nlittle boost, and everybody is running around to get an increase in tax \nprovisions. Fair is fair, Mr. President; fair is fair.\n  We have seen what has happened in productivity. Over the last 10 \nyears--here are the statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics--\nprofits are up 45 percent, productivity is up 29 percent, and the \nminimum wage is down 20 percent. These minimum wage workers haven't \neven had the opportunity to get an increase in their salaries in spite \nof the fact that we have seen a real increase in productivity. \nHistorically, when we saw an increase in productivity, that was \nreflected in an increase in the minimum wage. That was all true in the \n1960s, 1970s, up to the 1980s. As productivity increased, so did the \nminimum wage increase over a considerable period of time, but not in \nthe last few years.\n  As I have pointed out, a recent Gallup Poll found that 86 percent of \nsmall business owners do not think the minimum wage affects their \nbusinesses. Three out of four small businesses said an increase in the \nminimum wage would have no effect on their company. Many small \nbusinesses are already paying higher wages to recruit and retain \nquality workers. A higher minimum wage actually benefits them because \nit levels the playing field and allows them to compete with the bigger \nbusiness.\n  What we have found over time, when we provide a decent wage to \nworkers--and this is demonstrated; I mentioned it here, I spelled it \nout in some greater degree on yesterday--what we find is we get workers \nwho are loyal to the business. We find there is less of a turnover when \nthere was an increase in the minimum wage to a living wage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Our time has expired. That is interesting. Have we \nreserved the last 5 minutes for debate on the Snowe amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was not the unanimous consent agreement. \nThere is 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair.\n  I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Massachusetts and the \ndiligence with which he has worked on this issue and the number of \ntimes we have debated it. I appreciate the majority leader making it \npossible for us to consider amendments on this bill. I understand how \nsome people would like\n\n[[Page S890]]\n\nto have this as a clean amendment, that we just do the increase. The \ndebate the last three times we have done it has been about whether we \ncan have some provisions for small businesses to offset the impact of \nthe raise in the minimum wage.\n  I want to bring a more personal face to this small business. We \nconfuse that sometimes even with General Motors and some of the \nairlines. Those are big corporations. In fact, the ones I am \nparticularly concerned about are the ones with 50 employees or less, \nand even more concerned about the ones that only have 2 or 3 employees. \nThe impact and their ability to adjust is much more limited. We are \ntalking about the inventors in their garages who have an idea and who \nwill employ another person to help put their product together and \nmarket it. We are talking about the corner grocery store. We are \ntalking about the laundry. We are talking about the little shoe store, \nthe independent one.\n  These are families that are eking out a living. These are not \nfamilies that are getting rich. These are families that took on a lot \nof risk for the American dream. They are hoping that with all of the \nloans they put in place to be able to do this business that they always \ndreamed of doing, they might make a return on their investment and \nenough to keep their family going. But there is no guarantee.\n  These are the people who--and I know; I used to be a small \nbusinessman. I used to own shoe stores. One of my definitions of a \nsmall businessman is the guy who wakes up, sits up straight in bed in \nthe middle of the night and says: Tomorrow is payday; how do I meet \npayroll? And they figure out a way because the employees get paid \nfirst.\n  These are people worrying about how to stay in business, how to make \na living, and taking on a whole lot of risk to make sure other people \nhave jobs.\n  We have to remember that the small businessman will be forced to come \nup with additional funds to pay his or her workers on what we are \nmandating today. Those funds don't come from a money tree or some pot \nof gold at the end of the rainbow. They come out of the pockets of the \nNation's small businessmen. It is the penalty they pay for taking the \nrisk associated with running a small business.\n  I have about 3 minutes. I yield the remainder of the time to the \nSenator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \nleadership on this amendment that is so important to the small business \nsector of our economy. I also thank Chairman Kennedy as well for \nbringing this legislation to the floor.\n  I rise today in support of the pending modified amendment we will be \nvoting on shortly that has been offered by the Senator from Wyoming, \nMr. Enzi, the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, as well by the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, to enhance compliance \nassistance for small businesses. I truly appreciate all those joining \nme in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Kerry, Bond, Sununu, and \nRoberts as cosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to say to Members of the Senate, \nthis amendment would significantly help to reduce the regulatory burden \nimposed on small businesses throughout this country. The amendment is \ndesigned to clarify an existing Federal law that the Senate unanimously \npassed back in 1996. The Government Accountability Office has suggested \nthat we needed to have further clarification to the existing law \nbecause many Federal agencies are circumventing the law. These agencies \nare using loopholes to ignore requirements under the law that the \nagencies publish small business compliance guides so that small \nbusinesses know how to comply with complex Federal regulations. The \nagencies have used ambiguity in the law as a rationale for not \nassisting small businesses.\n  This amendment would clarify existing Federal rules and regulations, \nby requiring that Federal agencies produce compliance assistance \nmaterials to help small businesses satisfy their regulatory \nobligations. Because the GAO has found widespread and pervasive \ndisregard of this law by agencies, we felt it was very important to \nclarify the law so that small business not only gets the assistance it \nrequires but also can meet the regulatory requirements promulgated by \nthe Federal government. As we well know, small businesses face a \ndisproportionate burden of the impact of regulations in rules issued by \nFederal agencies. In fact, employers with 20 or fewer employees face \n44.8 percent more of a regulatory burden than companies with 500 or \nmore employees, in terms of compliance costs per employee.\n\n  So you can see that for our Nation's small businesses, we clearly \nneed to do better so they can continue to drive our economy, by \ncreating three-quarters of all the net new jobs each year. This \namendment will go a long way toward easing the impact of the cost of \nsmall business regulatory compliance and making sure the agencies \ncomply with requirements under existing law to provide the support \nsmall businesses rightly deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill).

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the Senator from Kansas has an \namendment. He has brought it up during the course of meetings of our \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and he has been \nadvocating for it for some period of time. He wishes to address the \nSenate at this time, if we could have order so that the Senator could \nbe heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 102\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise today to offer amendment No. \n102.\n  As we debate the issue of minimum wage, we can't forget the impact on \nthe employers who hire these minimum wage workers. Small businesses pay \n45 percent of the payroll in the United States, and they have created \n60 to 80 percent of new jobs over the last decade. In my home State of \nKansas, small businesses actually employ the brunt of hard-working \nfamilies. I often hear from these employers who agree with their \nworkers that they deserve a fair wage for a fair day's work, but they\n\n[[Page S891]]\n\nadmit, however, that they struggle to offer the basic benefits to their \nemployees such as childcare. With a mandated increase in the minimum \nwage, that struggle will only grow. So affordable childcare oftentimes \nbecomes a factor in keeping a job for many Americans in small \ncommunities such as Dodge City, my hometown, and other very similar \ncommunities. Childcare facilities are very scarce, limiting the \npossibilities for families to earn----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, maybe we \ncould have order. We are making good progress on this legislation. This \nis an important amendment. The Senator has spent a good deal of time, \nand we welcome the opportunity to hear him on it. We would ask our \ncolleagues and friends if they would be good enough to take their \nconversations to another part of the Senate so we can hear the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators, please remove your conversations out \nof the well.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and I thank the \nPresiding Officer and I thank my colleagues to my right who, hopefully, \nwill take their conversation from the floor of the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, small businesses generally do not have the resources \nrequired to start up and support a childcare center like happens in \nmany areas in urban America and big cities.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1997, one of the first bills I \nintroduced was the Small Business Child Care Act, which authorized a \nshort-term flexible grant as a program to encourage small businesses to \nwork together or with other local childcare agencies to provide \nchildcare services for their employees. This amendment includes the \nbipartisan language of the Small Business Child Care Act that was \npassed out of the HELP Committee in August of 2005 as part of the \nlarger childcare and development block grant.\n  Under the amendment, small businesses are eligible for grants up to \n$500,000 for startup costs and training and scholarships and other \nrelated activities, with priority given to grantees who work with other \nsmall businesses or local childcare organizations. These grants all \nhave a matching requirement which encourages self-sustaining facilities \nthat will go on well after the program ends.\n  In many small Kansas towns, childcare facilities can be very scarce, \nas I have said before. This amendment would alleviate the strain on \nworking families who often have to close the door on the opportunity to \nbe a double-income family because of the lack of childcare options in \ntheir communities.\n  When I first ran for the House back in 1980, I was going door to door \nin Dodge City. I was in south Dodge and I knocked on a door and a young \nlady came to the door and two children were immediately right there \nwith her. I handed her a brochure, and I said: I am running for \nCongress. What can I do for you? Is there anything I can do for you as \na candidate?\n  She looked at me with the two kids behind her--she was obviously a \nsingle mother--and she said: Mr. Roberts, it's your world, I'm just \nliving in it.\n  That made a big impression on me.\n  I said: What do you need more than anything else?\n  She said: If there could be a possibility that there could be any \nchildcare for these two children, I could go to work. I could go back \nto work.\n  But that was not the case at that particular time. Then I promised \nmyself that we would try our very best so that in a small community \nwith a bank, the implement dealer, and, say, a restaurant, they could \ncome together, and with these kinds of grants offer affordable \nchildcare.\n  So I am very hopeful we can get this amendment passed. It is a small \nchange that will make a big difference in the lives of many employees \nand employers who see a need for childcare in their communities. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise to thank the Senator from Kansas \nfor offering this amendment. Back about 20 years ago, the Senator from \nUtah and I, along with Senator Kennedy and others, authored the first \nchildcare development block grant ever to be proposed by the Congress. \nWe had hoped in those days that we would be able to expand the \navailability, affordability, and quality of childcare to millions of \nAmericans and their children who are lacking those resources.\n  Over the years, we have provided some good assistance. I am grateful \nto my colleagues over the years who have been supportive.\n  We have gone stale on the commitment over the last 5 or 6 years. The \nfunding has not gone up at all and demand continues to grow. We have \ndone a fairly good job in serving some of the working poor. We must do \nbetter, however. We have not done a good job, in my view, on the most \ncritical issue most parents and others care about, and that is the \nquality of childcare. This amendment gets to the quality of child care \nby providing small businesses the opportunity to use the grant for \nfacilities and to create partnerships with local organizations such as \nhealth departments.\n  What is happening with our colleague's amendment is that it is trying \nto expand opportunities for families, and I am grateful to him for \nproposing it. Everyday I hear about the communities in which the demand \nfor child care for exceeds the supply. This amendment would increase \nthe supply and allow more parents to go to work knowing that their \nchildren are safe.\n  I am supporting it. I think it is worthwhile, and it will help make a \ndifference of expanding quality and access.\n  It is good for everyone involved. A lot of times we offer legislation \nwith winners and losers. Here, everybody wins. From a business \nstandpoint, they are retaining good employees, allowing parents' minds \nto be focused on their jobs. In no small measure, this depends on how \nyou feel, where your children are, who is caring for them, and what the \nconditions are. In terms of productivity and retention, all the \nelements businesses desire for employees, childcare is a major \ncomponent. For the parents, obviously, not to be worried or concerned \nabout the quality of the care their children receive and whether they \ncan afford it is a major issue. I am preaching to the choir for those \nwho understand what I am talking about. Obviously, from the child's \nperspective, it's essential to be able to have that good, nurturing \nenvironment. There is not a guarantee they will get it in every case, \nbut it is more likely if this amendment passes.\n  The difficult area is with smaller businesses. Many larger \ncorporations have installed childcare facilities onsite. In fact, in \nsome cases they have offered less in salaries and wages in exchange for \nproviding better childcare; I am not saying that is great, but people \nare so hungry to have a good, safe, childcare environment, they will \nopt for lesser wage or salary in exchange for the assurance their \nchildren are in a safe place. Smaller businesses cannot do that. Some \nof them are at shopping malls, and they develop consortiums and set \naside space. There are a lot of creative ideas. But it is the hardest \nthing in the world for smaller business to provide child care. It is \nnot that they do not recognize the need for it. They understand the \nvalue of it. This amendment, from a child's perspective, from a \nparent's perspective, and from a business perspective is a win for all. \nI commend my colleague. We have talked of this in the past and agreed \non its importance. I thank Senator Enzi.\n  While I am here, I would like to talk about the underlying bill, to \nraise the minimum wage. Exactly because of what the Senator from Kansas \nhas offered, it is important to know that his amendment is a related \nmatter when it comes to children. The increase in the minimum wage has \na huge impact on children.\n  So I am taking advantage of a couple of minutes on his amendment to \nhighlight this point. In the last 5 years, we have watched child \npoverty in this country increase by 1.3 million children. This figure \nis from the U.S. Census Bureau, not a private think tank making this \nup. Nearly 12.9 million children in this country live in poverty.\n  Obviously, that is a matter of great concern, I hope to all of us. \nWhat is bothersome to me and should be to every single one of us--I \ndon't care what your politics are or your political persuasion--the \nfact that the United\n\n[[Page S892]]\n\nStates of America, at the outset of the 21st century, has one of the \nhighest rate of child poverty among all the industrialized nations. \nThat is something that ought to concern each and every one of us, not \njust because of what a shameful statistic that is. As we look to the \n21st century, watching our country grow, meeting the challenges in \nfront of us, we have to do a better job if we are going to have a well-\nprepared generation to meet the challenges.\n  Aside from providing decent child care, we know by increasing the \nearning capacity of parents we make a difference. In fact, nearly 6 \nmillion children will benefit from a minimum wage increase.\n  Children whose parents are economically secure--and this increase is \nnot going to guarantee security, but it moves a family closer to it--\nhave better attendance in school and have a higher concentration on the \nwork they are asked to do. Performance levels go up, test scores go up, \nand graduation rates increase when a family's economic circumstances \nare far more stable. In addition, children have stronger immune \nsystems, better health, fewer expensive hospital visits and fewer run-\nins with the juvenile justice system. Those are facts when you have a \nfamily doing better economically. For the families who have the \ngreatest economic stability at home, these statistics improve in almost \nevery category.\n  Because of what the Senator from Kansas has offered, focusing on \nchildcare, combined with what the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy, is leading today on the minimum wage, we can make a difference \nfor these children. That is the point I wanted to make to my \ncolleagues.\n  I commend them both. It is long overdue. My hope is that the \namendment from my friend from Kansas will be a forerunner this year for \nincreasing our commitments to child care. My colleague from Maine, \nSenator Snowe, has been terrific on this issue over the years. Senator \nHatch was my principal cosponsor on this many years ago. It was \ncourageous of him then. A lot of people did not realize the value of \nit. I am remiss not mentioning those who played a significant role. And \nlet me add my colleague, Senator Roberts, for his leadership on this \nissue. I thank him immensely. I thank Senator Kennedy for his \nleadership on minimum wage. We can make a difference for children with \nboth of these proposals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague for his \nexcellent presentation. He has been the leader of the children's caucus \nand a leader on this issue of childcare.\n  We have 14,000 family members now waiting, parents who are waiting \nfor childcare slots in my State of Massachusetts.\n  I have listened to the Senator give the statistics nationwide. This \nis all related to work. It is obviously related to lower income because \nthose at the lower income levels have less opportunity as far as \naffordability.\n  I can remember when the Senator first offered the childcare \nlegislation. I remember the debates we had about limiting the childcare \nlegislation. We debated for about 10 days or so while it was constantly \nadjusted, altered, and changed. Eventually, it passed. The childcare \nblock grant has done an enormous amount of good.\n  The Senator has been very much involved in the other childcare \nprograms that have come out through the CDBG and the other Social \nSecurity programs. There is a third childcare program, the one in the \nmilitary. If you read back in the history books, that particular \nprogram passed by over 90 votes. This, effectively, was the legislation \nthe Senator from Connecticut introduced. Today, when we have \ncomparisons about which childcare programs work the best, everyone \npoints to the military. The Senator from Connecticut can give the \nreasons for it.\n  The point is, this is a matter of enormous importance to working \nfamilies, with the whole change in the workforce, the increasing number \nof women in the workforce, the increasing number of women with \nchildren, the increasing demands upon those women, in particular, but \nnot exclusively.\n  We appreciate the fact that the Senator from Kansas would give focus \nand attention to this issue. We wish to work with the Senator. We can \ndo part of the job in terms of the authorization. We are going to rely \non him to help get limited resources to make sure we bring life to this \nprogram. I thank the Senator for his statements and comments.\n  We look forward to hearing from my friend and colleague from Wyoming, \nhopefully, urging acceptance of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I echo what the Senator from Massachusetts \nsaid, that this does provide for authorization. There is room for that \nto be included, and we can help look for the resources to do something \non that.\n  I commend both Senator Roberts and Senator Dodd for their \ntenaciousness and their active work to be able to bring this to the \nSenate at this point in time. I note that Senator Roberts has been \nworking on this for about 10 years. Six years is the average for a bill \naround here. That should qualify.\n  I ask we make this part of that package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Connecticut, \nI thank him very much for his comments. He has been absolutely \ntenacious, as described by the Senator from Wyoming.\n  I can remember, it was about, what, 5, 6, 7 years ago, that we all \nwere over, on a cold day, at the childcare center that is offered for \nemployees on Capitol Hill over by the Hart building. We had a press \nconference. Senator Kennedy was there, I was there, Senator Dodd was \nthere, I think Senator Jeffords was there at that time. That was 4 or 5 \nyears ago.\n  So we should be moving on these things. I pledge my support to see \nwhat we can do down the road.\n  I rise to call up Senate amendment 102.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 102.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The pending question is amendment 118 offered \nby Senator Kyl.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 106, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I call for the regular order with respect to Senate \namendment 106 and send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 106), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING PERSONAL SAVINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the personal saving rate in the United States is at its \n     lowest point since the Great Depression, with the rate having \n     fallen into negative territory;\n       (2) the United States ranks at the bottom of the Group of \n     Twenty (G-20) nations in terms of net national saving rate;\n       (3) approximately half of all the working people of the \n     United States work for an employer that does not offer any \n     kind of retirement plan;\n       (4) existing savings policies enacted by Congress provide \n     limited incentives to save for low- and moderate-income \n     families; and\n       (5) the Social Security program was enacted to serve as the \n     safest component of a retirement system that also includes \n     employer-sponsored retirement plans and personal savings.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Congress should enact policies that promote savings \n     vehicles for retirement that are simple, easily accessible \n     and provide adequate financial security for all the people of \n     the United States;\n       (2) it is important to begin retirement saving as early as \n     possible to take full advantage of the power of compound \n     interest; and\n       (3) regularly contributing money to a financially-sound \n     investment account is one\n\n[[Page S894]]\n\n     important method for helping to achieve one's retirement \n     goals.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, it is important as we think about low- \nand middle-income, middle-class workers in America today, to think \nabout how they are getting along and whether they are saving \nadequately. Savings is a part of any person's financial security. It \nmakes a difference between how a person thinks about his life, how he \nor she thinks about her job, and how they can live in the latter years. \nMost Americans today depend upon Social Security to finance their \nretirement as Social Security provides 73 percent of the retirement \nincome of the typical household. That is not enough money for the \naverage American to live on adequately. The truth is, they can have so \nmuch more so easily. I would like to talk about that today.\n  To live the comfortable life that Americans deserve after 40-plus \nyears of work, most need to supplement their Social Security income \nwith additional savings, either through an employer-sponsored plan or \ntheir own savings plan. Yet despite this need, most Americans are not \nputting aside money for their future.\n  Statistic after statistic tragically shows this. The personal savings \nrate in the United States, as this chart demonstrates, is at its lowest \nebb since the Great Depression. It is a matter of national importance, \nas the Chairman of the Reserve Board and others have discussed.\n  Look at this chart. It shows, since 1946, our savings rate has fallen \nsteadily; in 2006, it is below zero. We are spending our savings now \nmore than we are saving. It is a very troubling matter. We have to do \nsomething about it.\n  After having averaged better than 7 percent throughout most of the \npost-World War II period, the personal savings rate dipped into \nnegative territory by 2005 for the first time since 1933. This trend \ncontinued last year as the personal savings rate remained in negative \nterritory for the first three quarters of 2006, with the fourth quarter \nnumbers not yet reported.\n  These statistics indicate that the average American household has \nbeen spending more during the last 2 years by either drawing down past \nsavings or selling assets or borrowing.\n  An alarming number of Americans also lack any financial resources \nbeyond personal income. According to a Federal Reserve 2004 survey of \nconsumer finances, 17 percent of all households have zero or a negative \nnet worth, while 30 percent have a net worth of less than $10,000. This \nis especially a problem for African-American households, as they are \nmore than twice as likely to have zero or a negative net worth.\n  Perhaps most troubling, as this next chart demonstrates, almost half \nof the 152 million Americans who worked in 2004, 71.5 million \nemployees, worked for an employer that did not sponsor a retirement \nplan of any kind. Another 17 million did not participate in the plan \ntheir employer offered. That means over 58 percent of working Americans \nin 2004 were not participating in an employer-sponsored retirement \nplan.\n  Higher income people take care of their plans, but the average \nworking American tends to focus his savings through his business and \nemployer. In particular, younger workers are much less likely to \nparticipate in their employer's 401(k) plan, as only about one-third of \nworkers age 21 to 30 participate in any retirement plan at work. Even \nif a worker is participating in an employer-sponsored retirement plan, \nhe or she is unlikely to be saving sufficiently for the future.\n  The average American worker holds nine jobs by the time they are 35, \nmeaning that he or she often leaves the job before their retirement \nbenefits become vested. In fact, frequently they cash it out. I had the \nopportunity to be on an airplane recently with a young man, 37, with \ntwo kids. He is beginning to work for the Federal Government. He is \ngoing to be saving through the thrift plan. I asked him what he had \ndone before about savings. I told him the average person had nine jobs. \nHe said: I had nine jobs. And when asked about savings, he said: I \ncashed in my plans. I just had a few hundred dollars in this one and a \nfew hundred in that one. It didn't make sense to hold on to them. I \ncashed them in and paid my penalties. So at 35 with two kids, he has \nmissed those first 10 or 15 or 20 years of work that he could have been \nsaving and having the power of compound interest at work. About 45 \npercent of the participants in employer-sponsored retirement plans \ncashed out when they changed jobs in 2004. A lot of plans don't offer \nsavings until you have worked with the company 6 months or a year; \nsome, 2 years.\n  As this next chart shows, if we considered business and Government \nsavings, we find that the United States has the lowest national savings \nrate of any of the group of 20 industrial nations. Whereas Japan's \nsavings rate was 10.8 percent in 2003, Germany's was 5.4 percent, and \nIndia's was 15.4 percent, the United States had a net national savings \nrate of 1.6 percent in 2003. This is a World Bank chart. We can see we \nhave the lowest rate on the chart. That is significant, not only for \nindividuals, most importantly for individual working Americans, but \nalso for our economy because economists tell us that this is a major \ndetriment to our economy. In fact, all but two of the nations listed on \nthe chart I just showed have a net national savings rate of more than \ntwice that of the United States, if not more than 10 times our savings \nrate.\n  The lack of personal savings is a particular problem in my State of \nAlabama. An A.G. Edwards study rated Alabama the Nation's 46th lowest \nsavings State. This lack of personal savings is a national tragedy, as \nfew Americans are putting money aside to ensure their financial \nsecurity upon retirement, during a time where we have growth and \nrelative prosperity in our Nation. I will repeat that. Think about the \ntragedy that is occurring when people are not setting aside even a \nsmall percentage of their salary, when if they do, they could retire \nwith hundreds of thousands of dollars in a savings account at age 65. \nThis is very realistic. It is very possible. I will talk about it a \nlittle bit more in a minute. But as anybody knows who has studied the \ncompound interest factor, the earlier you save, the more important it \nis. So it is a special tragedy when we see this lack of savings. For \nexample, according to an analysis by Fidelity Investments, if one is 25 \nyears old and has 40 years until retirement, every additional dollar a \nperson saves would be worth $8.14 at retirement, adjusted for \ninflation. So a dollar saved, if you are 25, is worth $8.14 at \nretirement.\n  Increasing savings also allows Americans to achieve greater control \nand choice over their lives. According to the Center for Social \nDevelopment, the presence of savings is even associated with improved \nhealth and psychological well-being.\n  The benefits of increasing our Nation's personal savings rate go \nbeyond the financial security of individual families. By increasing \nhousehold savings, we will be providing the investment capital our \nNation needs to ensure long-term economic growth and create more and \nbetter jobs. Increasing savings will allow the United States to depend \nless on foreign capital. America's current account deficit, the amount \nof domestic investment financed by borrowing from abroad, hit a record \nhigh of over 6 percent of GDP in 2005. Foreign capital can sustain our \neconomy in the short run, but I don't know if we can depend on that in \nthe long run. Moreover, we, as a country, benefit from the interest and \ndividends our assets generate when we own them.\n  So what can we do to increase personal savings for retirement? I will \nsoon be introducing a bill to help solve our savings problem by \ncreating a national savings system that would give every American the \nopportunity to retire a half-millionaire. Not a chicken in every pot, \nnot a car in every garage, we desire that every American be able to \nretire with half a million dollars in the bank. That is possible, \nrealistic, so easily within our grasp if we set forth the right plans \ntoday.\n  Under the plan I will be introducing, individual savings accounts, or \nPLUS Accounts--for Portable, Lifelong, Universal Savings accounts--\nwould be created for every working American. One percent of every \npaycheck earned would be deposited automatically, pretax, into \nindividual PLUS Accounts, along with a 1-percent match from every \nemployer, and invested in a new system like our Federal thrift system, \na new 401(k)-type system. Under this plan, a savings account would be \nestablished for every American at birth, endowing these accounts with \n$1,000.\n\n[[Page S895]]\n\n  This is a proposal which the British are already doing. The UK has a \nplan similar to this plan. They are very excited about how well it is \nworking. Savings among families in Britain has gone up 40 percent since \nthey started this plan. It has educated people to the power of savings \nand compound interest.\n  Senators, such as Mr. Schumer, Mr. Santorum, and others, have \npreviously offered legislation of this kind.\n  So these funds contributed to PLUS Accounts would be the legal \nproperty of each account holder, but they could not be spent until age \n65. Any funds remaining when an individual died would be passed on as \nthey chose to their spouse, children, grandchildren, or any one of the \nholder's choosing, including a favorite charity. Account assets would \nbe protected from creditors and would not be considered in determining \neligibility for any federally funded benefits or in calculating estate \ntax liability.\n  Finally, my plan would simply serve as a supplement to Social \nSecurity, not altering the Social Security system in any way. I \nsupported the President's idea of changes in Social Security. I thought \nit made sense. We did not have the votes to do that in this Congress. \nSo I say, let's do it on top of Social Security.\n\n  I believe this can work. If we begin PLUS Accounts at birth and \nrequire a portion of every paycheck to be invested, the first check you \nget, the first job you go to work at, the average American citizen \ncould retire with a rather sizable nest egg. For example, given a \nreasonable rate of return, someone who makes $46,000 a year--the median \nhousehold income in 2005--and only contributes 1 percent of each \npaycheck would retire with almost $300,000 in the bank. Think about \nthat. You put in 1 percent, your employer puts in 1 percent. You have a \n$1,000 deposit at birth. With no more money put in there other than \nwhat you pay out, you would retire with $300,000 in your account. What \na remarkable and great country this is. At age 65, this account could \nbe converted to an annuity that would pay the recipient $2,100 per \nmonth for life, which is probably more than they will get from Social \nSecurity. If the same individual were to contribute 3 percent, if they \nwould just contribute 3 percent of their paycheck over the course of \ntheir working life, they could expect to retire with half a million \ndollars in their account--enough to purchase an annuity that pays over \n$3,700 per month for life, if they chose, or they could simply live off \nthe income of it and have assets for their children or the charity they \nchose. This is if the company, the employer, only puts in 1 percent. \nBut many employers today offer more than that.\n  I have to say, I was talking with Senator Corker from Tennessee, a \nsuccessful businessman, about this issue. He said: I believe in \nsavings. We have a savings plan in my company that our people all sign \nup for.\n  I said: Tell me about it.\n  He said: We put in 10 percent, if they will put in 5 percent.\n  Think about that. That is what Senator Corker does. A lot of \nbusinesses would do this. A lot of businesses would put in more. Many \nalready are, but many businesses would step up to the plate and put in \nmore than 1 percent. But if the employee put in 3 percent and the \nemployer put in 1, at age 65, it would be worth half a million dollars, \nif you are operating at median income. That is remarkable.\n  Thus, I would say that if we care about working Americans, if we \nreally want to do something historic, I believe we have an opportunity, \na bipartisan opportunity to establish a savings program for Americans. \nThat program should be modeled, in my view, although I am open to other \nsuggestions, on the Federal thrift plan that our employees admire so \nmuch and they value so much, you couldn't take it from them with a \ncrowbar. The Federal employees like it. They pay Social Security, and \nthey get a thrift plan where the Government puts in 5 percent if they \nput in 5 percent. And they can put in more than that. Many of these \nyoung people working today who work a career in the Government are \ngoing to retire with a very sizable nest egg, something they own, an \nasset they have earned themselves from their work, and they will be \nable to retire comfortably, whereas otherwise they may be dependent on \nSocial Security.\n  It is a national tragedy that we are not educating our children to \nsave. It is a national tragedy that our savings rate has fallen below \nzero. I believe we can do better. I am offering this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution to have the Senate think about it, to affirm its \ncommitment to increasing savings. As we go forward in the weeks to \ncome, we could be talking about the various proposals that are out \nthere to actually make this happen.\n  I see Senator Kennedy is off the floor. As I understand, we will set \nthe vote on this resolution for an appropriate time.\n  Hopefully, we will have strong support from my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this is an important amendment for many \nof our seniors because it deals with the taxes on Social Security \nbenefits. I have brought this issue before this Chamber before, so it \nshould be familiar to many of my colleagues.\n  When the Social Security program was created, benefits were not \ntaxed. However, in 1983, Congress changed the rules of the game by \npassing legislation to begin taxing up to 50 percent of a senior's \nSocial Security benefit if their income was over $25,000 for a single \nindividual or $32,000 for a couple.\n  Many seniors across the country were hit with a tax they never \nanticipated and were forced to send a portion of their Social Security \nbenefits back to the IRS.\n  In 1993, Congress felt taxing 50 percent of benefits wasn't good \nenough. That year, Congress passed and President Clinton signed a bill \nthat allows 85 percent of a senior's Social Security benefits to be \ntaxed if their income is above $34,000 for a single and $44,000 for a \ncouple. This was known as the ``Clinton senior citizens tax.''\n  The additional money this tax raises doesn't even go into helping \nSocial Security solvency; instead, it goes into a Medicare Part A \nprogram.\n  I was a Member of the House of Representatives in 1993, and I opposed \nthis tax then and I oppose this tax today, 14 years later.\n  Some people think this tax only affects ``rich'' seniors, but that is \nnot the case. In fact, the income thresholds both for the 50-percent \ntax and the 85-percent tax haven't changed since they were first \nenacted back in 1983 and 1993. This means more and more seniors are \npaying these taxes every year.\n  In fact, it is estimated that of the 40 million Social Security \nbeneficiaries, about 15 million--or 39 percent--of seniors pay taxes on \ntheir Social Security benefits. Of these, it is estimated that over 9.5 \nmillion pay taxes on up to 85 percent of their Social Security benefit.\n  On one hand, we tell seniors to plan and save for retirement and, on \nthe other hand, we tax them for doing that.\n  In the past, there have been efforts by Members of Congress, \nincluding myself, to remove this unfair tax. During debate on the \nSenate 2006 budget resolution, I offered an amendment that provided \nCongress with the budget resources to remove this unfair tax on \nbenefits. My amendment passed 55 to 45. Unfortunately, the tax \nreconciliation instructions were scaled back during conference.\n  Today, I am offering another amendment to finally repeal the 1993 tax \non Social Security benefits. This means the 85-percent tax tier would \nbe eliminated and the maximum amount of Social Security benefits that \ncould be taxed would be 50 percent. Millions of seniors would be able \nto keep more of their Social Security benefits, and Congress gets an \nopportunity to end this unfair tax on seniors.\n  It is also important to point out that the Medicare Program is not \nharmed by my amendment. As I already said, this tax funds the Medicare \nprogram. Therefore, my amendment transfers to Medicare any amount it \nwould have received due to this tax from the general fund.\n  This was an unfair tax on our seniors, and it is time we repeal it. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the Chair for the \ntime. We will look for a time later to bring up the amendment again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of the \nFair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. I commend Senator Kennedy for his \nleadership on this issue. This important legislation would increase the \nFederal minimum wage from the abysmally low $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an \nhour over a 2-year period.\n  Let us make no mistake about it, this bill will benefit millions of \nworkers and their families. It is very long overdue. Anyone who works \n40 hours a week in the United States of America should not be living in \nabject poverty. It is a moral disgrace that Congress has not increased \nthe minimum wage since 1997. Yes, Congress has provided hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in tax breaks to people who don't need it, but \nsomehow, over a 10-year period, Congress has not reached out to \nmillions of workers making the minimum wage and raised that wage.\n  Today's minimum wage workers have less buying power than minimum wage \nworkers did back in 1955, when Dwight Eisenhower was President. Simply \nput, a job should keep you out of poverty, not keep you in poverty.\n  At the current Federal minimum wage of $5.15 an hour, a person \nworking full time makes less than $11,000 per year before taxes, which \nis approximately $6,000 below the Federal poverty line for a family of \nthree.\n  Moreover, while the cost of living has skyrocketed, the value of the \nminimum wage has eroded by over 20 percent since the last increase. \nToday, nearly 13 million workers, 10 percent of the United States \nworkforce, would directly or indirectly benefit from a raise in the \nminimum wage to $7.25 an hour; 5.5 million workers would benefit \ndirectly, 7.4 million workers would benefit indirectly, and more than \n60 percent of those who would benefit are women.\n  In addition to workers, millions of American families would benefit \nfrom a raise in the minimum wage, including nearly 6 million children \nwho would see their parents' earnings increase.\n  But some will argue that an increase in the minimum wage will \nprimarily benefit teenagers. I think the evidence is quite strong that \nthat is not the case. Further, recently, over 650 economists, including \nNobel Prize winners and past presidents of the American Economics \nAssociation, released a statement calling for a raise in the minimum \nwage. They confirm that ``a modest increase in the minimum wage would \nimprove the well-being of low-wage workers and would not have the \nadverse effects that critics have claimed. . . . The weight of the \nevidence suggests that modest increases in the minimum wage have very \nlittle or no effect on employment.''\n  Moreover, and interestingly, a recent Gallup Poll revealed that 86 \npercent of small business owners today do not believe that an increase \nin the minimum wage would hurt their business. Three-fourths of small \nbusiness owners thought a 10-percent increase would have no effect on \nthem. In fact, nearly half of those polled thought the minimum wage \nshould be increased.\n  While I believe it is important to raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an \nhour, it is clear to me that much more needs to be done. We should see \nthis increase--long overdue--in the minimum wage as simply a start to \naddress the disgraceful reality that more and more of our fellow \nAmericans are living in poverty, and it is an outrage that today in the \nUnited States of America we have, by far, the highest rate of childhood \npoverty in the industrialized world.\n\n  In the last 10 years, what we have seen in our country is a \nproliferation of millionaires and billionaires. We have seen the \nwealthiest people become ever wealthier. But what we have also seen, \nsince President Bush has been in office, is that over 5 million more \nAmericans have slipped into poverty. The rich become richer, the poor \nbecome poorer, and the middle class continues to shrink. In my view, \nraising the minimum wage is an important start in attempting to address \nthe crisis of poverty in America, but it is clear to me that we have to \ndo much more. Among many other things we have to do, we must address \nthe reality in America today that we are losing millions of good-paying \nmanufacturing jobs and good-paying white-collar information technology \njobs because of our disastrous trade agreements.\n  The time is now to begin to fundamentally rethink our trade \nagreements so we can begin to create good-paying jobs here in the \nUnited States, so our young people will be able to make it to the \nmiddle class rather than to continue to struggle year after year in \npoverty.\n  We have to take a hard look at the National Labor Relations Act and \nthe National Labor Relations Board, which today make it increasingly \nhard for workers to form unions. If workers are able to collectively \nnegotiate a contract, very often the wages they get will be \nsubstantially higher than if they did not have a union. So in raising \nthe minimum wage, what we are doing today is saying to millions of \nworkers who are struggling desperately to keep\n\n[[Page S897]]\n\ntheir heads above water, we understand what you are going through. We \nunderstand it is an outrage that for a 10-year period this Congress has \nnot raised the minimum wage, and the purchasing value of the minimum \nwage has declined. But I hope that what we are doing this week is \nsimply a start to address the very serious economic problems facing not \nonly low-income Americans but the middle class as well.\n  I hope that this Senate, this Congress, will begin focusing its \nattention on the decline of the middle class, the increase of poverty, \nand come up with economic and fiscal policies that benefit all \nAmericans and not just the wealthy and large multinational \ncorporations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          New Strategy in Iraq\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, the reason I rise to take the floor is \nthis afternoon--I think the Presiding Officer was present in the Armed \nServices Committee hearing when General Petraeus testified about the \nnew strategy in Iraq. I hope that over time more Americans will be \nfamiliar with him and his view of what we can do to go forward.\n  In his testimony, General Petraeus clearly indicated we have made a \nlot of mistakes in Iraq. We never had enough troops to secure the \ncountry, and the debaathification program basically was a mistake. \nOther agencies involved in nationbuilding have not done their part. \nMilitias have grown. The biggest event in the sectarian violence was \nthe bombing of the Shia Golden Dome Mosque, and since that event, which \nwas al-Qaida-inspired, we have been going backward instead of forward \nand the sectarian violence in Baghdad has gotten worse.\n  But General Petraeus believes this new strategy is not more people \ndoing the same thing. It is a fundamentally different shift in policy. \nI agree with him and hope the country will listen closely to what he \nsays. I have a lot of confidence in General Petraeus. I intend to \nsupport him.\n  I will not vote for any resolution that declares a strategy of \nfailure before he has a chance to implement it because if we do that, \nit is going to be a very bad sendoff for our troops going into battle. \nIt will embolden the enemy and weaken the moderates we eventually have \nto rely on in the Mideast to help us in the war on terror.\n  The strategy will be similar to this: We will be increasing \nreinforcements on all fronts. We have had enough military people in \nIraq to clear territory but never hold it. We never lost a battle with \ninsurgents. We can clear out a town or sector of Baghdad, but once we \nleave, we turn it over to an immature Iraqi Army or corrupt police \nforce.\n  What we are doing by having 21,500 more troops is it doubles the \ncombat capability of American forces in Baghdad to 17,500, and that \nwill allow some soldiers to stay behind with the Iraqis to hold \nterritory. Hold for what purpose? To give the political leadership in \nIraq a chance to reconcile their differences through the political \nprocess.\n  Ask General Petraeus: Do you believe Iraq is part of the overall \nglobal war on terror?\n  I do.\n  If you believe it is a Vietnam which is a lost cause and not worth \nfighting for and we need to get out, don't pass a resolution condemning \nthe action. Cut off funding. If you believe it is part of the global \nwar on terror, as I do, we need to fight to win. I think that is \nexactly what we are trying to do. We are going to reinforce the \nmilitary so we can hold, to give the Iraqi leadership a chance to \nreconcile the problems politically. I don't believe any political group \ncould find democracy or common ground in this much violence. It is hard \nenough for us to find a solution to immigration and none of us being \nshot at. Can you imagine trying to reconcile a country oppressed by \ndictators for over 30 years with this level of violence?\n  If we can control the violence, I think it will lead to a better \npolitical result. They have to share the oil revenues with the Sunnis. \nThe Sunnis have to have something to fight for, not against. That has \nto happen. At the end of the day, a million troops won't change Baghdad \nor Iraq if the Iraqi people are not willing to make the accommodations \nthey need to make. They are under siege. They need reinforcements.\n  On the economic front, 70 percent of our casualties come from \nimprovised explosive devices, somebody planting a bomb along the side \nof the road. Some people are planting those bombs because they don't \nhave a job. They don't have any way to support their family, so they \nare taking money from the insurgents. Let's create an economy to give \nthem an option other than planting bombs.\n  Secondly, some people are planting bombs because there is no \ndownside. Once you get caught, you get released. We need a robust rule \nof law. If you want to change the way our troops are treated in Iraq, \nput people in jail for a very long time for attacking our troops. That \nwill be a deterrent.\n  Finally, more military presence will put pressure on those making \nthese explosive devices. This is a surge on all fronts. He is confident \nthis plan will work. He understands the Iraqi political leadership has \nto do their part. The Iraqi military has to do their part. But the \nsectarian violence has come about because al-Qaida hit the motherload \nwhen they blew up the Golden Mosque. We cannot let al-Qaida win in \ndestabilizing Iraq. They went to Iraq behind us because they understand \nthat the consequences of success in Iraq are not confined to Iraq. If \nyou can have a stable, functioning democracy that is tolerant, then it \nwill spread to other areas of the Mideast and will be a mighty blow to \nthe al-Qaida agenda.\n  We need to understand that a failed state in Iraq creates chaos for \nnot just us but the world. Iran becomes a big winner. The south of Iraq \nbecomes a puppet state of Iran. We could have a war between Turkey and \nthe Kurds in the north. And if there is a bloodbath in Bagdad, which \nthere surely will be if we leave, then Sunni Arab nations are going to \nget involved, and the whole region becomes much more unstable.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to General Petraeus and ask the \nquestion: Do you have confidence in this man to do what he says he can \ndo? And if the answer is yes, don't undermine him before he leaves. \nGive him the resources he needs. If you don't have confidence in him \nand our military and our leadership to change policy and strategy and \nbe successful, don't let one more person go to Iraq to get killed or \nwounded in a lost cause. You should have the courage of your \nconvictions to cut off funding. A middle-ground solution is the worst \nof all worlds.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in a while, we will take some action on \nSenator Sessions' amendment. I would like to make a couple comments on \nthat amendment before we get to that point. This might be an \nappropriate time.\n  Last year, Congress undertook the most sweeping changes to pension \nlaw since the enactment of ERISA. It was a major milestone and resulted \nin the most comprehensive change to workers' and their families' \npension and retirement savings in the past 32 years.\n  The Pension Protection Act could not have been enacted without \nbipartisan cooperation, but it took more than Republicans and Democrats \nworking together. The Pension Protection\n\n[[Page S899]]\n\nAct resulted from a deep commitment toward cooperation between the \nFinance Committee, which oversaw the tax provisions of the bill, and \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which oversaw the \npensions provisions.\n  On the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, we had \npreviously taken a strong bipartisan look at retirement issues and \nretirement savings as part of our pension oversight duties. The new \nchairman of the committee has stated he will continue the committee's \nstrong pension oversight responsibilities in order to protect and \nstrengthen the retirement savings so that workers and their families \nmay prosper long into their retirement years.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate resolution before us expresses the sentiment \nthat saving for retirement is important. We all agree with that point. \nThe fact is that savings opportunities are available almost everywhere, \nbut many workers do not take advantage of it. By this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution, we are not advocating any particular retirement \nprograms or initiatives over others on the books already or proposed to \nbe introduced. We are simply saying that people ought to save enough to \nmaintain their standard of living during their golden years, and they \nought to invest prudently so that their savings will be safe when they \ndo retire.\n  Better financial education and investment advice is needed. Automatic \nenrollment rules that were enacted in the Pension Protection Act will \nhelp people learn to save. New default investment regulations, when \nfinalized, will help too.\n  In that respect, progress has been made in saving for retirement, but \nmuch needs to be done.\n  I am happy to join with my colleagues in reiterating the commitment \nby supporting the sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I expect we will vote at a quarter to 5 \nor so on the Sessions amendment. I will vote in favor and urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor.\n  Americans who have worked hard and played by the rules for a lifetime \ndeserve a secure retirement. They deserve to be able to enjoy their \ngolden years, spend time with their families, and rest after a lifetime \nof hard work. We need to be sure they have the income they need for \ngasoline, prescription drugs, and other needs of daily living.\n  As my friend and colleague, Senator Enzi, pointed out, we passed a \ncomprehensive bill last year. It was the result of years of work by the \nHELP and Finance Committees. That work took steps to strengthen our \npension system and increase retirement savings, but we still have a \nlong way to go. Half of Americans have no type of pension plan at all \nin their workplace. And today, Americans have negative savings rates \nfor the first time since the Great Depression.\n  In order to guarantee a secure retirement for Americans, we need to \nensure that the three legs of retirement security are all there: Social \nSecurity, private pensions, and personal savings. Each one of these \nlegs plays a vital role, and we need to strengthen all three--Social \nSecurity, private pensions, and personal savings.\n  I know the Senator from Alabama has proposed ideas for creating and \nexpanding personal savings. Our staff has been talking about these \nideas and many proposals are being developed by Senator Baucus, Senator \nBingaman, Senator Conrad, and others. I look forward to continuing to \nwork with Senator Enzi, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Byrd on our \nRetirement Security Subcommittee.\n  This is an area of enormous concern for working families in this \ncountry--what is going to happen during their golden years. They look \nforward to Social Security, and we are going to have to address that \nissue. We are going to have to address the Medicare issue, which will \nbegin to run out of funds in, I believe, 2018.\n  We know that defined benefit programs have been collapsing over the \nyears, and 401(k)s that have tried to fill in have not played the role \nthat defined benefit plans played in terms of giving answers to \nworkers, and we have seen that the personal savings accounts brought \nout during the discussions by Senator Enzi and Senator Sessions have \nbeen in rapid decline.\n  The indicators are all moving in the wrong direction, in terms of a \nfirm, secure, dependable, and reliable retirement program for working \nfamilies in this country. We should find ways to work to encourage a \nchange in that policy.\n  At the appropriate time, when the Senator comes back, we will dispose \nof the Senator's amendment. We are at an appropriate time.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:45 p.m. today, the \nSenate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Session's amendment \nNo. 106, as modified; that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided \nand controlled between Senator Kennedy and Senator Sessions prior to \nthe vote; and that no second-degree amendment be in order to the \namendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, too often when we debate the issue of \nminimum wage, we focus on abstract ideas and proposals and fail to \nconsider the impact of our actions on the small business community that \nlives and breathes in the real world. I appreciate the cooperation with \nSenator Reid and others, focused around Senator Baucus and Senator \nGrassley, working in a very bipartisan way to put together a package \nthat would help to relieve some of the impact of the minimum wage \nincrease. I hope everyone has noticed that in the minimum wage debate \nwe have been having, the debate has not been over whether to raise the \nminimum wage. The debate has been on what we can do to alleviate some \nof the impact on small business. I hope that is the way we can continue \nthe discussion on this, too.\n  I mentioned earlier today that you need to meet some of these small \nbusinessmen. They are in your neighborhood. You can meet them easily. \nThey run the laundry, corner grocery, little retail stores. For the \nmost part they are families who are eking out a living while they are \ntaking on a lot of risk. They do have these moments that they wonder \nwhy they undertook that risk and how they are going to continue to fund \nthat risk. Sometimes they are paying employees when they can't even \nafford to pay themselves, and their families are relying on the \nbusiness to support them as a family, too, particularly considering all \nthe risks they are taking.\n  Sometimes they are forced to come up with additional funds to pay \ntheir workers on what we will be mandating. Those funds do not come \nfrom a money tree or some pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. They \ncome out of the pockets of the Nation's small businessmen. It is the \npenalty they pay for taking the risks associated with running a small \nbusiness.\n  The first hearing I held in Wyoming was as part of the Small Business \nCommittee. We had a hearing on some of the problems of small business. \nWhen it was over, one of the reporters came up and said: You only had \nabout 100 small businessmen attend this. Why do you suppose it was such \na poor turnout?\n  I said: That wasn't a poor turnout from small business. If small \nbusiness had an extra employee to send to a day's conference, they \nwould fire him. They can't afford extra people.\n  With that realization, it was a good turnout and there were a lot of \ngood suggestions. I always like to go back to Wyoming and meet with the \npeople and actually talk to the guy on the end of the shovel because he \nusually has the best suggestions for changing the shovel. I found that \nto be true of the small businessmen.\n  This afternoon we agreed to an amendment that will provide for easier \ncompliance with Federal rules and regulations, and I appreciate the \nbipartisan action that was taken. That will make a huge difference to \nsmall businessmen.\n\n[[Page S900]]\n\n  We could consider that the action we are about to take will be making \nit bad business for people to hire people who need some help and \nsupport in developing their skills by that method, making them higher \nwage workers. That cannot help but cost some people their jobs. In \nother instances, the hours they need will be cut back, hours that they \nneed to get a good paycheck.\n  We cannot leave the floor today feeling better about having helped \nease the income strain for many of the workers of our States but having \nleft the employers wondering how to pay for the increases we have \nmandated. Once again, we have the best of intentions, but, once again, \nwe have to remember one simple rule: It is not our money. We are, once \nagain, reaching into the pockets of the small businessmen in our \ncommunity and taking their money and telling them the amount of wages \nthey will pay their employees without regard to the talents and \nabilities of the employees they can hire.\n  We have this huge job training corps out there. It is called small \nbusinesses. They take people who don't have the skills that are \nnecessary for the small business they are operating and they teach them \nhow to run a cash register, how to count change, how to interact with a \ncustomer, how to dress appropriately.\n  You might think these are all things that might be covered in school \nclasses, and they are, if you take the right classes. But there are a \nlot of people who not only don't take the right classes, they drop out \nof school. They need to earn a living and they have to start somewhere \nearning a living. To earn that living they have to have some training, \nsome basic job training. A lot of these small businesses are where they \nget that basic business training, and they kind of get it for free. The \nbusinessmen provide that information, and most of the people in the \nminimum wage level move up rather quickly. As they learn those skills, \nthey get paid more. I know a lot of businesses where they have the \nminimum wage situation that lasts about 3 weeks if the people learn \nenough to advance so they can actually wait on the customer.\n  What we are talking about is a blanket increase that will warm the \nhearts of those who lack the skills for higher wage jobs as it leaves \nthe employers out in the cold, unless we do the Reid package. Any \nincrease in the minimum wage must be offset by a small business tax \nincentive package.\n  As a former small business owner of mom-and-pop shoe stores, let me \nwalk through the realities of how business owners may address a \nmandated Federal minimum wage hike. Raising the minimum wage to $7.50 \nimposes a 41-percent increase in labor costs for a small employer with \nminimum wage workers. Every employer must face the very real issue of \nhow he or she will deal with this increase in the costs and still meet \nthe payroll week after week.\n  These are very real and difficult questions that impact our smallest \nemployers most heavily. These increases must be paid for by employers \nand, as I said before, the money doesn't grow on trees. An employer \nmust make hard decisions about how to meet these increased payroll \nobligations.\n  When costs go up, most businesses first look to cut expenses. The \nchoices they have can be difficult and have often already been used. To \nmeet higher mandated payroll costs, a small employer may be forced to \nconsider cutting back on benefits such as health insurance, retirement, \nor leave plans--although a lot of small businesses can't afford to \nprovide those in the first place.\n  It is simply too easy to forget that fringe benefits have a \nsignificant cost. Most employees don't realize the benefit they are \ngetting when they get those. If a small employer has to reduce expenses \nto meet payroll, those are often the costs that go.\n\n  I know of a video store--I was talking to a young man who works in \nthe Senate now, and he used to work in the Senate and part-time in a \nvideo store. When the minimum wage went up last time, what the video \nstore did was instead of having two people at the store at the close of \nbusiness, they only had one, and only having one isn't nearly as safe \nas having two. But that was the choice that the owner had to make in \norder to be able to meet the payroll.\n  We have seen some charts where, in States where there has been a \nraise in minimum wage, there has been an increase in number of jobs as \nwell. I appreciate those charts and believe those charts to be \naccurate. What those charts are doing, though, is aggregating for the \nentire State. What we are doing is imposing this on one business at a \ntime, one employee at a time. It really gets down to as local as \npolitics ever gets. Those small businessmen believe that individuals \nmatter, that people matter, and they are forced into some of these \nchoices. There are not a whole lot of ways they can compensate for the \nchange.\n  I have a chart that shows how to cut costs when there are none to \ncut. This came from the Washington Post. It says:\n\n       We're at the bottom. If the minimum wage went up, I don't \n     know how we would make the cuts to cover it . . . the \n     employee said.\n\n  The lone salaried employee, she works 80 hours a week to make up for \nthe lack of workers. ``I have mixed feelings,'' she continued. ``I know \nthat people can't afford to live on $5.15 an hour. But on the business \nside, small businesses can't afford to pay it.''\n  There are examples like that that are real-life situations that do \nmake it difficult. That is the lone employee in a store.\n  Beyond cutting fringe benefits, small businesses may need to consider \ncutting back work hours, eliminating overtime, or laying off workers. \nSuch actions are traditional and often necessary responses to meeting \nincreased costs--not just the increased costs of the minimum wage. \nUnfortunately, these actions ultimately hurt the very workers the \nminimum wage increase is designed to help.\n  Some would say raise the prices. That is not always possible in the \nshort run. In the long run there may be some flexibility because this \nis going to be imposed on everybody and will drive up prices. Of \ncourse, when it drives up prices, it kind of eliminates the benefit of \nthe increase in the minimum wage. In the real world, small employers \nhave to consider these types of options to cope with mandated increases \nin wages. Small business owners who themselves favor a minimum wage \nincrease nonetheless recognize that any increase may result in having \nto make these tough choices.\n  In a recent front-page Washington Post article, the owner of a \ndiscount store in Kansas noted that, while he felt a wage of $7.25 \nseemed fair, he also noted that his profit margin was thin and that \nwages are his biggest controllable expense. He said: If wages go up, \nhours will have to come down. And the question will become: Whose, his \nstockman who works 6 hours a day and takes care of a wife who is blind \nand arthritic or should it be another worker who is ill and is on a \nwaiting list for an organ transplant and needs more hours rather than \nfewer or yet another employee who is 22 years old and pregnant? These \nare hard realities that are faced by many small employers and those who \nwork with them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Washington Post that \ncame out recently--I congratulate the writer of that article--be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 10, 2007]\n\n                         Life at $7.25 an Hour\n\n                           (By David Finkel)\n\n       Atchison, KS.--It was payday. Money, at last. Twenty-two-\n     year-old Robert Iles wanted to celebrate. ``Tonight, \n     chimichangas!'' he announced.\n       He was on his way out of the store where his full-time job \n     pays him $7.25 an hour--the rate that is likely to become the \n     nation's new minimum wage. Life at $7.25; This is the life of \n     Robert Iles and with $70 in a wallet that had been empty that \n     morning, he headed to a grocery store where for $4.98 he \n     bought not only 10 chimichangas but two burritos as well.\n       From there he stopped at a convenience store, where for \n     $16.70 he filled the gas tank of the car he purchased when he \n     got his raise to $7.25; then he went to another grocery \n     stores where he got a $21.78 money order to pay down some \n     bills, including $8,000 in medical bills from the day he \n     accidentally sliced open several fingers with a knife while \n     trying to cut a tomato; and then he headed toward the family \n     trailer 19 miles away, where his parents were waiting for \n     dinner.\n       Today in Washington, the House is scheduled to vote on \n     whether to increase the federal minimum wage from $5.15 to \n     $7.25. Passage is expected, with Senate approval soon to \n     follow, and if President Bush signs the resulting bill into \n     law, as he indicated he\n\n[[Page S901]]\n\n     would, the U.S. minimum wage would rise for the first time \n     since 1997, ending a debate about whether such a raise would \n     be good or bad for the economy.\n       But even if the matter is settled in Congress, it isn't \n     settled at all in Atchison, and Robert Iles's drive home is \n     proof. Every stop he made on his ride home revealed a \n     different facet of how complicated the minimum wage can be in \n     the parts of America where, instead of a debatable issue, it \n     is a way of life.\n       At the store where Iles works, for instance, the owner \n     thinks the minimum wage should be increased as a moral issue \n     but worries about which employees' hours he will have to cut \n     to compensate.\n       At the store where he bought the chimichangas, the cashier \n     who makes $6.25 worries that a raise will force her out of \n     her subsidized apartment and onto the street.\n       At the convenience store where he bought gas, the owner \n     worries that he will have to either raise prices, angering \n     his customers, or make less money, ``and why would I want to \n     make less money?''\n       At the store where he got the money order, the worries are \n     about Wal-Mart, which not only supports an increase but also \n     built a Supercenter on the edge of town that has been sucking \n     up customers since it opened three years ago.\n       As for Iles--who keeps $70 out of every paycheck to cover \n     two weeks' worth of food and gas and in a matter of minutes \n     was already down to $26.54--his worry was as basic as how \n     fast to drive home.\n       Drive too fast and he'd be wasting gas. But his family was \n     waiting. And his chimichangas, best cooked frozen, were \n     starting to thaw.\n\n\n                        The Meaning of a Dollar\n\n       The debate about the minimum wage usually comes down to \n     jobs. If Congress approves the increase it will result in \n     raises for an estimated 13 million Americans, or about 9 \n     percent of the total workforce. That's a percentage that most \n     economists agree would cause a modest increase in national \n     unemployment. In Kansas, however, ``it would have a fairly \n     significant impact,'' said Beth Martino, a spokeswoman for \n     the state Department of Labor. According to one independent \n     analysis, 16 percent of the workforce, or 237,000 workers, \n     would be affected--and that doesn't include the 20,000 whose \n     wages aren't governed by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act \n     and earn the state minimum wage of $2.65. That rate, the \n     lowest in the nation and unchanged since 1988, hints at the \n     prevailing wisdom in Kansas about the minimum wage, which is \n     that the only way low-wage earners will make more is through \n     congressional action.\n       This holds true from Topeka, where the powerful Kansas \n     Chamber of Commerce has long opposed any raise, to rural \n     Mulvane, home of Republican state legislator Ted Powers, who \n     says his futile effort three year's ago to raise the state \n     minimum wage resulted in his being branded a ``dirty dog,'' \n     to Atchison, a working-class city of 11,000 where the stores \n     that depend on low-wage workers include one called ``Wow Only \n     $1.00!'' This is the store where Robert Iles has worked for \n     five years.\n       ``Robert, would you help me a second?'' Jack Bower, the \n     owner, called to Iles soon after opening, as the line at the \n     cash register grew. A onetime Wal-Mart vice president, Bower \n     moved back to Atchison several years ago to teach and ended \n     up buying the old J.C. Penney store, and now runs a business \n     where the meaning of a dollar is displayed on shelf after \n     shelf. The jar of Peter Piper's Hot Dog Relish? That's what a \n     dollar is worth. The Wolfgang Puck Odor Eliminator that a \n     customer was looking at as she said to a friend, ``I just \n     don't know how I'm ever going to make it. My ex-husband's not \n     paying his child support''? That's a dollar, too, as is the \n     home pregnancy test, the most shoplifted item in the store.\n       ``This is not a wealthy community,'' Bower explained. ``The \n     thing is, a lot of people depend on this store.''\n       Robert Iles has his own version of a dollar's meaning, \n     learned last February when Bower took him aside and said he \n     would be getting a pay raise to $7.25. ``Okay,'' Iles \n     remembers replying, wanting to seem businesslike. ``But \n     inside I was doing the cha-cha-cha,'' he said. ``It was like \n     going from lower class to lower middle class.''\n       Soon after, he bought his car, a used 2005 Dodge Neon, and \n     just about every workday since then he has spent his lunch \n     break in the driver's seat, eating a bologna sandwich with \n     the engine off to save gas, even in winter. An hour later, he \n     was back behind the cash register, telling customers ``Thank \n     you and have a nice day'' again and again.\n       And meanwhile, Jack Bower wondered whose hours he will cut \n     if he has to give his employees a raise.\n       It's not that he's against raising the minimum wage--``I \n     don't think $5.15 is adequate,'' he said, adding that $7.25 \n     seems fair--but his profit margin is thin, and wages are his \n     biggest controllable expense. So if wages go up, he said, \n     hours will have to come down, and the question will become: \n     Whose?\n       Will it be Neil Simpson, 66, who works six hours a day as a \n     stockman, and then five more hours somewhere else cleaning \n     floors, and takes care of a wife who is blind and arthritic?\n       Will it be Susan Irons 57, who was infected with hepatitis \n     C from a blood transfusion, is on a waiting list for a liver \n     transplant and needs more hours rather than fewer?\n       Will it be Christina Lux, who is 22 years old and 13 weeks \n     pregnant?\n       Will it be Iles?\n       ``Attention, all shoppers,'' he said into the microphone. \n     ``We will be closing in 10 minutes. Please begin making your \n     final selections.'' Ten minutes later, he was clocked out and \n     back in his Neon. ``My brand new car,'' he called it proudly, \n     and he explained how he was able to afford it on $7.25 an \n     hour: a no-money-down loan for which he will pay $313.13 a \n     month until 2012.\n\n\n                      Small Business ``at Bottom''\n\n       Seven dollars and twenty-five cents an hour equals $15,080 \n     per year, and out of that comes $313 for the car loan and \n     $100 for car insurance, Iles said, going over his monthly \n     bills. An additional $90 for the 1995 car with 135,000 miles \n     on it that he is buying from a friend for his mother, $150 \n     for the family phone bills, $35 on his credit card, $100 for \n     gas $100 toward the mortgage on the trailer. ``That's about \n     it. Oh yeah, $20 in doctors' bills,'' he said, and totaled it \n     up on fingers scarred by surgical stitches. Nine hundred and \n     eight dollars. ``I bring home 900 a month,'' he said. ``So I \n     very rarely have any money for myself.''\n       He parked in front of a store called Always Low Prices, \n     which has the cheapest chimichangas in town.\n       Once it was a full-service grocery store with 28 employees. \n     Then came word that Wal-Mart was looking for land for a \n     Supercenter, and now it has become a bare-bones operation \n     where the starting pay for its few employees is $5.50, and \n     the manager wonders how the store will survive if wages \n     increase.\n       ``We're at the bottom. If the minimum wage went up, I don't \n     know how we would make the cuts to cover it,'' Michelle Henry \n     said. The lone salaried employee, she works 80 hours a week \n     to make up for the lack of workers. ``I have mixed \n     feelings,'' she continued. ``I know that people can't afford \n     to live on $5.15 an hour. But on the business side, small \n     businesses can't afford to pay it.''\n       At the register, meanwhile, Shannon Wilk, 33, who makes \n     $6.25 an hour, said that of course she would like to earn \n     more money. It would help her. It would help her 18-month-old \n     daughter. ``It would be good,'' she said, ``but also, for me, \n     I live in income-based housing, and if I get a raise, my rent \n     would go up, and I would lose my assistance.'' Even the \n     tiniest raise would affect her, she said, and with nowhere to \n     go, the last thing she can afford is a raise to $7.25.\n       In such an equation, the fact that she was working in \n     Kansas was to her benefit. Atchison sits on the Kansas-\n     Missouri border, and if Wilk worked a few hundred yards to \n     the east, she would already be in jeopardy: In November \n     Missouri voters supported a ballot initiative increasing the \n     state's minimum wage to $6.50, with an annual adjustment for \n     inflation. Five other states had similar votes, with similar \n     results, bringing to 29 the number that now require an hourly \n     wage above the federal minimum, In the District the minimum \n     is $7, in Maryland it's $6.15, and in Virginia it's $5.15.\n       Such is the arbitrariness of state-by-state minimum wage \n     laws that Wilk feels lucky to be in Kansas making $6.25 an \n     hour while inside at the first grocery store across the \n     Missouri state line, the cashier was ecstatic that she was in \n     a place where her pay was going from $6.20 to $6.50, \n     explaining, ``That's 30 cents more I ain't got.''\n       Iles handed over a $10 bill for his 10 chimichangas and two \n     burritos. He stuffed the change deep in his pocket, and \n     headed next to a convenience store owned by a man named Bill \n     Murphy, who said that if he had the chance to talk to new \n     House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, he would ask one question. \n     ``Where does she think the money will come from? And that is \n     the question,'' he said. ``My wages are going to go up 10 \n     percent.''\n       Unlike Jack Bower who would compensate by cutting hours. \n     Murphy said that in his two convenience stores there are no \n     hours to cut. ``I'm going to have to raise my prices,'' he \n     said--not only because his workers who make less than the new \n     minimum wage would get raises but also because those who earn \n     more would insist on raises as well. Employees at $7.25 will \n     want $8.25. Those at $8.25 will want $9.25.\n       Economists classify such workers as the ones who would be \n     indirectly affected by a minimum-wage increase. Of the \n     estimated 13 million workers expected to get raises, 7.4 \n     million are in that category. ``You've created this \n     entitlement,'' Murphy said he would tell Pelosi.\n       And yet he will pay it, he said, and compensate with price \n     increases, which he worries will be inflationary, even though \n     most economists say that won't happen. He will raise prices \n     he continued, because the only other option would be to earn \n     less money, which he doesn't want to do because he owes $1.5 \n     million on his businesses and wouldn't want to default.\n       ``Now that might be a stretch in some people's minds, from \n     giving a guy a raise to not being able to pay the bank, but \n     that's the path I'm talking about,'' he said. Against such a \n     dire backdrop, Iles put $17 worth of gas in his car.\n       ``That'll be $16.70,'' the clerk said to him, and instead \n     of correcting this. Iles gladly took the change.\n       Thirty cents, suddenly got.\n\n\n                          The Wal-Mart Factor\n\n       Iles drove past the Atchison Inn, where starting pay i$ \n     $5.15, past Movie Gallery, where it's also $5.15, and stopped \n     in front of\n\n[[Page S902]]\n\n     Country Mart, the fanciest grocery store in town, where high \n     school students start at $5.15 and, according to owner Dennis \n     Garrett, ``some of them aren't worth that.''\n       A few days earlier, Garrett had gotten a letter from a \n     lobbying consortium called the Coalition for Job \n     Opportunities, urging him to write Congress to protest the \n     minimum-wage increase. It came in the form of a letter \n     already written, to which he merely had to add his \n     congressman's name and send it off to Washington. ``We are \n     very concerned,'' the letter began. and it was signed by 25 \n     organizations.\n       The most conspicuous signature, though, was the one that \n     wasn't there, that of Wal-Mart, the nation's largest private \n     employer, with 1.3 million workers. Wal-Mart won't say how \n     many of those workers earn less than what the new minimum \n     wage would be, but if the Atchison store is an example, \n     starting pay is $6 an hour.\n       Nonetheless, in October 2005, Wal-Mart chief executive H. \n     Lee Scott Jr. said in a speech that the ``U.S. minimum wage \n     of $5.15 an hour has not been raised in nearly a decade, and \n     we believe it is out of date with the times,'' He went on to \n     say, ``Our customers simply don't have the money to buy basic \n     necessities between paychecks.''\n       When it comes to Wal-Mart, however, just about any \n     announcement that affects public policy is greeted with \n     suspicion, and that has been the case with the minimum wage. \n     Some have said that Wal-Mart, in need of good publicity, is \n     supporting an increase for public relations reasons; others \n     have declared it an attempt to drive small, independently \n     owned stores out of business.\n       These suspicions exist in Atchison as well. As in many \n     small communities, Wal-Mart defines local retail, and just as \n     Always Low Prices had to retool itself, Country Mart was \n     significantly affected by Wal-Mart's new food-stocked \n     Supercenter several miles away.\n       What is Wal-Mart up to? What are its true motives? Like \n     many others, Dennis Garrett wonders. He imagines public \n     relations is part of it, but he didn't want to speculate on \n     whether this was an attempt to put him out of business, \n     except to say that raising some wages wouldn't do that. He'd \n     reduce some hours, he said. He'd manage.\n       Yes, Atchison businesses would be hurt initially, but in \n     the long run, if unemployment increases, those hurt the most \n     would be the very ones Wal-Mart insists would be helped--the \n     customers, especially the younger ones, ``the people who \n     don't advance their education and need a job between the ages \n     of 16 and 21, 22, 23.''\n       In other words, many of the workers in Atchison, one of \n     whom was now at Garrett's service counter buying a money \n     order so he could pay bills. Even though Iles has a checking \n     account, this is the method he prefers because if he were to \n     pay by check, and the check were to bounce because of \n     insufficient funds, the penalty would be devastating. A $25 \n     fee would require more than three hours of work.\n       And where would those hours come from?\n\n\n                         ``It's Tough for Me''\n\n       So go the calculations of a $7.25 worker, now headed home.\n       ``It's an old trailer,'' he explained earlier in the day.\n       The heat doesn't work, he said, and the water heater works \n     sporadically.\n       One of the bedroom ceilings is caving in. He sleeps in the \n     other bedroom, and his parents sleep in the living room \n     because his father, who has diabetes and had to have several \n     inches of one of his feet amputated, can't really get around.\n       Also, his father has leukemia. And is legally blind. And \n     his mother, who once made $6.50 an hour as an aide at a \n     nursing home, quit to take care of her husband.\n       ``We're pretty much living off my money,'' Iles said, and \n     in he went to cook them dinner, bring payday to an end and, \n     the next morning, start the cycle again.\n       Life at $7.25. Should that be the minimum wage?\n       ``Yes,'' Iles said.\n       Even if it hurts job opportunities for people like him, as \n     Dennis Garrett had suggested?\n       ``Yes.''\n       Or causes price increases, as Bill Murphy had suggested?\n       ``Yes.''\n       Or damages businesses such as Always Low Prices?\n       ``I mean, it's tough for me, and I'm already making $7.25 \n     an hour.''\n       Or causes Jack Bower to reduce hours for one of his \n     employees? Perhaps for Iles himself?\n       ``It's just so hard for people. I mean it's hard,'' Iles \n     said, and then he went to work.\n       ``I think it'll be bad today,'' one of the workers \n     suggested as the line at the Wow Only $1.00! cash register \n     began to form.\n       ``Well, it depends on your perspective,'' Iles said.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. The author of the article is really a master at showing how \nall of these things are intertwined. It is very revealing and makes a \ngood case for the increase in the minimum wage. But it does show some \nof the decisions that will have to be made and how that will affect \nother people, some of whom will be in a similar situation.\n  In a similar vein, when confronted by higher labor costs, employers \nwill naturally gravitate toward filling positions with their most \nhighly skilled, experienced, and productive workers available. Once \nagain, this phenomenon of replacing low-skilled with high-skilled \nworkers in the face of rising labor costs winds up harming the very \nworkers an increase in the minimum wage seeks to help. The minimum wage \npositions are very often the entryway into the world of work for those \nwho lack skills and experience. I can't say that enough. I am hoping \nthe Workforce Investment Act will kind of come out of this whole \nprocess, too, and provide some additional training so people with less \nskills can have more skills and get some of the choice jobs that this \ncountry has to offer. But mandated increases in the minimum wage run \nthe risk of closing that entryway to many.\n  Another option, of course, for employers that has to be considered is \nautomation as an alternative to a paid employee. Does this sound \nfarfetched? Consider how the automated teller machines, the ATMs, have \nreplaced tellers, how the self-checkout lane at many establishments has \nreplaced the clerk, and the drive-through has replaced the waiter, and \nin toll booths the EZ Pass has replaced the toll collector--not all of \nthem, but a lot of them who use the EZ Pass eliminate toll collectors. \nWe have seen some charts on how productivity goes up when the minimum \nwage goes up. Sometimes productivity goes up when machines are \ninstituted in place of people. They can work 24 hours a day, 7 days a \nweek, 365 days a year. We don't pay them any health benefits. We may \nhave a little bit of maintenance done on them. They don't get any \nvacation.\n  Employees are still necessary. I keep telling people that you can't \noutsource the fact when your toilet is plugged and you need some help \nor when your electric switch doesn't work, there are a lot of hands-on \nthings that absolutely require people. But they are figuring out ways \nto automate a lot of these things. In Gillette, WY, where I am from, we \nhave this huge worker shortage, and as I have said a number of times, I \nkeep encouraging people to go west and find the new frontier and get \nsome good jobs. But when they are pinched, they come up with some other \nways of doing things. The drive-up for our McDonald's is actually \nhandled out of California. When you drive up to the little window and \nyou order your Big Mac, you are actually talking to someone in \nCalifornia who uses the Internet to send the order back to the people \nwho are putting it all together to give to you when you get in your \ncar. They have been able to increase the number of drive-throughs \nsubstantially using lower paid--this kind of amazes me--out of \nCalifornia. So automation is one of the answers.\n  Beyond these cost-cutting measures of eliminating benefits, reducing \nhours, downsizing, laying off employees, reducing low-skill and entry-\nlevel employment, and automating, employers may also have to face up to \nthe prospect of increasing the price of their goods and services. Price \nincreases caused by mandated cost increases bring their own catalog of \nills. Such increases drive inflation and cause all consumers to \nultimately pay the price of these mandates. The irony is that as the \ncost of these labor increases is passed to the consumers, it affects \neveryone, including the minimum wage worker, whose recently increased \nwages are suddenly devalued by the increased price for goods and \nservices that impact them as well. So on this ladder of success, we \nhave kind of removed the lower rung of it. So it is a little bigger \nstep to get up there, and some of them aren't going to be able to make \nthe step because of some of the ways that it has to be adjusted.\n  In the same Washington Post article I mentioned earlier, another \nsmall employer who owns two convenience stores noted that he simply \ndoes not have the option of cutting hours to meet his increased payroll \nburden. Instead, he noted: I am going to have to raise my prices. He \nindicated if he had the chance to talk with Speaker Pelosi about the \nminimum wage, he would ask one question, and that is: Where does she \nthink the money will come from? Of course, it can be argued that his \ncustomers, if he raises the price for the candy bar or the cup of \ncoffee, will go somewhere where it is cheaper, and that is a good \npossibility. That means that in order to maintain\n\n[[Page S903]]\n\nthe business, if he is going to raise those prices, he has to have \nemployees who give better service, quicker service, and that goes back \nto the on-the-job training I was mentioning that a lot of these small \nbusinesses do. They have to have the good service in order to keep \ntheir loyal customers. Sometimes that doesn't just hinge on the price \nof the candy bar or a cup of coffee.\n  I believe almost all of us recognize these economic realities and \nthat none of us want them to come about. It is for those precise \nreasons that the substitute amendment contains provisions designed to \nenable our smallest employers to meet the obligations imposed by a \nminimum wage increase without resorting to the difficult personnel \nchoices, the consumer price increases or all of the other things I \nmentioned.\n  Yesterday, I spoke briefly about the fact that in legislating, it is \noften important to find a third way. In this instance, the third way is \none that will provide an increase in the minimum wage but also provide \nrelief to the most affected small businesses so that they don't \nexperience employee dislocation, a reduction in employment \nopportunities for low-skilled and entry-level workers or an increase in \nconsumer prices that takes away the real value of any wage increase.\n  The third way is represented by the real value of any wage increase. \nThe third way is represented by the substitute amendment that was the \nproduct of extensive bipartisan support, Democrats and Republicans \nworking together, acknowledging the fact that mandated cost increases \ncan have negative economic effects. So together we developed a means of \naddressing those concerns in the form of a bipartisan substitute \namendment. I can't emphasize enough how pleased I am with the \ncooperation I saw as people worked out different alternatives. There \nwere certainly a wide variety of them that were done and I think with \nsome concentration particularly on how they would affect small \nbusiness. I would reiterate the bipartisan support of that small \nbusiness tax incentive package. There are key Democratic leaders who \nhave acknowledged the need for the package to offset any wage increase \nin order to not disenfranchise the employers and their workers.\n\n  So I hope we won't make this partisan now. As I mentioned yesterday, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and I have gone head to \nhead on raising the minimum wage three times in the past several years. \nEach time, the votes were set up for each side to fail. This time \naround, we worked to come up with a third way in order to get the job \ndone. I hope that all efforts to try and unravel this third way that \nwill most likely result in a minimum wage increase isn't abandoned for \nthe sake of making partisan messages. I urge my colleagues to continue \nto support the small business incentive package as a much-needed offset \nto the increased Federal wage.\n  I think this is a tremendous opportunity for us to do the right thing \nin all aspects, and I hope there will be good bipartisan support. I \nunderstand the desire to have a clean minimum wage, but that is what we \nhave been going through for a couple of years now, and we are finally \ntalking bipartisan. I think that was something that came out of the \nelections. I am pleased to see it is operating, and we will see how \nlong it continues.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Sessions \namendment No. 108 be modified with the changes at the desk, and I urge \nits adoption, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 108), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. STUDY OF UNIVERSAL USE OF ADVANCE PAYMENT OF EARNED \n                   INCOME CREDIT.\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall report to \n     Congress on a study of the benefits, costs, risks, and \n     barriers to workers and to businesses (with a special \n     emphasis on small businesses) if the advance earned income \n     tax credit program (under section 3507 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986) included all recipients of the earned \n     income tax credit (under section 32 of such Code) and what \n     steps would be necessary to implement such inclusion.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 108), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 107 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Sessions \namendment No. 107 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, in about 6 or 7 minutes, we will be \nhaving a vote, and then I would expect the President's State of the \nUnion Address will place demands on the Members, so that will mean we \nwill probably move over until tomorrow. As I mentioned earlier, I hope \nour colleagues will vote in support of the Sessions amendment for the \nreasons I have outlined.\n  I think an important message ought to go out to families and to \nworkers all over this country and many others who have worked long and \nhard to try and urge the Senate of the United States to move on the \nminimum wage issue and raise the minimum wage, as it has been stuck for \nthe last 10 years at $5.15. There are people who have knocked on doors, \nthere are people who have stuffed envelopes and there are people who \nhave phoned into radio stations and people who have written letters to \nthe editors and people who have met with Members of Congress all over \nthis country. People have marched, attended parades, and demonstrated. \nThey have spoken out for fairness and justice for workers. Tomorrow we \nwill have a real opportunity to respond to that.\n  I am very hopeful, as a result of the votes tomorrow, we will be well \non the way toward this body supporting action that has taken place in \nthe House of Representatives and a vote for an increase in the minimum \nwage. There will be those who will go to bed tonight who have been \nworking long and hard for $5.15 an hour. They may work one job, and \nmany of them, 300,000 Americans, work two full-time jobs. They probably \nkeep saying a prayer, and they are keeping their fingers crossed that \nin the Senate, tomorrow will provide at least some additional breath of \nhope to them and to their families, to their loved ones, that can make \na difference in terms of their lives and what a difference this can \nmake.\n  As we have mentioned, it may be more than a year's worth of groceries \nto some families or it may be the tuition for a community college. It \ncould be 20 months of child care for some workers. It could be heating \nand electric bills for 19 months, all measured in a few months, for \nthings that so many of us, certainly in this body, take for granted. \nBut out there in so many communities across the country, people fight \nand struggle to try and achieve those goals.\n  So this is a very important vote. We have important votes and some \nnot so important votes in this body, but tomorrow will be one of great \nimportance and consequence. I think it will be a defining issue about \nwhat kind of society we are; what is the measure of our decency and the \nmeasure of our humanity in this body. So I am very hopeful as to the \noutcome, and we urge our colleagues to give us their support. We will \nhave an opportunity to make comments tomorrow morning briefly before we \nvote on these measures. We thank all of our Members for all of their \ncooperation and their help to Senator Enzi and myself over the last \nseveral days. So with that I would indicate to our colleagues that in \napproximately 2 minutes or so we will begin the vote on the Sessions \namendment, an amendment which both I and Senator Enzi support.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S904]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield back, with the consent of both sides, the 2 minutes \nthat was to be available on both sides.

Mr. President, much has been said recently about the way \nin which VA purchases drugs and the manner in which medications are \nprovided to beneficiaries. This discussion has been a part of the \nongoing debate to allow Medicare to negotiate for drugs on behalf of \nits beneficiaries.\n  Concerns have been raised about veterans' access to drugs, the \nquality of the benefit, and VA's formulary and pricing. Veterans \nmedication coverage has been misunderstood. I would like to take this \nopportunity to set the record straight about the process by which VA \nachieves drug cost savings and the level of care afforded to veterans.\n  VA is different than Medicare for a variety of reasons, there is no \ndoubt, but I believe some lessons can be applied to address Medicare \ndrug prices.\n  While there is no question that VA's formulary is an important \ncomponent of VA pharmacy management, decisions about which drugs are on \nthe formulary are not made by bureaucrats nor are they made by those \nsolely concerned about the bottom line.\n  VA employs a scientific review process to select drugs to be \navailable to beneficiaries and to ensure quality care. Physicians and \nclinical pharmacists from the VA's regional offices manage the \nformulary.\n  While some concern has been expressed that the VA formulary covers \nonly 30 percent of the 4,300 drugs available on Medicare's market-\npriced formulary, this is not the case. Rather, it is my understanding \nthat VA actually offers 11 percent more drugs than are available under \nPart D of Medicare.\n  VA offers 4,778 drugs by way of a ``core'' national formulary which \nrequires that they must be made available at all VA medical care \nfacilities. If a drug is needed which is not on the formulary, VA has a \nquick process to ensure that the drug will be prescribed. This off-\nformulary process is so robust, in fact, that last year, VA dispensed \nprescriptions for an additional 1,416 drugs. So, to put a finer point \non this, when a non-formulary medication is clinically needed--it is \nprovided.\n  To those who argue that VA's formulary is ``among the most \nrestrictive in the marketplace,'' I would only say that the Institute \nof Medicine took a good long look at VA and found that in many respects \nit is actually less restrictive than other public or private \nformularies.\n  The chairman of the IOM committee said that if VA did not have a \nformulary process like it has, they would have indeed urged that one be \ncreated just like it.\n  Some have suggested that veterans receive substandard care because of \nthe VA drug benefit The literature says otherwise. Veterans get better \npharmaceutical care than private or public hospitals, according to a \nstudy last year published in the Archives of Internal Medicine.\n  VA's mail order pharmacy has been criticized, as well. VA employs \nnearly 10,000 pharmacists and technicians and is regarded by many \npharmacy organizations as excellent. VA also operates 230 outpatient \npharmacies. VA also trains more doctors of pharmacy than any other \nsingle organization in the U.S. And most significantly, while the error \nrate for prescriptions in the U.S. is between 3 and 8 percent, the \nerror rate in VA is less than one one-hundredth of one percent.\n  In VA, new drugs are reviewed on their merits and are made available \nquickly if they provide distinct benefits. Safety and how well a drug \nworks are the most important considerations in the review process, \nfollowed by cost.\n  I could go on. We know that VA gets the best prices, but I think the \nessential question is: Do veterans get the necessary drugs to promote \nthe best health care? The answer--based on peer-reviewed studies--is a \nresounding yes. The quality of medical care in VA is significantly \nhigher for overall quality in chronic care and preventative care.\n  And if some believe that veterans aren't happy with their drug access \nand pricing, it is news to me, and to the administration. Just last \nweek, VA announced results of a survey done by an independent reviewer \nof customer satisfaction. For the seventh straight year, the Department \nof Veterans Affairs has received significantly higher ratings than the \nprivate health care industry. VA's marks keep continuing to rise.\n  When veterans' groups testify before Congress about their needs and \ndesires, the only thing they say about their drug coverage is that they \nwant to keep it the way it is.\n  Peer-reviewed studies, veterans service organizations, polls, and \nconsumer reports consistently testify to the superiority of VA health \ncare over private sector care. The VA formulary has been repeatedly \nreviewed and approved by Congress, GAO and the Institute of Medicine. \nConsumer choice provides clear insight into the success of the VA \npharmacy management system.\n  We can learn a number of lessons from the VA as we consider Medicare \nprice negotiations. I support drug price negotiation by Medicare. As \nchairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I will closely monitor the \nevolution of this issue to ensure VA retains access to affordable \ndrugs. The gains that can be made in Medicare--and the improvement of \nquality--are just too great to do nothing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the VA's summary of the study to which I \npreviously referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S905]]\n\n Journal Article Praises VA Health Care--Secretary Nicholson: Further \n                     Proof of VA's Top Quality Care\n\n       Washington.--``One of the most striking examples of \n     American health care success''--that is one medical journal's \n     recent assessment of the health care system operated by the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\n       The most recent tribute to VA's health care system came in \n     an article in the medical journal Neurology.\n       ``The quality of VA's health care system is recognized by \n     medical professionals and, most importantly, by veterans,'' \n     said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson. \n     ``Repeatedly, the medical community holds up VA's health care \n     system as a model.''\n       ``The VA has achieved remarkable improvements in patient \n     care and health outcomes, and is a cost-effective and \n     efficient organization,'' according to the journal. For \n     example, the article cited VA's comprehensive coverage and \n     said it is especially suited to manage chronic disease.\n       Dr. Michael J. Kussman, VA's Acting Under Secretary for \n     Health, said the article underscores the Department's \n     commitment to high quality patient care.\n       ``This shows that VA's health system is recognized \n     internationally as the benchmark for health care services,'' \n     Dr. Kussman said. ``It further demonstrates that our \n     commitment to high quality care is benefiting the men and \n     women who have earned the best possible care through service \n     to our country.''\n       The Neurology article is the second recent study citing the \n     quality of VA health care. In December, a comprehensive study \n     by Harvard Medical School said federal and military \n     hospitals, such as those run by the VA, provide the best care \n     available anywhere for some of the most common life-\n     threatening illnesses.\n       In 2006, VA received the prestigious ``Innovations in \n     American Government'' Award from Harvard's Kennedy School of \n     Government for its advanced electronic health records and \n     performance measurement system.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, my friend from \nHawaii, for his excellent presentation. I pay tribute to him for his \nextraordinary work on behalf of the veterans of this country. He has \nbeen the real leader in the Senate on this issue, particularly for \nthose who have suffered the wounds of war. He has been a tireless \nadvocate to make sure we get the very best focus and attention to them. \nWe have listened to him frequently. I hope the Senate will pay close \nattention to his words and his findings and his urging for this body.\n  I thank him for his comments, as always.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/23/senate-section/article/S905-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMENDMENT NO. 71 TO S. 1\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, as I have mentioned before, \nlast year Washington was rocked by the Abramoff scandal and other \nmisdeeds. I am pleased that Congress has shown it is taking seriously \nits responsibility to the American people by revisiting and tightening \nthe rules and laws that govern Members of the Senate. Many have said \nthat S.1, which overwhelmingly passed out of the Senate last week, \nincludes the most sweeping ethics reform measures since Watergate.\n  There is one point that I discussed and pushed forward during last \nyear's debate that I believe needs to again be part of what we are \ndoing now. Last year I offered a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to make \nmany of the reforms we have considered throughout this ethics debate \napply to all branches of Government. I am pleased that this sense of \nthe Senate was accepted and is included in the underlying bill.\n  During the debate last week, I filed an amendment, No. 71, which \nbuilds upon the principle behind this sense of the Senate--that the \nstandards employed in this bill should be the minimum standards that \nguide the other branches of Government. I thought this was a good \namendment--in fact, a necessary amendment--that ought to be accepted \ninto this bill. Unfortunately, that did not happen. I have spoken with \nsome of my colleagues and understand that though there is general \nsupport for the principle that ethics standards in the executive branch \nshould be as stringent as those made applicable by this bill, some of \nmy colleagues believe the provisions of this amendment warrant further \nevaluation. Though I am disappointed this amendment will not be \nincluded on this bill, I respect and appreciate the importance and \nvalue of committee evaluation and will look forward to working on this \nissue as that committee process proceeds.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would like to thank my friend and colleague from \nNebraska for bringing this amendment and important issue forward. The \nSenate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has \njurisdiction over these issues which impact the executive branch. As \nchairman of that committee, I can appreciate that this amendment \nwarrants more thorough evaluation and deliberation. Later this year, \nthe committee will consider the reauthorization of the Office of \nGovernment Ethics--the executive branch's ethics arm. I look forward to \nworking with my friend from Nebraska on the issue throughout the year \nand as we consider this reauthorization and other matters.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my good friend from Connecticut. I \nappreciate his thoughtfulness in this debate, and I look forward to \ndiscussing it further as his committee proceeds this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/23/senate-section/article/S905-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              UNI-CAPITOL WASHINGTON INTERNSHIP PROGRAMME\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, as modern communication makes our world \nincreasingly smaller, linking global societies at unprecedented \nbusiness, government and social levels, it is critical that America and \nother democracies worldwide engage in a process of ongoing co-education \nabout the efforts and work of democratic governments. This educational \nexchange is best facilitated by hands-on learning and personal \nexperience. A terrific example of this effort is the Uni-Capitol \nWashington Internship Programme, in which outstanding college students \nfrom seven of Australia's top universities compete for the opportunity \nto serve as interns for Members of the U.S. Congress. In its eighth \nyear, the program has facilitated internships for 68 Australian \nstudents thus far.\n  I am fortunate to be able to participate this year. Charis Tierney \nfrom Brisbane, Queensland, has been a wonderful addition to my office \nthis winter. She says of this opportunity:\n\n       The UCWIP has been a once in a lifetime to not only observe \n     but participate in the work of the U.S. Congress. Working \n     within Senator Crapo's office has given me the kind of unique \n     appreciation for the United States Senate's work that can \n     only be gained from behind the scenes. My daily interaction \n     with the fantastic staff of the Senator's office has only \n     enhanced the experience.\n\n  I offer my congratulations to Director Eric Federing and his wife \nDaphne for their support and dedication of this important educational \nprogram. The additional activities such as visits to historic sites, \nmeetings with other government agencies and outside organizations and \nspecial events helps enhance the experience for these promising young \nwomen and men. The Federings' commitment to comprehensive bilateral \ncivic education has made it possible for students like Charis to take \ntheir experiences here in the legislative branch of the U.S. Government \nback to Australia and apply lessons learned as they pursue their own \ncourse of study across a wide range of academic pursuits.\n  This valuable program bridges the 9,000 miles that separate the \nUnited States and Australia with the friendship of shared experiences \nand realization and application of common goals and interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/23/senate-section/article/S905-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S905-S906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING CONNIE FEUERSTEIN\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of my \nlongtime friend and staff member, Connie Feuerstein. After working with \nme for over a decade, Connie has decided to join her husband, Jack, in \nretirement.\n  Long before joining my staff, Connie was active in her church, \ncommunity, and Genesee County politics. Her efforts were critical in my \nsuccessful campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996, and \nI am so fortunate that she was willing to join my congressional staff.\n  For Connie, her work has always been so much more than just a job. \nShe brings such passion and energy to everything she does. Whether it \nis attending a community event, walking in a parade or advocating on \nbehalf of a family or for the needs of her community, Connie always \ngives 110 percent to whatever she is doing.\n  As a district representative in my congressional offices in Brighton \nand\n\n[[Page S906]]\n\nFlint and a regional manager in my Flint/Saginaw/Bay office in the \nSenate, Connie has been my link to the community. She is a respected \ncommunity leader in her own right. Through the years, she has mentored \ninterns and staff members, many of whom have caught her zeal for public \nservice and have kept in touch with her long after they left the \noffice.\n  My staff and I will miss her sense of humor, boundless energy, \noptimism and enthusiasm, although I am certain that retirement will not \nstop her from staying involved. I also know that many people in \nMichigan, whose lives she touched through her work, will miss her.\n  Upon leaving the Senate, Connie plans to spend time in Florida, where \nshe will be closer to one of her daughters and her three precious \ngrandchildren. She has a love for life that is contagious and I know \nher family will appreciate having more of her time and attention.\n  Mr. President, I am sad because I am losing a trusted and valued \nmember of my staff, but I am happy to see a dear friend move on to new \nchallenges, and I wish her the best of everything.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/23/senate-section/article/S906-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING RICK HUMMEL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of our Nation's \nfinest sportswriters, Rick Hummel, and congratulate him on receiving \nthe J.G. Taylor Spink Award, the highest honor awarded by the Baseball \nWriters Association of America.\n  The great sportswriter, Red Smith, once said ``There's nothing to \nwriting. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and open a vein.'' He \nmeant, of course, that writing is not easy. Sports writing can be \nparticularly challenging, but when done well it can be some of the best \njournalistic writing there is. Rick Hummel does it well.\n  Those who know Hummel best call him the ``Commish'' a nickname he \nearned by organizing the newsroom's softball and bowling league teams. \nOver the years, the moniker has taken on deeper meaning. Today, it \nserves as a nod to his extensive knowledge of the game of baseball and \nas a tribute to his venerable career.\n  Rick Hummel was born and raised in Quincy, IL. He graduated from \nQuincy High School in 1964, went on to earn a degree from the \nUniversity of Missouri School of Journalism, and then served in the \nU.S. Army for 3 years.\n  Hummel joined the staff of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 1971. At \nthe Post-Dispatch, he learned the ropes, as many sportswriters do, by \ncovering high school athletics. Hummel was given his first chance to \nwrite about the World Champion St. Louis Cardinals in 1973. By 1978, \ncovering the Cardinals was Hummel's full-time job. He spent the next 24 \nyears as a beat reporter and continues to write for the Post-Dispatch \nas a regular columnist.\n  Hummel is passionate about baseball, but as a writer he is known for \nhis uncomplicated style and humility, as well as his ability to work \nwith players, coaches, and managers alike.\n  Hummel was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1980 and the National \nSportswriters and Sportscasters Association named him Missouri \nSportswriter of the Year on four separate occasions.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \ncity of Erlanger, KY, which is the recipient of the 2006 Award for \nMunicipal Excellence at the National League of Cities' Congress of \nCities. This city's Tiered Advanced Life Support System Program for \nEmergency Medical Services earned Erlanger the Gold Award, which is \npresented to cities that have a population below 50,000 people. By \nwinning this prestigious award, the Erlanger Fire Department and \nEmergency Medical Services, EMS, team exhibit the power of hard work as \nwell as their dedication to their community while serving as an example \nto the rest of the United States.\n  Since 1989, the goal of the Awards for Municipal Excellence has been \nto recognize cities that improve the lives of citizens in their \ncommunities. These awards identify and feature outstanding city and \ntown programs that show innovation in enhancing the quality of life in \nAmerica's communities.\n  The fire department and city of Erlanger recognize the need to have \nparamedic response and transport capabilities for the safety and \nwelfare of the citizens in its community of 17,000 people. After \ndebating several options, they found a fire service-based EMS delivery \nmodel that was affordable and could be enacted immediately. This model \nprovides two cross-trained EMS firefighters on a transport rescue unit, \nfollowed by a cross-trained firefighter paramedic in a staff car who \ncan assist and ride in the rescue ambulance with the patient. If the \npatient does not need advanced life support, the paramedic is ready to \nrespond immediately to the next emergency call. This model delivers the \nbest medical care available and keeps more firefighters on the street \nto deliver the highest quality fire protection. This joint partnership \nhas made a positive difference in both fire and EMS delivery services \nin the community of Erlanger.\n  I congratulate the city of Erlanger, KY, for receiving this Award for \nMunicipal Excellence. By using an innovative approach to address an \nimportant community need, they have created this outstanding program. \nThis cutting-edge approach to community emergency response shines as a \nmodel for all communities in Kentucky and the United States. This is a \ntrue example of Kentucky at its finest and a leadership example to the \nentire Commonwealth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/23/senate-section/article/S906-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JANE BOLIN\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I honor the life and legacy \nof Ms. Jane Bolin.\n  Jane Matilda Bolin of Queens, NY, passed away on Monday, January 8, \n2007 after a lifetime of public service. In 1939, Ms. Bolin was the \nfirst Black woman to become a judge in the United States, and she \ncontinued to serve honorably on the bench for the next 40 years. Her \nlifelong dedication to social justice, civil rights, and to the \nbetterment of our American society serves as an inspiration to us all.\n  A trailblazer in so many arenas, Ms. Bolin pursued her goals in the \nface of widespread discrimination and prejudice. She was the first \nBlack woman to graduate from Yale Law School, the first to join the New \nYork City Bar Association, and the first to work in the city's legal \ndepartment. In addition to being a fellow Yale Law graduate, she and I \nalso share the same undergraduate alma mater. Ms. Bolin attended \nWellesley College in the 1920s as one of only two Black freshmen. She \nwent on to graduate as a Wellesley Scholar, an honor given only to the \ntop 20 students in her class.\n  Ms. Bolin's tenacity set a powerful example for the women of my \ngeneration. In 1958, she commented on the struggle for women's rights \nthat ``we have to fight every inch of the way and in the face of \nsometimes insufferable humiliations.'' And Ms. Bolin never stopped \nfighting. She spoke out against segregation in her native Pougkheepsie. \nShe used her position on the bench to end the assignment of probation \nofficers and the placement of children in childcare agencies on the \nbasis of race. As a family court judge, she heard cases ranging from \nhomicides and battered spouses to child support and paternity suits.\n  Jane Bolin was truly a remarkable woman.\n  I offer my deepest sympathies to her son, Yorke B. Mizzle, and to all \nthose whose lives she enriched. My thoughts and prayers are with her \nfamily during this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/23/senate-section/article/S906-4", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S906-S907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JOHN AND JILL MAHAN\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to John and \nJill Mahan, an exceptional young couple from Kentucky who are the \nrecipients of the American Farm Bureau Young Farmers and Ranchers \nNational Achievement Award. By winning this prestigious award, the \nMahans exhibited an unprecedented passion and skill for farming, \nbeating out competition from across the United States.\n  The American Farm Bureau Young Farmers and Ranchers National\n\n[[Page S907]]\n\nAchievement Award is presented to young farmers and ranchers across the \nUnited States who demonstrate knowledge and achievement in agriculture, \nas well as a steadfast strength and goal of promoting the agricultural \ncommunity. With the average age of American farmers increasing steadily \nas the years go by, it is refreshing to see a young couple like the \nMahans embrace the financial and labor-intensive plight that is common \nin the field of agriculture.\n  The Mahans own 523 acres of a 2,000-acre farm near their home in \nLexington, KY. With the changing needs facing farmers, they quickly \nlearned to diversify their production options and create alternatives \nfor income. Currently, the Mahans produce burley tobacco, beef cattle, \nwheat, soybeans, corn, and alfalfa. This forward-thinking approach to \nthe ever-changing agriculture market is a clear reason this couple \nexperiences continued success in their farming career.\n  I congratulate John and Jill Mahan on this prestigious award from the \nAmerican Farm Bureau. By winning this national award, they have shown \nthe rest of the Nation the strength of the agricultural community in \nKentucky along with their personal dedication to their remarkable \ncareers in farming. They are true examples of Kentucky at its \nfinest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/23/senate-section/article/S907-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:09 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 390.

Tonight, I have a high privilege and distinct \nhonor of my own--as the first President to begin the State of the Union \nmessage with these words: Madam Speaker.\n  In his day, the late Congressman Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., from \nBaltimore, Maryland, saw Presidents Roosevelt and Truman at this \nrostrum. But nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter, \nNancy, presiding tonight as Speaker of the House of Representatives. \nCongratulations.\n  Two members of the House and Senate are not with us tonight--and we \npray for the recovery and speedy return of Senator Tim Johnson and \nCongressman Charlie Norwood.\n  Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, \ndistinguished guests, and fellow citizens:\n  This rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour--when \ndecisions are hard and courage is tested. We enter the year 2007 with \nlarge endeavors underway, and others that are ours to begin. In all of \nthis, much is asked of us. We must have the will to face difficult \nchallenges and determined enemies--and the wisdom to face them \ntogether.\n  Some in this Chamber are new to the House and Senate--and I \ncongratulate the Democratic majority. Congress has changed, but our \nresponsibilities have not. Each of us is guided by our own \nconvictions--and to these we must stay faithful. Yet we are all held to \nthe same standards, and called to serve the same good purposes: To \nextend this Nation's prosperity . . . to spend the people's money \nwisely . . . to solve problems, not leave them to future generations . \n. . to guard America against all evil, and to keep faith with those we \nhave sent forth to defend us.\n  We are not the first to come here with government divided and \nuncertainty in the air. Like many before us, we can work through our \ndifferences and achieve big things for the American people. Our \ncitizens don't much care which side of the aisle we sit on--as long as \nwe are willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done. Our \njob is to make life better for our fellow Americans, and help them to \nbuild a future of hope and opportunity--and this is the business before \nus tonight.\n  A future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy--and \nthat is what we have. We are now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job \ngrowth--in a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs . . . so \nfar. Unemployment is low, inflation is low, and wages are rising. This \neconomy is on the move--and our job is to keep it that way, not with \nmore government but with more enterprise.\n  Next week, I will deliver a full report on the state of our economy. \nTonight, I want to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be \npriorities for this Congress.\n  First, we must balance the Federal budget. We can do so without \nraising taxes. What we need to do is impose spending discipline in \nWashington, D.C. We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009--\nand met that goal 3 years ahead of schedule. Now let us take the next \nstep. In the coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the \nFederal deficit within the next 5 years. I ask you to make the same \ncommitment. Together, we can restrain the spending appetite of the \nFederal Government, and balance the Federal budget.\n  Next, there is the matter of earmarks. These special interest items \nare often slipped into bills at the last hour--when not even C-SPAN is \nwatching. In 2005 alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and \ntotaled nearly $18 billion. Even worse, over 90 percent of earmarks \nnever make it to the floor of the House and Senate--they are dropped \ninto Committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives \non my desk. You did not vote them into law. I did not sign them into \nlaw. Yet they are treated as if they have the force of law. The time \nhas come to end this practice. So let us work together to reform the \nbudget process . . . expose every earmark to the light of day and to a \nvote in Congress, and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in \nhalf by the end of this session.\n\n  Finally, to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of \nentitlements. Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are commitments \nof conscience--and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound. \nYet we are failing in that duty--and this failure will one day leave \nour children with three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, \nor huge and immediate cuts in benefits. Everyone in this Chamber knows \nthis to be true--yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act. \nSo let us work together and do it now. With enough good sense and good \nwill, you and I can fix Medicare and Medicaid--and save Social \nSecurity.\n  Spreading opportunity and hope in America also requires public \nschools that give children the knowledge and character they need in \nlife. Five years ago, we rose above partisan differences to pass the No \nChild Left Behind Act--preserving local control, raising standards in \npublic schools, and holding those schools accountable for results. And \nbecause we acted, students are performing better in reading and math, \nand minority students are closing the achievement gap.\n\n[[Page S908]]\n\n  Now the task is to build on this success, without watering down \nstandards . . . without taking control from local communities . . . and \nwithout backsliding and calling it reform. We can lift student \nachievement even higher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn \naround failing schools . . . and by giving families with children stuck \nin failing schools the right to choose something better. We must \nincrease funds for students who struggle--and make sure these children \nget the special help they need. And we can make sure our children are \nprepared for the jobs of the future, and our country is more \ncompetitive, by strengthening math and science skills. The No Child \nLeft Behind Act has worked for America's children--and I ask Congress \nto reauthorize this good law.\n  A future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have \naffordable and available health care. When it comes to health care, \ngovernment has an obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled, and \npoor children. We will meet those responsibilities. For all other \nAmericans, private health insurance is the best way to meet their \nneeds. But many Americans cannot afford a health insurance policy.\n  Tonight, I propose two new initiatives to help more Americans afford \ntheir own insurance. First, I propose a standard tax deduction for \nhealth insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for \ndependents. Families with health insurance will pay no income or \npayroll taxes on $15,000 of their income. Single Americans with health \ninsurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $7,500 of their \nincome. With this reform, more than 100 million men, women, and \nchildren who are now covered by employer-provided insurance will \nbenefit from lower tax bills.\n  At the same time, this reform will level the playing field for those \nwho do not get health insurance through their job. For Americans who \nnow purchase health insurance on their own, my proposal would mean a \nsubstantial tax savings--$4,500 for a family of four making $60,000 a \nyear. And for the millions of other Americans who have no health \ninsurance at all, this deduction would help put a basic private health \ninsurance plan within their reach. Changing the tax code is a vital and \nnecessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans.\n\n  My second proposal is to help the States that are coming up with \ninnovative ways to cover the uninsured. States that make basic private \nhealth insurance available to all their citizens should receive Federal \nfunds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick. I \nhave asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with \nCongress to take existing Federal funds and use them to create \n``Affordable Choices'' grants. These grants would give our Nation's \nGovernors more money and more flexibility to get private health \ninsurance to those most in need.\n  There are many other ways that Congress can help. We need to expand \nHealth Savings Accounts . . . help small businesses through Association \nHealth Plans . . . reduce costs and medical errors with better \ninformation technology, encourage price transparency . . . and protect \ngood doctors from junk lawsuits by passing medical liability reform. \nAnd in all we do, we must remember that the best health care decisions \nare made not by government and insurance companies, but by patients and \ntheir doctors.\n  Extending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration \nsystem worthy of America--with laws that are fair and borders that are \nsecure. When laws and borders are routinely violated, this harms the \ninterests of our country. To secure our border, we are doubling the \nsize of the Border Patrol--and funding new infrastructure and \ntechnology.\n  Yet even with all these steps, we cannot fully secure the border \nunless we take pressure off the border--and that requires a temporary \nworker program. We should establish a legal and orderly path for \nforeign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis. As a \nresult, they won't have to try to sneak in--and that will leave border \nagents free to chase down drug smugglers, and criminals, and \nterrorists. We will enforce our immigration laws at the worksite, and \ngive employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers--\nso there is no excuse left for violating the law. We need to uphold the \ngreat tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new \narrivals. And we need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants \nwho are already in our country--without animosity and without amnesty.\n  Convictions run deep in this Capitol when it comes to immigration. \nLet us have a serious, civil, and conclusive debate--so that you can \npass, and I can sign, comprehensive immigration reform into law.\n  Extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy \nthat keeps America's economy running and America's environment clean. \nFor too long, our Nation has been dependent on foreign oil. And this \ndependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes, and to \nterrorists--who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments . . . \nraise the price of oil . . . and do great harm to our economy.\n  It is in our vital interest to diversify America's energy supply--and \nthe way forward is through technology. We must continue changing the \nway America generates electric power--by even greater use of clean coal \ntechnology . . . solar and wind energy . . . and clean, safe nuclear \npower. We need to press on with battery research for plug-in and hybrid \nvehicles, and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel \nfuel. We must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol--\nusing everything from wood chips, to grasses, to agricultural wastes.\n\n  We have made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies in Washington \nand the strong response of the market. Now even more dramatic advances \nare within reach. Tonight, I ask Congress to join me in pursuing a \ngreat goal. Let us build on the work we have done and reduce gasoline \nusage in the United States by 20 percent in the next 10 years--thereby \ncutting our total imports by the equivalent of 3/4 of all the oil we \nnow import from the Middle East.\n  To reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels, \nby setting a mandatory Fuels Standard to require 35 billion gallons of \nrenewable and alternative fuels in 2017--this is nearly 5 times the \ncurrent target. At the same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel \neconomy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks--and \nconserve up to 8.5 billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017.\n  Achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil, but will not eliminate it. So as we continue \nto diversify our fuel supply, we must also step up domestic oil \nproduction in environmentally sensitive ways. And to further protect \nAmerica against severe disruptions to our oil supply, I ask Congress to \ndouble the current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will \nenable us to live our lives less dependent on oil. These technologies \nwill help us become better stewards of the environment--and they will \nhelp us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change.\n  A future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, impartial system of \njustice. The lives of citizens across our Nation are affected by the \noutcome of cases pending in our Federal courts. And we have a shared \nobligation to ensure that the Federal courts have enough judges to hear \nthose cases and deliver timely rulings. As President, I have a duty to \nnominate qualified men and women to vacancies on the Federal bench. And \nthe United States Senate has a duty as well--to give those nominees a \nfair hearing, and a prompt up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.\n  For all of us in this room, there is no higher responsibility than to \nprotect the people of this country from danger. Five years have come \nand gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that terrorists \ncan cause. We have had time to take stock of our situation. We have \nadded many critical protections to guard the homeland. We know with \ncertainty that the horrors of that September morning were just a \nglimpse of what the terrorists intend for us--unless we stop them.\n  With the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of \nconflict and the course we have followed. Such debates are essential \nwhen a great democracy faces great questions. Yet one question has \nsurely been settled--that to win the war on terror we must take the \nfight to the enemy.\n\n[[Page S909]]\n\n  From the start, America and our allies have protected our people by \nstaying on the offense. The enemy knows that the days of comfortable \nsanctuary, easy movement, steady financing, and free-flowing \ncommunications are long over. For the terrorists, life since 9/11 has \nnever been the same.\n  Our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not \nhappen. We cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our \nallies have prevented--but here is some of what we do know: We stopped \nan al Qaeda plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building \non the West Coast. We broke up a Southeast Asian terrorist cell \ngrooming operatives for attacks inside the United States. We uncovered \nan al Qaeda cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against \nAmerica. And just last August, British authorities uncovered a plot to \nblow up passenger planes bound for America over the Atlantic Ocean. For \neach life saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public \nservants who devote their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping \nthem.\n\n  Every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless \nambitions of this enemy. The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is \nstill at work in the world. And so long as that is the case, America is \nstill a Nation at war.\n  In the minds of the terrorists, this war began well before September \n11, and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled. And these \npast 5 years have given us a much clearer view of the nature of this \nenemy. Al Qaeda and its followers are Sunni extremists, possessed by \nhatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology. Take almost any \nprinciple of civilization, and their goal is the opposite. They preach \nwith threats . . . instruct with bullets and bombs . . . and promise \nparadise for the murder of the innocent.\n  Our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions. They want to \noverthrow moderate governments and establish safe havens from which to \nplan and carry out new attacks on our country. By killing and \nterrorizing Americans, they want to force our country to retreat from \nthe world and abandon the cause of liberty. They would then be free to \nimpose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology. Listen to \nthis warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi: ``We will sacrifice our \nblood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is \neven worse.'' And Osama bin Laden declared: ``Death is better than \nliving on this Earth with the unbelievers among us.''\n  These men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in \nthe Islamist radical movement. In recent times, it has also become \nclear that we face an escalating danger from Shia extremists who are \njust as hostile to America, and are also determined to dominate the \nMiddle East. Many are known to take direction from the regime in Iran, \nwhich is funding and arming terrorists like Hezbollah--a group second \nonly to al Qaeda in the American lives it has taken.\n  The Shia and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same \ntotalitarian threat. But whatever slogans they chant, when they \nslaughter the innocent, they have the same wicked purposes. They want \nto kill Americans . . . kill democracy in the Middle East . . . and \ngain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale.\n  In the 6th year since our Nation was attacked, I wish I could report \nto you that the dangers have ended. They have not. And so it remains \nthe policy of this Government to use every lawful and proper tool of \nintelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do our \nduty, to find these enemies, and to protect the American people.\n  This war is more than a clash of arms--it is a decisive ideological \nstruggle, and the security of our Nation is in the balance. To prevail, \nwe must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred, and drove 19 \nmen to get onto airplanes and come to kill us. What every terrorist \nfears most is human freedom--societies where men and women make their \nown choices, answer to their own conscience, and live by their hopes \ninstead of their resentments. Free people are not drawn to violent and \nmalignant ideologies--and most will choose a better way when they are \ngiven a chance. So we advance our own security interests by helping \nmoderates, reformers, and brave voices for democracy. The great \nquestion of our day is whether America will help men and women in the \nMiddle East to build free societies and share in the rights of all \nhumanity. And I say, for the sake of our own security . . . we must.\n\n  In the last 2 years, we have seen the desire for liberty in the \nbroader Middle East--and we have been sobered by the enemy's fierce \nreaction. In 2005, the world watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised \nthe banner of the Cedar Revolution . . . drove out the Syrian occupiers \n. . . and chose new leaders in free elections. In 2005, the people of \nAfghanistan defied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature. \nAnd in 2005, the Iraqi people held three national elections--choosing a \ntransitional government . . . adopting the most progressive, democratic \nconstitution in the Arab world . . . and then electing a government \nunder that constitution. Despite endless threats from the killers in \ntheir midst, nearly 12 million Iraqi citizens came out to vote in a \nshow of hope and solidarity we should never forget.\n  A thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics, \nand in 2006 they struck back. In Lebanon, assassins took the life of \nPierre Gemayel, a prominent participant in the Cedar Revolution. And \nHezbollah terrorists, with support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict \nin the region and are seeking to undermine Lebanon's legitimately \nelected government. In Afghanistan, Taliban and al Qaeda fighters tried \nto regain power by regrouping and engaging Afghan and NATO forces. In \nIraq, al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists blew up one of the most \nsacred places in Shia Islam--the Golden Mosque of Samarra. This \natrocity, directed at a Muslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke \nretaliation from Iraqi Shia--and it succeeded. Radical Shia elements, \nsome of whom receive support from Iran, formed death squads. The result \nwas a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues \nto this day.\n  This is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we are \nin. Every one of us wishes that this war were over and won. Yet it \nwould not be like us to leave our promises unkept, our friends \nabandoned, and our own security at risk. Ladies and gentlemen: On this \nday, at this hour, it is still within our power to shape the outcome of \nthis battle. So let us find our resolve, and turn events toward \nvictory.\n  We are carrying out a new strategy in Iraq--a plan that demands more \nfrom Iraq's elected government, and gives our forces in Iraq the \nreinforcements they need to complete their mission. Our goal is a \ndemocratic Iraq that upholds the rule of law, respects the rights of \nits people, provides them security, and is an ally in the war on \nterror.\n  In order to make progress toward this goal, the Iraqi government must \nstop the sectarian violence in its capital. But the Iraqis are not yet \nready to do this on their own. So we are deploying reinforcements of \nmore than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq. The vast \nmajority will go to Baghdad, where they will help Iraqi forces to clear \nand secure neighborhoods and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army \nunits. With Iraqis in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by \nchasing down terrorists, insurgents, and roaming death squads. And in \nAnbar province--where al Qaeda terrorists have gathered and local \nforces have begun showing a willingness to fight them--we are sending \nan additional 4,000 United States Marines, with orders to find the \nterrorists and clear them out. We did not drive al Qaeda out of their \nsafe haven in Afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in a \nfree Iraq.\n\n  The people of Iraq want to live in peace, and now is the time for \ntheir government to act. Iraq's leaders know that our commitment is not \nopen ended. They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to \nsecure Baghdad--and they must do so. They have pledged that they will \nconfront violent radicals of any faction or political party. They need \nto follow through, and lift needless restrictions on Iraqi and \nCoalition forces, so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing \nsecurity to all of the people of Baghdad. Iraq's leaders have committed \nthemselves to a series of benchmarks to achieve reconciliation--to\n\n[[Page S910]]\n\nshare oil revenues among all of Iraq's citizens . . . to put the wealth \nof Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq . . . to allow more Iraqis to re-\nenter their nation's civic life . . . to hold local elections . . . and \nto take responsibility for security in every Iraqi province. But for \nall of this to happen, Baghdad must be secured. And our plan will help \nthe Iraqi government take back its capital and make good on its \ncommitments.\n  My fellow citizens, our military commanders and I have carefully \nweighed the options. We discussed every possible approach. In the end, \nI chose this course of action because it provides the best chance of \nsuccess. Many in this Chamber understand that America must not fail in \nIraq--because you understand that the consequences of failure would be \ngrievous and far reaching.\n  If American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi \ngovernment would be overrun by extremists on all sides. We could expect \nan epic battle between Shia extremists backed by Iran, and Sunni \nextremists aided by al Qaeda and supporters of the old regime. A \ncontagion of violence could spill out across the country--and in time \nthe entire region could be drawn into the conflict.\n  For America, this is a nightmare scenario. For the enemy, this is the \nobjective. Chaos is their greatest ally in this struggle. And out of \nchaos in Iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens . . \n. new recruits . . . new resources . . . and an even greater \ndetermination to harm America. To allow this to happen would be to \nignore the lessons of September 11 and invite tragedy. And ladies and \ngentlemen, nothing is more important at this moment in our history than \nfor America to succeed in the Middle East . . . to succeed in Iraq . . \n. and to spare the American people from this danger.\n  This is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now. I have \nspoken with many of you in person. I respect you and the arguments you \nhave made. We went into this largely united--in our assumptions, and in \nour convictions. And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for \nfailure. Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq--and I ask you \nto give it a chance to work. And I ask you to support our troops in the \nfield--and those on their way.\n  The war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will \ncontinue long after you and I have turned our duties over to others. \nThat is why it is important to work together so our Nation can see this \ngreat effort through. Both parties and both branches should work in \nclose consultation. And this is why I propose to establish a special \nadvisory council on the war on terror, made up of leaders in Congress \nfrom both political parties. We will share ideas for how to position \nAmerica to meet every challenge that confronts us. And we will show our \nenemies abroad that we are united in the goal of victory.\n  One of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of \nour military--so that the American Armed Forces are ready for all the \nchallenges ahead. Tonight I ask the Congress to authorize an increase \nin the size of our active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 in the next 5 \nyears. A second task we can take on together is to design and establish \na volunteer Civilian Reserve Corps. Such a corps would function much \nlike our military reserve. It would ease the burden on the Armed Forces \nby allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on \nmissions abroad when America needs them. And it would give people \nacross America who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the \ndefining struggle of our time.\n  Americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle--\nbecause we are not in this struggle alone. We have a diplomatic \nstrategy that is rallying the world to join in the fight against \nextremism. In Iraq, multinational forces are operating under a mandate \nfrom the United Nations--and we are working with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, \nEgypt, and the Gulf States to increase support for Iraq's government. \nThe United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran, and made it clear \nthat the world will not allow the regime in Tehran to acquire nuclear \nweapons. With the other members of the Quartet--the U.N., the European \nUnion, and Russia--we are pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the \nHoly Land, and pursuing the establishment of a democratic Palestinian \nstate living side-by-side with Israel in peace and security. In \nAfghanistan, NATO has taken the lead in turning back the Taliban and al \nQaeda offensive--the first time the Alliance has deployed forces \noutside the North Atlantic area. Together with our partners in China, \nJapan, Russia, and South Korea, we are pursuing intensive diplomacy to \nachieve a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons. And we will \ncontinue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like Cuba, \nBelarus, and Burma--and continue to awaken the conscience of the world \nto save the people of Darfur.\n  American foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy. \nOur work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: To whom much \nis given, much is required. We hear the call to take on the challenges \nof hunger, poverty, and disease--and that is precisely what America is \ndoing. We must continue to fight HIV/AIDS, especially on the continent \nof Africa--and because you funded our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, \nthe number of people receiving life-saving drugs has grown from 50,000 \nto more than 800,000 in 3 short years. I ask you to continue funding \nour efforts to fight HIV/AIDS. I ask you to provide $1.2 billion over 5 \nyears so we can combat malaria in 15 African countries. I ask that you \nfund the Millennium Challenge Account, so that American aid reaches the \npeople who need it, in nations where democracy is on the rise and \ncorruption is in retreat. And let us continue to support the expanded \ntrade and debt relief that are the best hope for lifting lives and \neliminating poverty.\n  When America serves others in this way, we show the strength and \ngenerosity of our country. These deeds reflect the character of our \npeople. The greatest strength we have is the heroic kindness, courage, \nand self-sacrifice of the American people. You see this spirit often if \nyou know where to look--and tonight we need only look above to the \ngallery.\n  Dikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa, amid great poverty and disease. He \ncame to Georgetown University on a scholarship to study medicine--but \nCoach John Thompson got a look at Dikembe and had a different idea. \nDikembe became a star in the NBA, and a citizen of the United States. \nBut he never forgot the land of his birth--or the duty to share his \nblessings with others. He has built a brand new hospital in his \nhometown. A friend has said of this good-hearted man: ``Mutombo \nbelieves that God has given him this opportunity to do great things.'' \nAnd we are proud to call this son of the Congo our fellow American.\n\n  After her daughter was born, Julie Aigner-Clark searched for ways to \nshare her love of music and art with her child. So she borrowed some \nequipment, and began filming children's videos in her basement. The \nBaby Einstein Company was born--and in just 5 years her business grew \nto more than $20 million in sales. In November 2001, Julie sold Baby \nEinstein to the Walt Disney Company, and with her help Baby Einstein \nhas grown into a $200 million business. Julie represents the great \nenterprising spirit of America. And she is using her success to help \nothers--producing child safety videos with John Walsh of the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children. Julie says of her new \nproject: ``I believe it is the most important thing that live ever \ndone. I believe that children have the right to live in a world that is \nsafe.'' We are pleased to welcome this talented business entrepreneur \nand generous social entrepreneur--Julie Aigner-Clark.\n  Three weeks ago, Wesley Autrey was waiting at a Harlem subway station \nwith his two little girls, when he saw a man fall into the path of a \ntrain. With seconds to act, Wesley jumped onto the tracks . . . pulled \nthe man into a space between the rails . . . and held him as the train \npassed right above their heads. He insists he's not a hero. Wesley \nsays: ``We got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our \nfreedoms. We got to show each other some love.'' There is something \nwonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man like \nWesley Autrey.\n  Tommy Rieman was a teenager pumping gas in Independence, Kentucky, \nwhen he enlisted in the United States Army. In December 2003, he was on \na reconnaissance mission in Iraq when his team came under heavy enemy \nfire. From his Humvee, Sergeant Rieman returned fire--and used\n\n[[Page S911]]\n\nhis body as a shield to protect his gunner. He was shot in the chest \nand arm, and received shrapnel wounds to his legs--yet he refused \nmedical attention, and stayed in the fight. He helped to repel a second \nattack, firing grenades at the enemy's position. For his exceptional \ncourage, Sergeant Rieman was awarded the Silver Star. And like so many \nother Americans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned the \nrespect and gratitude of our whole country.\n  In such courage and compassion, ladies and gentlemen, we see the \nspirit and character of America--and these qualities are not in short \nsupply. This is a decent and honorable country--and resilient, too. We \nhave been through a lot together. We have met challenges and faced \ndangers, and we know that more lie ahead. Yet we can go forward with \nconfidence--because the State of our Union is strong . . . our cause in \nthe world is right . . . and tonight that cause goes on.\n  Thank you.\n                                                      George W.

          \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 360. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nexpenses which qualify for the Hope Scholarship Credit and to make the \nHope Scholarship Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit refundable; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Smith to \nintroduce the Greater Access To Education, or GATE Act, of 2007. This \nlegislation would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in order to \nmake college more affordable, and thus provide greater access to \npostsecondary education for lower income students and working families. \nSimply put, this bill would expand expenses which qualify for the Hope \nScholarship Credit, prevent aid for needy students from reducing the \ncredit, and make the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning Credits \nrefundable.\n  The cost of attending college in the U.S. has grown by 44 percent \nsince 2000, far outpacing the median growth in income. We've seen a 35 \npercent jump in inflation-adjusted average tuition and fees for in-\nstate students at public colleges and universities since 2001-02. The \ncost of going to college is 6.3 percent higher than just last year, \naveraging $12,796 including room and board.\n  Unfortunately, year after year, Congress has failed to raise Pell \nGrant Scholarships for needy students. This critical student aid has \nbeen frozen at just over $4000 for four years. Ten years ago, the \nmaximum Pell Grant covered more than 50 percent of the cost of tuition, \nfees, room and board at a public four-year college. Last year, it \ncovered only 35 percent of those costs.\n  At the same time, we're seeing increasing competition among colleges \nand universities for the highest scoring students. And these students \ncommand higher tuition discounts, particularly in the form of merit \nscholarships. As a result, there's a smaller proportion of the \nfinancial aid budget available for low income students at colleges with \nrising tuitions.\n  A recent report by Education Trust found that many of the flagship \nand research-extensive public universities have reallocated financial \naid resources away from the low income students who need help to go to \ncollege--mostly to compete for high income students who would enroll in \ncollege regardless of the amount of aid they receive. Between 1995 and \n2003, flagship and other research-extensive public universities \nactually decreased grant aid by 13 percent for students from families \nwith an annual income of $20,000 or less while they increased aid to \nstudents from families who make more than $100,000 by 406 percent. In \n2003, these institutions spent a combined $257 million to subsidize the \ntuition of students from families with annual incomes over $100,000--a \nstaggering increase from the $50 million they spent in 1995.\n  In addition, many colleges and universities are now using \n``enrollment and revenue management'' firms to help manage admissions \nand financial aid. I am concerned that too many schools are trying to \nleverage their financial aid to entice wealthier and high scoring \nstudents to attend their schools, at the expense of aid to lower\n\n[[Page S913]]\n\nincome students. In essence, they're directing financial aid dollars to \nstudents who will increase a school's revenues and rankings.\n  As a result, low income students are disproportionately bearing the \nbrunt of increased college tuition and fees. In turn, more and more \nstudents increasingly rely on loans to finance their education. And, \nwe've seen a significant increase in the amount of student debt in this \ncountry. In New Mexico, the average student now graduates from 4 years \nof college with more than $16,000 in debt.\n  And, last year, Congress cut $12 billion out of the Federal student \naid programs, pushing college further out of reach for American \nfamilies. It is the largest single cut the Federal Government has made \nto student aid programs, and it is expected to increase the debt burden \nof students and their families as many borrowers of student loans will \nface higher interest payments.\n  Congress, simply, has moved in the wrong direction, and failed to \nhelp make college more affordable for students from low income and \nworking families.\n  Full time students receive about $3,100 per year in aid in the form \nof grants and tax benefits at 4-year public institutions. In 2003-04, \nhowever, only 56 percent of 4-year public institution students from \nfamilies with incomes below $30,000 received sufficient grant aid and \ntax benefits to cover tuition and fees.\n  Even worse, we know that each year there are hundreds of thousands of \nstudents who are prepared to attend a 4-year college but do not do so \nbecause of financial barriers.\n  We must reverse this course and make college more affordable for \nstudents from low-income and working families.\n  The first priority for this Congress should be to increase student \naid for needy students. We must increase the amount of Pell grants to \nat least $5,100.\n  The next thing we should do is make sure that the existing education \ntax credits work effectively for the families that need them most. The \nHope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credits have helped millions \nof Americans finance their college education. For this tax year, the \ncredits allow eligible tax filers to reduce their tax liability by \nreceiving a credit of up to $1,650 for the Hope program or up to $2,000 \nfor the Lifetime Learning credit for tuition and course-related fees \npaid for a single student.\n  Unfortunately, research shows that these tax credits are not working \nas effectively as they could be. They do not support students who are \ncurrently enrolled in college to any significant degree, and they do \nnot induce greater numbers of students, including working adults who \nneed to upgrade their education and skills, to earn a postsecondary \ndegree.\n  Many students and their families are unable to take advantage of the \nmaximum amount of the credit because it is limited to covering \n``tuition and related expenses.'' Students who attend colleges with \nlower tuition costs, such as those attending community colleges, are \nnot entitled to the maximum amount of the credit.\n  For college students attending institutions with relatively high \ntuition rates, the maximum credit will be available to cover the higher \ntuition. This is not the case, however, for many students, particularly \nthe vast majority of community college students, as well as hundreds of \nthousands of students attending public four-year colleges, who attend \ncollege where the tuition is lower. These students are not able to \naccess the full credit because tuition at these institutions is lower \nthan the maximum credit, and the scope of the credit is limited to \ntuition and related expenses. College students must pay for much more \nthan just tuition, however, including room and board, books, supplies, \nequipment and fees.\n  Further, a student's eligibility for the Hope tax credit is actually \nreduced by any grants the student receives--Federal, State, or private. \nThe impact of this limitation is felt particularly by the by the low \nincome students that receive Pell Grants or other Federal or State \nassistance. Often, the assistance received fully offsets the amount of \nthe credit.\n  This legislation is simple and straightforward, and is crafted to \naddress these shortcomings. First, in addition to tuition, it allows \nthe Hope credit to cover room and board, required fees, books, \nsupplies, and equipment. It is important to note that the IRS Code \ncommonly recognizes non-tuition expenses, including substantial living \nexpenses, in programs such as Section 529 plans and tax-exempt, pre-\npaid tuition plans.\n  As we all know, tuition is just one of the many expenses associated \nwith going to college. Room and board, books, supplies, equipment and \nfees can be prohibitively expensive for those who attend colleges that \nhave reasonable tuition charges. The cost for books and supplies alone \ncan be as high as $1000 per year.\n  In addition, the legislation changes the IRS Code so that any Federal \nPell Grants and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants students \nreceive are not counted against their eligible expenses when Hope \neligibility is calculated. This change will provide some assistance to \nneedier students, especially those attending four-year public colleges.\n  But these fixes only get to a part of the problem. Because the \neducation tax credits are not refundable, a family of four must earn \nabove $30,000 to get the maximum credit. A student or working family \nmust have a positive tax liability to receive the credit. Nearly half \nof all families with college students do not get the full credit \nbecause their income is too low.\n  In fact, only 36 percent of filers claiming the credits at all had \nincomes under $30,000; less than 10 percent of filers claiming the \ncredits had incomes under $15,000. By contrast, 36 percent of filers \nclaiming the credits earned $50,000 or more.\n  Making the credits refundable would ensure that families in lower tax \nbrackets are eligible for the maximum benefits and would thus make \ncollege more affordable to those students and families who need the \nmost assistance.\n  I believe we all can agree that maintaining a skilled and educated \nworkforce should rank as one of our highest priorities. The National \nAcademy of Sciences projected that while the U.S. economy is doing well \ntoday, current trends indicate that the U.S. may not fare as well in \nthe future, particularly in the areas of science and technology, where \ninnovation is spurred and high-wage jobs follow.\n  This Congress should do everything in its power to ensure that every \ncapable student who wants to go to college should be able to, which \nwill in turn ensure that we have workers to fill the high-quality, \nhigh-wage jobs we are working so hard to create. I urge my colleagues \nto support this critical legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 360\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

(for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 361. A bill to designate the United States courthouse at South \nFederal Place in Santa Fe, New Mexico, as the ``Santiago E. Campos \nUnited States Courthouse''; to the Committee on environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nDomenici to introduce a bill to designate the United States Courthouse \nin Santa Fe, NM as the ``Honorable Santiago E. Campos United States \nCourthouse.'' Santiago Campos was appointed to the Federal bench in \n1978 by President Jimmy Carter and was the first Hispanic Federal judge \nin New Mexico. He held the title of Chief U.S. District Judge from \nFebruary 5, 1987 to December 31, 1989 and took senior status in 1992.\n  Judge Campos was a dedicated and passionate public servant who spent \nmost of his life committed to working for the people of New Mexico and \nour Nation. He served as a seaman first class in the United States Navy \nfrom 1944 to 1946, as the Assistant Attorney General and then First \nAssistant Attorney General of New Mexico from 1954 to 1957, and as a \ndistrict court judge from 1971 to 1978 in the First Judicial District \nin the State of New Mexico. He was the prime mover in reestablishing \nFederal court judicial activity in Santa Fe and had his chambers in the \ncourthouse there for over 22 years. For his dedication to the State, \nJudge Campos received distinguished achievement awards in 1993 from \nboth the State Bar of New Mexico and the University of New Mexico.\n  Sadly, Judge Campos passed away January 20, 2001 after a long battle \nwith cancer. Judge Campos was an extraordinary jurist and served as a \nrole model and mentor to others in New Mexico. He was admired and \nrespected by all that knew him. I believe that it would be an \nappropriate tribute to Judge Campos to have the courthouse in Santa Fe \nbear his name.\n  The Senate passed a bill in the 108th Congress to name the same \ncourthouse for Judge Campos by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, the \nHouse was unable to take up the measure and it failed to be signed into \nlaw. I rise again to ask the Senate to pass the bill and honor the work \nand dedication of Judge Santiago Campos.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 361\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.\n\n       The United States courthouse at South Federal Place in \n     Santa Fe, New Mexico, shall be known and designated as the \n     ``Santiago E. Campos United States Courthouse''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the United States \n     courthouse referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a \n     reference to the ``Santiago E. Campos United States \n     Courthouse''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 364. A bill to strengthen United States trade laws and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will help America's manufacturers compete on even terms with \nforeign manufacturers.\n  For generations, American manufacturing has been a tremendous source \nof pride and a ladder to the middle class. Unfortunately, over the last \nseveral years, the manufacturing sector of our economy has suffered \ndisproportionately and millions of good jobs have been lost. In my home \nState of West Virginia, well over 10,000 manufacturing jobs have \ndisappeared since 2001. Workers and manufacturers in all of our States \nhave found it increasingly difficult to compete in today's global \nmarkets, when the odds are stacked against them because of unfair \ntrading practices.\n  American industry can compete with anyone in the world when it's a \nfair fight. Our domestic and international trade laws were set up to \nestablish a level playing field, but unfortunately some of our trading \npartners have repeatedly found ways to circumvent these laws in order \nto gain an unfair advantage in trade with the United States. This has \nled to our record-breaking--and still growing--trade deficits, which \nthreaten the long-term health of our economy, and have contributed to \nthe migration of manufacturing jobs to factories overseas. This is an \nenormous problem that the United States must face and conquer.\n  A large part of the problem in recent years is that the Bush \nAdministration has not been an aggressive enforcer of U.S. domestic \ntrade laws. It has also failed to successfully advocate for U.S. \ninterests in the multilateral dispute settlement setting. The bill I \nintroduce today, the Strengthening America's Trade Law Act of 2007, \nwill improve our ability to correct deficiencies in four areas of U.S. \ntrade policy: first, it will address problems in the U.S. approach to \nthe WTO Dispute Settlement process; second, it will strengthen \nantidumping remedies, third, it will expand\n\n[[Page S915]]\n\nthe reach of countervailing duties, and fourth, it will remove the \nPresident's discretion to disregard the recommendations of the \nInternational Trade Commission in certain circumstances.\n  The steel industry is perhaps the best-known example of how our trade \nlaws can help or hurt domestic industry when it is injured by unfair \nforeign trade practices, but industries from timber to chinaware to \ncandlemaking are all too familiar with this point.\n  This bill contains a number of provisions that would provide \nmeaningful improvements to U.S. trade law. The United States would \nremain fully compliant with its obligations in the World Trade \nOrganization under this legislation.\n  Let me briefly describe what this bill will do to level the playing \nfield for American manufacturers.\n  Title I of the Strengthening America's Trade Laws Act bolsters the \nUnited States' position in WTO dispute settlement proceedings. The \ndispute settlement system set up in 1994 upon the creation of the WTO \nwas intended to establish a rules-based system of enforcing trade \nagreements. However, recent cases involving U.S. application of its \nlaws regarding import surges, anti-dumping and countervailing duties \nhave raised concerns about the fairness of the system.\n  To address these concerns, Title I allows the direct participation in \nWTO dispute settlement proceedings of the U.S. business and trade \nassociations that are directly affected by these proceedings, which \nwould improve the prospects of zealous advocacy on behalf of U.S. \ninterests at stake. It also creates a Congressional Advisory Commission \non WTO Dispute Settlement that would analyze WTO decisions that are \nadverse to the United States, report to Congress on the propriety of \nthe decisions and provide guidance for how the Congress might proceed \nin responding to adverse decisions.\n  Title I also requires Congressional approval of all measures taken by \nthe U.S. government to comply with adverse decisions. In most cases, \ncompliance with an adverse WTO decision calls for legislative changes, \nbut in some cases such as the recent case involving ``zeroing'' on \ndumping determinations, the Bush Administration has determined that the \nUnited States can comply with the adverse decision through regulatory \nchanges such as altering the methodology through which the Commerce \nDepartment calculates the dumping margin. This provision of my trade \nbill would prevent the Administration from side-stepping Congress in \ndetermining how to respond to an adverse decision in the WTO. \nCongressional oversight is an important element of our trade policy, \nand these provisions would help restore it.\n  Title II of the Strengthening America's Trade Laws Act tightens the \nrules in anti-dumping cases in favor of the petitioning domestic \nindustry and makes it harder for dumping countries and businesses to \ncircumvent the rules. Additionally, it applies a stricter methodology \nfor determining the market value of goods from countries designated as \n``nonmarket economies'' (NMEs). These countries presently include small \nformer Soviet republics such as Turkmenistan and Georgia, and also \nlarge U.S. trading partners such as China. These NME designations are \nan important element of U.S. trade policy, and Title II gives Congress \nthe ability to approve or disapprove any change in a country's NME \nstatus.\n  Title II also overrules the recent decision by the Federal Circuit in \nthe Bratsk case, which inappropriately added a new requirement not \npresently included in our anti-dumping laws, namely that ITC anti-\ndumping investigations must include evaluating the role of imports that \nare not actually subject to the investigation. This speculative element \nis not part of the investigation process that Congress mandated the ITC \nto follow in anti-dumping cases, and my bill would remove this \njudicially-added requirement that was never a part of our trade remedy \nlaw.\n  Title III of the Strengthening America's Trade Laws Act expands the \nreach of countervailing duties (CVDs) in order to address two \nsignificant sources of unfair trade: China's artificially undervalued \ncurrency, and the disparate treatment that international trade rules \ngive to value-added taxes (VAT) used by most U.S. trade partners.\n\n  Unlike anti-dumping duties, CVDs have not been applied against \nimports from NME countries like China, leaving a huge hole in the trade \nremedies available to U.S. manufacturers who are competing against \nsubsidized imports from China. This bill explicitly makes CVDs \napplicable to NME countries, and it and provides a methodology for \ndetermining subsidy levels in NMEs that is similar to the methodology \nfor determining fair market value in anti-dumping investigations \nregarding NME countries.\n  Next, Title III designates currency exchange rate manipulation as a \nsubsidy that can be addressed by application of CVDs. It is well known \nthat China's government pegs its currency's value to the value of a \n``basket'' of currencies including the dollar rather than allowing the \nvalue to be determined freely in currency exchange markets. This \npractice keeps China's currency artificially low, boosting Chinese \nexports and protecting Chinese domestic industry from imports. In \nDecember, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke called this practice \nwhat it is, an ``effective subsidy.'' This provision of Title III would \nallow the U.S. government to apply our CVD law to this subsidy.\n  Title III also contains a vital provision that would lead to the \npossible future use of CVDs as a remedy for the differential treatment \nthat international trade rules give to value-added taxes (VAT) used by \nmost U.S. trade partners. WTO rules provide that rebates on ``direct'' \ntaxes such as income, employment, and real estate taxes constitute \nsubsidies, whereas rebates on ``indirect taxes'' such as sales and VAT \ntaxes are not subsidies. This puts U.S. producers at a significant \ndisadvantage to producers in countries that use value-added tax (VAT) \nsystems.\n  Over 135 U.S. trading partners use VAT taxes for a significant amount \nof their revenue, and when U.S. exports enter a VAT tax country, they \nare subject to the importing country's VAT tax, whereas U.S. imports \nfrom a VAT tax country are not subject to the producing country's VAT \ntax. This unfair tax treatment constitutes both a hidden import duty \nfor U.S. exports and a hidden export subsidy for VAT tax country \nproducts entering the United States.\n  This provision of Title III would push the USTR to negotiate this \nissue to a satisfactory conclusion within the next two years. Failing \nsuch negotiations, it would designate this differential treatment a \ncountervailable subsidy which would then be subject to CVDs.\n  Finally, Title IV of the Strengthening America's Trade Laws Act would \nremove Presidential discretion to ignore the recommendations of the ITC \nin safeguard cases regarding China, or so-called ``Section 421'' cases. \nSection 421 of the legislation that provided for China's accession to \nthe WTO is a ``safeguard'' provision that provides for temporary relief \nfrom surges of imports that have caused injury to domestic industry. \nThere are a number of recent examples of President Bush's failure to \ntake action in cases in which the ITC has recommended ``safeguard'' \nrelief most notably on December 30, 2005, when he denied the relief \nthat the ITC had recommended for U.S. steel pipe and tube manufacturers \nin the face of a surge of imports from China. Title IV would ensure \nthat such denials do not happen in the future by removing Presidential \ndiscretion in applying safeguard measures in cases involving imports \nfrom China and instead making the findings and recommendations of the \nITC the final word on the matter.\n  The Strengthening America's Trade Laws Act will provide meaningful \nimprovements to U.S. trade law and a more level playing field for U.S. \nworkers and manufacturers in an increasingly competitive global \neconomy. I commend it to my colleagues and urge them to join me in \npushing for its swift enactment. Congress has sat on the sidelines for \ntoo long as our country's finest manufacturers have been dealt blow \nafter blow. This bill will not solve the trade deficit alone, but it is \na reasonable start.\n  I am going to ask my leadership, in my caucus and on the Finance \nCommittee, to work with me on this legislation, and I look forward to \njoining\n\n[[Page S916]]\n\nforces with my allies on the other side of the aisle to move this bill. \nI ask unanimous consent that the bill be entered into the record.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States joined the World Trade Organization \n     as an original member with the goal of creating an improved \n     global trading system and providing expanded economic \n     opportunities for United States workers, farmers, and \n     businesses.\n       (2) The dispute settlement rules of the WTO were created to \n     enhance the likelihood that governments will observe their \n     WTO obligations.\n       (3) Successful operation of the WTO dispute settlement \n     system was critical to congressional approval of the Uruguay \n     Round Agreements and is critical to continued support by the \n     United States for the WTO. In particular, it is imperative \n     that dispute settlement panels and the Appellate Body--\n       (A) operate with fairness and in an impartial manner;\n       (B) strictly observe the terms of reference and any \n     applicable standard of review set forth in the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements; and\n       (C) not add to the obligations, or diminish the rights, of \n     WTO members under the Uruguay Round Agreements in violation \n     of Articles 3.2 and 19.2 of the Dispute Settlement \n     Understanding.\n       (4) An increasing number of reports by dispute settlement \n     panels and the Appellate Body have raised serious concerns \n     within the Congress about the ability of the WTO dispute \n     settlement system to operate in accordance with paragraph \n     (3).\n       (5) In particular, several reports of dispute settlement \n     panels and the Appellate Body have added to the obligations \n     and diminished the rights of WTO members, particularly under \n     the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, the Agreement on \n     Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and the Agreement on \n     Safeguards.\n       (6) In order to come into compliance with reports of \n     dispute settlement panels and the Appellate Body that have \n     been adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body, the Congress may \n     need to amend or repeal statutes of the United States. In \n     such cases, the Congress must have a high degree of \n     confidence that the reports are in accordance with paragraph \n     (3).\n       (7) The Congress needs impartial, objective, and juridical \n     advice to determine the appropriate response to reports of \n     dispute settlement panels and the Appellate Body.\n       (8) The United States remains committed to the \n     multilateral, rules-based trading system.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to provide \n     for the establishment of the Congressional Advisory \n     Commission on WTO Dispute Settlement to provide objective and \n     impartial advice to the Congress on the operation of the \n     dispute settlement system of the World Trade Organization.\n\n     SEC. 102.

A bill to authorize the conveyance of certain Federal land in \nthe State of New Mexico; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce an \nuncontroversial piece of legislation that I hope will receive prompt \ncommittee action and will make its way quickly to the President's desk \nfor his signature.\n  I would first like to familiarize the Senate with the important \nmission and related work of the Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park in Las \nCruces, NM. The Chihuahuan Desert is the largest desert in North \nAmerica and contains a great variety of unique plant and animal \nspecies. The ecosystem makes up an indispensable part of the \nSouthwest's treasured ecological diversity. As such, it is important \nthat we teach our youth an appreciation for New Mexico's biological \ndiversity and impart upon them the value of this ecological treasure.\n  The Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park is a non-profit institution that \nhas spent the past six years providing hands-on science education to K-\n12th graders. To achieve this mission, the Nature Park provides \nclassroom presentations, field trips, schoolyard ecology projects and \nteacher workshops. The Nature Park serves more than 11,000 students and \n600 teachers annually. This instruction will enable our future leaders \nto make informed decisions about how best to manage these valuable \nresources. I commend those at the Nature Park for taking the initiative \nto create and administer a wonderfully successful program that has been \nso beneficial to the surrounding community.\n  The Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park was granted a 1,000 acre easement \nin 1998 at the southern boundary of USDA--Agriculture Research Service \n(USDA-ARS) property just north of Las Cruces, NM. This easement will \nexpire soon. It is important that we provide them a permanent location \nso that they are able to continue their valuable mission.\n  The bill I introduce today would transfer an insignificant amount of \nland: 1,000 of 193,000 USDA acres to the Desert Nature Park so that \nthey may continue their important work. The USDA-ARS has approved the \nland transfer, noting the critically important mission of the Desert \nPark. In addition, this bill was passed by the Senate in the 109th \nCongress without amendments by unanimous consent. I have no doubt that \nSenators on both sides of the aisle will recognize the importance of \nthis land transfer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 366\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 to enhance the cops on the beat grant program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce legislation, \nthe COPS Improvement Act of 2007, to reauthorize the Department of \nJustice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). This \nprogram has achieved what my colleagues and I hoped for back when we \nwere debating the 1994 Crime Bill. Prior to the final vote, in August \nof 1994, I stated that ``I will vote for this bill, because, as much as \nanything I have ever voted on in 22 years in the U.S. Senate, I truly \nbelieve that passage of this legislation will make a difference in the \nlives of the American people. I believe with every fiber in my being \nthat if this bill passes, fewer people will be murdered, fewer people \nwill be victims, fewer women will be senselessly beaten, fewer people \nwill continue on the drug path, and fewer children will become \ncriminals.''\n  Fortunately, with the creation of the COPS program, we were able to \nform a partnership amongst Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nand create programs that helped drive down crime rates for eight \nconsecutive years. In 1994 we had historically high rates of violent \ncrimes, such as murders, forcible rapes, and aggravated assaults. We \nwere able to reduce these to the lowest levels in a generation. We \nreduced the murder rate by 37.8 percent; we reduced forcible rapes by \n19.1 percent; and we reduced aggravated assaults by 25.5 percent. \nProperty crimes, including auto thefts also were reduced from \nhistorical highs to the lowest levels in decades. The COPS program has \nbeen endorsed by every major law enforcement group in the Nation, \nincluding the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), the \nNational Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), the National \nSheriffs Association (NSA), the International Brotherhood of Police \nOrganizations, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement \nOfficials (NOBLE), the International Union of Police Associations \n(IUPA), the Fraternal Order of Police, and others.\n  Rather than support this important program, the Bush Administration \nand Republican leadership has been set on eliminating it. President \nBush has proposed cuts each year he has been in office, and while we \nhave fought to maintain funding for COPS, the hiring program was \ncompletely eliminated in 2005. Overall funding for State and local law \nenforcement programs has been slashed by billions and the COPS hiring \nprogram has been completely eliminated. Last year's budget request \ncontained only $117 million for local law enforcement from COPS and the \ncomplete elimination of the Justice Assistance Grant.\n  These cuts are coming at the worst possible time. Local law \nenforcement is facing what I have called a perfect storm. The FBI is \nreprogramming its field agents from local crime to terrorism. \nUndoubtedly, this is necessary given the threats facing our Nation. \nBut, this means that there will be less Federal assistance for drug \ncases, bank robberies, and violent crime. Local law enforcement will be \nrequired to fill the gap left by the FBI in addition to performing more \nand more homeland security duties.\n  Due to budget restraints at the local level and the unprecedented \ncuts in Federal assistance they will be less able to do either. \nArticles in the USA Today and the New York Times highlighted the fact \nthat many cities are being forced to eliminate officers because of \nlocal budgets woes. In fact, New York City has lost over 3,000 officers \nin the 1ast few years. Other cities, such as Cleveland, MN, and \nHouston, TX, are facing similar shortages. As a result, local police \nchiefs are reluctantly pulling officers from the proactive policing \nactivities that were so successful in the nineties, and they are unable \nto provide sufficient numbers of officers for Federal task forces. \nThese choices are not made lightly. Police chiefs understand the value \nof proactive policing and the need to be involved in homeland security \ntask forces; however, they simply don't have the manpower to do it all. \nResponding to emergency calls must take precedence over proactive \nprograms and task forces, and we are beginning to pay the price. The \nFBI is reporting rising violent crime in cities throughout the Nation, \nwith murder rates rising 3.4 percent in 2005. Additionally, the \npreliminary numbers for 2006 show that violent crime is up 3.7 percent \nand murder rates up 1.4 percent when compared to last year's \npreliminary numbers.\n  Although the COPS program was re-authorized as part of Department of \nJustice Reauthorization, this bill is critical for several reasons. \nFirst, it re-establishes our commitment to the hiring program by \nincluding a separate authorization of $600 million to hire officers to \nengage in community policing, intelligence gathering, and as school \nresource officers. We need more cops on the beat and in our schools, \nand this will help get us there. It also authorizes $350 million per \nyear for technology grants, and it includes $200 million per year to \nhelp local district attorneys hire community prosecutors. Finally, it \ncongressionally establishes the COPS office as the entity within the \nDepartment of Justice to carry out these functions in order to \neliminate duplication of efforts. The bottom line is that this bill \nkeeps faith with our State and local law enforcement officers who put \ntheir lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe from \ncrime and terrorism. I would ask all of my colleagues to go ask their \nlocal police chief or sheriff and ask them if they should support this \nlegislation, and I hope that they will because if they did it would be \npassed 100-0.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 368\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
