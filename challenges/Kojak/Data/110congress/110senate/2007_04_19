He \nhas been a pastoral minister for over 25 years, serving as a hospice \nchaplain, a prison chaplain, and a bereavement counselor. In addition, \nhe is a certified spiritual director and mentor and teacher to those \nwho study spiritual direction. Tim and his wife Rita are members of \nValley Presbyterian Church. They are parents of two sons, one of whom, \nincidentally, interned in my office in Phoenix, AZ.\n  It is also a special privilege for a guest Chaplain to be here, and I \nexpress my appreciation also to our Chaplain, Dr. Barry Black, for his \nwillingness and kindness in inviting Tim Smith to be with us today.\n  Mr. President, I welcome Tim Smith, Minister of Valley Presbyterian \nChurch, to Washington and to the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/19/senate-section/article/S4723-6", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the distinguished visiting Chaplain \nmentioned the Revolutionary War event, and that is memorable. Also, on \nthis day I think it is important, to reflect on the Holocaust, that \nthis day in 1943 was the beginning of the Warsaw Uprising at the Warsaw \nghetto. As I recall, the Germans invaded Poland in 1939. They were, to \nsay the least, brutal, especially against the Jews. In about 1941, as I \nrecall, they cordoned off an area that was about 20 blocks by 6 blocks \nand ordered everyone out who was not Jewish and ordered all Jews from \nthe whole large metropolitan area of Warsaw into that ghetto.\n  Word got out that the Jews had gathered some weapons, as they had \ndone, minimal in number, and the German tanks came in on this day in \n1943. Of course they were to wipe out the ghetto in 1 day, but these \ngallant Polish patriots, these Jews, held out for more than a month.\n  In the annals of history, it is one of the greatest acts of defiance \nagainst terrorism that exists. They did it with heroism and gallantry, \nand it is a day that we should recognize as being a day in the history \nof mankind where people stood up for what was right and against what \nwas wrong.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/19/senate-section/article/S4724-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4724]]\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this morning there will be a period of \nmorning business for 60 minutes, Republicans controlling the first half \nand the majority controlling the last portion of the time. Following \nthe period of morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nS. 378, the court security legislation. Cloture was filed on the bill. \nMembers have until 1 p.m. today to file any first-degree amendments to \nthe matter.\n  I am confident and I am hopeful that we will finish that bill today \nand be able to move, either this evening or tomorrow, to the matter \ndealing with competitiveness. Everyone should be made aware of the fact \nthat we have at least 50 cosponsors of that legislation, so there will \nbe no cloture filed to move to it or after we are on it. This is a bill \nthat we should be able to complete without any procedural blocks of any \nkind from either side. But we are going to finish the court security \nbill before we leave this week. That may take a little extra time, but \nI think it is something we all need to do.\n  Coincidentally, yesterday, as I indicated on the Senate floor, the \nhead of the Marshals Service, Mr. Clark, came to see me. The meeting \nhad been long since scheduled. It was not scheduled as a result of this \nmatter being on the floor of the Senate. He indicated that violence \nagainst Federal judges was up 17 percent last year; that there were \nmore than 1,000 open threats against members of the Federal judiciary \nlast year. This does not take into consideration the many instances of \nthreats and actual violence in the State courts. This legislation will \nnot only make safer the people who work in the Federal courts, \nincluding the judges, but also has the ability to make our State courts \nsafer.\n  We need not be reminded too often of what has happened in recent \nyears. In Illinois, a crazed litigant waited in a judge's home. When \nthe family came home--not the judge, just the family members--they were \nkilled. In Nevada, a man who was dissatisfied with what a judge was \ndoing shot the judge. We know what happened in Georgia, where violence \ntook place and people were killed.\n  This is something we really need to do. Time is of the essence. I \nunderstand there are some amendments today, and that is fine. We will \ndispose of those just as quickly as we can. I hope we do not have to \nfile cloture on the bill.\n  That is the next thing. I appreciate very much the Republican leader \ndoing what was necessary so we could move to the bill immediately after \ncloture was invoked on the motion to proceed. This is important \nlegislation, and we should finish it as quickly as we can.\n  I also want to acknowledge that all Judiciary Committee members are \ntied up in the Judiciary Committee today, Democrats and Republicans, \nbecause Attorney General Gonzales is appearing before them in his much \nanticipated hearing. As a result of that, we didn't have a manager of \nthe bill. Sherrod Brown, a longtime Member of the House and new Member \nof the Senate, has agreed to manage this bill, and that will be done on \nthis side. There are no excuses. We need to move forward. We have a \nmanager. We will make sure everything is done in an appropriate manner.\n  We hope anyone who has amendments to offer will do so. There is \nnothing pending at this time, as I understand it. I say to the Chair, \nis that true, that this bill is open to amendment at the present time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The bill is open to amendment. We hope if people, Democrats \nor Republicans, think this bill can be improved, they will offer \namendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/19/senate-section/article/S4724-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

With regard to today's remembrance of the Holocaust, \nat today's 2007 National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance \nceremony, I will have the honor of lighting a candle alongside \nHolocaust survivor Eva Cooper. Eva was 10 years old when Nazis invaded \nher hometown of Budapest. She survived in hiding until Soviet forces \nliberated her and her family in 1945.\n  Hearing stories like Eva's reminds us that the Holocaust was not one \nact of evil, but millions, an evil that slaughtered little children and \nhorrified nations. Today, we remember evil and the strength and courage \nof those who lived under its dark reign.\n  As time marches ever forward, fewer survivors like Eva Cooper will \nstill live to tell us firsthand of the horrors they saw. That is why \nthe mission of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the host of today's \nevent, is so very important. History must never forget the horror \ncommitted against the Jewish people, so that horror of such magnitude \ncan never, never happen again.\n  Today's ceremony will also serve to remind us of the strength of the \nJewish people in the face of atrocity. The resilience of those who \nsurvived, and the determination of those who remember, is proof that \nthe dignity of the human soul will never be trampled by oppression, \ninjustice, or terror.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/19/senate-section/article/S4724-5", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I want to use some of the minority time \nin morning business this morning to discuss H.R. 1591, the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations Act of 2007. We are here now, some 73 days \nafter the President sent us the emergency wartime spending request, and \n73 days later we are still waiting to send to our troops the resources \nthey desperately need while they are in harm's way.\n  On March 23 the House passed their version of the bill, and on March \n29 the Senate did as well. We are now in the middle of April and the \ntwo bodies have yet to meet to work out their differences. More \ndistressing still, the House has yet to even name conferees.\n  I know yesterday the leaders of the Congress had a meeting with the \nPresident to discuss the progress, or maybe the lack of progress, on \nthis bill. In the 10 weeks since the Congress began consideration, we \nhave turned a bill intended to fund troops into a bill that seeks to \nput a hasty and misguided withdrawal deadline from Iraq. In addition to \nthat, not only does it not prioritize the war funding and leave it at \nthat, but it also contains about $20 billion in projects that are \nneither emergencies and, most of all, are not related to the war \neffort.\n  In addition to that, it is clear from the conversations that leaders \nhave had with the President that in this current form this bill will be \nvetoed. So\n\n[[Page S4725]]\n\nwhere are we today then? We clearly have a bill that is going to be \nunacceptable to the Executive. We still have not even conferenced on \nthe bill. And worse yet, the Democratic leadership shows no signs of \nchanging the path on which they are set, which is one that attempts to \nput an artificial deadline on the commanders on the ground and attempts \nto put other restrictions on their ability to fight the war from the \nground as they best see fit.\n  So at the end of the day, we should not be using a war supplemental, \nat a time of war, when our troops are in harm's way, to do things such \nas put $25 million for spinach farmers--that is not an emergency, that \ndoes not relate to the war effort, $75 million for peanut storage. \nAgain, I am sure peanuts being stored is an important thing, but is it \na wartime supplemental issue? Is it an emergency? No. And $250 million \nfor a dairy subsidy. We all enjoy ice cream, but do we need to have an \nemergency appropriation in order to subsidize diary farmers? Do we need \nto have an emergency appropriation for the war with bin Ladin now with \nthis kind of special interest pork?\n  There is $3.5 million in this bill for Capitol tours. They are \nimportant, too. They are not an emergency. They certainly do not relate \nto the war. And $2 million for the University of Vermont.\n  The President has said:\n\n       The longer Congress delays, the worse the impact on the men \n     and women of the armed forces [will be]. Our troops, [the \n     President said] should not be trapped in the middle.\n\n  I think that is true. I think it is very important that we move this \nprocess forward and that we allow for the troops on the ground to \nreceive the kind of funding they desperately need to continue the fight \nforward.\n  There is something here we must recognize. Whenever the Congress does \nnot timely fund an agency or department of the Federal Government, then \nwe need to find ways in which to get the job done. I can remember, \nduring my days in the Cabinet, that as Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, it is very disruptive for a stream of funding for a given \nproject to be disrupted, because then you have to make amends in order \nto continue to pay your bills, bills you are obligated to pay, while at \nthe same time having to rob Peter to pay Paul.\n  It is the most inefficient way to run Government. It is more costly \nthan any other way of doing it and, most of all, when you are dealing \nwith our Armed Forces, it has dire consequences.\n  Here are a couple of things that are wrong with the situation we are \nin today: We are delaying for no good reason. Secondly, we are \nattempting to impose a political deadline on a bill that is intended to \nprovide the troops the resources they need to continue to fight the \nwar.\n  The Iraq Study Group has been cited as having some good guidance on \nthe way forward. The experts in that group, the Iraq Study Group--I \nknow they are quoted frequently by my friends on the other side of the \naisle, but we can't be too selective about what we choose to like from \nthe Iraq Study Group and what we don't.\n  The Iraq Study Group says that: Near-term results--and this is \nreferring to an untimely or an early withdrawal--would result in a \nsignificant power vacuum.\n  Unquestionably, if we withdraw untimely, there will be a power vacuum \nin Iraq. There will be greater human suffering, and the region will be \ndestabilized, and a threat to the global economy would also be a part \nof what the Iraq Study Group found would be the result of a hasty \nwithdrawal.\n\n       Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory.\n\n  Make no mistake about that. The Iraq Study Group said: Our premature \ndeparture from Iraq, leaving a power vacuum, will provide al-Qaida with \na victory of historic proportions.\n\n       If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range \n     consequences could eventually require the United States to \n     return.\n\n  This is the Iraq Study Group. This is what they are saying about an \nuntimely and hasty withdrawal from Iraq. There is no question there \nwould be a power vacuum left, not only within Iraq but also in the \nregion. And as a result of that, only those who do not wish us well and \nwho are, frankly, the enemies of our country today would find this \nvacuum a great opportunity as a way that they could then descend. So \nthere would be a power vacuum within the country, which would surely be \nfilled by the radical elements of the society, who are not the ones who \nwere elected by the people but are the ones who will have the ability, \nthrough their own thuggery and armed intervention, by their own \nmilitias, to take over the country.\n  The factional killings would rise even higher than they are today, \nand then the region will be destabilized, because there is no question \nthat Iran would move into this power vacuum created by the hasty \ndeparture of the United States, the only stabilizing force in that area \nat the moment.\n  In addition, we would find the other countries in the region, the \nSunni states, the moderate Sunni states that are friendly to us, would \nfind this situation untenable. They would then have to act. I think the \nwhole region would be in greater chaos than it is today. This would \nthen necessitate a return of the United States into Iraq in a way that \nwould be, frankly, undesirable.\n  So what are we doing today? Well, I am not one of those who believes \nwe owe a commitment for the end of time and to all time. But I do not \nthink we are at the point in time when retreat is the only option. \nRetreat will be followed by defeat, and all of those consequences are \nnot what we want to see.\n  At this point in time we have two top-rated commanding officers in \nthe field. General Petraeus has been on site a scant couple of months. \nHis plan for this surge, his plan to try to pacify Baghdad, is \nunderway, and while there are daily setbacks, and last night, this \nmorning, we received the news of yet more fighting and more killing and \nmore bombs, the fact is there are some overall trends that seem to be \nmoving in a more positive direction.\n\n  Lieutenant General Odierno, who is the commanding general of the \nMultinational Corps in Iraq, reported on a number of aspects of \nmilitary progress. He said: ``We are seeing a drop in sectarian murders \nin Baghdad and some displaced families are returning to the city.''\n  Again, these are modest signs of something going in the right \ndirection.\n\n       The number of caches we are finding per week has doubled \n     since February.\n\n  All of the troops of this reinforcement action that many choose to \ncall a surge have yet to be on the ground. The capacity of the Iraq \nsecurity forces continues to grow. There are currently 10 Iraqi \ndivisions, 8 of which have transitioned to Iraqi control. I believe \nyesterday another province was turned over to Iraqi control, the Iraqi \nforces. Security across Al Anbar has dramatically improved. The people \nof Al Anbar are fighting back and winning against al-Qaida. And I think \nthat is true. We are receiving unparalleled and unprecedented \ncooperation from the locals in that area to help us defeat al-Qaida.\n  This, make no mistake about it, is a fight with al-Qaida. There may \nbe sectarian and factional fighting in Iraq, and certainly in Baghdad, \nbut in Al Anbar we are fighting al-Qaida.\n  Last week in Ramadi, there were nine attacks in total. During this \nsame week a year ago there were 84 attacks. In the north, petroleum \nproducts from the Baiji oil refinery have increased 20 percent in the \nlast 6 weeks alone, due to the Iraq security force's effort to protect \nthe distribution tankers.\n  The bottom line is, there is a drop in murders, there is an increase \nin finding arms caches, there is an increase in the Iraqi forces \ncontinuing to take control of their own country, there is a decrease in \nattacks, and there is an increase in oil production. It is a perfect \npicture but certainly something that seems to be moving in a direction \nthat is more desirable.\n  The emergency supplemental is vital to the troops and vital to our \nnational security. The operations in Iraq over the next several months \nwill determine our future efforts in Iraq and in that part of the \nworld. We do not have the luxury of delaying these funds. You see, it \nwould be a self-fulfilling prophecy not to properly fund the troops, to \nrequire that the rotations that are planned not take place; that the \nNational Guard--we value so much the training. And I keep hearing in \nthe Armed Services Committee repeated questions: Are our troops \nproperly trained before they are sent into battle?\n\n[[Page S4726]]\n\n  Well, we find that right now home State training of National Guard \nunits had to be suspended because of the supplemental not being funded, \nand deployment of all military units is going to have to be slowed.\n  In other words, there are people who are part of our Armed Forces who \nhave been in Iraq, who have served their time, who are expecting to \ncome home. Their time of coming home is going to be delayed because \ntheir replacement will not have the resources to get back into the \nfight.\n  The administration's position on the bill is that the war \nsupplemental should remain focused on the needs of the troops and \nshould not be used as a vehicle for adding on emergency spending, and \nalso for policy proposals that I find are more destined to make a \ndifference in the political fight than they are in the fight against \nthe enemies of our country.\n  Mr. President, I conclude by reading a letter that was written by \nArmy LTC Charles P. Ferry, regarding the death of his comrade, his \nfollow soldier, Army Ranger SSG Joshua Hager, a young man who died in \nthe service of his country.\n  The lieutenant colonel wrote:\n\n       On February 22, 2007, the Scout Platoon and I were \n     conducting a vehicle movement at night along a route we had \n     traveled many times before. Joshua and the rest of the Scouts \n     had every inch of this road memorized. About halfway to our \n     destination, Joshua's vehicle was struck by a large, deeply \n     buried improvised explosive device (IED). Joshua was \n     instantly killed by the blast, and the two other Scouts in \n     the vehicle were wounded.\n\n  The lieutenant colonel continues to write:\n\n       I have been in the Army for about 23 years and served in \n     numerous Infantry, Special Forces, and Ranger Battalions. I \n     have served about three years collectively in combat in \n     Somalia, Afghanistan, and Iraq, and Staff Sergeant Joshua \n     Hager is one of the best Sergeants I have ever served with \n     and I trusted my life with him. He was the consummate \n     professional and the absolute standard bearer for his \n     platoon. He died doing what he loved and what he was very \n     good at and I was proud to serve with him. I hope and pray \n     that our Nation will always appreciate the ultimate sacrifice \n     he and his family have made. I will never forget Joshua and I \n     carry his memory burned into my heart as we continue to \n     fight in the city of Ramadi.\n\n  I have spoken with the father of Sergeant Hager. We talked a number \nof times about his son and his son's beliefs. I cannot imagine the pain \nMr. Hager feels, but I can tell you what he did say to me. The message \nfrom Joshua's father that he wanted me to relay here was Joshua \nunderstood his mission. He understood what he was over there fighting \nfor. He knew this was a war worth fighting, and worth winning.\n  Young Joshua Hager told his dad these things and added:\n\n       I'll stay in Iraq for another year or however long it takes \n     to defeat the enemy--so that my son won't have to fight this \n     battle when he grows up.\n\n  That statement, I believe, embodies the spirit of our soldiers in the \nfield. They get it. They know their mission. We should know ours as \nwell. We ought to get to work. We ought to strip out of this bill the \ntimelines that would constrain and tie the hands of our military \ncommanders. We should strip the pork, the unnecessary, nonemergency, \nnonwar-related pork that is in the bill, and send a clean bill to the \nPresident that he might sign it and get the resources to the troops \nthey so desperately need, not only in Iraq but just as well as back \nhere at home as we continue to attempt to keep our National Guard \nproperly trained and properly prepared.\n  This is a difficult issue. I know very much how much this issue can \ndivide our country. But I also know how very important it is to those \nof us who I believe clearly understand the threat our country faces in \nthe global war on terror, the issues that relate to the security of \nthis Nation, and the very difficult situation we find ourselves in. We \nshould not make this situation more difficult by injecting domestic \npolitics into the atmosphere.\n  I do believe it is very important that we continue to fund the \ntroops, that we give the troops our support and our backing, and we do \nso in a timely manner.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I know the Republican side has \nadditional time remaining. That will be reserved for them. I wish to \nspeak under the Democratic time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, news from the Pentagon last week hit so \nmany families throughout our great State of Arkansas particularly hard. \nFour years into the conflict in Iraq, the Army National Guard put \n13,000 reservists, including nearly 2,000 from the largest National \nGuard unit in Arkansas, the 39th Infantry Brigade, on notice that they \nshould be prepared for a second deployment at the end of this year. The \nPentagon's decision to potentially deploy these troops marks the first \ntime during Operation Iraqi Freedom that full Guard units would be \ncalled up for a second tour of duty. Our Arkansas troops already have \nperformed bravely in Iraq, and we know they will do so again.\n  Today, along with many Arkansans honorably serving in the Active-Duty \nmilitary, over 1,600 of our citizen soldiers have been activated for \nservice in the Middle East and along our southern border with Mexico. \nThe 142nd Fire Brigade based in Fayetteville, AR, mobilized last week \nand is expected in Iraq this summer. Eighty members of the 213th Area \nSupport Medical Company are preparing for their mobilization orders in \nJune. Many of these members served in Iraq before with the 296th \nAmbulance Company. The headquarters company, the 871st Troop Command, \nis also expected to be mobilized in June.\n  Since the war began, our troops have performed their mission with \nincredible bravery and skill in some of the harshest conditions \nimaginable. Their families have supported them and kept them in their \nprayers, have been there with them each step of the way, both in the \nharsh conditions and when they have returned. Their communities have \nsupported them, many of which are rural communities. They are \ncommunities that, when these soldiers have been deployed, have to find \nsomeone else to fill positions while they are gone, positions such as \nmayor or principal of the school, fire chief or police chief, small \nbusinesses that keep the economies in those small rural communities \nthriving.\n  Because of the sacrifice of these brave men and women, their \nfamilies, and these communities, we have seen a popularly elected \ngovernment replace a ruthless dictator.\n  We have seen a democratic constitution approved by the Iraqi people \nreplace the authoritarian rule they had known. Tragically, we also have \nseen civilian mismanagement of this war which is not reflective of the \ntremendous sacrifice put forth by our men and women in uniform. Today, \nmore than\n\n[[Page S4727]]\n\n3,300 servicemembers, 56 with Arkansas ties, have given their lives--\nthe ultimate sacrifice in this undertaking--and more than 24,000 have \nbeen wounded.\n  Now, as our troops contemplate the thought of returning to Iraq to \ncontinue an undefined mission, President Bush has chosen to question \nthe resolve of Congress to provide our troops with the resources they \nneed to finish the job. He has questioned us. I take great exception to \nthe President's comments. I find them disingenuous, and I wish to make \nclear to the American people that Congress is committed to providing \nour troops with everything they need to safely and effectively complete \ntheir mission. I believe that we have worked diligently to bring about \na bill which would provide just that.\n  Last month, I voted with the majority of my Senate colleagues for an \nemergency spending bill that was above the President's request for our \ntroops and would provide nearly $100 billion for operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We met each of his requests and provided every nickel he \nasked for and more. The additional dollars we approved provide for \ntheir combat equipment, housing, and much needed health care, \nparticularly addressing mental health issues for those suffering from \ntraumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder. Our \nsoldiers in the field deserve no less. Our returning veterans deserve \nno less. We should be doing everything we possibly can to provide what \nthe President has asked and more. We do just that in the supplemental \nbill we will send him.\n\n  Our legislation also sets measurable benchmarks for the Iraqi \nGovernment such as assuming control of their own security operations, \ncontaining the sectarian violence, and making the tough decisions \ntoward political reconciliation that desperately need to be made--the \nvery same benchmarks the President himself has continually called for.\n  The Senate did this in record time. In the past 2 years, it took well \nover 100 days to get to a supplemental. This Senate, recognizing the \nurgency of the issue, moved quicker than we have in the last 2 years. \nWe have been more expeditious, and we acted in less than 50 days to get \nit passed in the Senate. We now anticipate sending him a bill next \nweek. Despite our best efforts to find common ground, however, the \nPresident has threatened to veto this bill once it reaches his desk, \nalthough the final language still needs to be negotiated in a \nconference package. I hope it will be done in a way that does expedite \ngetting the resources and needs to our soldiers.\n  What is so egregious about our approach that the President will not \nconsider signing it and has been so adamant? The President points to \ntwo particular issues. First, he claims this bill would impose \nrestrictions on our military commanders and set an arbitrary date for \nwithdrawal from Iraq, giving our enemies the victory they desperately \nwant. I argue that the constantly shifting objectives of this war make \nit difficult to imagine an end to the U.S. commitment, unless we \npresent the benchmarks the President has spoken about and called for. \nThe American people are exhausted with this war, and the President's \njustification for staying in Iraq becomes harder and harder to stomach \neach and every day if we do not call on the Iraqis to step up to the \nplate and seize their opportunity to create their own security.\n  As Iraq slides deeper into an increasingly violent civil war, the \nPresident's high-risk military strategy has increased our military's \ninvolvement. This strategy comes at a time when the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity reports that al-Qaida has become an increased threat to our \nnational security because we have devoted so much manpower, resources, \nand attention solely to Iraq. We have in a sense spread ourselves so \nthin in one place that how can we react in the multiple places where \nal-Qaida is strengthening itself? It also comes at a time when our own \nmilitary reports that its readiness has dramatically eroded because it \nhas been overextended and underequipped.\n  Listening to my military leaders in Arkansas, my guardsmen and \nreservists, who know full well what is going to be asked of them, one \nof the first things on their list of concerns is the lack of medical \nand dental readiness for their soldiers. They find that when some of \ntheir troops get called up, because they are citizen soldiers and they \nmay not have regular health care--which is a whole other issue to be \ndealing with in this body--they are held back on medical hold because \nthey don't meet medical readiness or, in some of the more horrific \nstories, they just simply pull that soldier's teeth and send them to \nIraq because they don't have time to give adequate dental care to bring \nthem to that medical-readiness status. It is unacceptable and \ninexcusable that we should be putting those many pressures on the brave \nmen and women who fight for this country.\n  Our bill seeks to address these issues. In the Senate bill, we \nacknowledge that the conditions in Iraq have changed substantially \nsince we originally authorized the war in 2002. We are no longer \nfighting an enemy that will one day show the white flag and surrender. \nInstead, we are now in a referee position of a brutal fight for \ndominance between two warring religious sects and countless militia who \nare all hungry for power. Oftentimes, soldiers come home and say they \ndon't even know who the enemy is when they go into these communities \nand seize what they think are civilians and don't know whether it is a \nmilitia that will lash out and cause great harm.\n  While I agree with President Bush that we should not leave Iraq in \nchaos, we don't have to. That is the point we make in this bill. We \ndon't have to if we make sure, as we do in this bill, that the Iraqis \nunderstand what our expectations are of them, the benchmarks we have \nlaid down, and the expectations we have of the Iraqis to stand up so \nour American soldiers can step down, as President Bush has so \nfrequently said.\n  U.S. troops should not be in the position of policing a civil war \nwith an open-ended commitment. The American people realize that and are \nclamoring for us to move forward in a positive way to bring our troops \nhome.\n  That is why U.S. policy must focus on policy that encourages Iraqi \nleaders to take responsibility for their country and attempt to find a \npolitical solution to this grave conflict.\n  America is no stranger to that. In looking for our own freedom \nhundreds of years ago, we realized there were commitments that had to \nbe made. We knew there were steps that had to be taken, courageous \nsteps that had to be taken. The Iraqi people know that, too. We must \nencourage them now to take those steps.\n  Our efforts are already having their intended effect. On Tuesday, the \nPresident's own Defense Secretary, Robert Gates, stated:\n\n       [T]he debate in Congress has been helpful in demonstrating \n     to the Iraqis that American patience is limited. The strong \n     feelings expressed in the Congress about the timetable \n     probably has had a positive impact in terms of communicating \n     to the Iraqis that this is not an open-ended commitment.\n\n  The President has also chided Congress for providing much needed \nemergency funding. This is one of the other areas he brings complaint \nabout our supplemental--for providing this much needed emergency \nfunding for items such as Katrina recovery, agricultural disaster \nrelief, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, known as SCHIP, \nand firefighting, just to name a few. He has attempted to paint this \nfunding as porkbarrel funding when the reality is these are dollars \nwhich will be used to rebuild the gulf region; dollars which will be \nused for farmers to offset losses over the past several years from \ndrought and hurricanes and other types of natural disasters; dollars \nwhich will be used for health care needs for our Nation's neediest \nchildren, our most precious blessing; and dollars for our first \nresponders and on and on.\n  I am reminded of a conversation I had with my grandmother one time \nwhen she said to me: It is crazy, but some people will sometimes ask \nyou, Which of your children do you love the most? How do you respond to \nsomething like that? As the mother of twins, it is impossible. \nPresident Bush is the father of twins. He knows how important it is \nthat all of your children--all of your children--know they are loved. \nYes, some, though, who are the neediest may need more attention. That \nis why--that is why--the soldiers, the brave men and women serving in \nuniform from this country, are the\n\n[[Page S4728]]\n\nfirst priority on our list here. But that does not mean we forget the \nrest of the members of our American family. That does not mean we \nforget the children who need health care or the farmers who are \nexperiencing disaster or, Heaven forbid, we forget the members of our \nAmerican family in the gulf region who have yet to get the resources \nand the help from their Federal Government they need to begin to \nrebuild their lives.\n  These are people who are a huge part of our American family and who \nstrengthen the fabric of this great country. It is so critically \nimportant that they, too, be included as a part of strengthening this \ncountry to which our soldiers will one day return home. These are funds \nwhich are needed now. The supplemental offers the best opportunity to \naddress these emergencies. It is the typical place where we address \nemergencies in the Congress.\n  Moving forward, I am pleased President Bush met with Majority Leader \nReid and Speaker Pelosi yesterday. I see that as a sign of progress. \nBut I am also very disappointed that the President continues to put \nveto threats out there about a bill that is so vitally necessary to our \nsoldiers and to our entire American family.\n  For the security of our country and for the sake of our troops, it is \ntime for a new direction. It must be a direction that better reflects \nthe ability, the reality, and the real progress that ultimately lies \nwith the Iraqis taking responsibility for their own future. We know--we \nknow--it can happen if the Iraqis understand what is expected of them.\n  This new direction must also acknowledge we must do more for our \ntroops when they are in harm's way particularly but also when they come \nhome. The love and care--particularly health care--they and their \nfamilies need is essential to keeping our American family whole. They \nnot only deserve our appreciation and support, they deserve the very \nbest equipment, armor, and other battlefield amenities necessary to \ncomplete their mission and to bring them home, as well as the proper \ncare, benefits, and attention once their military service is complete.\n  Our troops are worthy of this commitment from us. We should come \ntogether as a Congress and an executive branch to make that expression, \nto show our troops and to show our entire American family that at this \ntime, at this difficult time in our Nation's history, we come together \nin a bipartisan way, in an American way, to recognize the needs of this \ngreat country and to move us forward.\n  I strongly believe this bill offers the necessary guidelines to bring \nour soldiers home safely, and as soon as possible, to care for this \nincredible country--these communities they will return home to, to keep \nthem whole and to keep this incredible fabric of our American family \nstrong.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to come to the \nfloor and urge the Senate to expedite the consideration of the \nsupplemental appropriations bill that is now in conference between \nHouse and Senate members on the Appropriations Committee. This \nsupplemental request for funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan \nhas been pending now for way too long, without action to send this bill \nto the President for his signature.\n  Over 2 weeks ago, I received a letter from the Joint Chiefs of Staff \noutlining the urgency of this appropriations bill. I am going to read a \ncouple of excerpts from that letter now:\n\n       With the increasing pace of operations and material needs \n     in Iraq and Afghanistan, we ask that the Congress \n     expeditiously complete its work on the Fiscal Year 2007 \n     Emergency Supplemental. Timely receipt of this funding is \n     critical to military readiness and force generation as we \n     prosecute the war on terror. Given the current status of this \n     legislation, we are particularly concerned that funding could \n     be significantly delayed.\n\n  It is very clear that delay is occurring, and it is a serious matter. \nWe are talking about life-and-death situations, the ability to furnish \nthe equipment, the weaponry, the training that is necessary for our \nArmed Forces to carry out their mission.\n  This is not a time to play politics with the well-being of troops in \nthe field. I am afraid that is what we are witnessing. I do not have \nany particular problem with the Senate and House members of our \nconference committee seriously engaging in a discussion of our \ndifferences and resolving those and submitting a final conference \nreport as soon as possible. I urge that is what we do. But we are \nseeing more and more delay. That is just not justified under the \ncircumstances in which we find ourselves.\n  In this letter I received the other day, here is another thing that \nis pointed out by the Joint Chiefs of Staff:\n\n       Without approval of the supplemental funds in April, the \n     Armed Services will be forced to take increasingly disruptive \n     measures in order to sustain combat operations. The impacts \n     on readiness and quality of life could be profound. We will \n     have to implement spending restrictions and reprogram \n     billions of dollars. Reprogramming is a short-term, cost-\n     inefficient solution that wastes our limited resources. \n     Spending restrictions will delay and disrupt our follow-on \n     forces as they prepare for war, possibly compromising future \n     readiness and strategic agility. Furthermore, these \n     restrictions increase the burden on servicemembers and their \n     families during this time of war.\n\n  I do not know how the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and those \nwho are working closely with him in this very difficult period could be \nmore clear about the importance of action now on this supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  I am not going to belabor the point, but I think for us to continue \nto engage in who is going to win this political struggle about \ndeadlines, forced redeployments from Iraq and Afghanistan, suspension \nof activities of this kind or the other, and who is in charge, it makes \nthe world wonder whether our Nation is competent to deal with an \nemergency that threatens the very security of our country.\n  I know when I came to Congress, you would hear it said that partisan \npolitics should stop at the water's edge, that whatever is going on in \nother parts of the world that affects our security, our economic well-\nbeing, threatens us all as a nation, Democrats, Republicans, young and \nold, the military, and the civilian leaders of our country--we are all \nin this together.\n  We need to work out our differences and resolve them somehow. Let's \nlook to compromise that is fair, that carries out the intent as \nexpressed in these bills by those who have supported and passed an \nappropriations bill in the Senate and one in the House. Let's resolve \nthe differences. That is what we are waiting on. And do you know what. \nThe conference committee has not even met. There has been no meeting of \nthe conferees on the part of the House or the Senate to discuss the \ndifferences. Now, that is inexcusable, and I lay that at the feet of \nthe leadership of the Senate and the House. We are all in this \ntogether. I am not saying just the Democratic leadership or the \nRepublican leadership, but we as Members ought to call on our leaders \nnow.\n  Let's end this logjam. Let's end this confrontation and the political \ngrandstanding that is going on on the part of some. I think we need to \nimmediately move to conference. Let's work on these bills. Let's get \nthem resolved in a conference report that the President can sign.\n  We are talking about a supplemental appropriations bill for our \nmilitary forces. There have been other things added in both the Senate \nand the House. Well, that is not unusual. That happens. What we can \nagree on, let's agree on and send it to the President. But let's stop \nthe delay, the procrastination, the finger-pointing, the political \naccusations that the President does not have the interests of the \ncountry at heart--whatever is being said in so many words. It is a \npolitical attack against the President. This is not the time for \npartisan politics. This is the time for the Senate and the House to get \ntogether, resolve our differences, and move on, support our troops, and \nprotect our national security interests. That is what this bill does.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter \nsigned by Peter J.

The Senate will resume consideration of S. \n378, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 378) to amend title 18, United States Code, to \n     protect judges, prosecutors, witnesses, victims, and their \n     family members and for other purposes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we continue to debate and consider \nthe Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. It should not be a struggle \nto enact this broadly supported consensus legislation. We made some \nprogress yesterday but failed to get to final passage of this important \nlegislation. I hope we can get there later today.\n  I would like to thank the majority leader for his support and \nleadership on this bill. Senator Reid knows all too well about the need \nfor greater court security since the last courthouse tragedy occurred \nin Nevada. Nobody has been a stronger supporter of this legislation. He \nhelped us pass similar protections twice last year. It is no surprise \nto me that yesterday he met with the head of the U.S. Marshals Service. \nSadly, they reported a 17 percent increase in attacks this year. We \ncannot delay our response any further in the face of this trend.\n  Senator Durbin, our assistant majority leader, has been consistently \ndedicated to getting this legislation passed. The tragic murder of \nJudge Lefkow's husband and mother in her home State of Illinois serves \nas a terrible reminder of why we need this legislation. Senator Durbin \nhas worked tirelessly to prevent any further tragedies from befalling \nour Federal judges.\n  As I have noted before, this legislation has broad bipartisan \nsupport. Yesterday Senator Cornyn gave a powerful statement in support \nof this legislation. Senator Cornyn is a former member of his State's \njudiciary. I urge Members to consider his views and support for these \nimportant provisions providing for increased security. Even the White \nHouse has issued a supportive Statement of Administration Policy.\n  Yesterday a number of amendments were filed, but none of them was \nrelevant to the important purpose of court security. There will be \nother opportunities to consider worthwhile amendments. I look forward \nto working with Senator Coburn on Department of Justice reauthorization \nlater this year.\n  We made some progress yesterday. The Senate adopted the Kyl-Feinstein \namendment that was adopted in committee. I thank Senator Specter for \nworking with me on an important managers' amendment. That amendment \nmade several technical fixes and clarified our treatment and protection \nof magistrate judges and the Tax Court judges.\n  Last night after significant debate we had a vote on an amendment \noffered by Senator Coburn. Regretfully, it took from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 \np.m. for the Senator from Oklahoma to be ready to offer his amendment. \nOnce offered we dealt with it promptly.\n  I would like to thank Senator Whitehouse for helping me manage this \nbill yesterday. His eloquent words in support of this legislation were \nmuch appreciated.\n  I thank Senators Klobuchar and Brown for helping me manage this \nlegislation today during the Judiciary Committee's oversight hearing \nwith Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.\n  I hope that today we can finish our work on this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Nevada has an \namendment he wishes to offer.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 897.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 897.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 897.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Except as provided in section 604(c), this title and the \n     amendments made by this title shall take effect 12 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, we are debating a bill about court \nsecurity. The court security bill is about the administration of \njustice. Some would argue that the amendment I have offered, while \nrelating to the courts, does not deal with court security. Both the \nunderlying bill and my amendment deal with the administration of \njustice. There are provisions in the bill that are not strictly dealing \nwith court security, and I believe this is an appropriate place to talk \nabout this amendment and an appropriate time for the Senate to vote on \nmy amendment. It is something we have been working on for a few years.\n  My amendment recognizes that the ninth circuit, by far being the \nlargest circuit in the United States, is too large, the administration \nof justice is too slow, and that the ninth circuit needs to be broken \nup at this point. It needs to be split up so the people, such as the \npeople who live in the State of Nevada, can receive justice in a way \nthat is fair and that is also expeditious.\n  In the past, the United States has gotten to a point with other \ncircuits where we have decided that they are too large and need to be \nsplit. Some have argued that splitting up the ninth circuit is for \nideological reasons, but that is not why I have offered this amendment. \nMany who used to be opposed to splitting up the ninth circuit 5 or 10 \nyears ago now understand that for the sake of the administration of \njustice, the ninth circuit needs to be split up. It is by far and away \nthe largest circuit in the United States.\n  We have had testimony in front of the Judiciary Committee, and many \narticles have been written, on why so many of the ninth circuit \ndecisions are overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The Ninth Circuit, far and away, has more of its decisions overturned \nby the Supreme Court than any other circuit. Well, Mr. President, we \nhad testimony that one of the reasons a lot of people believe that to \nbe the case is not that the jurists on the Ninth Circuit may be less \ncompetent than those in other circuits, but that is because of the \noverwhelming caseload, the circuit doesn't have the time to consider \nthe cases that other circuits do but the use of the en-banc panel, \ninstead of the full circuit, contributes to this problem.\n\n[[Page S4731]]\n\n  Mr. President, 20 percent of the country is in the Ninth Circuit. It \nis laden with immigration cases. It has too many cases per judge and, \nbecause of that, too many of the cases that need to be heard in a \ntimely fashion are delayed. What our bill simply would do is to divide \nthe Ninth Circuit up in a very fair manner. We have put this through \njudges and through studies and over the years we have modified it on \nexactly how to break it up. If people disagree with how we are deciding \nto break it up, we can talk about that. But the bottom line is that it \nis too large of a circuit, and the Ninth Circuit needs to be split up.\n  I think all but one of the judges in the State of Nevada--by the way, \nalmost all these same judges used to be against splitting up the Ninth \nCircuit. Today, nearly all of them have come out in favor of splitting \nup the Ninth Circuit. The reason for that is we live in the fastest \ngrowing area in the country. Nevada, in 18 out of the last 19 years, is \nthe fastest growing State. The other States in the Ninth Circuit, \nincluding Arizona, California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, all of these \nStates have booming populations. While we are the largest circuit in \nthe United States, it is going to get increasingly worse in the future, \nas far as the size of the population, the number of cases per judge, \nwhile overwhelming now, it is only going to get worse in the future.\n  I believe this is an amendment that should be discussed as a separate \nbill on the floor. But we all know most bills cannot get time on the \nSenate floor. So you have to take the opportunity to offer amendments \nwherever you can. We have been trying to get this bill acted on for \nyears and years and years. We now have a vehicle, dealing with the \ncourts, where it is appropriate to offer this amendment. So that is why \nI am offering this amendment today.\n  Mr. President, again, amendment No. 897 would split the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Because my home State of Nevada is under the \njurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit, I have taken particular interest in \nhow the Ninth Circuit functions. As a Senator from Nevada, I represent \npeople who are on both sides of this issue. I have heard arguments for, \nand against, splitting the Ninth Circuit but, having listened to the \ndebate, have concluded that it is time for Congress to split the Ninth \nCircuit.\n  The Ninth Circuit really has become too large to function as \nefficiently as it should. The population of the States in the Ninth \nCircuit is growing too fast for the circuit to manage its caseload. \nCases working their way through the Ninth Circuit take far too long to \ncome to resolution. The circuit is becoming increasingly dependent on \nvisiting judges, who are not as familiar with circuit precedent, to \nmanage its caseload. The reversal rate of cases heard by the Supreme \nCourt which on appeal from the Ninth Circuit is much higher than the \naverage of all Federal circuits. These problems require some form of \naction by Congress and, having studied the issue, simply adding more \njudges is not the solution.\n  Last year, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the issue of \nsplitting the Ninth Circuit. As several Federal judges who were \nwitnesses testified, adding more judges, in a circuit so geographically \nlarge, is not going to adequately address the need for collegiality \namong judges.\n  Mr. President, my primary motivation is to ensure that my \nconstituents, the people of Nevada, have equal access to justice. Equal \naccess to justice requires not only fair, but also prompt, resolution \nof a case. From my perspective, the current backlog in cases and the \nfact that the resolution of appeals takes far longer in the Ninth \nCircuit than any other circuit demonstrates that Nevadans are not \nguaranteed the promise that their claims will be heard with the same \ntimeliness as persons living in other circuits. The adage of ``justice \ndelayed is justice denied'' is appropriate with respect to the Ninth \nCircuit delays.\n  I believe we should consider the cost that unreasonable delay causes \nto the parties in a case. The lawyers and the judges live in this \nsystem. To these people, delays are not only reasonable but they are \nexpected. A delay to someone who is part of the legal community is just \nthe way things are done. But that is not the case for litigants. Ask \nany litigant whose case is waiting for a hearing on appeal. They take \nbeing sued personally and would tell you that their lives are on hold. \nThey may fear they will lose their business, or their job, or their \nlivelihood. It really does not matter whether the case involves \nbusiness litigation, an immigration appeal, or a criminal matter.\n  If you talk to the parties to a case, they will tell you stories of \nthe economic, social, and psychological toll extended litigation has on \nthem and their families. That is why I am concerned about delays in the \nprocess.\n  That is also why I believe that some groups have endorsed my bill. \nFor example, the Western States Sheriff's Association, which includes \nNevada, has endorsed splitting the Ninth Circuit. I believe that the \nAssociation understands that America's law enforcement agencies have \nbeen devoting scarce budget resources to monitoring and dealing with \ncriminal appeals that would otherwise be better devoted to protecting \nAmerica's families if only appeals cases were resolved sooner rather \nthan later.\n  I believe that it is not only the duty of Congress but also our \nobligation to ensure that the Judicial branch is operating efficiently. \nThat is why we are considering the current legislation, the court \nsecurity bill, because we want to ensure that judicial branch operates \nefficiently. And we know that it cannot, if those who work in the \nsystem--our judges and our court officers--do not feel safe. That is \nalso why my amendment is so important.\n  I do not believe that splitting the Ninth Circuit would infringe on \nthe ``independence of the judiciary'' as some might suggest. The \nConstitution provides Congress with the power to ``constitute'' or \nestablish ``tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court,'' and also gives \nCongress the power to ``ordain and establish'' the lower Federal \ncourts. Acting in accordance with the Constitution, Congress has used \nits authority to establish the Federal appeals courts and the Federal \ndistrict courts, as well as other Federal courts. Congress has the \nability to create courts of special jurisdiction, such as military \ncourts, bankruptcy courts, and tax courts, and to limit the appeals \njurisdiction of all Federal courts, including the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. The Constitution clearly provides that the people, \nacting through their respective Congressional representatives, can \nenact legislation to split the Ninth Circuit. The prerogative of \nCongress to enact legislation to split the Ninth Circuit is consistent \nwith the role of Congress established by the Constitution. The idea of \nsplitting the Ninth Circuit is a proper action for Congress to take.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would hope that Members of the Senate could \nagree that, regardless of where each of us may be on this issue, we \ncould engage in an honest discussion and avoid attacking each other's \nmotives. I have read with great interest the statements of people on \nthe other side of this issue suggesting that split supporters, like \nmyself, are only ``politically motivated'' or that supporters of a \nsplit are ``trying to punish'' the Ninth Circuit because of the \nperception of the circuit's ideology. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. I am sure the people who do not favor a split have likewise had \nsimilar attacks directed at them. We should not condone that rhetoric \nor impugn each others motives. I do not believe that it is in the \nSenate's, or the Nation's, best interest to attack someone else's \nmotives. I have met with people on both sides of this issue and respect \ntheir views.\n  Let me conclude by saying this. The saying is that justice delayed is \njustice denied. In the Ninth Circuit that is what happens ever single \nday. Nevadans experience justice delayed too often. We are putting more \nand more of a burden on our Federal courts by the actions of the \nSenate. We need to now take the responsibility to make sure our various \ncircuits around the country are not even more overburdened simply \nbecause of population growth. That is what has happened, and will \ncontinue to happen, in the Ninth Circuit. We have added a judge here \nand there. But the overall size of the Ninth Circuit, even if you add \nmore judges, would not take care of the problems we are now \nexperiencing. Some have argued that adding more judges would fix the \nproblem, but it still would not\n\n[[Page S4732]]\n\nallow the full Ninth Circuit to hear many of the most difficult, \nchallenging cases. The judges of the ninth are not able to work \ntogether as a full circuit and collaborate on some of the most \ndifficult, challenging judicial cases.\n  That is why it is better to split up this circuit, so that more \nthoughtful decisions can be made in the administration of justice.\n  With that, I will yield the floor and ask my colleagues to support \nthis very important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from North Dakota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, April 22 marks the beginning of National \nCrime Victims' Rights Week, an annual commemoration that has been \nobserved since the early 1980s to honor crime victims and call \nattention to their plight.\n  We have an opportunity to provide full justice to many victims of \nfederal crime by passing legislation that will help federal criminal \njustice officials more fully recover court-order restitution that is \nowed to innocent crime victims. By ensuring victims receive the \nrestitution they are entitled to, our proposal truly reflects the theme \nof this year's Crime Victims' Rights Week--Victim's Rights: Every \nVictim, Every Time.\n  I intend to offer an amendment with Senator Grassley today that would \nimprove the collection of federal criminal debt. Our amendment is being \nsent over to the floor at this point. I will describe it and the reason \nfor offering it.\n  The amendment will be one in the form of a bill, S. 973, which I \nauthored with my colleague, Senator Grassley. We introduced it with \nSenators Durbin and Collins. It is called the Restitution for Victims \nOf Crime Act. This piece of legislation will give Justice Department \nofficials the tools they say are needed to help them do a better job of \ncollecting court-ordered Federal restitution and fines.\n  In our court system in this country, there are, in many cases, fines \nthat are levied against defendants who are found guilty of a crime. \nThey are adjudged to be guilty and, therefore, are levied a fine by the \ncourt. In many cases, they are required to make restitution through \norders of the court system. For some long while, I have been working on \nthis issue because I have discovered that in the Federal court system, \nJustice Department data shows that the amount of uncollected criminal \ndebt--that is, fines and restitution--is growing out of control. \nBelieve it or not, the uncollected Federal criminal debt is nearly $46 \nbillion. Think of that. It is almost $46 billion. These are fines that \nhave been levied in our Federal court system against defendants \nadjudged to have been guilty. Restitution orders have been made that \nrequire someone to make financial restitution; yet some $46 billion is \nthe amount of criminal debt that is unpaid. It is spiraling upward. It \nwas $41 billion just a year ago. When I first called attention to this \nproblem, it was well less than half of that. Yet very little has been \ndone.\n  In my State of North Dakota, the Federal courts have about $18.7 \nmillion of uncollected criminal debt. That is up some $4 million from \nthe preceding year. In my judgment, crime victims should not have to \nworry if those in charge of collecting the restitution on their behalf \nare making every effort to do so. We would expect that to be happening. \nYet it is not. In some cases, it is because the tools don't exist. In \nsome cases, it is because collecting the criminal debt has become kind \nof the backwater of the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n  At my request, GAO reviewed five white-collar financial fraud cases. \nWhat they have found is that certain offenders, those judged guilty, \nhad taken expensive trips abroad, traveled overseas; had fraudulently \nobtained millions of dollars in assets and converted those assets to \npersonal use. GAO also found offenders who had established businesses \nfor their children; held homes and lived in homes worth millions of \ndollars that were located in upscale neighborhoods. So here we have a \ncircumstance where we have people who have been judged guilty of \ncertain things by the Federal court system. They have been told you \nhave to pay a fine or you have to pay restitution. Yet despite the fact \nthat they have not made restitution or paid their fine, according to \nthe GAO evaluation at my request, some of them have decided we are not \ngoing to pay those things, we are going to take a trip overseas, live \nin multimillion dollar houses, we are going to transfer a business to \nthe children so federal justice officials cannot get at it.\n  All of this is going on at a time when victims are waiting for \nrestitution that has been ordered by the court. The proposal that \nSenator Grassley and I have authored is a proposal based on a set of \nrecommendations, some from the Justice Department, some from the task \nforce on improving the collection of criminal debt. Justice Department \nofficials believe the changes we suggest will remove many of the \ncurrent impediments to better debt collection.\n  Our legislation offers the tools that we think are necessary, having \nworked with Justice officials and others and victims' rights \norganizations, to deal with these issues. Justice Department officials \ndescribe, for example, a circumstance where they were prevented by a \ncourt from accessing $400,000 in a criminal offender's 401(k) plan to \npay a $4 million restitution debt to a victim. Let me say that again. \nThis is an offender who was judged to be guilty and who had $400,000 in \na 401(k) plan. He has been ordered to pay a $4 million restitution debt \nto a victim. The court said: No, you cannot take the $400,000 in the \n401(k) plan because the defendant was complying with a $250 minimum \nmonthly payment plan, and that precluded any other enforcement actions. \nSo he is sitting there with nearly half a million dollars in liquid \nassets, and the victim is sitting over here having been defrauded. The \ncourt said you must pay restitution, and this person with nearly half a \nmillion dollars in assets is paying $250 a month, and the court says \nthat is it, you cannot get the 401(k) funds from the victim. That is \nnot fair. Our proposal would remove impediments like this in the \nfuture.\n  This legislation will address another major problem identified by the \nGAO for officials in charge of criminal debt collection. Many years can \npass between the date a crime occurs and the date that a court will \norder restitution. That gives criminal defendants an ample opportunity \nto hide their ill-gotten gains. This bill sets up preconviction \nprocedures for preserving assets for victims' restitution. We set up \nthose preconviction circumstances--no, not to take the assets but at \nleast be sure they are going to be preserved in the event they are \nneeded for restitution.\n  These tools will ensure financial assets that are traceable to a \ncrime are going to be available when a court imposes a final \nrestitution order on behalf of a victim. These tools are similar to \nthose already used in some states and by Federal officials in certain \nasset forfeiture cases. The Restitution for Victims Of Crime Act that I \nhave introduced in the Senate as S. 973, with Senator Grassley and \nothers, has been endorsed by a number of organizations that are \nconcerned about the well-being of crime victims and the rights of \nvictims to receive the restitution ordered by federal courts: National \nCenter for Victims of Crime, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Parents of \nMurdered Children, Justice Solutions, and many others.\n  The U.S. attorney in North Dakota has said this legislation \n``represents important progress toward ensuring that victims of crime \nare one step closer to being made whole.''\n  I have mentioned S. 973, and that is what I intend to offer as an \namendment to the court security bill. I recognize the legislation \nitself doesn't deal with the narrower issue of the security of the \ncourts, but it certainly deals with the functioning of the courts and \nthe ability of a court to decide they are going to levy a fine or \nimpose a restitution order on a person judged guilty of a crime and \nthen be able to feel, at some point, they are going to be able to make \nthat happen.\n  I mentioned earlier U.S. Attorney's Offices, as most of us know, are \nabout investigating and prosecuting. They are involved when given \ninvestigation capability or given the results of investigations. If \nthey believe a criminal act has occurred, they are involved in \npreparing to go to court to prosecute criminal actions.\n\n  They have also been given the responsibility to collect fines and \nrestitutions. But the fact is, many U.S.\n\n[[Page S4733]]\n\nattorneys will admit they have a U.S. Attorney's Office that, by and \nlarge, in the front of that office is engaged in prosecuting \nwrongdoing, and in the back of that office, the collection of fines and \nrestitutions is not a high priority and, frankly, is difficult for many \nof them.\n  I don't come here with harsh criticism in those circumstances. But I \ndo say we should not stand for it, the Justice Department should not \nstand for it, and certainly victims should not stand for a circumstance \nwhere some $46 billion in court-ordered fines and restitution remains \nuncollected, while at least some are taking trips to London and have \n$400,000 in 401(k) accounts, are hiding their assets by transferring \nbusinesses to children, living in multimillion-dollar homes and \ndeciding they won't pay the fines, they won't pay the restitution, and \nnothing much is going to happen to them because we are not very \naggressive on behalf of victims or on behalf of this country in getting \nthose fines and restitutions paid.\n  That is not the right course for this country. I plan offer the \namendment shortly to address this problem. I am checking with Senator \nGrassley for his cosponsorship. As I indicated, he was the primary \ncosponsor when we introduced the legislation earlier this year.\n  I hope that perhaps we can consider this legislation as an amendment \nthat would be added to the court security bill.\n  Regarding the court security bill, I am pleased this bill is before \nthe Senate. It is rather strange we had to have a recorded vote on \nwhether we would have a motion to proceed to go to a court security \nbill, but I guess that is the strange, Byzantine circumstances of \nlegislative activities these days in the Senate.\n  Now that it is before the Senate, this is important business, and we \nshould proceed to consider amendments and then pass this legislation \nand move to the other issues that are before us.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Contracting Abuses\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are considering the court security \nbill. At the moment, there is no one who wishes to speak on that \nlegislation. I wish to speak about the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nwhich is now holding a hearing. I just finished testifying before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. I wish to talk about that testimony.\n  The Armed Services Committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Carl \nLevin, is holding a hearing this morning on contracting abuses; that \nis, contracting abuses in Iraq especially under what is called the \nLOGCAP contract.\n  I testified that I chaired in the Democratic Policy Committee, over \nthe last 3 years, 10 hearings on these issues of contract abuses. I \nsuggested to the Armed Services Committee that they look into what is \nnot only called the LOGCAP, which is a logistic contract which, in this \ncase, Halliburton, or their subsidiary, KBR, provided certain logistics \nassistance to the Department of the Army under a contract worth \nbillions of dollars, I suggested they also look into the RIO contract, \nwhich is Restore Iraqi Oil contract.\n  I pointed out to them that the woman who rose to become the highest \ncontract official in the U.S. Corps of Engineers--she rose to become \nthe highest civilian contract official in the Army Corps of Engineers--\nshe said the awarding of the RIO contract, the Restore Iraqi Oil \ncontract--Restore Iraqi Oil is what RIO stands for--to Halliburton and \nKBR was ``the most blatant contracting abuse I have seen in my entire \ncareer.'' This is from the top civilian contracting officer.\n  What happened to her? She paid for that with her job. For that she \nwas demoted. Before she said that publicly, she was given outstanding \nevaluations every year. Once she said publicly what she had told them \nprivately, and they ignored, they began the process of giving her \nperformance evaluations that were inferior for demotion.\n  A couple of nights ago, I called the general, now retired, who \nbrought this contracting officer in as the top civilian contracting \nofficer. I said: What's the story?\n  He said: She has been dealt an awful hand, and it has been very \nunfair to her. She is a straight-shooter, she is competent, she speaks \nthe truth. The fact is, she is paying for telling the truth.\n  I suggested to the Armed Services Committee that this woman, named \nBunnatine Greenhouse, who had the courage to speak out against \ncontracting abuse, should be called to testify.\n  We ought to put a stop to this stuff that when someone in the Federal \nGovernment speaks out and says there is abuse occurring, the taxpayers \nare being abused, the soldiers are being disserved, that somehow they \ninjure their career by telling the truth. But let me go on.\n  I suggested the committee look into the RIO contract. I sent the \nissues raised by Bunnatine Greenhouse, who paid for her honesty with \nher job: she was demoted. I sent all that material to the inspector \ngeneral. Seventeen months ago, I got a letter from the inspector \ngeneral saying they received it, they looked into all those \nallegations, it has now been referred to the Justice Department, it is \nfor their action, and because it is a criminal matter, they would not \ncomment further.\n  Obviously, they believed there was something that was serious. That \nis the RIO, the Restore Iraq Oil contract.\n\n  There is another contract, and that is the purpose of the hearing \nthis morning, the LOGCAP contract, once again, given to Halliburton and \ntheir subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown and Root. What I told them this \nmorning is what I found in 10 hearings. I held up a white towel, a \nwhite hand towel that most would recognize. It hangs in the bathrooms \nin most homes.\n  A man named Henry Bunting came to us. Henry Bunting was in Kuwait. He \nwas actually buying supplies for the troops in Iraq. Henry Bunting was \na purchaser for KBR in Kuwait. They said to Henry Bunting: Buy some \ntowels for the troops. So Henry goes about buying towels for the \ntroops. But then the supervisor said: No, you can't buy those towels. \nYou have to buy towels that have the embroidered name of KBR on the \ntowel, triple the cost. Henry said it would cost a lot of money. It \ndoesn't matter, the taxpayers are paying for this, cost plus. Triple \nthe price of the towels so you can put the embroidered initials of the \ncompany on the towels.\n  How about $45 for a case of Coca-Cola? How about $7,500 a month to \nlease an SUV? Henry Bunting told us about that as well.\n  I described the other issues. Rory Mayberry--Rory showed up at a \nhearing. He was a food service supervisor for KBR in Iraq at a \ncafeteria. He said he was told by his supervisor: Don't you dare talk \nto Government auditors when they show up. If you do, you will get fired \nor you will get sent to an active combat zone. Don't you dare talk to a \nGovernment auditor.\n  He said: We routinely provided food to the soldiers that had expired \ndate stamps on it.\n  The supervisor said: It doesn't matter--the expired date stamps--feed \nthe expired food to the troops.\n  We know from previous press accounts that at one point that company \nwas charging for 42,000 meals a day to soldiers when they were actually \nonly feeding 14,000 soldiers. Rory said the same thing. Rory Mayberry, \na supervisor in one of the KBR food service situations in Iraq said \nthey were charging for meals for soldiers who weren't there, and the \nsupervisor said: We are doing that because we had lost money \npreviously, so now we are charging for meals that aren't being served \nto soldiers.\n  How about an eyewitness to an $85,000 brand new truck left beside the \nroad in a noncombat zone in Iraq to be torched because they didn't have \nthe proper wrench to fix the tire? It doesn't matter, the American \ntaxpayer is going to buy the new truck, cost plus.\n\n[[Page S4734]]\n\n  The list is almost endless. It is unbelievable the stories we have \nheard from people who wish to come forward.\n  One company, the same company under the LOGCAP contract, was to \nprovide water to the military bases in Iraq--all of the bases. A \nwhistleblower came to me and said: I have something you should see. It \nis a 21-page internal report, and it is written by a man named Will \nGranger who is in charge of all water going to the bases in Iraq. He is \nthe KBR employee, Halliburton employee in charge of all water that goes \nto the bases in Iraq.\n  He said instead of treating the water, nonpotable water which \nsoldiers use to shower, shave, sometimes brush their teeth, and so on, \ninstead of treating the water as it was supposed to have been treated \nunder the contract, the water was more contaminated with E coli and \nbacteria than raw water from the Euphrates River.\n  He said: Here is the internal report. The internal report said this \nwas a near miss. It could have caused mass sickness or death.\n  That was from the internal report I had in my hand. The company said \nit never happened. This is the internal report made by the man in the \ncompany whose name is Will Granger, who said: Here is what we \ndiscovered.\n  Just after I held the hearing and described this situation, I \nreceived an e-mail from a young woman in Iraq who was an Army \nphysician. She said: I read about this hearing about the water issue, \nthe nonpotable water which was more contaminated than raw water from \nthe Euphrates River that was being used for nonpotable water for \nsoldiers. She said: It has happened on my base as well. She said: I \nstarted seeing these illnesses, conditions with the soldiers, and I had \na lieutenant follow the waterline back. It is exactly the same \ncircumstance--untreated water. We were paying for it, and the company \nwasn't doing what the contract requires, putting at risk those \nsoldiers. The company denied it happened, but it is in black and white. \nThe evidence exists.\n  I described these issues and other issues this morning to the Armed \nServices Committee. I am pleased they are holding hearings. It is long \npast the time for them to hold these oversight hearings finding out \nwhat is happening and what we can do about it.\n  Mr. President, these are important issues. I commend Senator Levin, \nSenator Warner, and all members of the Armed Services Committee for \ntaking a serious look at these issues. My interest is not in tarnishing \nany company or anything like that. My interest is in making sure the \nAmerican taxpayers are not disserved, and they have been. And my \ninterest is the American soldiers are treated properly, and they have \nnot been. What I saw with the waste, fraud, and abuse with these \ncontracts, in my judgment, is a disservice to the American taxpayer and \na disservice to the country's soldiers, and the fact is, we can fix \nthis.\n\n  I will describe at a later time the legislation I have introduced \nthat deals with these contracting abuses so we can prevent them from \never happening again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am speaking in favor of S. 378, the \nCourt Security Improvement Act of 2007. I have had a personal \nexperience with court security issues when I was a prosecutor, the \nchief prosecutor in Hennepin County.\n  We had a very tragic incident, where a woman who had emotional \ndifficulties came into our courthouse with a gun and gunned down a \nwoman--an innocent woman--who was the guardian of her father's estate \nand was simply there to help. This had been a long-standing litigation \nbattle. She tracked her down at the courthouse and shot her to death, \nand shot her own lawyer. Fortunately, he did not die. He survived. But \nthis happened only a few floors below my office. We went on to \nprosecute this woman, and she was convicted and sentenced to life in \nprison for the murder and an additional 15 years for the attempted \nmurder.\n  That is why I am such a strong proponent of this bill. The Court \nSecurity Improvement Act will significantly improve our ability to \nprotect judicial officials and all those who help to protect the fair \nand impartial justice system in America.\n  The bill is going to improve court security by, first, enhancing \nmeasures that protect judicial personnel, witnesses, and family members \nof judicial personnel. I should note there is a provision in the bill \nthat allows for State courthouses to apply for grants for things such \nas witness protection.\n  I will say, coming from running an office of nearly 400 people, but \noperating in a local court system as opposed to the Federal system, \nthere are increasing problems for local prosecutors with witness \nprotection. I can't even count the number of witnesses we had \nthreatened during trials. We had a juror threatened who actually had to \nget off the case after a call was made to her home during a trial in a \ngang case. We are seeing an increasing number of cases where we have \nwitnesses threatened. Obviously, we don't have the Federal Witness \nProtection Program in a local district attorney's office, so I am very \npleased there are some provisions for this and some realization that \nthis is a growing issue.\n  This bill would also increase funding for judicial security at the \nFederal and State levels. It would strengthen the relevant criminal \npenalties. It would authorize funds for the U.S. Marshals Service for \njudicial security. This is a good bill, and I stand in support of it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, we hear much from the Bush administration \nand our Republican friends, almost on a daily basis, about how \nwonderfully our economy is doing. I recall not so long ago being at a \nBudget Committee hearing when we heard the Secretary of the Treasury, \nMr. Paulson, indicating in fact that the economy is doing ``just \nmarvelous.''\n  Yet, for obvious reasons, the American people do not seem to agree \nwith the Bush administration or with our Republican friends as to how \nwell the economy is doing. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record segments of two polls that were recently released, one by \nCBS News and one by Gallup.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             CBS News Poll\n\n    [Conducted 4/9-12/07; surveyed 994 adults; margin of error  3% \n   (release, 4/15).

More generally, \n     a large majority of Americans support the principle that \n     wealth should be more evenly distributed in America, and an \n     increasing number--although still a minority--say there are \n     too many rich people in the country. Attitudes toward heavy \n     taxes on the rich are strongly related to one's own income, \n     and Democrats are much more likely to be in favor of income \n     redistribution than are Republicans.\n       Basic Trends\n       A poll commissioned by Fortune Magazine in 1939 and \n     conducted by famous pollster Elmo Roper included a question \n     phrased as follows:\n       ``People feel differently about how far a government should \n     go. Here is a phrase which some people believe in and some \n     don't. Do you think our government should or should not \n     redistribute wealth by heavy taxes on the rich?''\n       At that time, near the end of the Depression, only a \n     minority of Americans, 35%, said the government should impose \n     heavy taxes on the rich in order to redistribute wealth. A \n     slight majority--54%--said the government should not. (Eleven \n     percent did not have an opinion.)\n       Gallup asked this question again in 1998 and found the \n     percentage willing to say that the government should \n     redistribute wealth had gone up by 10 points (while the ``no \n     opinion'' responses had dropped to 4% and the negative stayed \n     slightly above 50%).\n       Now, the attitudes have shifted slightly again, to the \n     point where Americans' sentiment in response to this question \n     is roughly split, with 49% saying the government should \n     redistribute wealth by heavy taxes on the rich, and 47% \n     disagreeing.\n       People feel differently about how far a government should \n     go. Here is a phrase which some people believe in and some \n     don't.

The percentage of Americans who say there are too many \n     rich people in the United States--although still a minority--\n     is up significantly from the two times in the 1990s when this \n     question was asked.\n       In summary, the data show that:\n       A significant majority of Americans feel that money and \n     wealth should be distributed more equally across a larger \n     percentage of the population.\n       A significant majority of Americans feel that the rich pay \n     too little in taxes.\n       About half of Americans support the idea of ``heavy'' taxes \n     on the rich to help redistribute wealth.\n       Almost 4 out of 10 Americans flat-out say there are ``too \n     many'' rich people in the country\n\n\n                              Implications\n\n       Most societies experience tensions revolving around \n     inequalities of wealth among those societies' members. This \n     seemingly inevitable fact of life has been at the core of \n     revolutions throughout history. American society has been \n     immune from massive revolts of those at the bottom end of the \n     spectrum in part because the public perceives that the United \n     States is an open society with upward social mobility. A \n     recent Gallup Poll found a majority of Americans believing \n     that people who make a lot of money deserve it, and that \n     almost anyone can get rich if they put their mind to it. And \n     a 2003 Gallup Poll found that about a third of Americans, \n     including a significantly higher percentage of younger \n     Americans, believed that they themselves would one day be \n     rich.\n       The findings reviewed in this report most likely reflect at \n     least in part the fact that it is easy to advocate greater \n     taxation of the rich, since most Americans do not consider \n     themselves rich.\n       In fact, a 2003 Gallup Poll found that the median annual \n     income that Americans considered ``rich'' was $122,000. Since \n     the average income in America is markedly below that, it \n     follows that most Americans do not consider themselves rich. \n     (Eighty percent of Americans put themselves in the middle \n     class, working class, or lower class. Only 1 % identify \n     themselves as being in the upper class, while 19% are willing \n     to say the upper middle class.)\n       The data show that as one gets closer to being what \n     Americans consider rich, one is also less interested in the \n     rich being taxed heavily. This relationship is fairly linear; \n     the more money one makes in general, the more likely one is \n     to say that the government should not be imposing heavy taxes \n     on the rich.\n       People feel differently about how far a government should \n     go. Here is a phrase which some people believe in and some \n     don't.

About half of Americans are willing to \n     go so far as advocate ``heavy taxes'' on the rich in order to \n     redistribute wealth. These findings are despite the belief of \n     many Americans that the rich deserve their money and the \n     hopes Americans themselves harbor that they will be rich some \n     day.\n       From a political viewpoint, these data suggest that a \n     political platform focused on addressing the problems of the \n     lower and middle classes contrasted with the rich, including \n     heavier taxes on the upper class, could meet with significant \n     approval, particularly among Democrats and those with lower \n     incomes.\n\n\n                             Survey Methods\n\n       These results are based on telephone interviews with a \n     randomly selected national sample of 1,008 adults, aged 18 \n     and older, conducted April 2-5, 2007. For results based on \n     this sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the maximum \n     error attributable to sampling and other random effects is  3 \n     percentage points. In addition to sampling error, question \n     wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can \n     introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion \n     polls.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. When the American people were asked by CBS News the \nquestion, ``Do you think the economy is getting better, getting worse \nor staying about the same?'' 11 percent of the American people said the \neconomy is getting better, 44 percent thought it was getting worse, and \n44 percent thought it was about the same.\n  Then, interestingly, in that same poll, when the American people were \nasked by CBS the question, ``Over the past 10 years, do you think life \nfor middle class Americans has gotten better or worse?'' 30 percent \nsaid life has gotten better, 59 percent, almost a 2-to-1 margin, said \nlife is getting worse, and 7 percent said the same.\n  Technology has exploded in recent years. Our workers are far more \nproductive than used to be the case. Yet by a 2-to-1 margin the \nAmerican people have said that life for the middle class is getting \nworse, not better.\n  In terms of the Gallup Poll, the Gallup people, from April 2 to April \n5, asked some very interesting questions that we very often do not \nspeak about here on the floor of the Senate. In my view, what we have \nseen since President Bush has been in office, in a general sense, is \nthe shrinking of the middle class, an increase in poverty, and a \ngrowing gap between the rich and the poor--not something we talk about \nterribly often on the floor of the Senate, not something that is talked \nabout terribly often in the corporate media. But here is the question, \nvery interestingly, that Gallup asked the American people, between \nApril 2 and April 5: ``Do you feel that the distribution of money and \nwealth in this country today is fair, or do you feel that the money and \nwealth in this country should be more evenly distributed among a larger \npercentage of the people?'' Answer: Distribution is fair, 29 percent; \nshould be more evenly distributed, 66 percent.\n  Then the next question they asked, which was rather a clumsy \nquestion, I thought, and I was surprised by the answer, but this was \nthe question. Question: ``People feel differently about how far a \ngovernment should go. Here is a phrase which some people believe in and \nsome don't. Do you think our Government should or should not \nredistribute wealth by heavy taxes on the rich?''\n  That is a pretty clumsy question. Do you know what the answer was to \nthat rather clumsy question? Yes, should redistribute wealth, 49 \npercent; no, should not, 47 percent.\n  I mention this poll because it is important to understand that \ndespite a lot of the rhetoric we hear from the White House and on the \nfloor of the Senate, the American people understand that in terms of \nour economy, something is fundamentally wrong. They understand it \nbecause they are living the experience of working longer hours for \nlower wages; of working day after day, trying to pay the bills for \ntheir family, trying to send their kids to college, trying to take care \nof health care, trying to provide childcare for their kids. They know \nthe reality of the economy because they are the economy.\n  Every single day the people of our country are seeing an economy \nwhich is forcing them in many instances to work longer hours for lower \nwages, an economy in which they wonder how their kids are going to be \nable to go to college, able to afford college; an economy in which they \nworry that for the first time in the modern history of our country, \ntheir children will see a lower standard of living than they do. That \nis the reality of the economy, in the eyes, I believe, of millions of \nAmerican workers.\n  That perception that the American worker has of the economy is, in my \nview, the correct perception of what is going on. Since George W. Bush \nhas been President, more than 5 million Americans have slipped into \npoverty, including 1 million children. This country now has the very \ndubious distinction of having by far the highest rate of childhood \npoverty of any major industrialized country on Earth. How do you have a \ngreat economy, a booming economy, when 5 million more Americans have \nslipped into poverty? Median income has declined in our country for 5 \nyears in a row. Americans understand that the economy is not doing well \nwhen the personal savings rate is below zero, which has not happened \nsince the Great Depression. How do we talk about a strong economy when \n7 million Americans have lost their health insurance since President \nBush has been in office, and when we now have, unbelievably, 47 million \nAmericans who have no health insurance at all?\n  How can anybody come to the floor of the Senate, or anybody in the \nBush administration talk about a strong economy, when we have 47 \nmillion Americans who have no health insurance at all; when 35 million \nAmericans in our country, the richest country in the history of the \nworld, struggled to put food on the table last year; and the number of \nthe poorest, most hungry Americans keeps getting larger? The American \npeople understand this is not an economy that is working for ordinary \npeople. In this economy today, more and more of our brothers and \nsisters, our fellow Americans, are going hungry. Let's not talk about a \nbooming economy when we have children in America who are hungry.\n  Mr. President, you and I have heard, over and over again, people \ntalking about the importance of education for this country. Yet \nmillions of working families do not know how they are going to be able \nto send their kids to college when the cost of college education is \nsoaring, when the average person graduating a 4-year college leaves \nthat school $20,000 in debt, when hundreds of thousands of young people \nare now giving up the dream of going to college because they don't want \nto come out deeply in debt? How do we talk about a booming economy when \nso many of our young people, some of the brightest, most able of our \nyoung people, are giving up the dream of going to college? How do you \ncompete on the international and global economy if so many of our young \npeople are not able to get the kind of education they need?\n  When we talk about a booming economy, how does that correlate with \nthe fact that our manufacturing infrastructure is falling apart, that \nsince President Bush has been in office we have lost over 3 million \ngood manufacturing jobs, and when people go out to the store to shop, \nwhen they look at the product, they know where that product is \nmanufactured today? It is not manufactured in the United States. Over \nand over again they see it is manufactured in China.\n\n[[Page S4737]]\n\n  We have a trade deficit now of over $700 billion. In my small State \nof Vermont, not a manufacturing center, we lost 20 percent of our \nmanufacturing jobs in the last 5 years and that phenomenon is going on \nall over this country. How do you have a booming economy when we are \nlosing huge numbers of good-paying manufacturing jobs and we are on the \ncusp of losing millions of good-paying, white-collar information \ntechnology jobs?\n  Three million fewer American workers today have pension coverage than \nwhen President Bush took office. Half of private sector American \nworkers have no pension coverage whatsoever. How does that speak to a \nstrong economy? It was not so many years ago that workers understood \nthat when they left their job, there would be a defined pension \navailable to them. They knew what they were getting. Today, those days \nseem like ancient history. Fewer and fewer workers have solid pensions \non which to depend.\n  What is important to understand is, while poverty is increasing, \nwhile the middle class is shrinking, while more and more people are \nlosing their health insurance, while hunger is growing in America, \nwhile good-paying jobs are going to China, the truth is not all is bad \nin the American economy. We have to acknowledge that. Are there some \npeople who in fact are doing well? The answer is yes. Today, the simple \ntruth is the top 1 percent of the families in our country have not had \nit so good since the 1920s. When that poll I mentioned from Gallup \ntalks about the American people wanting to seek an understanding of the \nunfair distribution of wealth, this is precisely what they are \nreferring to.\n  Today in the United States we have by far the most unequal \ndistribution of income and wealth of any major country on Earth. Let me \nhighlight very briefly a recent study done by Professor Emmanuel Saez \nfrom the University of California-Berkeley and Professor Thomas Piketty \nfrom the Paris School of Economics. This is what they found. In 2005, \nwhile average incomes for the bottom 90 percent of Americans declined \nby $172, the wealthiest one one-hundredth of 1 percent reported an \naverage income of $25.7 million, a 1-year increase of $4.4 million.\n  In other words, for the people at the very top, a huge increase in \ntheir income, while 90 percent of the American people saw a decline. \nThe gap between the rich and the poor, the rich and the middle class, \ncontinues to grow wider.\n  The top 1 percent of Americans received, in 2005, the largest share \nof national income since 1928. And some people may remember what \nhappened in 1929. The top 300,000 Americans now earn nearly as much \nincome as the bottom 150 million Americans combined.\n  You and I have heard many of our friends here on the other side of \nthe aisle talk about how much the wealthy are paying in taxes. My, my, \nmy. Yet the reason for that is what we are seeing is, with the decline \nof the middle class, a huge increase in the percentage of the income \nbeing made by the people on top. Let me repeat it. The top 300,000 \nAmericans now earn nearly as much income as the bottom 150 million \nAmericans. Is that the kind of country we really want to become, with \nso few having so much and so many having so little? I do not think that \nis the America most people want to see us evolve into, an oligarchic \nform of society. That is wrong.\n  According to Forbes magazine, the collective net worth of the \nwealthiest 400 Americans increased by $120 billion last year to $1.25 \ntrillion--$1.25 trillion for the wealthiest 400 Americans. That is an \nastounding number. The reality is that in America today, we have the \npeople on the top who have more income, in some cases, than they are \ngoing to be able to spend in a thousand lifetimes, while people in \nVermont, people in Ohio, people in Minnesota, people all over our \ncountry are struggling so hard to provide basic needs for their \nfamilies.\n  One of the reasons the gap between the rich and the poor is growing \nwider and why we now have by far the most unequal distribution of \nincome and wealth of any major country is due to the passage of massive \ntax breaks for millionaires and billionaires since President Bush has \nbeen in office.\n  Now, you stop and you take a look at the needs of the people of our \ncountry in the most basic sense.\n  Hunger is increasing. Well, what do we think? Should we eliminate \nhunger in America or do you give tax breaks to billionaires? I don't \nthink too many people would disagree with what we should be doing.\n  We have a crisis in affordable childcare in America. We have single \nmoms, working families, both parents going to work, trying to provide \nwell for their 2-year-old, 3-year-old. They cannot provide affordable \nchildcare. The Federal Government provides totally inadequate \nchildcare. Do we increase funding for childcare or do we give tax \nbreaks to millionaires?\n  We are all aware of the scandal at Walter Reed Hospital. We are all \naware of the outrageously inadequate way we treat our veterans, men and \nwomen who put their lives on the line defending this country. Yet when \nthey come home from Iraq, there is inadequate care at the hospital at \nWalter Reed and inadequate care and waiting lines at VA hospitals all \nover America. What is our priority? Do we take care of our veterans or \ndo we give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires?\n  In America, millions of children do not have any health insurance. \nWhat are our priorities?\n  People are paying 50 percent of their limited income for housing \nbecause we are not building affordable housing. What are our \npriorities?\n  We have a major crisis in global warming. We should be investing in \nsustainable energy, energy efficiency, not giving tax breaks to \nbillionaires. What are our priorities?\n  Let me conclude by saying that I think the American people, on issue \nafter issue, are far ahead of where we are in Congress. So we are going \nto have to work very hard to catch up to where the American people are. \nI think we should begin the process of doing that.\n  We need to fundamentally change our national priorities. We have to \nhave the courage now to stand up to the wealthiest people and the \nlargest corporations and say to those people: The free ride is over.\n  Our job is to represent the middle class, working families, the lower \nincome people who are not getting justice from the Congress. When we \nstand and do the right thing for the middle class and working families \nof this country, I believe we are going to see a significant increase \nin the respect this body receives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this crucial \nlegislation. I want to read into the record a statement from the Bush \nadministration in support of the bill. It is from the Executive Office \nof the President, Statement of Administration Policy:\n\n       The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 378 to \n     strengthen judicial security. The legislation would enhance \n     the ability of the Federal government to prosecute \n     individuals who attack or threaten participants in the \n     Nation's judicial system, including judges, lawyers, \n     witnesses, and law enforcement officers. A Nation founded on \n     the rule of law must protect the integrity of its judicial \n     system, which must apply the law without fear or favor. The \n     Administration also supports the provision to prohibit the \n     filing of false liens against judges, prosecutors, and other \n     government officials to retaliate against them for the \n     performance of their official duties.\n\n  Another of the most important provisions of this bill was brought to \nour attention by Judge Carr of the Northern District Court in Toledo, \nOH. Judge Carr pointed out the importance of section 101 that \n``enhances the ability of the Judicial Conference of the United States \nto participate in determining the security needs of the judicial branch \nby requiring the Director of the U.S. Marshals Service . . . to consult \nwith the Judicial Conference on an ongoing basis regarding the security \nrequirements of the judicial branch.''\n  This legislation makes sense for a variety of reasons. Not only must \nour judges be protected, but they must have a seat at the table in \ndetermining\n\n[[Page S4738]]\n\nthe safety of our Federal courthouses and the personal safety of the \nemployees of the Federal judiciary and the participants who come in \nfront of the Federal bench.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment before us that will split the Ninth Circuit. We will be \nvoting on a point of order at 2 o'clock.\n  I think it is very unfortunate that the pending bill, to make much-\nneeded improvements in the security of our judges, is being threatened \nby a rehashing of an old and bad idea to split the circuit. There is a \nraft of reasons why the Senate should defeat this effort to divide the \nNinth Circuit. First, it would be a serious blow to judicial \nindependence if the circuit were to be split because of disagreement \nwith its decisions. It would also result in an unfair distribution of \nthe Ninth Circuit caseload. Judges in the new Ninth Circuit would be \nmuch more busy than their counterparts on the Twelfth Circuit. The \nproposal that is being made by Senator Ensign essentially takes \nCalifornia, Hawaii, Guam, and the Mariana Islands and puts them into \ntheir own Ninth Circuit, and takes all the big continental States that \nare now part of the Ninth Circuit and creates a Twelfth Circuit. That \nis the proposal that is before the body now.\n  This proposal would also destroy the current uniformity of the law in \nthe West. It would have significant costs that the judiciary cannot \nafford to bear, given its already tight budgets, and it is opposed by \nthe vast majority of the people who know the circuit best: its judges. \nVirtually overwhelmingly I think all but three or four of the judges in \nthe Ninth Circuit oppose its splitting.\n  I agree with many of the Ninth Circuit's decisions. I disagree with \nsome of them. However, the Framers of the Constitution intended the \njudiciary to be independent and free from congressional or Presidential \npressure or reprisal. I am concerned that recent attempts to split the \nNinth Circuit are part of an assault on the independence of the \njudiciary by those who disagree with some of the court's rulings.\n  As former Gov. Pete Wilson has stated:\n\n       These attempts are judicial ``gerrymandering,'' designed to \n     isolate and punish judges whose decisions some disagree with. \n     They are antithetical to the Constitution.\n\n  That is not me saying that; that is the former Republican Governor of \nCalifornia.\n  Attempting to coerce or punish judges or rig the system is not an \nappropriate response to disagreements with a court's decisions. Rather, \nit is essential that we preserve our system of checks and balances and \nmake it clear that politicians will not meddle in the work of judges. \nThe configuration of the Ninth Circuit is not set in stone; however, \nany change to the Ninth Circuit should be guided by concerns of \nefficiency and administration, not ideology.\n  After a substantial review of the statistics, decisions, and reports \nfrom those who know the circuit best, it is clear that splitting the \nNinth Circuit would hinder its mission of providing justice for the \npeople of the West.\n  The split proposal before us would unfairly distribute judicial \nresources to the West. This is the key. The Ninth Circuit would keep 71 \npercent of the caseload of the current circuit but only 58 percent of \nits permanent judges. Any split we look at, because California is so \nbig, tilts the circuit and, of course, all of the proponents of the \ncircuit split take the judges with them. So it leaves a \ndisproportionate share of a heavy caseload in the Ninth Circuit--unless \nyou split California, and to split California creates a host of \ntechnical and legal problems.\n  Last year, the Ninth Circuit had a caseload of 570 cases per judge, \nas opposed to a national average of 381 cases per judge. So under the \nproposed split, the Ensign plan, the average caseload in the new Ninth \nCircuit would actually increase to 600 cases per judge, while the new \nTwelfth Circuit would have half that, 326 cases per judge. There is no \neffort to give the Ninth the new judges they would need to keep the \ncaseload even. This inequitable division of resources would leave \nresidents of California and Hawaii facing greater delays and with court \nservices inferior to their Twelfth Circuit neighbors.\n  The uniformity of law in the West is a key advantage of the Ninth \nCircuit, offering consistency to States that share many common \nconcerns. The size of the Ninth Circuit is an asset, offering a unified \nlegal approach to issues from immigration to the environment. Dividing \nthe circuit would make solving these problems even more difficult. For \nexample, splitting the circuit could result in different \ninterpretations in California and Arizona of laws that govern \nimmigration, different applications of environmental regulations on the \nCalifornia and Nevada sides of Lake Tahoe, and different intellectual \nproperty law in Silicon Valley and the Seattle technology corridor. \nThese differences would have real economic costs. These are border \nStates, and trade and commerce in the Pacific is a huge part of what \nthey do. Therefore, the legal consistency between them is an asset, not \na disadvantage.\n  In a time of tight judicial budgets, splitting the circuit would add \nsignificant and unnecessary expense. The split actually would require \nadditional Federal funds to duplicate the current staff of the Ninth \nCircuit and a new or expanded courthouse and an administrative building \nsince existing judicial facilities for a Twelfth Circuit are \ninadequate. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts estimated that \ncreating a Twelfth Circuit would have a startup cost of $96 million, \nwith another $16 million in annual recurring cost.\n  If we are going to do anything, what we need is more judges on the \nNinth Circuit. That is the key. With budget pressures already forcing \nour Federal courts to cut staff and curtail services, this is no time \nto impose new, unnecessary costs on the judiciary.\n  My colleague, Senator Barbara Boxer, joins me in these remarks. She \nwill have a separate statement.\n  Those who know the Ninth Circuit best overwhelming oppose the split. \nOf the active Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judges, 18 oppose the \nsplit, to be exact, and only 3 support it. The district court and \nbankruptcy judges of the Ninth Circuit also oppose the split. Every \nState bar association that has weighed in on the split--Alaska, \nArizona, Hawaii, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington--opposes \nbreaking up the Ninth Circuit, and more than 100 different national, \nregional, and local organizations have written to urge that the Ninth \nCircuit be kept intact.\n  I believe splitting the Ninth Circuit would create more problems \nright now than it would solve. It will not solve the caseload problem \nof the circuit, and that is the critical issue. Those who propose the \nsplit do so to unfairly benefit themselves because they also take the \njudges from the Ninth Circuit and they add them to the Twelfth Circuit. \nThey would end up having a caseload per judge of one-half of what the \ncaseload would be in a new Ninth Circuit. So it is not a fair plan \nbecause it does not fairly distribute the resources based on caseload. \nI believe there is only one criterion for resources, and that is \ncaseload. The judges must be where the cases are, and that should be an \ninescapable truth that we follow.\n  I urge the Senate to vote to sustain the point of order on the Ensign \namendment to split the Ninth Circuit, and instead let's focus our \nattention on securing the courts and then, secondly, providing the \njudges who are necessary to equalize caseloads throughout the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 505(a) of H. Con. Res. 95, the concurrent resolution \non the budget for fiscal year 2004; that at 2 p.m. today, a vote occur \non Senator Ensign's motion to waive the point of order, considered made \nby this agreement, with the time until 2 p.m. equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Feinstein and Ensign or their designees; \nthat if the motion to waive the Budget Act is not successful, then \nwithout further intervening action or debate, the bill be read a third \ntime and the Senate vote\n\n[[Page S4739]]\n\non passage of the bill; that if the motion to waive the Budget Act is \nsuccessful, the provision on third reading and passage be vitiated.\n  I ask that the preceding be done by unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to sustain the \nbudget point of order because the underlying amendment, which would \nsplit the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is not yet ripe for \nconsideration by this body. The issue is a very complicated one as to \nwhat will happen with the Ninth Circuit. It is admittedly too large at \nthe present time, but we have a lot of analysis to do as to which \nStates ought to be in which divisions. It is an issue which the \nJudiciary Committee has wrestled with for some time. We took it up in \nthe 109th Congress. The two confirmations of Chief Justice Roberts and \nJustice Alito took a great deal of time, as did the PATRIOT Act, and \nour bankruptcy legislation and class action reform, the confirmation \nprocess generally. I know Senator Leahy, as chairman, plans to take up \nthis issue as soon as we can do so. We are not ripe for action.\n  When we finish the next vote, we will be taking up final passage on \nthe Court Security Act. I urge my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation. There is no doubt that there is a real threat to judges. \nWe have seen violence right in the courtroom. We have seen violence \nagainst family members of Federal judges. We have seen the \nextraordinary situation that in April of 2005, cookies with rat poison \nwere mailed to each of the nine Supreme Court Justices, also to FBI \nDirector Robert Mueller, and others in the Federal establishment.\n  The core legislation was introduced during the 109th Congress in \nNovember 7, 2005. It passed unanimously. We need to pass it now to make \nsome very important changes to provide for the security of our Federal \njudges.\n  I see the arrival of the Senator from California who has raised a \nbudget point of order. I know we plan to vote imminently.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the \nEnsign amendment. Splitting the circuit would have detrimental effects \non the West--in particular, in my home State of Montana. Splitting the \nNinth Circuit would eliminate uniformity of law in the West. States \nsharing common concerns such as the environment and Native American \nrights could end up with different rules of law. This would create \nconfusion and cause serious problems between States.\n  And splitting the Ninth Circuit would impose huge new costs. A split \nwould require new Federal funds for courthouses and administrative \nbuildings. Existing judicial facilities are just not equipped for a new \ncircuit. The Administrative Office estimates these start-up costs to be \n$96 million, and then $16 million in annual recurring costs under the \nproposed split. The judiciary budget is already stretched thin. The \ncreation of a new and costly bureaucracy to administer the new circuit \nwould just add to our growing deficit. And this proposal does not have \nthe support of the people whom it will most directly affect.\n  Judges on the circuit oppose the split. Members of the State bars \naffected by the split oppose it. And almost 100 Federal, State, and \nlocal organizations oppose splitting the Ninth Circuit. Only 3 of the \n26 active judges on the Ninth Circuit favor splitting the circuit. Many \nState bars oppose this proposal including Alaska, Washington, Nevada, \nHawaii, and Arizona. Even the Federal Bar Association and the appellate \nsection of the Oregon bar feel strongly that we should not split the \nNinth Circuit. The State Bar of Montana does not support this proposal. \nThe Montana bar unanimously passed a resolution opposing division of \nthe Ninth Circuit.\n  We ought to be listening to the people on the ground who deal with \nthis issue every day, not creating hardship from our offices in DC. \nLet's be frank here. The motivation behind splitting the circuit is \npolitical. It is an attempt to control the decisions of the judiciary \nby rearranging the bench. The judiciary is supposed to be an \nindependent branch of government. It must remain so. Splitting the \ncircuit is not the right thing to do for Montana. It is not the right \nthing to do for the country.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, once again we are faced with a proposal to \nsplit the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes my home State \nof California.\n  The amendment before us today would create a ``new'' Ninth Circuit, \nwith California, Hawaii, and Guam, and a new 12th Circuit, consisting \nof other Western States.\n  I oppose this amendment for three reasons: First, splitting the Ninth \nCircuit would place a greater burden on California Federal appellate \njudges. Under the new plan, California judges would constitute only 58 \npercent of the former circuit's judicial staff, but required to handle \nmore than 70 percent of former circuit's total caseload. Second, \nsplitting the Ninth Circuit is unnecessary. The Ninth Circuit has \nperformed well according to most performance measures, despite having \none of the highest caseloads per judge in the country. Third, splitting \nthe Ninth Circuit is opposed by the majority of people who would be \nmost affected--the judges and attorneys of the Ninth Circuit.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this unnecessary amendment that has \nnothing to do with court security, and creates new problems and costs \nfor the parties, lawyers and judges that practice in the Ninth Circuit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNevada is expected to make a motion to waive the Budget Act.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to rule on the point of \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained.\n  The amendment falls.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to comment on section 207 of the \npending matter, the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. Section 207 \nincreases the statutory maximum penalties for the Federal offense of \nmanslaughter. Pursuant to this legislation, the maximum penalty for \ninvoluntary manslaughter will be increased from 6 to 10 years, and the \npenalty for voluntary manslaughter will be increased from 10 to 20 \nyears. This is a change that I sought to have included in last year's \nvarious court security bills. I am pleased to see that it will be \nincluded in this year's final Senate bill.\n  The need for an increase in the manslaughter statutory maximum \npenalty is made clear in testimony that was presented before the U.S. \nSentencing Commission by Paul Charlton, the U.S. Attorney for the \nDistrict of Arizona, on March 25, 2003. Despite recent changes to the \nguidelines for manslaughter offenses, the typical DUI involuntary \nmanslaughter crime still is subject to a sentencing range of only 30 to \n37 months. Yet, as Mr. Charlton noted in his testimony, under Arizona \nState law, the presumptive sentence for a typical DUI involuntary \nmanslaughter offense is 10\\1/2\\ years. In other words, despite recent \nguidelines adjustments, the Federal criminal justice system still \nimposes a sentence for involuntary manslaughter in drunk driving cases \nthat is only a third of the sentence that would be imposed for the \nexact same conduct under State law.\n  Mr. Charlton concluded that there is a ``dire need for immediate \nimprovements to the manslaughter statutory penalty and sentencing \nguidelines.'' As he noted, ``the respect and confidence of surviving \nvictims in the federal criminal justice system is severely undermined \nand will continue to be unless the statutory maximum penalties are \nincreased to reflect the seriousness of the crime and the sentencing \nguidelines are comparably changed to reflect that increase.''\n  With this bill, the Congress finally acts on Mr. Charlton's \nrecommendation to increase the statutory maximum. I would like to \nemphasize, however, that enactment of section 207 does not alone finish \nthe job. As Mr.\n\n[[Page S4740]]\n\nCharlton noted in his testimony, even after Congress increased \nstatutory penalties for these offenses in 1998, the sentences imposed \nby Federal courts ``remain[ed] inadequate to deter and punish offenders \n[as of March 2003] because the federal manslaughter sentencing \nguideline was never changed to reflect the increased penalty.''\n  The Sentencing Commission did eventually adjust the guidelines in \nresponse to the 1998 amendments, albeit 5 years after those changes \nwere enacted. In case a staffer for the Sentencing Commission reads \nthis speech in the Congressional Record, let me be clear: yes, we do \nexpect the Commission to adjust the guidelines for voluntary and \ninvoluntary manslaughter in order to reflect the statutory changes made \nby section 207. And please persuade the Commissioners to act \nexpeditiously. If this matter is not addressed during the next \nappropriate period for submitting proposed changes to the guidelines, I \nwill contact the Commission to inquire why no adjustment has been made.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Charlton's 2003 testimony before the \nSentencing Commission be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Testimony Before the U.S. Sentencing Commission\n\n                           (By Paul Charlton)\n\n       Members of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, thank you for \n     giving me the opportunity to appear before you to discuss \n     sentencing in federal manslaughter cases. This topic is \n     particularly important to the District of Arizona because my \n     district routinely handles the highest number of prosecutions \n     under the Major Crimes Act arising out of violations in \n     Indian country, including federal manslaughter cases, in the \n     United States. The low statutory and guideline sentences for \n     these offenses are a topic of frustration routinely discussed \n     among my counterparts with similar criminal jurisdiction \n     responsibilities and who serve on the United States Attorney \n     General's Native American Issues Advisory Subcommittee.\n       The District of Arizona encompasses the entire state of \n     Arizona. We have exclusive authority to prosecute Major \n     Crimes Act violations occurring within Arizona's 21 Indian \n     Reservations. Two of the nation's largest Indian Reservations \n     are located in Arizona--the Navajo Nation, with an \n     approximate total population of 275,000 members and a land \n     base of over 17 million acres spanning three states (Arizona, \n     New Mexico and Utah), and the Tohono O'odham Nation, with an \n     approximate total population of 24,000 members and a land \n     base comparable to the state of Connecticut. Recent \n     Department of Justice data revealed that the violent crime \n     rate on the Navajo Reservation is six times the national \n     average. In total, in calendar year 2002, my office handled a \n     total of 64 manslaughter and 94 murder cases. In a two-year \n     period ending September 2002, the Flagstaff division of the \n     U.S. Attorney's Office (which responds to Northern Arizona \n     federal crimes) handled 65 homicide prosecutions, including \n     27 manslaughter and 38 murder cases.\n       In the summer of 2001, this Commission held a hearing on \n     the impact of the sentencing guidelines on Indians committing \n     offenses in Indian country. The perception going into this \n     hearing was that Indians sentenced under the federal \n     sentencing guidelines are treated more harshly than those who \n     are adjudicated in the State system. The experiences of \n     federal prosecutors in my District as they relate to the \n     crimes of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter are not \n     consistent with this perception. Our perception, and that of \n     many Indian and non-Indian victims, is that the federal \n     criminal justice system is in many circumstances unjust. \n     Consequently, the respect and confidence of surviving victims \n     in the federal criminal justice system is severely undermined \n     and will continue to be unless the statutory maximum \n     penalties are increased to reflect the seriousness of the \n     crime and the sentencing guidelines are comparably changed to \n     reflect that increase.\n       In 1994, the United States Congress amended the penalty for \n     involuntary manslaughter from three years to the current six \n     year maximum term. [Footnote: See H.R. Conf. Rep. 103-711 \n     (1994).] The primary purpose for the amendment was to correct \n     the inadequacy of the three-year penalty as it applied to \n     drunk driving homicides. In passing the amendment, one \n     Senator noted ``Involuntary manslaughter most often occurs \n     through reckless or drunken driving. A three-year maximum \n     sentence is not adequate to vindicate the most egregious \n     instances of this conduct, which takes an increasing toll of \n     innocent victims' lives.'' [Footnote: 134 CONG. REC. S.7446-\n     01 (statement of Sen. Byrd).] I applaud Congress' efforts in \n     amending the law. However, it has become abundantly clear \n     that the current statutory penalties remain inadequate to \n     deter and punish offenders because the federal manslaughter \n     sentencing guideline was never changed to reflect the \n     increased penalty.\n       Today, the average range of sentence for a defendant for \n     involuntary manslaughter is 16-24 months imprisonment \n     followed by three years on Supervised Release. I would like \n     to share with you some of the experiences faced by federal \n     prosecutors assigned to DUI homicides in Indian country to \n     illustrate the gravity of theses crimes, the comparable state \n     sentences imposed, and to demonstrate the need for increased \n     penalties and comparable sentencing guidelines:\n       Kyle Peterson, was charged with one count of involuntary \n     manslaughter for the death of a 60-year-old man who was \n     driving to work southbound on the Loop 101 Freeway in \n     Phoenix. Peterson was driving north in the southbound lanes \n     of the Loop 101. The two vehicles collided head-on as they \n     entered a portion of the freeway located in Indian country. \n     The victim was killed instantly. Peterson suffered serious \n     head injuries but his recovery has been positive. At the time \n     of impact Peterson's blood alcohol level was .158. He pled \n     guilty to the charge of involuntary manslaughter with no \n     agreements and was sentenced to 14 months in custody followed \n     by three years on supervised release. In her victim impact \n     statement, the decedent's widow stated ``[f]inally there is \n     me rage at a system that allows a criminal to face almost no \n     punishment because of Federal Sentencing Commission laws . . \n     . DUI is a criminal offense. Why does the Federal system not \n     treat it as such?''\n       Gaylen Lomatuwayma was charged with one count of \n     involuntary manslaughter after he struck and killed the \n     victim, who was walking along Navajo Route 2. The crash took \n     place after a night of drinking in Flagstaff, Arizona. The \n     defendant kept driving until his truck stopped working. He \n     was indicted on one count of involuntary manslaughter and was \n     sentenced to 21 months in custody followed by 3 years on \n     supervised release.\n       In July, 2001, Zacharay Guerrero was driving intoxicated on \n     the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservation near Phoenix when he \n     failed to stop at a clearly posted stop sign. He collided \n     with a vehicle occupied by two female tribal members. On \n     impact, both females were ejected from the vehicle, which \n     ignited in flames and burned at the scene. Guerrero fled the \n     scene. Investigation revealed that the defendant's vehicle \n     had an impact speed of between 64 and 70 mph (while the \n     posted speed limit was 35 mph) and the victim vehicle had an \n     impact speed of 9 mph. One victim died at the scene. The \n     medical examiner attributed her death to multiple blunt force \n     trauma due to the motor-vehicle impact. The second victim \n     died two months later. While there were small amounts of \n     alcohol detected in the victim/driver's blood, the accident \n     reconstructionist did not believe it was a significant \n     contributing factor to the crash. Guerrero was charged and \n     plead guilty to two counts of involuntary manslaughter, with \n     no sentencing agreement. The guideline calculation resulted \n     in a total offense level 13, with acceptance of \n     responsibility, or a sentencing range of only 12-18 months. \n     Only because of Guerrero's prior criminal history did he \n     receive a sentence of concurrent terms of 37 months, the high \n     end of the applicable guideline range.\n       In November 2001, Ernest Zahony was driving eastbound on \n     hwy 160 near the Old Red Lake Trading Post on the Navajo \n     Indian Reservation. He crossed the center line and struck a \n     family headed westbound on their way to a late Thanksgiving \n     dinner. The driver was pinned behind the steering wheel and \n     later died as a result of her injuries. Five other occupants, \n     including children, received serious injuries. The \n     defendant walked away from the scene and was found about a \n     mile away. The defendant admitted to drinking all night \n     and into the morning. At the time of the crash, he is \n     estimated to have had a .252 blood alcohol level. The \n     court, applying an upward departure, sentenced the \n     defendant to 40 months in custody.\n       Victim families routinely hear or read about state drunk-\n     driving homicide cases where long sentences are imposed by \n     state court judges. Without exception, every Assistant U.S. \n     Attorney and Victim Advocate assigned to federal drunk \n     driving homicides must go through the painful process of \n     explaining to victim families that the long sentences meted \n     out in the state court system do not apply because the \n     defendant will be sentenced under the federal sentencing \n     guideline scheme. Victim families cannot comprehend that had \n     the crime occurred in state jurisdiction, the defendant would \n     be imprisoned for a substantially longer term.\n       To illustrate this, in Arizona state court, the crime of \n     manslaughter is designated either ``dangerous'' or ``non-\n     dangerous.'' [Footnote: Case illustrations were provided by \n     the Arizona Chapter of MADD. Explanation of state sentencing \n     categories were provided by the Maricopa County Attorney's \n     Office.] In Maricopa County, DUI homicides are almost \n     exclusively charged as ``dangerous'' felonies. [Footnote: \n     According to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office, ``non-\n     dangerous'' felonies are reserved for those DUI homicides \n     with great evidentiary weaknesses and are rarely, if ever, \n     charged.] The sentence for manslaughter ``dangerous'' ranges \n     from seven to 21 years in custody and yields a presumptive \n     10\\1/2\\ year sentence.\n       For example, the Maricopa County Attorney's Office stated \n     that generally, where an intoxicated defendant crosses a \n     center line striking and killing someone, he/she will almost \n     assuredly receive a sentence of 10\\1/2\\ years. If the \n     individual has a prior drunk driving history, the range of \n     sentence increases by 2 years. In cases where a passenger in \n     a defendant's car is killed, the\n\n[[Page S4741]]\n\n     range of sentence generally is 7-10\\1/2\\ years in custody.\n       Compare Arizona v. Bruguier with United States v. \n     Lomatuwayma. In Bruguier, the defendant was sentenced to \n     11\\1/2\\ years for driving while intoxicated and striking and \n     killing an individual who was jogging along a roadway.\n       Ironically, if any of the victims in the above-mentioned \n     cases were injured, rather than killed, each defendant would \n     have been sentenced under the assault statute, resulting in \n     much harsher penalties. [Footnote: Similarly, the statutory \n     maximum for Assault with a Dangerous Weapon and Assault \n     Resulting in Serious Bodily Injury is no more than 10 years \n     and a $250,000 fine. 18 U.S.C.Sec. 113. The Base Offense \n     Level is 15 and allows for specific offense characteristics \n     which may result in a substantially higher sentencing range.] \n     To address the low statutory and guideline penalty for \n     involuntary manslaughter cases, my office applies alternative \n     or additional charges in appropriate cases such as assault or \n     second degree murder. This approach enhances the penalties \n     available to the court. Also, the added charges will \n     hopefully deter the defendant from future conduct, and \n     provide a means to advocate on behalf of the surviving \n     victims.\n       For example, Sebastian Lopez plead guilty to Second Degree \n     Murder for committing a DUI homicide and was sentenced to \n     11\\1/2\\ years in custody. At the time of this offense, Lopez \n     was serving a sentence of federal probation for a prior DUI \n     homicide. In total, this defendant had four prior DUI \n     convictions, three involving accidents and one involving \n     death, yet he remained undeterred by his first DUI homicide \n     crime and federal sentence.\n       Additionally, federal prosecutors routinely seek upward \n     departures to increase a drunk driving defendant's final \n     adjusted sentence. However, courts are reluctant to impose \n     upward departures in manslaughter cases. In United States v. \n     Merrival, 176 F.3d 1079 (8th Cir. 1999), a case prosecuted by \n     the District of South Dakota, the defendant was charged with \n     one count of Involuntary Manslaughter for the DUI homicide of \n     his two passengers, which included a 5-month-old infant. The \n     defendant plead guilty to the indictment and the district \n     court departed upward to sentence him to 70 months in \n     custody. In imposing sentence, the court stated that the \n     defendant's conduct was extremely dangerous and resulted in \n     two deaths and severe bodily injury to the three surviving \n     victims. In upholding the sentence, the Eighth Circuit stated \n     ``[w]e make special note, however, that in imposing a \n     departure of this magnitude, the district court acted at the \n     outermost limits of its discretionary authority.'' Id. at \n     1082. Consequently, federal courts themselves appear to \n     struggle with finding a just sentence for these crimes and \n     remain reluctant to impose an upward departure even in the \n     most egregious cases.\n       Additionally, if a defendant's tribal criminal history \n     reflects repeated criminal conduct while they are under the \n     influence of alcohol, a prosecutor may seek an enhanced \n     sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 4A1.3, Adequacy of \n     Criminal History. [Footnote: This section may only be applied \n     where a defendant's prior sentence(s) are not factored into \n     his sentencing guideline range. 4A1.3(a).] However, federal \n     court judges are reluctant to apply an upward departure even \n     where a defendant has prior multiple tribal court DUI \n     convictions. Recently, Dale Haskan received a 14 month \n     sentence for the DUI homicide of a 15-year-old girl. Haskan \n     had multiple prior DUIs in tribal court dating back 20 years. \n     The district court ruled that only one of his prior \n     convictions was admissible because of inadequate \n     documentation and his concern whether Haskan was represented \n     in tribal court on those multiple convictions.\n       Depending on the extent and substance of a defendant's \n     tribal criminal history, the facts, and the character of the \n     victim, a court may make legal and factual findings that the \n     defendant is entitled to an enhancement. See United States v. \n     Betti Rowbal, 105 F.3d 667 (9th Cir. Nev.) (Unpublished \n     Decision). In drunk driving homicides, however, it is hard \n     for a prosecutor to argue that the Sentencing Commission did \n     not take into account the loss of life or the degree of a \n     defendant's intoxication. Id. Therefore, sentencing \n     enhancements in these cases, although routinely sought, are \n     difficult to substantiate and thus are rarely imposed. It is \n     my hope that these examples will serve to illustrate the dire \n     need for immediate improvements to the manslaughter statutory \n     penalty and sentencing guidelines.\n       I would like to briefly address second degree murder. As \n     you consider addressing manslaughter, I urge the Commission \n     to reexamine the murder sentencing guidelines in relationship \n     to the statutory maximum penalty, life imprisonment. The \n     Commission must evaluate whether the 33 base offense level is \n     appropriate given that second degree murder involves a high \n     level of culpability on the part of the defendant. [Footnote: \n     With a Criminal History of I and a 3-level adjustment for \n     Acceptance of Responsibility, a defendant would face an \n     adjusted offense level of 30 (97-121 months in custody).] For \n     example, Douglas Tree plead guilty to Second Degree Murder \n     for beating his girlfriend's 18 month old daughter. Her \n     injuries included a fractured clavicle and fractured ribs. He \n     waited until his girlfriend came home to take the child in \n     for medical treatment. The infant was hospitalized, placed on \n     life support and later died. Tree received a 142 month \n     sentence. Leslie Vanwinkle was also charged with Second \n     Degree Murder for the beating death of his 70-year-old \n     father. Vanwinkle was sentenced to a term of 151 months in \n     custody. These crimes are among the most malicious and often \n     occur with weapons including knives, rocks and shovels. The \n     use of a firearm gives prosecutors the leverage of charging a \n     gun violation, which drastically enhances the second degree \n     murder sentence.\n       Finally, should the Commission increase the manslaughter \n     sentencing guideline, it must evaluate the impact that the \n     existing second degree murder guideline will have relative to \n     any increase. I therefore encourage the Commission to \n     consider creating specific offense characteristics that \n     reflect the more egregious and aggravated type of murder.\n       The frustration felt by the victim families, prosecutors, \n     and often expressed by district court judges in imposing \n     sentences is all to common in my district and experienced by \n     every federal prosecutor with similar federal criminal \n     jurisdictional responsibilities. So, I am thankful and \n     encouraged that this Commission continues to have an interest \n     in this area. I am also encouraged that the Commission \n     developed the Native American Ad Hoc Advisory Committee to \n     more thoroughly review the perceptions of Indian Country \n     Crimes and Sentencing disparity. My colleagues and I on the \n     Attorney General's Native American Issues Advisory Committee \n     look forward to the Committee's findings. Thank you again for \n     extending to me the invitation to speak to you today.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work of my colleagues \nin coming to agreement to proceed to final passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  This bill has been a top priority of the Federal judiciary. I \nintroduce it back in January, and it proceeded through regular order. \nWe held a hearing, issued a committee report, considered floor \namendments, and debated the measure.\n  Now it is time to vote for its passage. We can and we must provide \nfor increased security for our Federal judges.\n  Physical attacks on our judges threaten not only the dedicated public \nservants who serve in these roles but also the institution. Our \nNation's Founders knew that without an independent judiciary to protect \nindividual rights from the political branches of Government, those \nrights and privileges would not be preserved. Our Federal courts are \nthe ultimate check and balance in our system of government.\n  We owe it to our judges to better protect them and their families \nfrom violence to ensure that they have the peace of mind to do their \nvital and difficult jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the White House has been telling America \nthat Democrats are doing the wrong thing by calling for a change of \ncourse in Iraq. They say holding the Iraqi Government accountable is \nwrong. They say finding a political solution in Iraq is wrong. They say \nredeploying troops out of a civil war is wrong. They have said even \ndebating a strategy for changing course is dangerous, and many Senate \nRepublicans have backed that up by blocking several of our attempts to \ndebate this issue here on the Senate Floor.\n  The American people want us to debate the war, and they want us to \nchange the course. Listen to what the President's own Secretary of \nDefense Robert Gates said in the last few hours, and I quote:\n\n       The debate in Congress has been helpful in demonstrating to \n     the Iraqis that American patience is limited. The strong \n     feelings expressed in the Congress about the timetable \n     probably has had a positive impact in terms of communicating \n     to the Iraqis that this is not an open-ended commitment.\n\n  The President and some of my Republican colleagues have also \nattempted to create a false crisis by claiming that Democrats are \nputting the troops in danger by not sending the supplemental bill \nimmediately. But today, the Pentagon acknowledged what Democrats have \nlong known--that President Bush continues to misstate the reality on \nthe ground and in Iraq to score political points.\n  Like the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the Pentagon now \nacknowledges that it can pay for the Iraq war at least through June \nwith the funds that have already been provided.\n  I hope the President and our Republican colleagues in Congress will \nput these false claims aside so we can get back to working toward a \nbipartisan solution.\n  Yesterday I met with President Bush to express the will of the \nAmerican people, senior military officials, and a bipartisan majority \nof Congress that we must change course in Iraq. I told President Bush \nthat, going on to 5 years, more than 3,300 American soldiers lost, tens \nof thousands wounded, a third of them gravely wounded, and billions and \nbillions of dollars depleted from our Treasury, we as a country must \nchange course in Iraq.\n  Conditions in Iraq get worse by the day. Now we find ourselves \npolicing another nation's civil war. We are less secure from the many \nthreats to our national security than we were when the war began. As \nlong as we follow the President's path in Iraq, the war is lost. But \nthere is still a chance to change course and we must change course. No \none wants us to succeed in the Middle East more than I do. But there \nmust be a change of course. Our brave men and women overseas have \npassed every test with flying colors. They have earned our pride and \nour praise. More important, they deserve a strategy worthy of their \nsacrifice.\n  The supplemental bill we passed with bipartisan support offers that. \nIt includes a reasonable and attainable timeline to reduce combat \nmissions and refocus our efforts on the real threats to our country's \nsecurity. It offers a new path, a new direction forward. If we put \npolitics aside, I believe we can find a way to make America safer and \nstronger.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nspeak as in morning business for as much time as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

CARHART\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, yesterday was a good day for democracy. \nIt was a great day for American constitutionalism. I have said it \nbefore. I will continue to say it. All too often, we see judicial \ndecisions on America's most important social issues made without any \nconstitutional warrant.\n  Too difficult to convince your community that it should not pray \nbefore football games? No problem. Just find a judge to say that the \npractice is unconstitutional.\n  Too discouraged by the slow pace of the march toward same-sex \nmarriage? Find a judge to declare that the State constitution has \nallowed it all along. A constitutional right to same-sex marriage--\n``presto chango.''\n  Americans of all political stripes understand that this highjacking \nof social policy from the people's representatives is deeply misguided.\n  A good number of law professors, law students, judges, and \npoliticians still continue to inject the judicial branch\n\n[[Page S4745]]\n\ninto social controversies. Yet, in attempting to smooth out the rough \nedges of democracy, activist judges have time and again undermined \ndemocracy and increased bitterness in our political debates.\n  Yesterday's decision in Gonzales v. Carhart was a step toward \nrighting that dangerous trend. It was a step toward restoring the \npeople's liberties and the vitality of our democracy.\n  Let me explain.\n  In 2003, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act. This was well-considered legislation. It was broadly \nsupported by the public. Senators of both parties, including my \ncolleague from Vermont, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nsupported the bill. And after years of trying, it finally became law.\n  It was a modest bill, born of an existential abhorrence of a \nprocedure that callously snuffed out human life. Nonetheless, a \ncoalition of the usual proponents of judicial legislating attempted to \nundo this law.\n  Fortunately, the Supreme Court disagreed and upheld this legislation. \nIt was a reasonable decision. And it showed a proper deference to the \npeople and their representatives--deference that one would expect in a \ndemocracy.\n  The public first became aware of partial-birth abortion in 1992, when \nDr. Martin Haskell gave a presentation describing the procedure. A \nnurse who assisted him in a partial-birth abortion on a 26\\1/2\\ week \nfetus testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee of her experience \nwith this procedure. It was shocking testimony. I am glad that Justice \nKennedy included it in his majority opinion. I will not repeat it here. \nIt was graphic. It was horrific. And it will stay with me forever.\n  A 6-month-old fetus was treated worse than any animal--and disposed \nof like garbage. The American people were rightly appalled.\n  It very well might be that there is some give in the seams of our \nConstitution. The meaning of every term and principle is not entirely \nclear. But if you are going to be making up constitutional rights \nwithout textual warrant, the American people understand what many law \nprofessors, radical--I mean, progressive--activists, and judges did \nnot.\n  It perverts our constitutional traditions to argue that a document \ncommitted to life, liberty, and the dignity of the human person would \nprohibit public condemnation and legal regulation of such barbarity. \nAnd the Court agreed.\n  This was a reasonable and a limited decision. The Court rejected a \nfacial challenge to the law. Relying on its precedent in Casey v. \nPlanned Parenthood, the Court held that the law was not \nunconstitutionally vague and did not impose an undue burden on a \nwoman's right to abortion.\n  This was a reasonable decision, one rooted in a deep respect for the \nrole of the people's representatives in Congress. And what is the \nresponse of the hard left? Hysteria.\n  I know many of my colleagues in this body are familiar with the blog, \nDaily Kos. It is the online meeting room for the political left.\n  The complaints of its members recently led a number of Democratic \ncandidates for President to withdraw from a Fox News-sponsored debate. \nThey were intimately involved in the debate in the House over how best \nto cut off funding for our troops. This is what one of these citizen \nagitators posted about the decision:\n\n       The 5 Catholics on the court have ruled!! Why don't we just \n     outsource the Supreme Court to the Vatican. Save some money!!\n\n  There was a time when this anti-Catholic venom had no place in our \npolitical discourse. Unfortunately, liberal groups are becoming more \nand more radical, and less and less liberal in their thinking.\n  This is what Nancy Keenan, of the radical abortion-rights lobby \nNARAL, had to say:\n\n       An anti-choice Congress and an anti-choice president pushed \n     this ban all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\n  An anti-choice Congress? Is she kidding? Is the Democratic chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee anti-choice? Is the Democratic chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee anti-choice? Is the Democratic chairman of \nthe Budget Committee anti-choice?\n  Give me a break.\n  The radicals criticizing this decision are seriously unmoored from \nthe American people and our legal traditions. The radicals who support \nabortion on demand reject the choices of the American people. They \nreject the informed choice that the people's representatives made about \nthis gruesome procedure. They are ``Johnny and Jane one-notes''--\nabortion now, abortion always, abortion forever.\n  The American people deserve better. We have been told by the new \nmajority that America is done with partisanship. America needs results.\n  Well, we got results with the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. This \nwas a bipartisan achievement that brought together Republicans and \nDemocrats, conservatives and liberals. It is unfortunate, then, to see \ncertain Democratic candidates bemoaning this decision in the same old \nterms.\n  It is not too surprising to see the New York Times editorial page \nhyperventilating over this decision. But we deserve more from our party \nleaders and Presidential candidates. I understand their predicament. \nWhen you have to answer to uncompromising abortion-rights groups, logic \nsometimes gets tossed by the wayside.\n  When President Clinton was in the White House, he abandoned almost \nevery liberal group imaginable in his quest for triangulation. But \nthere was one group that he would never cross--the abortion-rights \nlobby.\n  And given the knee-jerk reactions about this decision from the \nleftwing blogosphere and Democratic candidates, I have no doubt that \nthis commitment will not change. I think that is sad. But if they want \nto have a fight, the centerpiece of which is judicial administration of \na judicially created right to abort your baby at any time during \npregnancy, I am sure many will gladly meet them in the ring.\n  I think that these overheated comments are particularly interesting \nin light of the legislation that we considered earlier today. I was an \noriginal cosponsor of the court security bill.\n  Obviously, our judges need to be protected from violent criminals. \nThey are public servants. And all too often they are threatened with, \nor subjected to, physical violence. This is unacceptable. And so I \njoined with many of my Judiciary Committee colleagues in supporting \nthis bill.\n  But I want to distance myself from some of the remarks made by my \nDemocratic colleagues yesterday. The suggestion that strong and \nvigorous criticism of judicial decisionmaking is somehow inappropriate \nor collaterally responsible for violence against judges is absurd. \nViolence against judges is unacceptable. But violence against judges is \nnot caused by criticism of judicial activism. And it is not caused by \noverheated rhetoric.\n  I find it particularly ironic that on the same day that liberal \npundits and interest groups are bemoaning a moderate and limited \nSupreme Court decision as the catalyst for making women second-class \ncitizens, Democrats took to the floor to brand serious and vigorous \ncriticism of judges as irresponsible.\n  In the end, I think Justice Scalia was right in his Casey \nconcurrence. So long as the Court went about doing what lawyers and \njudges are supposed to do--interpret the law--nobody gave the Supreme \nCourt a second thought. But when the Court decided that it should be a \nsuper legislature that second guesses the judgments of the American \npeople and their representatives, the Court invited criticism.\n  You act like legislators, you get treated like legislators.\n  If my colleagues would like to see less criticism of judges, maybe \nthey should stop advocating an undemocratic and constitutionally \nungrounded judicial activism.\n  The people can criticize the courts. And their representatives can \ncriticize the courts. If Lincoln did it, and FDR did it, I think we are \non solid ground.\n  But I am not going to criticize yesterday's decision. I would like to \nclose by again applauding it. It was not just a victory for the unborn \nchild. It was a victory for moderation and the rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/19/senate-section/article/S4745-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4745-S4746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL DARRELL S. CRAMER\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to pay special tribute to an \nextraordinary man, a loving husband, father\n\n[[Page S4746]]\n\nand grandfather; a valiant soldier; and a true patriot in every sense \nof the word--BG Darrell S. Cramer.\n  Darrell recently passed away, leaving a tremendous void in the lives \nof all who knew him. Yet his legacy of service, courage, and dedication \nwill serve as an example for many generations to come.\n  Darrell was born in Ogden, UT, to Olvie and Loretta Stuart Cramer and \nwas the oldest in a family of five. He enjoyed his childhood immensely \nand excelled in athletics and academics. As a young child he developed \na strong interest in aviation which would guide his future life. His \ndream of flying became a reality shortly after enrolling in a civilian \npilot training course at Weber College.\n  On December 7, 1941, Darrell was listening to the radio at home when \nhe heard the news bulletin that stunned the Nation--Pearl Harbor had \nbeen attacked, and the United States was now joining the war. The very \nnext day, he drove to Salt Lake City and visited the recruiting offices \nof both the Army and the Navy to try to enlist in the Aviation Cadet \nprograms. At that time a recruit was to be at least 20 years old and \nhave 2 years of college, so he was turned away.\n  Just over a month later the rules were changed, and Darrell, eager to \nserve his country, immediately enlisted in the Army. He quickly became \nan excellent fighter pilot candidate and excelled in the training. Thus \nbegan a storied and exemplary military career.\n  The highlights of his military service included many tours of duty \nbeginning in November 1942, when Darrell was sent to the South Pacific \narea as a P-38 pilot assigned to the 339th Fighter Squadron of the 13th \nAir Force. The young airman flew in the campaigns of Guadalcanal, New \nGuinea, and North Solomons and completed his tour of duty with credit \nfor the destruction of a Japanese Zero fighter and Betty bomber \naircraft.\n  In December 1943, he returned to the United States and was assigned \nto a P-47 combat training school in Abilene, TX. In June 1944, General \nCramer was assigned to the European Theater of Operations and flew a P-\n51 aircraft with the 55th Fighter Group. He finished this tour of duty \nas a squadron commander with a total of 300 flying hours in 60 missions \nand credited for the destruction of 11 German aircraft. As such, he \njoined an exclusive fraternity of fighter ace.\n  At the end of World War II, Darrell returned home, and shortly after, \nhe left active duty to go into business with his father forming the \nCramer and Son Coal Company. He went on to pursue additional business \nopportunities but couldn't put his love of flying behind him and once \nagain joined the Utah Air National Guard. When the Berlin Airlift began \nin 1948, he was again called to active duty for Operation Vittles.\n  When that operation ended, Darrell once again returned to the United \nStates and began service as director of flying in the Advanced Flying \nSchool at Williams Air Force Base in Arizona. This was followed 2 years \nlater with his return to Europe to assume command of the 53rd Fighter \nSquadron and later the 36th Fighter Bomber Wing in Germany.\n  This service was followed by assignments in Washington, DC, \nCalifornia, Turkey, Thailand, and Vietnam. In February 1971, General \nCramer became the vice commander of the 17th Air Force, Ramstein Air \nBase in Germany. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1970 and \nretired from military service in June 1973.\n  During his many years of military service, Darrell was recognized and \nawarded many times for his courage and exemplary service to our Nation. \nHis military awards and decorations included the Distinguished Service \nMedal, Legion of Merit with an oak leaf cluster, Distinguished Flying \nCross with an oak leaf cluster, Air Medal with 21 oak leaf clusters, \nJoint Service Commendation Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, \nPresidential Unit Citation emblem with two oak leaf clusters, and an \nAir Force Outstanding Unit Award Ribbon with an oak leaf cluster. In \naddition, he was also inducted into the Utah Aviation Hall of Fame and \nthe Order of the Daedalians, a fraternity of pilots.\n  With all of these accomplishments, Darrell became a larger-than-life \nfigure to all those who knew him. Yet his humble and unassuming spirit \nwas demonstrated in all he did. His greatest accomplishments he always \nmaintained was marrying the love of his life, Mildred ``Mick'' McPhie. \nThey built a beautiful life together providing a loving, cherished home \nfor friends, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren to enjoy.\n  In his later years, Darrell didn't just quietly sit and watch the \ndays go idly by. He found happiness pursuing many hobbies and interests \nincluding golfing, skiing, and spending quality time with his brothers \nand sisters, grandchildren, and friends.\n  He also appreciated computer technology and used it to modernize his \nwork in genealogy and family history. He spent many hours serving in \nthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Family History \nProgram. He shared his knowledge and helped many search for their own \nancestors.\n  As the wonderful, strong military leader General George S. Patton \nonce said, ``It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather \nwe should thank God that such men lived.''\n  While I don't believe it is foolish for many to mourn the loss of \nthis great man, I do believe that many do thank our Heavenly Father \nthat BG Darrell S. Cramer lived and that he provided such a powerful \nexample of courage, service, and love for generations to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/19/senate-section/article/S4746-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COURT SECURITY IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, earlier today the Senate passed S. 378, \nthe Court Security Improvement Act, with overwhelming, bipartisan \nsupport. With this legislation, we in the Senate acted for the third \ntime in a year to better protect our Federal judges from institutional \nand physical threats.\n  For the past several years, I have introduced and sponsored \nlegislation to extend the authority for Federal judges to redact \nrelevant portions of their financial disclosure statements if they have \nbeen threatened. The authority to redact portions of judges' financial \ndisclosure statements expired last year.\n  The redaction authority bill passed by the Senate last year would \nhave extended the redaction authority without interruption and expanded \nit to judges' families. It struck the right balance by preserving \ncongressional oversight to prevent the misuse of this redaction \nauthority, which has been a matter of some concern.\n  I was disappointed that the House of Representatives failed to act on \nthis legislation that passed the Senate last November but I am pleased \nthat the new House of Representatives was able to pass it earlier this \nyear. I continue to support an extension of redaction authority for \nthreatened judges and am glad that the Senate is passing that measure, \nH.R. 1130 today. I trust that the President will sign it into law \nwithout delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/19/senate-section/article/S4746-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4746-S4748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   U.S.-RUSSIAN ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I wish to congratulate Secretary of \nCommerce Carlos M. Gutierrez on his recent trip to Moscow, Russia. The \nSecretary delivered an important message to the Russian Government and \nRussian people: ``While political issues between our nations tend to \ngarner the most headlines, economic interests should not be ignored. \nU.S.-Russia commercial ties are stronger and more dynamic than ever \nbefore, providing stability to our overall relationship.'' I couldn't \nagree more with this assessment.\n  The United States and Russia business relationship is expanding \nsignificantly. Last year, U.S. exports to Russia increased by 20 \npercent to $4.7 billion in a broad range of merchandise and service \nmarkets. The American Chamber of Commerce in Russia recently conducted \na survey of American business in Russia. They made some interesting \nfindings:\n  Half of the American companies surveyed report sales increases of 200 \npercent in Russia from 2001 to 2005.\n  Ninety-seven percent of U.S. companies in Russia project continued \ngrowth in sales during the next three years.\n  Ninety-two percent of U.S. companies in Russia believe that continued\n\n[[Page S4747]]\n\ncommercial engagement with Russia is positive for American business, \nand 86 percent believe that Russia's membership in the WTO will bring \nnew opportunities for them.\n  Profitability of two-thirds of American companies in Russia is on or \nabove target.\n  Seventy-five percent of Russian employees of American companies in \nRussia view the United States positively, compared to 47 percent of \nemployees in Russian-owned companies.\n  The people of Russia and the United States stand to benefit a great \ndeal from this expanded relationship. The Secretary also focused on \nthose areas where improvement is needed, including, stronger \naccountability, enforcement of intellectual property rights and and \nanticorruption efforts.\n  The U.S.-Russia relationship is critical to the security and \nprosperity of both countries and the international community. In recent \nmonths the bilateral relationship has been dominated by disagreements \nand confrontation on a number of important issues. American and Russian \nleaders must reverse this trend. I congratulate Secretary Gutierrez in \nmaking a strong step forward in the right direction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of a speech he delivered at the \nAmerican Chamber of Commerce's Annual Investment Conference in Moscow \non April 4, be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you for inviting me to this Conference.\n       Minister Gref, Ambassador Burns, it is an honor to join you \n     in opening this conference. This is my second trip to Moscow \n     as Secretary of Commerce. It has been nearly two years since \n     my first visit and I'm pleased to be here today to discuss \n     economic growth and opportunity between Russia and the United \n     States.\n       As you know, this year marks the 200th anniversary of \n     diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Russia. Though \n     there have been times of great challenge during that history, \n     we are now poised to enter a new era of commercial engagement \n     which will strengthen our ties, grow our economies and create \n     prosperity for our citizens.\n       My visit this week reflects the considerable and growing \n     value the U.S. places on our business ties with Russia, and \n     our desire to find new ways to bring greater economic \n     opportunity to the people of our countries.\n       While political issues between our nations tend to garner \n     the most headlines, the economic relationship is a great \n     untold story.\n       U.S.-Russia commercial ties are stronger and more dynamic \n     than ever before. This creates great opportunity for our \n     future.\n       In the past two decades, Russia has begun to reap the \n     benefits of engagement in the global economy and take a place \n     as one of the world's great economic powers.\n       Today, Russia's nearly $1 trillion economy is in its 9th \n     straight year of growth, and the Economic Development \n     Ministry reported 8.4 percent growth in the first two months \n     of this year. That is impressive.\n       With inflation below 10 percent, an 11 percent increase in \n     real disposable income within the past year, early debt \n     repayments and budget surpluses, Russia's economy is indeed \n     on the rise.\n       As the economy continues to grow, so does U.S. business. I \n     know later today you will hear from executives of companies \n     such as Alcoa, Boeing, Coca-Cola and Motorola. Their presence \n     at this conference speaks to the growing environment for \n     business and investment here.\n       According to some recent surveys, 84 percent of foreign \n     companies active in Russia report being successful in meeting \n     their goals; 95 percent plan to expand.\n       Consistent with these figures, current bilateral trade and \n     future prospects for U.S. businesses in Russia are expanding \n     significantly.\n       In 2006, U.S. exports to Russia grew 20 percent to $4.7 \n     billion. This growth is occurring in a wide range of \n     merchandise and service categories, suggesting that Russia's \n     growth is having a positive impact in purchasing power.\n       Importantly, the growth in our trade is a two-way street:\n       In 2006, Russian exports to the U.S. were more than $19 \n     billion, 30 percent more than in 2005.\n       Russia is, for the first time, beginning to take on a \n     notable direct investment profile in the United States, with \n     investments in mining, steel-manufacturing, and retail-\n     petroleum, helping support American jobs and supply American \n     consumers. Russia's direct investment in the U.S. is $3 \n     billion. The U.S. has $11 billion invested in Russia.\n       As big as these numbers sound, they are actually quite \n     small for two countries our size. Indeed, we are just getting \n     started.\n       The next step for Russia is World Trade Organization \n     accession. Russia is the world's largest economy not yet in \n     the WTO.\n       The United States has been working side-by-side with Russia \n     to achieve WTO membership. Last November, Minister Gref and \n     U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab signed a bilateral \n     market access agreement.\n       Now Russia, working multilaterally with the U.S. and other \n     WTO members, has the opportunity to take the necessary steps \n     to bring this process to a close, and enable its economy, \n     companies and people to fully participate in the world \n     market.\n       Many U.S. multinationals regard Russia as a strategic \n     market.\n       At the same time, their perception is colored by what they \n     hear about political issues such as energy security and a \n     challenging business climate.\n       Expansion of Russian commercial engagement with America and \n     globally requires transparent markets that embrace foreign \n     and domestic competition.\n       As the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development noted in its 2006 economic survey of Russia, \n     ``Greater openness is essential to monitoring, accountability \n     and anti-corruption efforts.''\n       The U.S. and other economies have greatly benefited from \n     openness, transparency, competition and adherence to the rule \n     of law. Democratic institutions fostering economic freedom \n     and rule of law offer the best mix of economic and social \n     justice.\n       We believe that companies and economies benefit from the \n     accountability provided by a vibrant media and independent \n     courts. They serve to ensure government agencies responsible \n     for upholding the rules of commerce carry out their duties \n     properly and evenhandedly.\n       As Russia becomes more prominent on the global stage, \n     creating and maintaining a level playing field that \n     encourages competition will attract more investment and \n     ensure that Russian companies can successfully thrive at home \n     and abroad.\n       It is crucial for Russia, just as it is for the United \n     States, to maintain an open business climate for capital, \n     goods and services moving back and forth with its trade and \n     investment partners.\n       Transparency and predictability in regulations and laws \n     governing investment would send positive signals to potential \n     partners in both our countries. Capital allocators look for \n     secure, predictable markets, and they watch with concern \n     where uncertainty exists.\n       In every country with an aspiration of attracting capital, \n     business law should be applied consistently across companies \n     and never selectively.\n       Building in predictability, transparency and reliability \n     for investors will give Russia a competitive advantage.\n       While we are mindful of countries' interests in protecting \n     so-called ``strategic'' aspects of their economies, policies \n     which seek to cordon off broad segments of an economy are \n     policies that carry risks of their own to a nation's economic \n     strength. Russia's challenge will be to pursue ``strategic \n     sectors'' while welcoming and encouraging foreign capital and \n     avoiding protectionist policies.\n       Protectionism often has the unintended consequence of \n     limiting access to capital, technology and know-how, and \n     sheltering companies and entire industries from competition \n     that sparks innovation and drives efficiency.\n       Protectionism doesn't protect jobs--the only thing that \n     does is to compete, innovate and grow.\n       The United States and Russia should have a stronger \n     partnership in areas such as energy, aerospace, \n     transportation infrastructure, and high technology, to name \n     some examples.\n       There have been tremendous technological advancements from \n     which Russian companies could greatly benefit.\n       Russians and Americans, like the rest of the world's \n     people, stand to benefit from stronger enforcement of \n     intellectual property.\n       Around the globe we have seen that stolen intellectual \n     property is not only an economic hazard, stifling innovation \n     technological innovation, and discouraging works of culture \n     in music and the arts, but also a health hazard.\n       The World Health Organization estimates that 10 percent of \n     global medicine is counterfeit. Tough IP enforcement will \n     protect Russian businesses and their ideas, like this \n     country's resurgent film industry, and it will also protect \n     Russian people.\n       Russia is doing better from an economic standpoint than it \n     has ever done before. However, from my discussions with \n     American business leaders, it is clear to me that there \n     remains much unrealized opportunity.\n       This foregone potential is an opportunity cost upon \n     Russia's consumers, entrepreneurs, producers and workers, \n     even as it also represents unmet potential for Russia's \n     suppliers, clients and customers.\n       With the maturity of our bilateral relations, we can afford \n     to be frank and honest with one another about issues on which \n     we disagree, in the economic realm as well as other areas.\n       It is important that we speak up when we find ways to \n     unlock untapped potential for expanding and building upon our \n     commercial and political relationships in ways that would \n     serve the mutual interests of our two nations.\n       We have come too far in building a new foundation based on \n     cooperation and mutual interests to turn back the clock. \n     There is much work to be done, but the foundation has been \n     laid for the future of U.S.-Russia relations to include \n     economic growth, prosperity and opportunity for both our \n     peoples.\n       I believe we are entering a new era of collaboration and \n     prosperity for our two great\n\n[[Page S4748]]\n\n     nations, and I thank AmCham Russia for your leadership and \n     commitment to that future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/19/senate-section/article/S4748-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EARTH DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I commemorate April 22--Earth Day 2007, \na day set aside to celebrate gains we have made in improving the \nenvironment and to renew our commitment to protect our planet.\n  Earth Day was established by Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin and \nwas first celebrated in 1970. Senator Nelson firmly believed that \neducation was the key to changing people's attitude about the \nenvironment. Since then, the Earth Day celebration has spread \nthroughout the nation and to the rest of the world, with more and more \npeople getting involved in efforts to clean and nurture the \nenvironment.\n  Despite Earth Day's popularity and the many programs that were \ncreated to improve the health of the planet, our world is still wrought \nwith environmental problems. We still face many pressing issues such as \nglobal warming, protecting our coastal waters from over-fishing, and \npreserving America's most precious resource lands from the Alaskan \nTongass Rainforest to the Redrock lands in Utah, to our own Chesapeake \nBay.\n  Today, we face a serious and growing threat from global warming. \nRecently I told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee about \nthe immediate threats that global warming poses to Maryland. A \nsignificant part of Maryland is in low-lying areas that would be \ninundated if global temperatures keep rising. The National Flood \nInsurance Program has designated more than 12 percent of Maryland as a \nspecial flood hazard area, and an estimated 68,000 Maryland homes and \nbuildings are located within a flood plain.\n  We are already seeing the effects. About a third of Blackwater \nNational Wildlife Refuge on the Eastern Shore has been lost to sea \nlevel rise in the past 70 years. Smith Island, situated in the \nChesapeake Bay, has lost 30 percent of its land to rising sea levels \nsince 1850.\n  I have long supported a comprehensive, environmentally friendly \nenergy policy that emphasizes increasing the availability and use of \nrenewable energy, as well as promoting greater energy efficiency. \nEnergy efficiency and renewable energy will reduce America's dangerous \ndependency on foreign oil while also dramatically reducing greenhouse \ngases.\n  Closer to home, we must continue to focus our efforts on restoring \nthe Chesapeake Bay. The Bush administration's budget proposes drastic \ncuts to vital initiatives, including environmental education, funds to \nupgrade wastewater treatment plants, and several farm bill conservation \nprograms that help farmers reduce nutrient runoff from entering the \nBay. The budget resolution that I helped draft and the Senate passed \nlast month restores many of those dangerous cuts, but we still have \nmuch work ahead of us to assure that these critical Federal programs \nare fully funded.\n  Earth Day celebrations serve as important reminders that we cannot \ntake our natural resources for granted. I urge all Americans to join \ntogether to protect, preserve, and restore the planet's natural \ntreasures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/19/senate-section/article/S4748-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RURAL VETERANS HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I am a proud cosponsor of the Rural \nVeterans Health Care Improvement Act. Increasing access to veterans' \nhealth care facilities is essential to recognizing the realities that \nexist on the ground today, not only for veterans living in rural areas \nof my home State of Maine, but for the millions of veterans living in \nremote areas across our broad land. I applaud Senator Salazar for \nintroducing this legislation at a time when so many of our veterans \nreceive their health care through the VA and nearly half of today's \nactive duty military servicemembers and tomorrow's veteran population \nlist rural communities as their homes of record. Once again, I commend \nSenator Salazar for his continuing resoluteness and advocacy for our \nveterans.\n  Our legislation will work to expand upon the Veterans Benefits, \nHealth Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006, which passed the \nSenate with my support at the end of the 109th Congress. Under that \nlegislation, the Veterans Affairs Office of Rural Health was created in \norder to enhance access to VA medical facilities for veterans living in \ngeographically remote areas.\n  First off, our newly proposed legislation tasks the Office of Rural \nHealth with developing demonstration projects that would broaden the \naccess to health care in rural areas by way of partnership between the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, and the Department of Health and Human Services at access \nhospitals and community health centers. Second, this bill calls on the \nOffice of Rural Health to establish between one and five Centers for \nExcellence to be based at VA medical centers to research ways to \nimprove health care for rural veterans.\n  While increased outpatient care services in Maine and other \nunderserved areas is a good step forward, it is only half of the \nequation. Veterans must also be able to get to the facilities, and \nwhile programs such as the Disabled American Veterans Transportation \nNetwork are to be commended, they simply cannot take care of all the \ntransportation needs of all the patients who require VA health care.\n  Therefore, our legislation would task the Director of the Office of \nRural Health to create a program that would provide grants of up to \n$50,000 to veterans' service organizations and State veterans' service \nofficers to assist veterans with innovative travel options to VA \nmedical centers. Additionally, this legislation directly addresses the \ninequitable travel reimbursements currently provided to veterans for \ntheir travel expenses to VA medical facilities, an issue which I have \nbrought up to the VA Secretary Jim Nicholson in the past. Under current \nlaw, veterans with a disability of 30 percent or more are entitled to \n11 cents per mile, a rate that has not changed since 1977. In order to \nput an end to this unjust practice, our legislation would provide \ncritical assistance to veterans traveling long distances to VA health \ncare facilities by reimbursing them at the Federal rate of 48.5 cents \nper mile.\n  Establishing new facilities and transportation networks in Maine, as \nenumerated within the provisions of our legislation, would give rural \nveterans better access to the veteran health care system and deliver on \nthe promise America has made to our men and women in uniform. But as \nrural veterans will tell you, there is a long way to go, and we must \nredouble our efforts to ensure that the VA secures the necessary \nresources for all rural regions across Maine and throughout the Nation.\n  Furthermore, I have nothing but the utmost respect for those brave \nAmericans who served in uniform with honor, courage, and distinction. \nThe obligation our Nation holds for its veterans is enormous, and it is \nan obligation that must be fulfilled every day, by invoking the \nindelible words of President John F. Kennedy, who stated:\n\n       As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the \n     highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by \n     them.\n\n  Undoubtedly, these words still speak truth today, at a time when over \n600,000 courageous men and women have returned from combat in both Iraq \nand Afghanistan. It is now up to Congress to do everything in its power \nto answer our veterans' call, to ensure that they receive the benefits \nthat they rightly earned and rightly deserve. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation. Our veterans deserve nothing \nless.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/19/senate-section/article/S4748-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4748-S4749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  CONGRATULATING THE SOUTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY WOMEN'S BASKETBALL \n                                  TEAM\n\n Mr. THUNE. Madam President, today I honor the South Dakota \nState University women's basketball team. In only their third season as \nDivision I competitors, the Jackrabbits made it to the quarterfinals of \nthe Women's\n\n[[Page S4749]]\n\nNational Invitational Tournament. This impressive accomplishment capped \noff an extremely successful season in which the Jacks finished with a \nrecord of 25-6.\n  The SDSU women's basketball team has a long tradition of postseason \nsuccess. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the Jacks qualified for 10 \nAIAW regional tournaments. As NCAA Division II competitors, they made \nnine postseason appearances and won the national title in 2003. \nAdditionally, the Jackrabbits reached the Elite Eight in each of their \nlast three seasons as a Division II team.\n  In 2004, SDSU transitioned its athletic program to compete in NCAA \nDivision I, becoming the first school in South Dakota to do so. Since \nthis transition, the Jackrabbits women's basketball team has \nsuccessfully risen to meet the challenge that comes with this new level \nof competition. By defeating well-known teams with much bigger budgets, \nthis year's team once again proved that SDSU can compete with the top \nprograms in the Nation.\n  The Jackrabbits were led by Aaron Johnston, who has served as head \ncoach of the SDSU women's basketball team for the past seven seasons. \nCoach Johnston was responsible for taking the Jacks to the top of NCAA \nDivision II and has shown his strong leadership skills in successfully \ntransitioning the team to Division I. He was the 2006 South Dakota \nSportswriters Women's College Basketball Coach of the Year and has been \nnamed the Division I Independent Coach of the Year for the past two \nseasons. Johnston was supported by Assistant Coaches Laurie Melum, Jina \nJohansen, and Matt Stamerjohn.\n  Of course, this historic season would be impossible without the \nplayers themselves. The athletes of the 2006-2007 South Dakota State \nUniversity women's basketball team, in alphabetical order, are as \nfollows: Alison Anderson, Maria Boever, Ketty Cornemann, Courtney \nGrimsrud, Nicole Helsper, Abby Kratovil, Morgan Meier, Ashlea \nMuckenhirn, Laura Nielsen, Stacie Oistad, Andrea Verdegan, Megan Vogel, \nand Jennifer Warkenthien.\n  While all of these women should be commended for their efforts, I \nwould like to especially recognize the team's only senior, Megan Vogel. \nA 4-year starter, Vogel ended her career as the second leading scorer \nin SDSU school history with 1,850 career points. During this past \nseason, she led the Jacks in scoring with 17.5 points per game and was \nchosen as a first-team all-Division I Independent selection for the \nsecond time. After participating in the WNBA Pre-Draft Camp, Vogel was \nchosen as a second round draft pick by the Washington Mystics. Selected \nas the 19th overall pick, Vogel became the first Jackrabbit and first \nplayer from a South Dakota college to be taken in the WNBA draft.\n  These are just a few of the many firsts that the Jacks accomplished \nthis season. These student-athletes should be very proud of all of \ntheir remarkable achievements. On behalf of the State of South Dakota, \nI am pleased to say congratulations Jackrabbits on this impressive \naccomplishment and keep up the great work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/19/senate-section/article/S4749-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ROBERT WINGET: IN MEMORIAM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of a respected law enforcement officer, Officer \nRobert Winget of the Ripon Police Department.\n  For the past 3 years, Officer Winget worked tirelessly to provide the \nresidents of Ripon with safety and service. On the morning of April 10, \n2007, Officer Winget's life was tragically cut short in the line of \nduty as a result of a vehicle accident while patrolling the heavily \nwooded banks of the Stanislaus River.\n  Officer Winget began his law enforcement career at the Los Angeles \nPolice Department in the early 1970s. In a career that would span 37 \nyears, Officer Winget also worked for the Stanislaus County Sheriff's \nDepartment before lending his considerable talents to the Ripon Police \nDepartment. Throughout his career, Officer Winget demonstrated a \npassion for law enforcement and commitment to helping others, qualities \nthat enabled him to become a beloved member of the Ripon Police \nDepartment. Officer Wignet's colleagues and the people whom he \nprotected shall always remember him for his devotion to serving the \ncommunity.\n  Officer Winget is survived by his wife and four children. Officer \nWinget served the people of Ripon with honor and dignity and fulfilled \nhis oath as a peace officer. His contributions to law enforcement and \nthe many lives he touched will serve as a shining example of his \nlegacy.\n  We shall always be grateful for Officer Wignet's service and the \ndedication that he displayed while serving the people of Ripon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/19/senate-section/article/S4749-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:42 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1361.

A bill to amend the Tariff Act of 1930 to eliminate the \nconsumptive demand exception relating to the importation of goods made \nwith forced labor; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce legislation \nthat will strike the consumptive demand clause from Section 307 of the \nTariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307). Section 307 prohibits the \nimportation of any product or good produced with forced or indentured \nlabor including forced or indentured child labor.\n  The consumptive demand clause creates an exception to this \nprohibition. Under the exception, if a product is not made in the \nUnited States, and there is a demand for it, then a product made with \nforced or indentured child labor may be imported into this country.\n  Let us be clear: forced or indentured labor means work which is \nextracted from any person under the menace of penalty for \nnonperformance and for which the worker does not offer himself \nvoluntarily. Let us be really clear: this means slave labor. In the \ncase of children, it means child slavery.\n  Some examples of goods that are made with child slave labor include \ncocoa beans, hand-knotted carpets, beedis, which are small Indian \ncigarettes, and cotton.\n  Throughout my Senate career, I have worked to reduce the use of \nforced child labor worldwide. It was in 1992 that I first introduced a \nbill to ban all products made by abusive and exploitative child labor \nfrom entering the United States.\n  Over the years we have been making some progress. I was heartened \nlast year when the International Labor Organization's (ILO) global \nreport, The End of Child Labor Within Reach, detailed the progress \nbeing made on reducing the worst forms of child labor. The ILO projects \nthat if the current pace of decline in child labor were to be \nmaintained, child labor could be eliminated, in most of its worst \nforms, in 10 years--by 2016. Although there has been a tremendous \namount of progress in ending child labor, there are still\n\n[[Page S4753]]\n\nsome obstacles to ending these abusive practices. One of those \nimpediments is the consumptive demand clause.\n  Today, hundreds of millions of children are still forced to work \nillegally for little or no pay, making goods that enter our country \neveryday. For this reason, the consumptive demand clause is outdated. \nSince this exception was enacted in the 1930s, the U.S. has taken \nnumerous steps to stop the scourge of child slave labor. Most notably, \nthe United States has ratified International Labor Organization's \nConvention 182 to Prohibit the Worst Forms of Child Labor. Currently, \n162 other countries have also ratified this ILO Convention.\n  Additionally, in 2003, my staff was invited by Customs to meet with \nfield agents on Section 307 to discuss what appropriations were needed \nto enforce the statute. At the meeting, the field agents reported that \nthe consumptive demand clause was an obstacle to their ability to \nenforce the law that is supposed to prevent goods made with slave labor \nfrom being imported into the United States. Yet there has been no \naction from the Bush Administration to support efforts to remove the \nclause.\n  Retaining the consumptive demand clause contradicts our moral beliefs \nand our international commitments to eliminate abusive child labor. \nMaintaining the consumptive demand clause says to the world that the \nUnited States justifies the use of slave labor, if U.S. consumers need \nan item not produced in this country. Last year, Harvard University \nconducted a pilot study on the effects on sales of labeling towels, \ncandles, and dolls as made under ``fair labor conditions.'' The study \nfound that labeling the products and raising their prices slightly to \ncover the costs of ensuring fair labor conditions resulted in an \nincreased demand for these products among certain consumers in New York \nCity.\n  There should be no exception to a fundamental stand against the use \nof slave labor. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 1158. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to increase the use of \nrenewable and alternative fuel, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Alternative \nFuel Standard Act. The bill that I am introducing today reflects the \nPresident's draft legislation to which he referred in his State of the \nUnion.\n  Although I may have some questions with the particulars of the \nPresident's plan, he and I share the common goal of increasing domestic \nenergy security without compromising environmental quality.\n  As the committee of principal jurisdiction, the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works has a long history of moving fuels \nlegislation. While chairman, I successfully discharged legislation that \nserved as the historic fuels title to the comprehensive energy bill. \nThat renewable fuels plan was the product of years of hearings, \nnegotiation, and debate. The President's initiative deserves the same \namount of attention.\n  According to a Labor Department report this month, most of the \ncountry's inflation can be directly attributed to higher gas prices. \nThe USDA's Economic Research Service concluded that high gas prices \nwill increase food costs in 2007; the Service noted that the food \nconsumer price index increased at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in 2006 \nand will increase 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent.\n  The Energy Information Administration's April 2007 Outlook noted that \nthe higher prices are due to continued international tensions, the \nconversion to summer blends, and unanticipated refinery problems.\n  AAA found that the average national price for gasoline is $2.87 up \nfrom $2.55 just a month earlier. Yet those national high prices seem \nlow compared to California. AAA of Northern California noted that the \naverage price for gasoline is $3.41 in Oakland, $3.53 in San Francisco, \nand averages $3.34 statewide.\n  The bottom line--supply source instability and inadequate domestic \ninfrastructure have and will continue to contribute to high prices and \ninflation unless Congress does something about it. The President's \nambitious proposal seeks to alleviate those concerns by sourcing new \nsupply domestically.\n  The proposal that I am introducing would amend the Clean Air Act's \nexisting renewable fuels standard by diversifying the types of \nqualifying fuels and increasing the volumes. Qualifying alternative \nfuels will be expanded to include fuels derived from gas and coal, and \nhydrogen, among others.\n  Cellulosic biomass ethanol is a promising technology that could \nsignificantly increase fuel supplies without compromising the food and \nfeed prices. I am proud to say that some of the foremost research in \nthe field is being done in my own State of Oklahoma, including a team \nat the Noble Foundation. Their work is engineering high energy and \nperennial crops that can be grown across the country.\n  Similarly, coal-to-liquids fuels could be the greatest domestic \nenergy resource of all time. I have been promoting the technology for \nyears, particularly for defense aircraft, but now is the time to expand \nthis super clean fuel for use across America.\n  The plan would replace the current RFS by requiring 10 billion \ngallons of alternative fuel to be used in 2010 and increasing to 35 \nbillion gallons by 2018. The bill similarly builds upon the current RFS \nby requiring EPA to incorporate the newer qualifying fuels into the \ncredit trading system.\n  I have been seeking to increase U.S. energy security for years. I am \nglad that the President has stepped up and taken this issue head-on. \nThe proposal deserves careful and proper consideration. The American \npeople require as much. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nimprove U.S. domestic energy security while fully considering public \nhealth and welfare.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Roberts, \n        Mr. Coleman, Mr. Warner, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Lieberman, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1159. A bill to amend part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act to provide full Federal funding of such part; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nNebraska, Senator Hagel, in introducing the IDEA Full Funding Act. The \naim of this legislation is to ensure, at long last, that Congress makes \ngood on a commitment it made more than three decades ago when we passed \nwhat is now called the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. At \nthat time, in 1975, we told children with disabilities, their families, \nschools, and States that the Federal Government would pay 40 percent of \nthe extra cost of special education. We have never lived up to that \ncommitment. In fact, today, we are not even halfway there.\n  As we introduce this bill, we want to pay tribute to our former \ncolleague, Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont, who, in 2001, joined with \nme to introduce the first amendment to make full funding of IDEA \nmandatory. In 1975, as ranking member of the House subcommittee on \nspecial education, Jim Jeffords co-authored what would later be known \nas the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, requiring equal \naccess to public education for millions of students with disabilities. \nIt was a matter of profound disappointment to Jim that, year after \nyear, the Federal Government failed to make good on its funding \npromises under that law.\n  We tell our children all the time to keep their promises, to live up \nto their commitments, to do as they say they are going to do. We teach \nthem that if they fail to do so, other people can be hurt. Well, that \nis what Congress has done by failing to appropriately fund IDEA: We \nhave hurt school children all across America. We have pitted children \nwith disabilities against other children for a limited pool of school \nfunds. We have put parents in the position of not demanding services \nthat their child with a disability truly needs, because they have been \ntold that the services cost too much and other children would suffer. \nWe have hurt school districts, which are forced, in effect, to rob \nPeter to pay Paul in order to provide services to students with \ndisabilities. We have also hurt local taxpayers, who are obliged to pay \nhigher property taxes and other local taxes\n\n[[Page S4754]]\n\nin order to pay for IDEA services because the Federal Government has \nreneged on its commitment.\n  I was pleased that, at the outset of this new Congress, we were able \nto increase funding for the IDEA grants to states program as part of \nthe FY 2007 Continuing Resolution to $10.8 billion. But even that level \nof funding is woefully inadequate. That represents only 17.2 percent of \nthe additional funding needed to support special education. So we have \na long way to go to reach the 40 percent level. But it is time to do \nso. It is time for the Federal Government to make good on its promise \nto students with disabilities in this country.\n  The IDEA Full Funding Act is pretty straight forward. It authorizes \nincreasing amounts of mandatory funding in 8-year increments that, in \naddition to the discretionary funding allocated through the \nAppropriations Committee, will finally meet the Federal Government's \ncommitment to educating children with special needs.\n  This bill is a win-win-win for the American people. Students with \ndisabilities will get the education services that they need in order to \nachieve and succeed. School districts will be able to provide these \nservices without cutting into their general education budgets. And \nlocal property tax payers will get relief.\n  Full funding of IDEA is not a partisan issue. We all share an \ninterest in ensuring that children with disabilities get an appropriate \neducation, and that local school districts do not have to slash their \ngeneral education budgets in order to pay for special education. We all \nshare a sense of responsibility to make good on the promise Congress \nmade to fully fund its promised share of special education costs.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Hagel and me in \nsponsoring this bill. In the 30-plus years since we passed IDEA, and in \nthe 6 years since we passed the No Child Left Behind Act, the \nexpectations for students with disabilities have grown immensely. \nLikewise, we are holding local school systems accountable in \nunprecedented ways. It is high time for us in Congress to also be held \naccountable. It is time for us to make good on our promise to fully \nfund IDEA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Clinton, \n        Mr. Casey, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Murray, \n        Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Smith, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Brown, Mr. \n        Menendez, Mr. Burr, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1160. A bill to ensure an abundant and affordable supply of highly \nnutritious fruits, vegetables, and other specialty crops for American \nconsumers and international markets by enhancing the competitiveness of \nUnited States-grown specialty crops; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Specialty \nCrop Competition Act of 2007.'' This bipartisan legislation co-\nsponsored by the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, \nincreases the focus on the contribution that specialty crops add to the \nUnited States agricultural economy. This bill specifically provides the \nproper and necessary attention to many challenges faced throughout each \nsegment of the industry.\n  Most do not realize the significance of specialty crops and their \nvalue to the U.S. economy and the health of U.S. citizens. According to \nthe United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, \nfruits and vegetables alone added $29.9 billion to the U.S. economy in \n2002. This figure does not even include the contribution of nursery and \nother ornamental plant production, which our bill recognizes.\n  The specialty crop industry also accounts for more than $53 billion \nin cash receipts for U.S. producers, which is close to 54 percent of \nthe total cash receipts for all crops. A surprising fact to some is \nthat my State of Idaho is a top producer of specialty crops. Idaho \nproudly boasts production of cherries, table grapes, apples, onions, \ncarrots, several varieties of seed crops and of course one of our most \nnotable specialty crops, potatoes.\n  Maintaining a viable and sustainable specialty crop industry also \nbenefits the health of America's citizens. Obesity continues to plague \nmillions of people today and is a very serious and deepening threat not \nonly to personal health and well-being, but to the resources of the \neconomy as well. This issue is now receiving the necessary attention at \nthe highest levels, and specialty crops will continue to play a \nprominent role in reversing the obesity trend.\n  The ``Specialty Crop Competition Act'' will also provide a stronger \nposition for the U.S. industry in the global market arena. This \nlegislation promotes initiatives that will combat diseases, both native \nand foreign, that continue to be used as non-tariff barriers to U.S. \nexports by foreign governments. Additionally, provisions in this bill \nseek improvements to federal regulations and resources that impede \ntimely consideration of industry sanitary and phytosanitary petitions.\n  This bill does not provide direct subsidies to producers like other \nprograms. This legislation takes a major step forward to highlight the \nsignificance of this industry to the agriculture economy, the benefits \nto the health of U.S. citizens, and the need for a stable, affordable, \ndiverse, and secure supply of food.\n  Senator Stabenow, I, and our co-sponsors fully intend to work with \nChairman Harkin, Ranking Member Chambliss and the entire Senate \nAgriculture Committee to include this legislation in the new Farm Bill \nthat Congress will soon be debating. Specialty crops have never sat at \nthe head of the farm policy table, but their importance to our Nation's \nhealth, security, and economy cannot be avoided any longer.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Administration \nto consider this comprehensive and necessary legislation as we begin to \ndiscuss new initiatives for the 2007 Farm Bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Schumer, \n        and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1161. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nauthorize the expansion of medicare coverage of medical nutrition \ntherapy services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my \ncolleagues Senators Craig and Conrad and others in introducing the \nMedicare Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 2007. This marks the fourth \nconsecutive Congress that Senator Craig and I have joined together in \nintroducing a bill to expand the current Medicare Medical Nutrition \nTherapy (MNT) benefit.\n  In 2000, the Congress passed a bill authorizing Medicare payment for \nMNT services, but only for patients with diabetes and renal diseases. \nRecognizing that many other diseases also have a nutrition component to \ntheir treatment, Congress asked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nservices to report back to Congress their recommendations on MNT \ncoverage. That report was submitted to Congress in 2004 and recommended \nthat patients with conditions such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and \ncertain cancers be eligible to receive MNT therapy.\n  Medical Nutrition Therapy is not nutrition counseling, it is much \nmore. It involves a specific diagnosis of a disease, condition, or \ndisorder that can be treated with nutrition intervention. That is why \nCongress limited MNT provider status to Registered Dietitians; they \nhave the specific training necessary to address nutritional \ninterventions as part of a diseased related therapy.\n  As we all know, Medicare is under tremendous financial stress. It is \ntherefore critically important that bills designed to expand Medicare's \ncoverage be both necessary and cost effective. This is exactly why \nSenator Craig and I have been such consistent supporters of expanding \nthe MNT benefit.\n  Under our current bill, there is no mandated expansion of the \nbenefit. Instead, we simply give the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices the authority to expand coverage using the National Coverage \nDetermination process. The Congress has mandated that the criteria used \nin that process is necessary and reasonable.\n  As a result, the MNT benefit will not be expanded beyond diabetes and \nrenal diseases unless such expansion is proven to be cost effective. \nThis is likely not a difficult test for MNT to meet.\n\n[[Page S4755]]\n\nThere is considerable evidence that MNT is cost effective in the \ntreatment of conditions such as pre-diabetes, which surprisingly is not \neligible for MNT.\n  Five years ago, in March of 2002, then HHS Secretary Tommy G. \nThompson warned Americans of the risks of ``pre-diabetes,'' a condition \naffecting nearly 16 million Americans that sharply raises the risk for \ndeveloping type 2 diabetes and increases the risk of heart disease by \n50 percent.\n  HHS-supported research that shows most people with pre-diabetes will \nlikely develop diabetes within a decade unless they make modest changes \nin their diet and level of physical activity, which can help them \nreduce their risks and avoid the debilitating disease.\n  Secretary Thompson called for physicians to begin screening \noverweight people age 45 and older for pre-diabetes. When Congress \npassed the Medicare Modernization Act in December 2003, it included \ndiabetes (and pre-diabetes) screening in the Welcome to Medicare \nphysical. So Medicare now covers diabetes screening and will pay for \nMNT for beneficiaries diagnosed with diabetes, but it will not pay for \nnutrition counseling for beneficiaries diagnosed with pre-diabetes. \nThis makes no sense.\n  The last Congress recognized the critical role that MNT can play in \nthe treatment of HIV/AIDS by making MNT one of the Core Medical \nServices under the Ryan White CARE Act. According to the American \nDietetic Association, ``The importance of nutrition and especially \nmedical nutrition therapy to the treatment and management of HIV \ndisease cannot be overstated. MNT has become a critical element of \ndisease management for persons living with HIV/AIDS.'' Many HIV/AIDs \npatients are eligible for Medicare and these patients are in need of \nMNT to help them manage their disease.\n  Since the current MNT benefit is limited under statute to just \nbeneficiaries with diabetes and renal diseases, CMS lacks the authority \nto expand the benefit regardless of how cost effective it is or how \nmany lives it might save. This makes no sense.\n  The bill that Senator Craig and I are introducing today gives the \nexperts at CMS the authority to make those decisions. Choosing to rely \non the National Coverage Determination (NCD) process would allow CMS to \nmake decisions based upon the science, and establish the extent to \nwhich Medicare will cover specific services, procedures or technologies \non a national basis. This is what the NCD is designed to do. This \napproach also recognizes the importance of saving Medicare dollars.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me today in supporting this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1161\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \ncompensation and specially adapted housing for veterans in certain \ncases of impairment of vision involving both eyes, and to provide for \nthe use of the National Directory of New Hires for income verification \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce the Blinded Veterans \nPaired Organ Act of 2007. This legislation would update the eligibility \nrequirements for certain benefits provided to veterans with a service-\nconnected disability due to blindness. It addresses two areas of \nveterans' law that heretofore excluded many veterans with severe vision \nimpairment from accessing benefits that could significantly improve the \nquality of their lives. At a time when great changes are afoot in how \nthis Nation prioritizes the care of its veterans, it is still important \nthat we also remain attentive to the places where small changes can \nmake a large impact. Several of my colleagues, including Senators \nBrown, Feingold, Hagel, Isakson, and Webb, join me in introducing this \nlegislation.\n  This bill would relax the criteria for vision impairment in two \nseparate areas of veterans' benefits law. The first governs eligibility \nfor disability compensation under what is known as the ``paired organ \nlaw.'' The second relates to the criteria for blinded veterans seeking \nVA grants for specially adapted housing.\n  The paired organ law provides veterans who sustain a service-\nconnected injury loss of function in one of their coupled organs, eyes, \nkidneys, ears, lungs, hands, and feet, with eligibility for additional \ncompensation should they sustain a non-service-connected injury or loss \nof function in the companion organ.\n  With respect to vision, VA currently requires veterans to demonstrate \na visual acuity of less than 5/200 in the non-service-connected eye in \norder to receive compensation for full service-connected blindness. \nHowever, this requires veterans to demonstrate more severe visual \nimpairment to qualify for benefits than if the standard definition of \nblindness were used by VA. The standard definition, accepted by the \nAmerican Medical Association, the Social Security Administration, and \nthe motor vehicle license laws of all 50 States, is a visual acuity of \n20/200 or less, or a peripheral field of vision of 20 degrees or less.\n  This difference in standards was initially brought to the attention \nof Representative Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin several years ago by Dr. \nJames Allen, a veteran of the Korean War and a long-time \nophthalmologist at the Madison VA hospital. Representative Baldwin \nsubsequently engaged in a long fight on behalf of blinded veterans, \nultimately securing passage of a bill this March which would change \nexisting law. I would like to thank Representative Baldwin and Dr. \nAllen for their hard work on behalf of veterans who are struggling with \nvision impairment as a result of their service and I am proud to join \nthem in their efforts through introduction of this companion bill.\n  With respect to VA grants for specially adapted housing for blinded \nveterans, VA disburses grants of up to $10,000 to veterans with a \nservice-connected disability due to blindness in both eyes for the \npurpose of adapting their homes to accommodate their disability. \nHowever, as with the paired organ statute, current law requires that \nveterans have a visual acuity of 5/200 or less in order to be eligible \nfor these grants. This legislation would correct this standard as well, \nmaking\n\n[[Page S4756]]\n\nspecially adapted housing grants available to veterans with a visual \nacuity of 20/200 or less, or a peripheral field of vison of 20 degrees \nor less.\n  This legislation is particularly important at this moment when so \nmany of the men and women in our Armed Forces are deployed overseas in \ncombat zones. Traumatic brain injury is frequently described as the \n``signature wound'' of the conflict in Iraq and it is frequently \naccompanied by damage to the veteran's vision. Thus, there are numerous \nveterans recovering from battle wounds right now who can benefit from \nthis legislation both in the immediate future and down the road. Some \nwho have suffered severe vision impairment will be able to speed their \nreadjustment by adapting their homes to accommodate the disability. And \nthose who have suffered blindness in one eye will be assured that they \nare provided for in the event that they lose sight in the other eye.\n  With more and more servicemembers deployed in combat zones everyday, \nwe are constantly reminded of the great sacrifice they make for this \nNation. We owe it to them, at the very least, to ensure that they are \nnot required to shoulder an undue burden when it comes to qualifying \nfor veterans' benefits. Thus, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join \nme in supporting this important legislation on behalf of blinded \nveterans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Graham, and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska):\n  S. 1164. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove patient access to, and utilization of, the colorectal cancer \nscreening benefit under the Medicare Program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Colon Cancer Screen \nfor Life Act of 2007 along with my colleagues, Senator Collins, Senator \nLieberman, and Senator Graham. Many people are aware that colon cancer \nis the second most deadly cancer in the United States. In 2006 alone, \naccording to the American Cancer Society, more than 150,000 new cases \nwere diagnosed and more than 50,000 Americans died from colon cancer. \nIn my own State of Maryland, nearly 1,000 people lost their lives to \nthis disease last year. What people are not as aware of, however, is \nthat colon cancer is preventable with appropriate screening, highly \ndetectable, and curable if found early. The purpose of our bill is to \nincrease the rate of participation in colon cancer screening and ensure \nthat we are saving every life that we can from this deadly disease.\n  Medicare coverage for colorectal cancer screening through colonoscopy \nwas authorized in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and further expanded \nin 2000 when the colonoscopy benefit was added for high risk \nbeneficiaries. Under this Medicare benefit, a low risk beneficiary is \nentitled to receive a colonoscopy once every ten years and a high risk \nbeneficiary is entitled to a colonoscopy every two years. Despite this, \nrecent studies have shown that patients are not utilizing coverage of \nCRC preventive screenings. According to the Government Accountability \nOffice, since the implementation of the benefit in 1998, the percentage \nof Medicare beneficiaries receiving either a screening or a diagnostic \ncolonoscopy has increased by 1 percent.\n  Since providing coverage for this lifesaving service, Congress has \ndiscovered many barriers that stand in the way of patients having \naccess to the colonoscopy benefit. One reason for such low utilization \nis that the physician reimbursement has been cut by 33 percent since \nthis benefit was enacted. In 1997, a colonoscopy performed in a \nhospital outpatient department or an ambulatory surgery center was \nreimbursed at approximately $301. Now, in 2007, that reimbursement is \nonly $198.20.\n  Some may argue that reductions in Medicare payments are necessary to \nkeep the Medicare Program financially viable. While I strongly support \nefforts to eliminate wasteful spending in Medicare, I can assure my \ncolleagues that is not the case here. To the contrary, providing \nadequate reimbursement for screening will result in Medicare savings \nand better health outcomes. Let me explain. Our health care system \nspends an estimated $8.3 billion annually to treat newly diagnosed \ncases of colon cancer. The average cost of direct medical care for each \ncancer episode is estimated to be between $35,000 for early stage \ndetection and $80,000 for later stage detection. So each time that \ncancer is not detected early, that individual faces an increased risk \nof developing the disease and needing treatment that costs Medicare \nProgram tens of thousands of dollars.\n  Patient participation has also been is that currently Medicare does \nnot cover a preoperative visit with a physician prior to screening. \nWhile it is true that a colonoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure, \nan anesthetic is used to sedate the patient to make the colonoscopy \nless uncomfortable. Because the patient is going to be sedated, medical \nstandards require doctors to visit with the patient before surgery to \ndetermine and protect against any risks, such as drug interaction, and \nto give them preoperative instructions. Recognizing the importance of \nthese visits, Medicare does reimburse for a consultation prior to a \ndiagnostic colonoscopy. A preoperative visit is no less medically \nnecessary before a preventive screening, and therefore should be \nreimbursed in the same manner.\n  Finally, some beneficiaries may delay seeking colorectal cancer \nscreening because they cannot afford Medicare's Part B deductible. \nRecognizing this, Congress recently took an important step by waiving \nthe Part B deductible for preventive colon cancer screenings, effective \nJanuary 1, 2007. However, gastroenterologists are now reporting that, \nif polyps or other signs of cancer are discovered in the course of a \npreventive colonoscopy, the procedure is then considered to be \ndiagnostic and Medicare requires that the beneficiary pay a deductible. \nCongress needs to ensure that beneficiaries are not dissuaded from \ngetting this lifesaving procedure by the concern that they might have \nto pay a deductible if a polyp is discovered. Our legislation clarifies \ncongressional intent to ensure that CMS will waive the deductible in \nall screenings so that Medicare beneficiaries are not confronted with \nan unexpected additional expense, should the procedure's coding change.\n  The Colon Cancer Screen for Life Act would eliminate every one of \nthese barriers, and in doing so, save lives. First, this legislation \nwould increase reimbursement for colorectal cancer related procedures \nto ensure that physicians are able to continue to perform these \nvaluable services. Reimbursement for procedures performed in a \nphysician's office would be increased by up to 10 percent and \nreimbursement for procedures performed in Hospital Outpatient \nDepartment, HOPD, or Ambulatory Surgery Center, ASC, would be increased \nby up to 30 percent. The bill would also provide Medicare coverage for \nthe preoperative doctor's visit conducted prior to a screening \ncolonoscopy. Finally, the bill contains a technical provision to \nrequire that the deductible is waived whether or not the beneficiary's \nscreening was clean or results in a biopsy or lesion removal.\n  More than 50,000 Americans will die from colon cancer this year \nalone. Ninety percent of these cases might have been prevented. We \ncannot afford to wait another moment before doing something to \neliminate these and other barriers that are standing in the way of \npreventing colon cancer.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important \nlegislation and enact it this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN:\n  S. 115. A bill to require Federal buildings to be designed, \nconstructed, and certified to meet, at a minimum, the Leadership in \nEnergy and Environmental Design green building rating standard \nidentified as silver by the United States Green Building Council, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we need to make this country energy \nindependent, and to enact a comprehensive, long-term energy policy that \nwill give Americans the energy they need, while protecting our \nenvironment and our national security.\n  As one step in this direction, today I am introducing the American \nGreen Building Act.\n\n[[Page S4757]]\n\n  Our Federal Government is the largest single energy consumer in the \nworld.\n  Buildings account for over a third of America's energy consumption. \nBuildings also account for 49 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions, 25 \npercent of nitrous oxide emissions, and 10 percent of particulate \nemissions, all of which damage our air quality. Buildings produce 38 \npercent of the country's carbon dioxide emissions--the chief pollutant \nblamed for global warming.\n  Federal buildings are a large part of this problem.\n  Energy used in Federal buildings in fiscal year 2002 accounted for 38 \npercent of the total Federal energy bill. Total Federal buildings and \nfacilities energy expenditures in fiscal year 2002 were $3.73 billion.\n  The American Green Building Act would require all new Federal \nbuildings to live up to green building LEED, Leadership and Energy in \nEnvironmental Design, Silver standards, set by the United States Green \nBuilding Council. These standards were created to promote sustainable \nsite development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials \nselection, and indoor environmental quality. The average LEED-certified \nbuilding uses 32 percent less electricity, 26 percent less natural gas \nand 36 percent less total energy. LEED-certified buildings in the U.S. \nare in aggregate saving 150,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide \nreduction, equivalent to 30,000 passenger cars not driven for one year. \nA single LEED-certified building is designed to save an average of 352 \nmetric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, which is equivalent \nto 70 passenger cars not driven for one year. This standard would only \napply to Federal buildings for which the design phase for construction \nor major renovation is begun after the date of enactment of the \nprovision. The General Services Administration or relevant agency may \nwaive this requirement for a building if it finds that the requirement \ncannot be met because of the quantity of energy required to carry out \nthe building's purpose or because the building is used to carry out an \nactivity relating to national security.\n  My bill will also require that significant new development or \nredevelopment projects undertaken by the Federal Government plan for \nstorm water runoff. The hardened surfaces of modern life, such as \nroofs, parking lots, and paved streets, prevent rainfall from \ninfiltrating the soil. Over 100 million acres of land have been \ndeveloped in the United States. Development is increasing faster than \npopulation: Population growth in the Chesapeake Watershed, for example, \nincreased by 8 percent during the 1990s, but the rate of impervious \nsurface increased by 42 percent. Development not only leads to \nlandscape changes but also to contamination of storm water runoff by \npollutants throughout the watershed. Storm water runoff can carry \npollutants to our streams, rivers, and oceans, and poses a significant \nproblem for the Chesapeake Bay. Every other pollution source in the \nChesapeake is decreasing, but pollution from storm water runoff is \nincreasing. In urbanized areas, increased storm water runoff can cause \nincreased flooding, stream bank erosion, degradation of in-stream \nhabitat and a reduction in groundwater quality. For these reasons, as \nthe Federal Government moves forward with development, we need to plan \nfor how to manage storm water runoff. The storm water provisions in the \nAmerican Green Building Act will be used to intercept precipitation and \nallow it to infiltrate rather than being collected on and conveyed from \nimpervious surfaces.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1165\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income certain zone compensation of civilian employees of \nthe United States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nEmployee Combat Zone Tax Parity Act, which would provide parity to \ncivilian Federal employees by extending the tax credit currently \nreceived by military personnel in combat zones to the civilian Federal \nemployees working alongside them. My fellow Virginian, Congressman \nFrank Wolf, has introduced a similar bill in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In addition, several Federal employee organizations, such as the \nAmerican Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the National \nTreasury Employees Union (NTEU), the Financial Management Association \n(FMA), the Senior Executives Association (SEA), the American Foreign \nService Association (AFSA), and the National Federation of Federal \nEmployees (NFFE), strongly support this legislation.\n  As of today, I have made eleven separate trips to Iraq and \nAfghanistan to see firsthand the work of our military personnel, which \nis essential to success in these regions. In addition, the work of our \nFederal civilian employees in these regions is significantly important.\n\n[[Page S4758]]\n\n  At the moment, a majority of the work in the reconstruction of these \ncountries is being done by the military and the Department of State \n(DOS). These dedicated men and women deserve our gratitude. However, as \nI have said on a number of occasions, our challenging task requires the \ncoordination and work of Federal agencies across the spectrum.\n  Regardless of whether one is in the military or a civilian, there are \ncertain risks and hardships associated with working overseas. As a \nresult, the Federal Government provides certain incentives to \nindividuals when they take on extremely challenging jobs. For example, \nthose in the military working in a combat zone receive the Combat Zone \nTax Credit.\n  This tax credit permits military personnel working in combat zones to \nexclude a certain amount of income from their Federal income taxes. \nThis benefit for the military was established in 1913.\n  Private contractors working in Iraq and Afghanistan get a similar \nbenefit. Under the Foreign Earned Income Tax Credit, contractors are \nallowed to exclude a portion of their income from taxes while they work \nabroad, like in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  To date, however, no similar benefit exists for Federal employees \nserving in the same combat zones. I do not believe it is fair for our \nFederal employees to be excluded from the same benefits available to \nmilitary personnel and private contractors in the same combat zone.\n  The Commonwealth of Virginia, of which I have been honored to serve \nfor the last 28 years in the Senate, is home to over 200,000 Federal \nemployees. I have long been a strong supporter of our Federal employees \nas I have been for our military personnel.\n  Our efforts in the war on terrorism can only be successful with a \nhighly skilled and experienced workforce. I can personally attest to \nthe dedication of civil service employees throughout the Federal \nGovernment. Since the September 11th attacks, Federal employees have \nbeen relocated, reassigned, and worked long hours under strenuous \ncircumstances without complaints, proving time and again their loyalty \nto their country is first and foremost.\n  During my service as Secretary of the Navy--during which I was \nprivileged to have some 650,000 civilian employees working side by side \nwith the uniformed Navy--I valued very highly the sense of teamwork \nbetween the civilian and uniformed members of the United States Navy. \nTeamwork is an intrinsic military value, in my judgment, and essential \nto mission accomplishment. A sense of parity and fairness is important \nfor developing this teamwork.\n  In Iraq and Afghanistan, the teamwork of the entire Federal \nGovernment is essential to harness our overall efforts to secure a \nmeasure of democracy for the peoples of those countries, and we need to \nmake it easier for our Federal employees to participate.\n  Last year, I offered additional legislation that became law under an \nemergency supplemental bill to achieve this goal. My bill, S. 2600, \nprovided the heads of agencies other than DOS and the Department of \nDefense (DOD) with the authority, at their discretion, to give their \nemployees who serve in Iraq and Afghanistan allowances, benefits, and \ngratuities comparable to those provided to State Department and DOD \nemployees serving in those countries.\n  At that time, the agency heads of non-DOD and DOS agencies did not \nhave such authority, and it is essential, as part of the U.S. effort to \nbring democracy and freedom to Iraq and Afghanistan, that agency heads \nbe able to give their workers in those countries the same benefits as \nthose they work beside.\n  In the last estimate, there are almost 2,000 Federal employees \nworking a variety of jobs in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am grateful for \ntheir hard work in potentially dangerous situations. And, I know there \nare many other Federal employees who are anxious to serve their country \nand engage in these efforts, but it is a lot to risk.\n  Providing parity in this important tax credit would provide a \nsignificant incentive for individuals to take on this challenge--a \nchallenge that America desperately needs Federal employees to \nundertake.\n  Throughout the world, America's civil servants are serving our \ngovernment and our people, often in dangerous situations. They are on \nthe ground in the war on terrorism taking over new roles to relieve \nmilitary personnel of tasks civilian employees can perform. They are \nplaying a vital role in the reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We have a long tradition in Congress of recognizing the valuable \ncontributions of our Federal employees in both the military service and \nin the civil service by providing fair and equitable treatment. This \nbill gives us the ability to continue this tradition while at the same \ntime providing an important incentive to help America meet its needs.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in support of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1166\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Employee Combat Zone \n     Tax Parity Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXCLUSION FROM GROSS INCOME FOR CERTAIN COMBAT ZONE \n                   COMPENSATION OF CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES OF THE \n                   UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 112 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to certain combat zone compensation of \n     members of the Armed Forces) is amended by redesignating \n     subsections (c) and (d) as subsections (d) and (e), \n     respectively, and by inserting after subsection (b) the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Civilian Employees of the United States Government.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Gross income does not include so much of \n     the compensation as does not exceed the maximum amount \n     specified in subsection (b) for active service as an employee \n     of the United States for any month during any part of which \n     such employee--\n       ``(A) served in a combat zone, or\n       ``(B) was hospitalized as a result of wounds, disease, or \n     injury incurred while serving in a combat zone; but this \n     subparagraph shall not apply for any month beginning more \n     than 2 years after the date of the termination of combatant \n     activities in such zone.\n       ``(2) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection--\n       ``(A) Employee of the united states.--The term `employee of \n     the United States' has the meaning given such term by section \n     2105 of title 5, United States Code, and includes--\n       ``(i) an individual in the commissioned corps of the Public \n     Health Service or the commissioned corps of the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and\n       ``(ii) an individual not otherwise described in the \n     preceding provisions of this subparagraph who is treated as \n     an employee of the United States or an agency thereof for \n     purposes of section 911(b).\n       ``(B) Active service.--The term `active service' means \n     active Federal service by an employee of the United \n     States.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Section 2201(b) of such Code is amended by striking \n     ``112(c)'' both places it appears and inserting ``112(d)''.\n       (2) The heading for section 112 of such Code is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 112.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 in order to \nprovide funding for student loan repayment for civil legal assistance \nattorneys; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Legal Aid \nAttorney Loan Repayment Act. This important legislation is critical to \nensuring that basic civil liberties are protected for all of our \ncitizens. Our promise of ``equal justice under law'' rings hollow if \nthose who are most vulnerable are denied access to representation. \nLegal Aid attorneys across the country protect the safety, security, \nand health of low-income citizens. When a senior citizen is the victim \nof a financial scam, when a family faces the loss of their home, or, \nall too often, when a woman\n\n[[Page S4759]]\n\nseeks protection from abuse, Legal Aid is there to help them. Legal Aid \nattorneys are critical to ensuring that poverty is not a barrier to \naccessing the justice system.\n  Despite the importance of the services they provide, almost half of \nthe eligible people seeking assistance from Legal Aid are being turned \naway because of a lack of funding. Additional qualified and experienced \nattorneys would alleviate some of the shortages facing Legal Aid.\n  I started my legal career as a legal service lawyer, and it is an \nexperience that I will never forget. It helped shape many of my views \nabout how government can most effectively help those in need. Working \nas a Legal Aid attorney is one of the most rewarding career choices a \nyoung lawyer can make.\n  Unfortunately, these days, it's harder and harder for newly minted \nlawyers to make the choice that I made to work for Legal Aid. The \naverage starting salary for a Legal Aid lawyer is now $35,000. But the \naverage annual loan repayment burden for a new law school graduate is \n$12,000! Many law graduates who are able to take positions with Legal \nAid end up leaving after two or three years because their debt is too \nburdensome. They leave at a time when they have gained the necessary \nexperience to provide valuable services to low-income clients, creating \na revolving door of inexperienced lawyers within Legal Aid services.\n  That is why I am introducing this bill to provide a loan-repayment \nprogram for new law graduates who chose to work for Legal Aid. Such \nprograms are available for Federal prosecutors and other Federal \nemployees. But, for Legal Aid attorneys--who have the lowest incomes--\nthere is not adequate access to loan-repayment programs. Estimates \nsuggest that there are fewer than 2,000 attorneys who would need the \nassistance of such a program. This bill builds on existing loan-\nrepayment and retention programs for lawyers in other fields by \nproviding partial loan-repayment assistance to full time civil legal \nassistance lawyers. Recipients who receive the loan-repayment \nassistance must commit to a minimum of three years of service. And the \nbill prioritizes awards for those who have practiced public service law \nwith less than five years of experience. This program is critical to \nensure that lawyers who want to commit to public service are able to do \nso.\n  We have a responsibility to ensure that all citizens have appropriate \nprotection under the law. By establishing a loan-repayment program, \nLegal Aid programs are better able to attract and retain qualified \npersonnel. I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation to \nreduce the barriers to public service and protect access to legal \nrepresentation for all of our citizens.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER:\n  S. 1168. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to establish a regulatory \nprogram for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides mercury, and carbon dioxide \nemissions from the electric generating sector; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to reduce \nair pollution and the threat of global warming by enacting strict \nstandards on the four major pollutants from powerplants. I send the \nlegislation to the desk and ask it be introduced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am pleased that Senator Joe \nLieberman, of Connecticut, who chairs a key environmental subcommittee, \nwill be the bill's lead cosponsor, so it will be known as the \nAlexander-Lieberman Clean Air Climate Change Act of 2007. It will \nestablish an aggressive but practical and achievable set of limits on \nfour key pollutants. This is a little different sort of clean air and \nclimate change bill, and I would like to talk for a few minutes about \nexactly what it does and why we are doing it this way.\n  Most of us in the Senate can be measured by where we come from. I \ncome from the Great Smoky Mountains. When I go home tomorrow afternoon, \nafter we hopefully start the competitiveness legislation debate, I will \ngo to my home about 2 miles from the Great Smoky Mountains National \nPark. When the Cherokees named the Great Smoky Mountains, which today \nhave become our most visited national park, they were not talking about \nsmog and soot. Unfortunately, today they probably would be. There has \nbeen a lot of recent progress, but air pollution is still a serious \nhealth problem, causing illnesses from asthma to premature death, and \nmaking it harder to attract new jobs.\n  To be specific about that, recently, over the last 20 years, the auto \nindustry has become important to Tennessee.\n  Tennessee was in competition recently for a Toyota plant that nearly \ncame to Chattanooga but went to Mississippi. In the last 25 years, one-\nthird of our manufacturing jobs have become auto jobs. I can remember \nwhen there were not any, and I was Governor, and the Nissan plant \ndecided to come to Tennessee in 1980. The first thing I had to do as \nGovernor was to help them go down to the air quality board and get a \npermit to paint 500,000 cars and trucks a year. That is a lot of paint, \nand produces a lot of emissions in the area. If Tennessee had not had \nclean air at that time, that Nissan plant would have been in Georgia. \nSo clean air is not only about our health, although the more we learn \nabout the effects of nitrogen pollutants and sulfur pollutants, the \nmore that we learn that it and mercury are about our health, clean air \nis also about our ability to attract jobs. So we want to make sure that \nwhen Nissan or Toyota or any of the suppliers of any automobile \ncompany--General Motors with a Saturn plant in Tennessee--when they \nwant to look at our State for expansion--they are not limited by our \ninability to meet clean air standards.\n  We also have jobs that come from another direction. In Tennessee, \ntourism is big business. Many people know about Yellowstone in the \nWest, but the Great Smoky Mountains have three times as many visitors \nas any Western park, nearly 10 million visitors a year, and they come \nto see the Great Smokies, not to see smog, not to see soot. They want \nto enjoy it.\n  When I go into Sevierville, Dolly Parton's hometown, and ask the \nChamber of Commerce right there next to Maryville where I grew up, what \nis your No. 1 issue, these conservative Republicans in Sevier County \nsay to me: Clean air. That is what the Chamber of Commerce there says, \nclean air. So we Tennesseans think clean air is important for our \nhealth, because we love to look at our mountains and because of our \njobs.\n  I am the chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority Congressional \nCaucus. I sit on the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee. I \nam especially delighted that Senator Lieberman, who is the cosponsor of \nthis legislation, not only is on that committee, but he chairs one of \nthe major subcommittees on the Environment and Public Works Committee \nthat has to do with global warming.\n  What we are hoping is that this legislation, which I am about to \ndescribe, along with legislation Senator Carper of Delaware is \nintroducing today or tomorrow, will help move along the debate about \nhow we deal with global warming in our country.\n  In the legislation I have presented, the Alexander-Lieberman \nlegislation, we seek to preserve our jobs while we clean the air and \npreserve the planet. We have a number of concerns in our country, and \nglobal warming is only one of those. So I would argue that the \nprovisions we have set out are aggressive, but they are practical and \nthey are achievable. They set schedules for powerplants to reduce \nemissions for sulfur dioxide, for nitrogen oxide, for mercury, and for \ncarbon dioxide. Doing so will relieve some of the worst air-related \nhealth environmental problems such as ozone, acid rain, mercury \ncontamination, and global warming.\n  I think it is important to note that one of the differences with this \nAlexander-Lieberman bill is it proposes carbon caps only on powerplants \nthat produce electricity; it does not propose carbon caps on the \neconomy as a whole.\n  Now, why would we only do that? Well, here are the reasons for that: \nNo. 1, when we talk about global warming and carbon, we are dealing \nwith a huge, complex economy. This country of ours produces and uses \nabout 25 percent of all of the energy in the world. We have businesses \nthat range from the shoe shop to Google to chemical plants.\n\n[[Page S4760]]\n\n  I think we have to be very careful in Washington about coming up with \ngreat schemes and great ideas that sound good here but that might not \napply to everyone across the country, because everyone across the \ncountry has a natural conservatism about the wisdom of those who are in \nWashington. We could scare them to death with some talk of an \neconomywide global warming bill. So I am more comfortable thinking \nsector by sector. I want our steps to be practical and cost effective.\n  I do believe a market-based cap and trade system for powerplants \nmakes a lot of sense. Powerplants are the logical place to start with \ncarbon regulation. Powerplants produce about 40 percent of all the \ncarbon in our economy. Powerplants are increasing emissions of carbon \nat a rate faster than any other large segment in our economy. We have \nselected in our legislation what we call a market-based cap and trade \nsystem to regulate the amount of carbon that is produced. This is not a \nnew idea. The market-based cap and trade system was actually introduced \nby a Republican administration in which I served in the Cabinet, the \nfirst George Bush. It was a part of the Clean Air Act amendments in \n1990. It was introduced because we were concerned about the amount of \nsulfur coming out of powerplants. Basically it created a lot of \nflexibility for those powerplants. It used a market system. We have now \nhad 15 years experience with it. It has worked very well. It has \nsignificantly reduced the amount of sulfur in the air. It has done it \nin a way that most everyone concedes is the lowest possible cost of \nregulation.\n  It is a minimal amount of rules from here, a maximum amount of market \ndecisions and individual decisions by individual utilities. So we have \nhad that system in effect since 1990. There has been a similar system \nin effect for nitrogen. There has been a similar cap and trade system \nin Europe. We have a lot of experience with cap and trade. So we have \nelected to use a similar cap and trade market-based system to regulate \nthe carbon coming out of the same smokestacks that sulfur, nitrogen, \nand mercury come out of. We can already measure the amount of carbon \ncoming out, so we do not have to guess about that. We do not have to \ninvent a new system.\n\n  We do have to be careful about what the standards are, what the dates \nare. We want to know what the costs will be to the ratepayers. We want \nto keep electric rates as low as we possibly can, as well as making the \nenergy clean.\n  But if we are concerned about global warming in this generation, \nbecause I think we should be, then powerplants are a good place to \nstart. It is time to finish the job of cleaning the air of sulfur, of \ntoo much sulfur, too much nitrogen, and too much mercury. It is time to \ntake the right first step with controlling carbon emissions. It is time \nto acknowledge that climate change is real, that human activity is a \nbig part of the problem, and that it is up to us to act.\n  Now not only am I glad to be working with Senator Lieberman, who will \nbe the lead cosponsor of this legislation, he, of course, is already a \nleader in this area and he has an economywide piece of legislation \nwhich he introduced. Senator McCain in the last session--I am not about \nto try to speak for another Senator, but I think Senator Lieberman is \ntaking the position he would like to see several good trains moving \ndown the track toward the same station in hopes that one of them \neventually gets there, and that we can learn from each other.\n  That is the attitude I take with the legislation Senator Carper has \ndescribed today and that he is introducing today or tomorrow. Senator \nCarper and I have worked together through two Congresses on four \npollutant legislation. A lot has happened since we started working. For \nexample, the Administration, to its credit, through the Environmental \nProtection Agency, has stiffened requirements for sulfur and nitrogen. \nI applaud President Bush for that. They are very good requirements. \nThey have also proposed the regulation of mercury for the first time in \nour country's history. I applaud the EPA for that. So a lot has changed \nsince Senator Carper and I first started.\n  Also we have learned a lot. Senators who do not always have their \nmouths open learn a lot. We have discovered one of the most difficult \nareas in fashioning a market-based cap and trade system for sulfur or \nfor nitrogen or for carbon is who pays for it. We called that the \nallocation system.\n  Senator Carper and I started out with what we called an output \nsystem. We thought that sounded pretty good. It would be based upon the \namount of electricity you would be putting out. But the more we studied \nit, he came to a different conclusion and I came to a different \nconclusion. I came to the conclusion that we should use historical \nemissions. In other words, we are saying to a utility in the United \nStates: We are about to impose upon you some requirements for cleaning \nup more sulfur, cleaning up more nitrogen, cleaning up mercury--for the \nfirst time--and regulating the emissions of carbon for the first time, \nand I understand that is a significant cost.\n  That capital cost will have to be borne in the end by ratepayers. So, \nin my view, it seems to me that the fairest way to impose that cost \nwould be through what we call the historical allocation system. That is \nthe way we have done it with allowances for sulfur and nitrogen for the \nlast 15 years.\n  In fact, the input or the historical allowance system as the way to \npay the bill has been the way it is done almost everywhere, I believe.\n  But there is another way to allocate that is called the output. \nSenator Carper selected that. There is still a third way to allocate \nthe costs of doing whatever regulation we do, and that is called the \nauction. A market-based cap and trade system sounds complicated, but it \nis not so complicated. It basically says to each emitter of one of the \npollutants: You have an allowance to emit one ton of that sulfur or of \nthat carbon, and as long as you emit that much, you are okay. If you \nemit more than that, you are going to have to buy allowances to emit \nthat much more from someone else. So it costs you more. Or if you emit \nless, you can sell your allowance. Then as the law goes along over the \nyears, 2009 or 2010 to 2015, the amount of pollutants that come down, \nyour allowance total drops down as well.\n  One of the favored proposals mostly--and especially by many \nenvironmental groups--is an auction of those allowances. Well, I have \nresisted. I have been careful about the auctions. I have been to a lot \nof auctions. I know they must have them in Minnesota as well as \nTennessee. I have yet to see one where the purpose of the auction was \nnot to get the highest possible price.\n  Well, if I am paying my electric bill down in Memphis, or if I am at \nEastman Chemical in east Tennessee or ALCOA trying to keep my electric \ncosts in line, I am not interested in my Senator coming to Washington \nand having an auction to raise my electric rates to the highest \npossible price.\n  So also there is the temptation that if you auction off these \nallowances, and there are a lot of them when we are talking about \ncarbon allowances, many more than when we are talking about sulfur \nallowances over the last 15 years. They will bring in a lot of money. \nAnd whenever you bring in a lot of money, and 100 different Senators \nand lots of Congressmen know there is a pot of money, they will come up \nwith a lot of ways to spend that money. And where will that money come \nfrom? Well, it has got to come from the man or women or family paying \nthe electric bill in Nashville, or Knoxville. So I have been \nconservative about the use of auctions.\n  Senator Lieberman and I, in this bill, say 75 percent of the \nallowance comes from historical emissions and 25 percent are sold in an \nauction. This gets way down in the weeds, as we say. But one of the \nthings that I think may be beneficial from Senator Carper going ahead \nwith his bill, which relies on an output system that becomes a 100-\npercent auction, and way we go ahead in the Alexander-Lieberman bill \nwith 75-percent input and 25-percent auction, may be that our \ncolleagues will do as we have been doing over the last few months, and \nspend a little more time understanding allowances and auctions, and we \ncan come to a better conclusion about this.\n  I value greatly my relationship with Senator Carper and respect his \nleadership in this area. He chairs one of the principal subcommittees \non the Environment Committee upon which I serve\n\n[[Page S4761]]\n\nand the Presiding Officer serves. What I hope is he and I are moving \ninto a new stage of our working relationship on clean air and climate \nchange, and the result of that will be that all of our ideas will be \nout in front of our colleagues and that it will move the debate along.\n  I would emphasize, we agree, he and I, on a lot more than we disagree \non. In fact, I believe on all of the standards and deadlines for \nmeeting those standards for nitrogen, sulfur, and mercury, we agree. We \nagree there should not be a cap and trade system for mercury because \nmercury is a neurotoxin, and down in east Tennessee where I live, we do \nnot want TVA buying a lot of allowances so they can emit a lot more \nmercury, because it doesn't go up in the air and blow into North \nCarolina, it goes up in the air and comes right down on top of us, for \nthe most part. We don't want that.\n  We don't want that. The more we learn about mercury, the less we want \nit. We don't have cap and trade for mercury, although we do suggest \nthat for carbon.\n  Climate change has become the issue of the moment. Everybody is \ntalking about it. There are movies about it. The Vice President was \nhere testifying about it. It is not the only issue that faces us that \nhas to do with air pollution. I am more concerned in Tennessee about \nsulfur, nitrogen, and mercury than I am about carbon. That is why this \nis a four-pollutant bill. We ought to address all of these at once.\n  I was in this body 40 years ago as a staff assistant working for \nHoward Baker. I remember very well when Senator Baker, a Republican, \nand Senator Muskie of Maine, a Democrat, worked together on the \ncommittee on which the Presiding Officer and I now serve. They passed \nthe first Clean Water Act and the first Clean Air Act. The Clean Water \nAct, some people have said, is the most important piece of urban \nrenewal legislation ever enacted because the rivers of America had \ngotten so dirty, nobody wanted to live on them. The rivers of America \nare where most of our great cities are. As soon as they were cleaned \nup, people moved back to the cities and around the rivers. That was \n1970 and 1971.\n  It is appropriate to think about that now because Earth Day is coming \nup this weekend. I can remember Earth Day, which began in 1970. \nSuddenly the environment, which had been an issue that was reserved for \nonly a few people, became a national craze. It was almost like a hula \nhoop. Everybody was interested in the environment and recycling. Former \nSenator Gaylord Nelson was a leader in creating Earth Day. I can \nremember sitting in a meeting of President Nixon and the Republican \nleadership in 1970 when I was on the White House staff, and President \nNixon was trying to explain to the Republican leaders the importance of \nenvironmental issues. It was 8 o'clock in the morning, and they weren't \nlistening very well. It was a new subject. But Gaylord Nelson was doing \nit. The kids were doing it. People were recycling. The Republican \nPresident was talking to the Republican leadership, and Senator Baker, \nSenator Muskie, and the Congress passed the first Clean Air and Clean \nWater Acts.\n  Many of us who have lived a while can remember things are better \ntoday in many ways. When I was a student at Vanderbilt in Nashville, it \nwas so smoggy in the mornings, you couldn't see downtown. Your clothes \ngot dirty during the day. Things got gradually better. In 1990, when \nthe first President Bush was in office, we passed important Clean Air \nAct amendments, and the first cap and trade system for sulfur began. \nWhat also happened was that we learned more about how damaging these \npollutants are to our health.\n  As a result, the standards which we once thought were high seemed \nlow. Knoxville, the biggest city near where I grew up, near the Smoky \nMountains, is the 14th most polluted city for ozone. Ozone irritates \nlung tissue, increases the risk of dying prematurely, increases the \nswelling of lung tissue. It increases the risk of being hospitalized \nwith worsened lung diseases and triggering asthma attacks. At risk in \nKnoxville County alone are 176,000 children, 112,000 seniors, 15,000 \nchildren with asthma, and 50,000 adults with asthma. Ozone is not \nemitted directly from tailpipes and smokestacks. The raw ingredients \ncome from coal-fired powerplants and cars.\n  Sulfur is in many ways our biggest problem. It is the primary \ncontributor to haze. It causes difficulty in breathing. It causes \ndamage to lung tissue and respiratory disease and premature death.\n  We know that mercury is also a problem. Monitoring by the National \nPark Service in the Great Smoky Mountains has found high levels of \nmercury deposits from air pollution. Mercury pollution of rivers and \nstreams contaminates the fish we eat and poses a serious threat to \nchildren and pregnant women.\n  This bill is a clean air and a climate change bill. I hope our \ncommittee, as we take advantage of this resurgence of interest in the \nquality of air and our health and what we need to do about it, we won't \njust do part of the job. I would like to look at the whole picture. \nWhat we do in this bill is take the standards that the EPA has created \nfor nitrogen and sulfur and put them into law. We make them a little \nstricter, but basically we put them into law. We take the mercury rule \nof the EPA, and we put it into law. We make it even stricter. The EPA \nsays get rid of 70 percent of it. We say get rid of 90 percent. Then \nfor the first time we put into law carbon caps on electric powerplants \nwhich produce 40 percent of all the carbon produced in the United \nStates and are the fastest growing sector producing carbon in America.\n  I hope my colleagues will carefully consider this sector-by-sector \napproach to climate change. Carbon caps might be the best way--I \nbelieve they are--for dealing with electric powerplants. When it comes \nto fuel, there may be another strategy that makes sense. We could deal \nwith that sector in a different way. For example, when we were dealing \nwith sulfur, we didn't put a cap and trade on diesel fuel. We did on \npowerplants. But when we got to diesel fuel, we just said that you have \nto have ultra low sulfur diesel for big trucks, which just now went \ninto effect.\n  There is also the large segment of building energy use. If we took \nthe sector of building energy use, the fuel segment, and the electric \npowerplants, if we added that to a few stationery sources in America \nand developed strategies that were aggressive but practical and cost-\neffective for each of those segments, we would be up in the 85 to 90 \npercent of all the carbon we produce in America. That makes a lot more \nsense to me than trying to devise some one-size-fits-all system that \naffects every little shop, store, or farm in America. If we can get \nmost of it this way, maybe we can learn something so that someday we \ncan get the rest of it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks a section-by-section description of the \nAlexander-Lieberman bill, a one-page summary of the Alexander-Lieberman \nClean Air/Climate Change Act of 2007, as well as a short memorandum \nwhich we describe as discussion points and with which I will conclude \nmy remarks by going over in just a moment, and a letter from the \nNational Parks Conservation Association endorsing the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 1 through 4.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Senator Lieberman and I don't have all the answers \nwith this legislation. I feel much more comfortable with this \nlegislation today than I did with any I helped introduce last year or \nthe year before because I have learned a lot more. But I will guarantee \nmy colleagues that there are several areas in which I would welcome \nadvice. Over the last several weeks, I have met with a dozen, two dozen \nenvironmental groups, utilities, Tennessee citizens, others who had \nsuggestions. For example, the discussion points that I have put into \nthe record contain five points that are arguable. I have come to a \ntentative conclusion on them. That is in the bill. But there is another \nside to the point. I am looking for advice.\n  For example, should we cap only carbon or all greenhouse gases \nemitted from electricity plants? I chose to cap CO2 only. \nThat is because this is a four-pollutant bill--sulfur, nitrogen, \nmercury, and carbon. It is not primarily a climate change bill.\n  Another consideration is that it seems Europe's experience is that it \nmay be better to cap just carbon and\n\n[[Page S4762]]\n\nnot all greenhouse gases. That is a question we can debate.\n  What should the size of an auction be in terms of the allowances? I \ndiscussed that earlier. Senator Lieberman and I have chosen 25 percent \nof the total number of allowances. Senator Carper, in his bill, \neventually goes to 100 percent. There are arguments on both sides.\n  What influenced my decision was, I wanted to keep the costs down as \nmuch as possible. I was afraid that if we used some different kind of \nallowance allocation, we might literally take money away from the \nemitters that they ought to be using to put scrubbers on to reduce \nsulfur, nitrogen, mercury, or carbon and pay it to other utilities.\n  What rules should govern the use of offset allowances by electric \nplants? Offsets are an ingenious idea. The idea would be that an \nemitter of carbon might be able to pay somebody else to reduce their \noutput of carbon and, therefore, we would end up with the same amount \nof carbon. There are many advantages to that. For example, the \nTennessee Valley Authority might pay a Tennessee farmer to manage his \nlivestock crop in a way as to not produce as much methane, might pay a \nTennessee farmer to plant a lot of trees. Both of those things would \nreduce greenhouse gases, and the farmer would have more money in his \npocket. That is a good idea.\n  The downside of offsets is that if they are unregulated entirely, it \nseems to me they could become a gimmick or a fad or worse. What we have \ndone in this bill is adopt a system of offsets from a consortium of \nStates ranging from Maryland to Maine--that includes Senator \nLieberman's State of Connecticut--and used those model rules on \noffsets. That tends to limit the way offsets may be used. It is a good \nplace to at least begin. In other words, a utility might produce more \ncarbon, but it might pay someone else who is reducing carbon by using \nbiomass or by sequestering carbon in some other way.\n  There is a question about how should new coal-fired electric plants \nbe treated. There are probably 160 new coal plants on the drawing \nboards. Some of them hope to escape the rules Congress is considering \nabout capping the output of carbon. I don't think they should. This \nbill would apply to all coal-fired powerplants, including those on the \ndrawing boards. It also would give an incentive to the first 30 of \nthose plants to meet a high standard of clean coal technology. We don't \nwant to encourage the use of natural gas in this bill. That is the last \nthing we want to do. We don't want to discourage the use of coal. We \nhave a lot of coal. It would help make us energy independent. We want \nto encourage the creation of the kind of technology that will permit us \nto use coal in a clean way that either recaptures the carbon and stores \nit or finds some other way to deal with it.\n  Finally, what should the CO2 cap levels be? We can debate \nthat, and I am sure we will. But the cap level we pick in this \nlegislation is to say, let's freeze at the level of last year, starting \nwith 2011, and go down step by step into 2025 to 1.5 billion metric \ntons. This is our contribution to the debate.\n  We have learned enough about our health, about our ability to attract \njobs, to know we need to finish the job of cleaning up the air of \nnitrogen, of sulfur, and of mercury; and we need to take the right \nfirst step to begin to control the emission of carbon to deal with \nglobal warming. I believe the right first step is a market-based cap \nand trade system of electricity plants which is described here.\n  May I also say this: Some people say: Well, let's wait until China \ndoes it. Let's wait until India does it. The great danger is that we \nwill not unleash the technological genius of the United States of \nAmerica to clean our air and to deal efficiently and inexpensively with \nthe emissions of carbon. If we do not figure that out, India and China \nare going to build so many dirty coal powerplants that it will not make \nany difference what we do because the wind will blow the dirty air \naround here, and we will suffer and the planet will suffer whatever the \nconsequences are of global warming and of the other pollutants that \ncome from coal.\n  So we have an obligation not just to the world to do this, we have to \ndo this for ourselves because 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 new coal-fired \npowerplants in India and China will obliterate any of the good work we \nmight do here. I believe if we take the aggressive but practical cost-\neffective steps in this Clean Air/Climate Change Act, we will unleash \nthe great entrepreneurial spirit of our country. We will be able to \ncreate an inexpensive way to deal with carbon on a segment-by-segment \nbasis, deal with the other pollutants, and India and China will have to \nfollow. The rest of the world will follow, and we will be better off.\n  I cannot imagine more interesting and exciting work to be doing. This \nis the kind of subject on which we should be working together on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman for joining me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation. I salute Senator Carper for his continued leadership. I \nlook forward to working with him.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Clean Air/Climate Change Act of 2007, Section by Section Description, \n                             April 19, 2007\n\n\n                      TITLE I: GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n     Sec. 101. New Source Performance Standard\n       Requires all new coal-fired electricity plants constructed \n     or modified after January 1, 2015, to meet a performance \n     standard of 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) \n     per megawatthour of electricity generated (MWh).\n       Between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2020, 5 percent of \n     the total CO2 allowances will be set aside for new \n     coal-fired power plants built after enactment that meet this \n     performance standard.\n     Sec. 102. New Source Review Program\n       Beginning January 1, 2020, electricity plants that have \n     been operating for 40 years or more have to meet a \n     performance standard of 2 pounds of sulfur dioxide per MWh \n     and 1 pound of nitrogen oxides per MWh.\n     Sec. 103. Integrated Air Quality Planning for the Electric \n         Generating Sector\n       Cuts sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions in two \n     phases:\n       Phase One--codifies Phase One of the Clean Air Interstate \n     Rule (CAIR).\n       Phase Two--in 2015, replaces CAIR with a national program, \n     reducing the current SO2 cap of 9.4 million tons \n     to 2.0 million tons per year and establishing eastern and \n     western NOx caps totaling 1.6 million tons per year.\n       Requires mercury emissions to be cut by 90 percent in 2015 \n     without trading.\n       Establishes a Climate Champions Program that authorizes EPA \n     to recognize electricity plants that meet a 1,100 pound of \n     CO2 per MWh.\n       Reduces carbon dioxide emissions as follows:\n       2011-2014 2.3 billion metric tons of CO2\n       2015-2019 2.1 billion metric tons\n       2020-2024 1.8 billion metric tons\n       2025 and thereafter 1.5 billion metric tons\n       Authorizes an auction of 25 percent of the CO2 \n     allowances to be used to mitigate increased electricity \n     costs, if any, of consumers and energy-intensive industries.\n     Sec. 104. Revisions to Sulfur Dioxide Allowance Program\n       Updates the allowance allocation formulas of the Title IV \n     SO2 program to meet the 2015 cap of 2.0 million \n     tons per year and to include allowances for electricity \n     plants built from 1990 to 2006.\n     Sec. 105. Air Quality Forecasts and Warnings\n       Requires the Administrator of the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in cooperation with the \n     EPA Administrator, to issue air quality forecasts and \n     warnings.\n     Sec. 106. Relationship to Other Law\n       Requires the EPA Administrator within 2 years to promulgate \n     regulations for the underground injection of CO2 \n     in a manner that protects human health and the environment.\n\n\n                    TITLE II: GREENHOUSE GAS OFFSETS\n\n     Sec. 201. Greenhouse Gas Offsets\n       Establishes standards for offset allowances in six \n     categories: landfill methane capture and destruction; sulfur \n     hexafluoride reductions; sequestration of carbon due to \n     afforestation or reforestation; reduction and avoidance of \n     carbon dioxide emissions from natural gas, oil, and propane \n     end-use combustion due to end-use energy efficiency; avoided \n     methane emissions from agricultural manure management \n     operations; and eligible biomass.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n        Alexander-Lieberman Clean Air/Climate Change Act of 2007\n\n                       Why legislation is needed\n\n       To improve public health and reduce the threat of global \n     warming, Congress must enact electricity sector legislation \n     that puts stricter standards on sulfur and nitrogen \n     pollution, cuts mercury emissions by 90 percent, and places \n     the first caps on carbon emissions.\n       The Environmental Protection Agency's new rules to limit \n     sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury don't go far enough, fast \n     enough.\n       Under current law, too many communities live with air that \n     is unhealthy to breathe, and mercury continues to pollute our \n     rivers and streams.\n       The Clean Air/Climate Change Act sets aggressive, but \n     practical and achievable limits\n\n[[Page S4763]]\n\n     for reducing four pollutants in order to preserve our jobs \n     while we clean the air and preserve our planet.\n\n             Why the bill focuses on the electricity sector\n\n       Electricity plants are the logical place to start because:\n       They produce 40% of the CO2 in our country, at a \n     rate almost twice as fast as any other large segment of the \n     economy.\n       We have 15 years' experience with a market-based cap and \n     trade program to reduce sulfur emissions.\n\n                 How Clean Air/Climate Change Act works\n\n       The Clean Air/Climate Change Act of 2007 provides an \n     aggressive--yet achievable--schedule for power plants to \n     reduce emissions and alleviate some of our worst air-related \n     health and environmental problems, such as ozone, acid rain, \n     mercury contamination, and global warming.\n       Specifically, the Clean Air/Climate Change Act would:\n       Cut sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by 82 percent \n     by 2015. This acid rain-causing pollution would be cut from \n     today's 11 million tons to a cap of 2 million tons in 2015.\n       Cut emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 68 \n     percent by 2015. Ozone pollution would be cut from today's 5 \n     million tons to a cap of 1.6 million tons in 2015.\n       Cut mercury emissions at each power plant by 90 percent in \n     2015. This is a stringent, yet achievable goal that would \n     greatly reduce the risks this neurotoxin poses to children \n     and pregnant women.\n       Implement a cap, trade, and offsets program to reduce \n     CO2 emissions. CO2 emissions would be \n     capped at 2.3 billion metric tons in 2011, 2.1 billion metric \n     tons in 2015, 1.8 billion metric tons in 2020, and 1.5 \n     billion metric tons in 2025 and beyond.\n\n                          Innovative features\n\n       In order to encourage prompt, deep yet cost-effective \n     CO2 reductions, the Clean Air/Climate Change Act \n     contains several innovative features, including:\n       Climate Champions Program. Establishes a reserve of 5% of \n     all CO2 allowances as an incentive for new coal-\n     fired electricity plants that meet a performance standard of \n     1,100 pounds of CO2 per megawatthour between 2011 \n     and 2020. (This performance standard is comparable to an IGCC \n     coal plant with 60% CO2 capture and storage.)\n       Minimizes costs. Auctions 25% of the CO2 \n     allowances and authorizes the proceeds to be used to mitigate \n     increased electricity costs (if any) to consumers and energy-\n     intensive industry.\n       Discourages fuel switching from coal to natural gas. The \n     use of natural gas to generate electricity can create \n     volatility in electricity prices for consumers.\n       Flexible compliance. Permits the use of offsets so that \n     companies may meet their carbon emissions reduction flexibly \n     and cost-effectively.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n        Clean Air/Climate Change Act of 2007, Discussion Points\n\n\n            Issues that Sen. Alexander would like to discuss\n\n       1. Should Congress cap only CO2 or all \n     greenhouse gases emitted from electricity plants?\n       2. What size should an auction be?\n       3. What rules should govern the use of offset allowances \n     electricity plants?\n       4. How should new coal-fired electricity plants be treated?\n       5. What should CO2 cap levels be?\n                                  ____\n\n     1. Should Congress cap only CO2 or all greenhouse \n         gases emitted from electricity plants\n       Clean Air/Climate Change Oct\n       Caps CO2 only.\n       Discussion\n       In his bill, Sen. Alexander chose to cap CO2 \n     only. In part, that decision is a result of the Clean Air/\n     Climate Change Act being a bill that limits the four major \n     pollutants emitted from electricity plants: sulfur dioxide, \n     nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. It is not \n     primarily a climate change bill.\n       Another consideration is the experience gained from Phase \n     One of the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme (EU \n     ETS), the largest cap and trade program in the world. The EU \n     ETS capped only CO2 in its first phase. Phase Two \n     of that program, which starts in 2008, will cap six \n     greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides, \n     perflourocarbons hydrofluorocarbons, and sulfur hexaflouride\n       The U.K. House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee in \n     its Fourth Report (dated March 27, 2005) recommended that \n     Phase Two not be expanded to include gases other than carbon \n     dioxide.\n       Instead, the House of Commons Committee recommended minimal \n     significant changes to the shape and scope of the trading \n     program.\n       The House of Commons Committee also recommended non-carbon \n     greenhouse gases be addressed through regulation and not \n     through trading.\n       What is the best approach?\n     2. What size should an auction be\n       Clean Air/Climate Change Act\n       Auctions 25 percent of CO2 allowances.\n       Uses the proceeds to offset increased electricity costs (if \n     any) of consumers and energy-intensive industries.\n       Discussion\n       The total value of the CO2 allowances will be \n     much higher than the total value of SO2 allowances \n     because there will be about 1,000 times more CO2 \n     allowances than SO2 allowances. Because \n     CO2 allowances will be so much more valuable, \n     economists recommend that there be an auction.\n       In its 2004 report, the National Commission on Energy \n     Policy (NCEP) recommended that 10 percent of allowances be \n     auctioned. However, in March 2007 NCEP changed its \n     recommendation on allocation. NCEP now recommends that 50 \n     percent of allowances be auctioned.\n       Similarly, a March 2007 NCEP paper states that businesses \n     and consumers at the end of the energy supply chain--not oil, \n     natural gas, and electric utilities--bear the largest share \n     of the costs of a greenhouse gas emissions cap-and-trade \n     program.\n       Auctioning 25 percent of the CO2 allowances for \n     the power sector would generate revenues sufficient to \n     protect consumers from higher electricity rates.\n       The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) model rule \n     recommends that 25 percent of CO2 allowances be \n     auctioned.\n     3. What rules should govern the use of offset allowances by \n         electricity plants?\n       Clean Air/Climate Change Act\n       Includes the RGGI model rules on offsets.\n       Offset types: landfill methane capture and destruction; \n     sulfur hexafluoride reductions; sequestration of carbon \n     through afforestation or reforestation; reduction and \n     avoidance of carbon dioxide emissions from natural gas, oil, \n     and propane end-use combustion due to end-use energy \n     efficiency; avoided methane emissions from agricultural \n     management operations; and eligible biomass.\n       Discussion\n       Allowing electricity plants to meet their CO2 \n     reductions through offsets provides compliance flexibility \n     that greatly reduces costs to consumers and industry.\n       Offsets must be real reductions, however, and not gimmicks.\n       RGGI's model rules on offsets were adopted in an extensive, \n     multi-state stakeholder process.\n       Sen. Alexander is seeking additional measures to include in \n     a four pollutant law that will prevent fuel switching to \n     natural gas, as the use of natural gas to generate \n     electricity can create volatility in electricity prices for \n     consumers.\n     4. How should new coal-fired electricity plants be treated\n       Clean Air/Climate Change Act\n       New fossil fuel electricity plants coming on line after \n     January 1, 2007 will be required to purchase 100 percent of \n     their required allowances.\n       Between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2020, 5 percent of \n     the total CO2 allowances will be set aside as an \n     incentive for new coal-fired power plants that meet a \n     performance standard of 1,100 pounds of CO2 per \n     megawatt hour.\n       In 2015, all new coal-fired electricity plants must meet \n     this performance standard.\n       Discussion\n       Electricity sector climate legislation should actively \n     discourage the construction of new conventional fossil fuel \n     power plant and encourage technologies that allow for the \n     capture and sequestration of CO2.\n       A performance standard of 1,100 pounds of CO2 \n     per MWh (the same standard used in California for electricity \n     purchases from out-of-state coal-fired power plants) will \n     ensure that new coal-fired power plants capture at least 60 \n     percent of their CO2.\n       Denying CO2 allowances to plants that fail to \n     meet this standard is a powerful disincentive to building \n     conventional coal plants that lack lack carbon capture \n     technology.\n       Otherwise, new conventional coal plants will lock in high \n     CO2 emissions for years.\n       Inclusion of natural gas-fired plants in this program is \n     important to avoid creating an incentive to shift more \n     generation to natural gas.\n     What should CO2 cap levels be\n       Clean Air/Climate Chance Act\n       The power sector CO2 cap should decline over \n     time on the following schedule: 2011-2014, 2.3 billion metric \n     tons; 2015-2019, 2.1 million metric tons; 2020-2024, 1.8 \n     billion metric tons; and 2025 and beyond; 1.5 billion metric \n     tons.\n       Discussion\n       This an aggressive yet achievable cap that starts with \n     limiting electricity sector CO2 to the level \n     emitted in 2006 and then declines in a step wise manner out \n     to 2025.\n       An electricity sector CO2 cap on 1.5 billion \n     metric tons is roughly equivalent to the electricity sector \n     cap in the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship and \n     Innovation Act.\n       Electricity plants emit 40 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide. \n     Emissions from this major sector source of carbon dioxide \n     need to be reduced now in order to preserve the option of \n     stabilizing atmospheric concentrations at 450 parts per \n     million, the level that scientists believe will most likely \n     prevent some of the worst global warming impacts being \n     projected.\n       Delaying emissions reductions will make the job more \n     challenging and expensive down the road.\n\n[[Page S4764]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                               Exhibit 4\n\n                                                    National Parks\n\n\n                                     Conservation Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 18, 2007.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: On behalf of the National Parks \n     Conservation Association, we strongly commend you for \n     introducing the Clean Air/Climate Change Act of 2007, a bill \n     designed to provide healthier air to millions of Americans, \n     help restore clear skies to our national parks, and take \n     important steps toward addressing global warming.\n       As I know you are well aware, coal-fired power plants are a \n     leading source of the pollutants that cause asthma attacks \n     and respiratory disease in humans, habitat damage and hazy \n     skies in our parks, and mercury-laden fish in our rivers and \n     lakes. They are also the main industrial source of the \n     pollution that causes global warming. Technologies are \n     readily available that can allow these plants to operate much \n     more cleanly. The Clean Air/Climate Change Act would employ \n     flexible market mechanisms and adequate lead-time so these \n     technologies can be affordably applied at these plants to \n     help restore air quality and diminish the causes of global \n     warming. Starting with the coal-fired power plants, which are \n     the worst offenders, before proceeding to address other \n     polluters makes strategic and economic sense.\n       Taken together, the provisions in the Clean Air/Climate \n     Change Act provide a comprehensive and balanced solution to \n     the problem of coal-fired power plant pollution. The National \n     Parks Conservation Association is pleased to support the \n     Clean Air/Climate Change Act of 2007. From all of us, thank \n     you for your strong leadership on this incredibly important \n     subject.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thomas C. Kiernan,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Feingold, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Reed, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Brown, Mrs. \n        Clinton, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1170. A bill to designate as wilderness certain Federal portions \nof the red rock canyons of the Colorado Plateau and the Basin and Range \nDeserts in the State of Utah for the benefit of present and future \ngenerations of people in the United States; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce America's Red \nRock Wilderness Act of 2007. This legislation continues our Nation's \ncommitment to preserve our natural heritage. Preservation of our \nNation's vital natural resources will be one of our most important \nlegacies.\n  America's Red Rock Wilderness Act will designate as wilderness some \nof our Nation's most remarkable, but currently unprotected public \nlands. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in Utah harbor some of the \nlargest and most remarkable roadless desert areas anywhere in the \nworld. Included in the 9.4 million acres I seek to protect are well \nknown landscapes, like the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, \nas well as lesser known areas just outside Zion National Park, \nCanyonlands National Park, and Arches National Park. Together this wild \nlandscape offers spectacular vistas of rare rock formations, canyons \nand desert lands, important archaeological sites, and habitat for rare \nplant and animal species.\n  I have visited many of the areas this Act would designate as \nwilderness. I can tell you that the natural beauty of these truly \nunique landscapes is a compelling reason for Congress to grant these \nlands wilderness protection. I have the honor of introducing \nlegislation first introduced by my friend and former colleague in the \nHouse of Representatives, Wayne Owens. As the representative for much \nof Utah's Red Rock country, Representative Owens pioneered the \nCongressional effort to protect Utah wilderness. He did this with broad \npublic support, which still exists not only in Utah, but in all corners \nof our Nation.\n  The wilderness designated in this bill was chosen based on more than \ntwenty years of meticulous research and surveying. Volunteers have \ntaken inventories of thousands of square miles of BLM land in Utah to \nhelp determine which lands should be protected. These volunteers \nprovided extensive documentation to ensure that these areas meet \nFederal wilderness criteria. The BLM also completed a reinventory of \napproximately six million acres of Federal land in the same area in \n1999. While only six million acres of the total 9.4 million acres were \ninventoried by the BLM, the results provide a convincing confirmation \nthat the areas designated for protection under this bill meet Federal \nwilderness criteria.\n  For more than 20 years, Utah conservationists have been working to \nadd the last great blocks of undeveloped BLM-administered land in Utah \nto the National Wilderness Preservation System. The lands proposed for \nprotection surround and connect eight of Utah's nine national park, \nmonument and recreation areas. These proposed BLM wilderness areas \neasily equal their neighboring national parklands in scenic beauty, \nopportunities for recreation, and ecological importance. Yet, unlike \nthe parks, most of these scenic treasures lack any form of long-term \nprotection.\n  Today, the BLM is in the process of making critical decisions about \nthe future stewardship and use of nearly six million acres of wild \nlands that my legislation would protect. The BLM will decide which \nareas should be preserved or developed and whether they will be left \nroadless or have roads cut through them. It also will determine if \nthese wild lands will be open to off-road vehicles or exploited for \nmineral mining and oil and gas exploration. Any policies put in place \nwill stand for 15 to 20 years, a timespan long enough to leave a \nlasting mark on this landscape.\n  Americans understand the need for wise and balanced stewardship of \nthese wild landscapes. Unfortunately, the Administration has proposed \nlittle or no serious protections for Utah's most majestic places. \nInstead, the BLM appears to lack a solid conservation ethic and \nroutinely favors development and consumptive uses of our wild public \nland. In just the last four years, the BLM has leased for oil and gas \ndevelopment over 125,000 acres of land that would have been designated \nfor wilderness in America's Red Rock Wilderness Act.\n  This legislation represents a realistic balance between our need to \nprotect our natural heritage and our demand for energy. While \nwilderness designation has been portrayed as a barrier to energy \nindependence, it is important to note that within the entire 9.4 \nmillion acres of America's Red Rock Wilderness Act the amount of \n``technically recoverable'' undiscovered natural gas and oil resources \namounts to less than four days of oil and four weeks of natural gas at \ncurrent consumption levels.\n  America's Red Rock Wilderness Act is a lasting gift to the American \npublic. By protecting this serene yet wild land we are giving future \ngenerations the opportunity to enjoy the same untrammeled landscape \nthat so many now cherish.\n  I'd like to thank my colleagues who are original cosponsors of this \nmeasure, many of whom have supported the bill since it was first \nintroduced. Original cosponsors are Senators Kerry, Feingold, Cantwell, \nMenendez, Cardin, Reed, Harkin, Kennedy, Bayh, Lieberman, Stabenow, \nSchumer, Lautenberg, Boxer, Whitehouse, Brown and Clinton. \nAdditionally, I would like to thank The Utah Wilderness Coalition, \nwhich includes The Wilderness Society and Sierra Club; The Southern \nUtah Wilderness Alliance; and all of the other national, regional and \nlocal, hard-working groups who, for years, have championed this \nlegislation.\n  Theodore Roosevelt once stated:\n  ``The Nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources as \nassets which it must turn over to the next generation increased and not \nimpaired in value.''\n  Enactment of this legislation will help us realize Roosevelt's \nvision. To protect these precious resources in Utah for future \ngenerations, I urge my colleagues to support America's Red Rock \nWilderness Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1170\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to again join with the \nSenior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, as an original cosponsor of \nlegislation, America's Red Rocks Wilderness Act of 2007, to designate \nareas of pristine Federal lands in Utah as wilderness.\n  I had an opportunity to travel twice to Utah. I viewed firsthand some \nof the lands that would be designated for wilderness under Senator \nDurbin's bill. I was able to view most of the proposed wilderness areas \nfrom the air, and was able to enhance my understanding through hikes \noutside of the Zion National Park on the Dry Creek Bench wilderness \nunit contained in this proposal and inside the Grand Staircase-\nEscalante National Monument to Upper Calf Creek Falls. I also viewed \nthe lands proposed for designation in this bill from a river trip down \nthe Colorado River, and in the San Rafael Swell with members of the \nEmery County government.\n  I support this legislation, for a few reasons, but most of all \nbecause I have personally seen what is at stake, and I know the \nmarvelous resources that Wisconsinites and all Americans own in the \nBureau of Land Management, BLM, lands of southern Utah.\n  Second, I support this legislation because I believe it sets the \nbroadest and boldest mark for the lands that should be protected in \nsouthern Utah. I believe that when the Senate considers wilderness \nlegislation it ought to know, as a benchmark, the full measure of those \nlands which are deserving of wilderness protection. This bill \nencompasses all the BLM lands of wilderness quality in Utah. \nUnfortunately, the Senate has not, as we do today, always had the \nbenefit of considering wilderness designations for all of the deserving \nlands in southern Utah. During the 104th Congress, I joined with\n\n[[Page S4769]]\n\nthe former Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Bradley, in opposing that \nCongress's omnibus parks legislation. It contained provisions, which \nwere eventually removed, that many in my home State of Wisconsin \nbelieved not only designated as wilderness too little of the Bureau of \nLand Management's holding in Utah deserving of such protection, but \nalso substantively changed the protections afforded designated lands \nunder the Wilderness Act of 1964.\n  The lands of southern Utah are very special to the people of \nWisconsin. In writing to me over the last few years, my constituents \nhave described these lands as places of solitude, special family \nmoments, and incredible beauty. In December 1997, Ron Raunikar of the \nCapital Times, a paper in Madison, WI, wrote:\n\n       Other remaining wilderness in the U.S. is at first \n     daunting, but then endearing and always a treasure for all \n     Americans. The sensually sculpted slickrock of the Colorado \n     Plateau and windswept crag lines of the Great Basin include \n     some of the last of our country's wilderness, which is not \n     fully protected. We must ask our elected officials to redress \n     this circumstance, by enacting legislation which would \n     protect those national lands within the boundaries of Utah. \n     This wilderness is a treasure we can lose only once or a \n     legacy we can be forever proud to bestow to our children.\n\n  I believe that the measure being introduced today will accomplish \nthat goal. The measure protects wild lands that really are not done \njustice by any description in words. In my trip I found widely varied \nand distinct terrain, remarkable American resources of red rock cliff \nwalls, desert, canyons and gorges which encompass the canyon country of \nthe Colorado Plateau, the Mojave Desert and portions of the Great \nBasin. The lands also include mountain ranges in western Utah, and \nstark areas like the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. These \nregions appeal to all types of American outdoor interests from hikers \nand sightseers to hunters.\n  Phil Haslanger of the Capital Times, answered an important question I \nam often asked when people want to know why a Senator from Wisconsin \nwould cosponsor legislation to protect lands in Utah. He wrote on \nSeptember 13, 1995 simply that ``These are not scenes that you could \nsee in Wisconsin. That's part of what makes them special.'' He \ncontinues, and adds what I think is an even more important reason to \nact to protect these lands than the landscape's uniqueness, ``the fight \nover wilderness lands in Utah is a test case of sorts. The anti-\nenvironmental factions in Congress are trying hard to remove \nrestrictions on development in some of the nation's most splendid \nareas.''\n  Wisconsinites are watching this test case closely. I believe that \nWisconsinites view the outcome of this fight to save Utah's lands as a \nsign of where the Nation is headed with respect to its stewardship of \nnatural resources. What Haslanger's Capital Times comments make clear \nis that while some in Congress may express concern about creating new \nwilderness in Utah, wilderness, as Wisconsinites know, is not created \nby legislation. Legislation to protect existing wilderness ensures that \nfuture generations may have an experience on public lands equal to that \nwhich is available today. The action of Congress to preserve wild lands \nby extending the protections of the Wilderness Act of 1964 will \npublicly codify that expectation and promise.\n  Finally, this legislation has earned my support, and deserves the \nsupport of others in this body, because all of the acres that will be \nprotected under this bill are already public lands held in trust by the \nFederal Government for the people of the United States. Thus, while \nthey are physically located in Utah, their preservation is important to \nthe citizens of Wisconsin as it is for other Americans.\n  I am eager to work with my colleague from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, to \nprotect these lands. I commend him for introducing this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 1171. A bill to amend the Colorado River Storage Project Act and \nPublic Law 87-483 to authorize the construction and rehabilitation of \nwater infrastructure in Northwestern New Mexico, to authorize the use \nof the reclamation fund to fund the Reclamation Water Settlements Fund, \nto authorize the conveyance of certain Reclamation land and \ninfrastructure, to authorize the Commissioner of Reclamation to provide \nfor the delivery of water, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

This bill is \ncritical for New Mexico's future. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to see that it gets enacted into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1171\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reduce hunger in the United States; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, President Eisenhower once stated, ``Every \ngun that is made, every warship that is launched, every rocket fired, \nsignifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not \nfed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in armaments is \nnot spending its money alone: it is spending the sweat of its laborers, \nthe genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.''\n  In as trying a time as we live in today, his statement cannot ring \nmore true. We are in the middle of a war with no seeming end in sight. \nWe have daily debates about the numbers in our budget. But President \nEisenhower was right. We are not spending our money alone.\n  In a Nation as rich as ours, we should be able to arrange our \npriorities to meet the needs of our country, but the unfortunate \nreality is that in the United States today, children go hungry. \nChildren count on school, not only for education but also for their \nmeals. Seniors are forced to make a choice between life-saving \nmedicines and groceries for their meals. Families are forced to make \nthe difficult choice between paying for food and paying for utilities \nor their rent or mortgage or even their medicine or medical care. This \nis the reality of our America.\n  As Senators, we often hear from families that tell us the difficulty \nin making ends meet. More and more working families are turning to food \nbanks, pantries and soup kitchens for emergency food assistance. When \nexamining the actual costs of housing, food, utilities and other \nnecessities, researchers have found that in most areas of the country, \nfamilies need about 200 percent of the poverty level to achieve \n``minimal economic self-sufficiency.'' Individuals and families are \nfaced with a cost of living that continues to rise and an increasing \ngap between what low-wage workers earn and what is required to meet \nbasic needs.\n  In my State of Illinois, over 158,000 Illinois households experienced \nhunger in 2005. If we include households that have had to struggle to \nput food on the table or have had to skip meals to make sure the food \nwould last through the week--that's 440,000 households in Illinois \nliving with food insecurity--9 percent of Illinois households. These \nare working families who need more to lead healthy, happy lives.\n  Fortunately, we have some programs in existence to offer hope. Since \nPresident Johnson started the war on poverty, we have documented that \nthe Federal nutrition programs work to reduce hunger. When people are \nable to use Food Stamps, there are enough groceries to last through the \nweek. When new moms are helped by WIC, they and their babies have \nenough milk and eggs and fruit. When senior citizens are near a \nCommodity Supplemental Food Program site, they can take home a box of \nfood to fill the pantry AND buy their prescription drugs. Our school \nchildren can fill their stomachs and then focus on learning--because of \nthe Federal school food program. In cases of emergency, like the\n\n[[Page S4778]]\n\ntragic occurrences of hurricanes, our Federal nutrition assistance \nprograms have been there to assist families in need. These Federal food \nprograms work, but more can be done.\n  Last Congress, I introduced the Hunger Free Communities Act with \nSenators Lincoln, Smith and Lugar. The bill creates new grant programs \nthat help communities make the most of the Federal nutrition programs \nand build on their successes.\n  First, the bill makes grant money available to local groups that are \nworking to eliminate hunger in their communities. Each day, soup \nkitchens serve meals, and food pantries give groceries, and volunteers \ncollect food, make sandwiches, and deliver food. Our bill creates an \nanti-hunger grant program--the first of its kind--that asks communities \nto assess hunger and hunger relief at the local level. Grant money is \navailable to help with that assessment or grant money can be used to \nhelp fill in the gaps that a local plan identifies.\n  Second, we create a funding stream that food banks and soup kitchens \ncan use to keep up their buildings and trucks and kitchen equipment. \nThe response of the food bank network to the crisis after hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita was remarkable. Tons of food was donated, transported \nand delivered by thousands of volunteers from all over the country. But \nwithin days, America's Second Harvest recognized the food banks needed \nfreezers, forklifts, delivery trucks and repairs to warehouses and \nequipment. My bill creates the only Federal funding stream specifically \nfor the capital needs of local hunger relief efforts. Helping these \norganizations is especially important for those organizations in \nunderserved areas and areas where rates of food insecurity, hunger, \npoverty, or unemployment are higher than the national average.\n  Late last Congress, the Hunger Free Communities Act was passed by the \nSenate. I had hoped that there might be time for the House to act on it \nbefore the Session ended, but we ran out of time. This was, however, a \nsmall victory. It was a small step toward progress--a step that both \nDemocrats and Republicans want to take for the health and well-being of \nour communities.\n  There are still too many parents in this country who skip meals \nbecause there is not enough money in the family food budget for them \nand their children to eat every night. There are still too many babies \nand toddlers in America who are not getting the nutrition their minds \nand bodies need to develop to their fullest potential. There are too \nmany seniors, and children, who go to bed hungry. In the richest Nation \nin the history of the world, that is unacceptable.\n  Progress against hunger is possible, even with a war abroad and \nbudget deficits at home. I am heartened by the 43 United States \nSenators who agreed with me and cosponsored the Hunger Free Communities \nAct last year. I am heartened by the support of the Illinois Coalition \non Hunger, Bread for the World and America's Second Harvest. Congress \nwill be reauthorizing many nutrition programs this year with the farm \nbill, and the Hunger Free Communities Act should be a part of that. I \nbelieve this bill can take a modest but meaningful step toward \neliminating hunger in this country. We tried to make that first step \nwhen the bill passed the Senate late last year. We can do it again and \nshould.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1172\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Natural Gas Act to modify a provision \nrelating to the siting, construction, expansion, and operation of \nliquefied natural gas terminals; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nrestore the authority of State and local governments to protect the \nenvironment and ensure public safety with respect to the siting of \nLiquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals within their States. This measure \nwould strike a provision in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 which gave \nthe Federal Regulatory Energy Commission (FERC) power to preempt State \nand local concerns in the siting, construction and operation of LNG \nfacilities.\n  In recent years, the LNG industry has proposed building dozens of new \nLNG terminals throughout the United States, as LNG's share of the \nnatural gas market continues to grow rapidly. Many of these terminals \nare being planned near populated areas or in environmentally sensitive \ncoastal areas. As a highly hazardous and combustible fuel source, LNG \nposes serious safety concerns to local communities from potential \naccidents, as well as terrorism risks. Richard Clarke, a former Bush \nAdministration Counter Terrorism official, noted that LNG terminals and \ntankers present ``especially attractive targets'' to terrorists. \nExperts have identified anumber of potentially catastrophic events that \ncould arise from an LNG release, including pool fires--an extremely \nintense fire that cannot be extinguished and can spread over \nconsiderable distance, flammable vapor clouds that may drift some \ndistance from the spill site, and flameless explosions. According to \nthe Congressional Research Service, there have been approximately 13 \nserious accidents at LNG plants around the world over the past six \ndecades, including three accidents which caused fatalities--two in \nAlgeria in 1977 and 2004 respectively, and another at Cove Point, MD; \nin 1979, which killed one worker and caused some $3 million in damages.\n  In the State of Maryland, which is already home to one of six \noperating LNG terminals in the United States, AES Sparrows Point LNG, \nLLC and Mid-Atlantic Express, LLC has proposed building a new terminal \nnear a densely-populated area of Baltimore. Our area Congressional \nDelegation, Governor O'Malley, Baltimore County Executive Jim Smith and \nother local officials and community leaders believe this project poses \nunacceptable public safety, economic and environmental risks and does \nnot serve the public interest. Yet, under current law, the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission now has exclusive authority to approve \nonshore LNG terminal siting applications. While the law requires FERC \nto consult with State and local governments regarding safety concerns, \nthey have no role in the final decision. Moreover, while the law \npermits states to conduct safety inspections of LNG terminals, they do \nnot have the authority to require any safety precautions or to take \nenforcement actions if they discover problems at a facility during a \nsafety inspection.\n  It is vital, in my opinion, that State and local authorities and the \npublic have a meaningful opportunity to participate in the decision-\nmaking process about the siting of these plants. These terminals have \nthe potential for tremendous impacts on the communities in which they \nwould be constructed and would operate. The measure I am introducing \ntoday seeks to restore that authority and give Governors the same veto \npowers for onshore LNG terminal proposals as they currently exercise \nfor offshore terminal proposals under the Deepwater Port Act. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 1175. A bill to end the use of child soldiers in hostilities \naround the world, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue of \nchildren's rights and human rights: the recruitment and use of child \nsoldiers.\n  Hundreds of thousands of children in the world today serve as child \nsoldiers, boys and girls alike.\n  They serve as combatants, porters, human mine detectors and sex \nslaves.\n  Their health and lives are endangered and their childhoods are \nsacrificed.\n  The bulk of these children are captured, recruited, or sold into \nservice with rebel groups such as the infamous Lord's Resistance Army \nin Uganda.\n  But some serve with uniformed armed forces or government-supported \nparamilitaries or militias.\n  Even more troubling, children have served as child soldiers for \ngovernments that receive U.S. military assistance.\n  Today, Senator Sam Brownback and I are introducing legislation \naddressing this issue.\n  Our bill, the Child Soldiers Prevention Act, will ensure that U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars are not used to support foreign militaries known to \nrecruit or use child soldiers in government armed forces or government-\nsupported militaries.\n  U.S. military assistance can continue under this bill, but it will be \nused to remedy the problem by helping countries successfully demobilize \ntheir child soldiers and professionalize their forces.\n  Under the terms of this bill, Foreign Military Assistance and other \ndefense-related aid would be limited if countries are clearly \nidentified in the State Department's Human Rights report as recruiting \nor using child soldiers.\n  Military assistance to these countries would be limited to supporting \nthe professionalization of their forces until they eliminate the use of \nchild soldiers.\n  If years of abuse continue, then U.S. assistance would eventually be \neliminated.\n  In all circumstances, the President would be able to waive these \nrules if he deems that it is in the national interest.\n  What do we mean by professionalization?\n  We mean creating regular militaries which conform to long-standing \ninternational norms, such as not using children, respecting human \nrights, and functioning as professional armies.\n  This bill can only affect governmental or government sanctioned \nmilitary and paramilitary organizations.\n  But that is where we have leverage through our foreign military \nassistance programs and we will use whatever leverage we have to \naddress this heinous phenomenon.\n  In the last year, many of us have read the haunting memoir of Ishmael \nBeah, A LONG WAY GONE: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier.\n  Beah is all of 26: that might seem too young to write a memoir, but \nsadly, his youth was stolen from him many years ago.\n  Beah grew up in war-torn Sierra Leone. He was born in 1980.\n  Eleven years later, civil war broke out, killing tens of thousands of \npeople and driving millions from their homes.\n  At the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels.\n  Beah's parents and his two brothers were among those killed.\n  By thirteen, he'd been picked up by the government army, but that was \nno refuge.\n  Fleeing the rebels who had killed so many of his friends and family, \nBeah wound up in a village run by government troops.\n  He wrote of this moment in his life, ``In the beginning it seemed we \nhad found safety the smiles on people's faces assured us that there was \nnothing to worry about anymore. All that darkened the mood of the \nvillage was the sight of orphaned children. There were over thirty boys \nbetween the ages of six and sixteen. I was one of them. Apart from \nthis, there were no indications that our childhood was threatened, much \nless that we would be robbed of it.''\n  That was exactly what was happening, though.\n  In Beah's first battle he watched his eleven-year old tent-mate bleed \nout before his very eyes.\n  He writes of this awful day, ``My face, my hands, my shirt and gun \nwere covered with blood. I raised the gun and pulled the trigger, and I \nkilled a man. Suddenly, as if someone was\n\n[[Page S4781]]\n\nshooting them inside my brain, all the massacres I had seen since the \nday I was touched by war began flashing in my head. Every time I \nstopped shooting to change magazines and saw my two young lifeless \nfriends, I angrily pointed my gun into the swamp and killed more \npeople.''\n  That was at 13. Thirteen--- an age for junior high soccer games, not \nfor going to war.\n  Ultimately during his time in the government army, Beah says he \nkilled ``too many people to count.''\n  In 1998 he fled and in 1999 he was able to come to New York.\n  Returning to civilization, according to Beah, was actually harder \nthan the act of becoming a child soldier because ``dehumanizing \nchildren is a relatively easy task.''\n  Thank God, Sierra Leone's civil war is over.\n  But too many children in the world continue to be forced to serve as \nchild soldiers.\n  Ensuring that countries professionalize their militaries and help \ntheir child soldiers make the transition back into civil society is a \nhumanitarian issue but also in the best interest for our own armed \nforces.\n  We do not want American soldiers in a position where they have to \nreturn fire on children.\n  Delay in such a moment could cost an American soldier his life, but \nthink also of the psychic costs of having to kill a child in battle.\n  We want our troops to avoid such a situation and we want to ensure \nthat American taxpayer dollars are used as they should be: for \nprofessionalizing the militaries of countries whom we are assisting.\n  It is not enough for child soldiers simply to be demobilized: U.S.-\nfunded programs assist in the rehabilitation of child soldiers and the \nreintegration of these young people back into civilian life.\n  Some of these child veterans of war have witnessed or been forced to \ndo terrible things.\n  Many of the girls have been victims of rape and may be coming back \ninto civilian life with their own children.\n  I strongly support programs to provide psychological services, \neducational and vocational training, and other assistance to these \ntraumatized young people.\n  I also support efforts to bring to justice those rebel leaders and \nothers who kidnap children for use as child soldiers.\n  The use of child soldiers represents a basic issue of human rights.\n  For that reason, next week Senator Coburn, who is the ranking member \non the Judiciary Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law, and I will \nbe holding a Subcommittee hearing on Child Soldiers and the Law.\n  In this hearing, we will explore the persistent use of child soldiers \ndespite the fact that this practice is widely acknowledged as a war \ncrime.\n  Is this persistent crime in part a failure of enforcement?\n  Are reforms needed in U.S. law to criminalize this terrible practice?\n  How is this issue addressed under our immigration laws?\n  Expert witnesses from non-governmental and faith-based organizations \nwill speak to these issues in our hearing next Tuesday.\n  So too will Ishmael Beah, whose words vividly capture the horror of \nchildren at war.\n  I am introducing this bill and our subcommittee is holding this \nhearing as progressive steps to remedy a terrible and persistent \nproblem.\n  Here in Washington, on the floor of the Senate, it is hard to imagine \nthe atrocities that children endure every day, as combatants, as sex \nslaves, and as forced labor for militaries and paramilitaries.\n  But those atrocities do continue.\n  At the least we should ensure that U.S. assistance goes to remedy the \nproblem and that it is never used to prolong it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1175\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Soldier Prevention Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the September 7, 2005, report to the \n     General Assembly of the United Nations by the Special \n     Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and \n     Armed Conflict, ``In the last decade, two million children \n     have been killed in situations of armed conflict, while six \n     million children have been permanently disabled or injured. \n     Over 250,000 children continue to be exploited as child \n     soldiers and tens of thousands of girls are being subjected \n     to rape and other forms of sexual violence.''.\n       (2) According to the Center for Emerging Threats and \n     Opportunities (CETO), Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, \n     ``The Child Soldier Phenomenon has become a post-Cold War \n     epidemic that has proliferated to every continent with the \n     exception of Antarctica and Australia.''.\n       (3) Many of the children currently serving in armed forces \n     or paramilitaries were forcibly conscripted through \n     kidnapping or coercion, a form of human trafficking, while \n     others joined military units due to economic necessity, to \n     avenge the loss of a family member, or for their own personal \n     safety.\n       (4) Some military and militia commanders force child \n     soldiers to commit gruesome acts of ritual killings or \n     torture, including acts of violence against other children.\n       (5) Many female child soldiers face the additional \n     psychological and physical horrors of rape and sexual abuse, \n     enslavement for sexual purposes by militia commanders, and \n     severe social stigma should they return home.\n       (6) Some military and militia commanders target children \n     for recruitment because of their psychological immaturity and \n     vulnerability to manipulation and indoctrination. Children \n     are often separated from their families in order to foster \n     dependence on military units and leaders. Consequently, many \n     of these children suffer from deep trauma and are in need of \n     psychological counseling and rehabilitation.\n       (7) Child soldiers are exposed to hazardous conditions and \n     are at risk of physical injury and disability, psychological \n     trauma, sexually transmitted diseases, respiratory and skin \n     infections, and often death.\n       (8) On May 25, 2000, the United Nations adopted and opened \n     for signature, ratification, and accession the Optional \n     Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the \n     Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (in this Act \n     referred to as the ``Optional Protocol''), which establishes \n     18 as the minimum age for conscription or forced recruitment \n     and requires states party to ensure that members of their \n     armed forces under the age of 18 do not take a direct part in \n     hostilities.\n       (9) On June 18, 2002, the Senate unanimously approved the \n     resolution advising and consenting to the ratification of the \n     Optional Protocol.\n       (10) On December 23, 2002, the United States presented the \n     ratified optional protocol to the United Nations.\n       (11) More than 110 governments worldwide have ratified the \n     optional protocol, establishing a clear international norm \n     concerning the use of children in combat.\n       (12) On December 2, 1999, the United States ratified \n     International Labour Convention 182, the Convention \n     concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the \n     Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, which \n     includes the use of child soldiers among the worst forms of \n     child labor.\n       (13) On October 7, 2005, the Senate gave its advice and \n     consent to the ratification of the Protocol to Prevent, \n     Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women \n     and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention \n     Against Transnational Organized Crime.\n       (14) It is in the national security interest of the United \n     States to reduce the chances that members of the United \n     States Armed Forces will be forced to encounter children in \n     combat situations.\n       (15) Section 502B(a)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (22 U.S.C. 2304(a)(3)) provides that ``the President is \n     directed to formulate and conduct international security \n     assistance programs of the United States in a manner which \n     will promote and advance human rights and avoid \n     identification of the United States, through such programs, \n     with governments which deny to their people internationally \n     recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, in \n     violation of international law or in contravention of the \n     policy of the United States as expressed in this section or \n     otherwise''.\n\n     SEC. 3. CHILD SOLDIER DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, consistent with the provisions of the Optional \n     Protocol, the term ``child soldier''--\n       (1) means--\n       (A) any person under age 18 who takes a direct part in \n     hostilities as a member of governmental armed forces;\n       (B) any person under age 18 who has been compulsorily \n     recruited into governmental armed forces;\n       (C) any person under age 16 voluntarily recruited into \n     governmental armed forces; and\n       (D) any person under age 18 recruited or used in \n     hostilities by armed forces distinct from the armed forces of \n     a state; and\n       (2) includes any person described in subparagraphs (B), \n     (C), and (D) of paragraph (1) who is serving in any capacity, \n     including in\n\n[[Page S4782]]\n\n     a support role such as a cook, porter, messenger, medic, \n     guard, or sex slave.\n\n     SEC. 4.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Based on the recommendations made by the \n     2007 Judicial Conference and the statistical data provided by \n     the 2006 Federal Court Management Statistics (issued by the \n     Administrative Office of the\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\n     United States Courts), the Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Federal courts along the southwest border of the United \n     States have a greater percentage of their criminal caseload \n     affected by immigration cases than other Federal courts.\n       (2) The percentage of criminal immigration cases in most \n     southwest border district courts totals more than 49 percent \n     of the total criminal caseloads of those districts.\n       (3) The current number of judges authorized for those \n     courts is inadequate to handle the current caseload.\n       (4) Such an increase in the caseload of criminal \n     immigration filings requires a corresponding increase in the \n     number of Federal judgeships.\n       (5) The 2007 Judicial Conference recommended the addition \n     of judgeships to meet this growing burden.\n       (6) The Congress should authorize the additional district \n     court judges necessary to carry out the 2007 recommendations \n     of the Judicial Conference for district courts in which the \n     criminal immigration filings represented more than 49 percent \n     of all criminal filings for the 12-month period ending \n     September 30, 2006.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to increase the \n     number of Federal judgeships, in accordance with the \n     recommendations of the 2007 Judicial Conference, in district \n     courts that have an extraordinarily high criminal immigration \n     caseload.\n\n     SEC. 603.

Madam President, we will return tomorrow in session to \ndiscuss the competitiveness bill now pending and to have debate only \nand then consider amendments, and we hope to vote on it early next \nweek.\n  As far as our meeting this week in the Senate, we are able to point \nto the passage of the court security bill, which is an important piece \nof legislation. Unfortunately, it is a bill that took 2 days, and it \nshould have taken 20 minutes. During the course of 2 days, we had a \ngeneral debate about budget deficits and a debate which started and \nended without a vote on splitting up the Ninth Circuit. It was time for \nsome Members to bring up issues of importance to them, but I would \nsuggest we have a limited amount to show for our activity this week \nbecause of activities on the other side of the aisle.\n  Twice we were stopped in efforts to call up important legislation. We \nwanted to have the reauthorization of the intelligence agencies in \nAmerica so that they are prepared to deal in the most effective way in \nfighting terrorism. Unfortunately, there was resistance from the \nRepublican side of the aisle, and we weren't able to do so. The bill \nhad to be pulled from debate on the floor and put back on the calendar \nfor another day. Then we wanted to move to the Medicare prescription \nPart D Program. Those of us on the Democratic side think it is \nimportant to have a debate as to whether Medicare can offer less \nexpensive, more affordable drugs to seniors and disabled people. The \npharmaceutical companies don't like this idea. The current system is \nvery profitable for them. They have mounted a very expensive campaign \nto stop any suggestion of changing Medicare prescription Part D. It \nwould have been a lively debate, an important debate, followed closely \nby many seniors and their families but, unfortunately, once again, the \nRepublican minority, within their rights, stopped us from moving to \nthat important debate.\n  So for two very substantive issues, we were stopped this week from \nthe kind of progress which I think people expect us to make. Even if we \ndisagree between the parties, there should be a spirit of cooperation \nhere, at least when it comes to honest debate in a reasonable period of \ntime and then an up-or-down vote and then move on, but we couldn't \nreach that point this week. Sadly, the only bill that passed was the \nCourt Security Act, as important as it is. It should have passed very \nquickly without controversy. It took us 2 days.\n  Now we have a very important bill before us, which I think is long \noverdue. I wish to thank Senator Alexander from Tennessee and Senator \nBingaman for being the lead sponsors on this bill. I hope the debate \ntomorrow will lead to some amendments the beginning of next week and \nthen to passage. America needs to maintain the competitive edge in so \nmany parts of our economy, particularly when it comes to manufacturing, \nand this bill could be very positive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/19/senate-section/article/S4788-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 761\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
