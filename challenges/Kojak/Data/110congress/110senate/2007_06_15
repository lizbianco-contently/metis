Mr. President, we will shortly resume consideration of the \nenergy legislation. There are no rollcall votes scheduled today. We \nhave heard from a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle of \ntheir desire to come and offer amendments. The managers of the bill \nhave indicated they are willing to set amendments aside to move on \nthat. I think that is appropriate.\n  There will also be no rollcall votes on Monday. This has been a long \nschedule, but it is, again, my hope that Members will take that \nopportunity to come offer and debate amendments on this energy \nlegislation.\n  Sometime next week--and I will meet and discuss this with the \ndistinguished Republican leader--if this debate doesn't speed up and \nmore amendments are not offered, then we will have to see if we can \nmove to end the debate and finish this legislation.\n  There are issues that are important. There has to be some decision, a \nfinality made with regard to the pieces of the bill that are so \nimportant, such as the renewable portfolio standard, the CAFE \nstandards, and there is also interest in coal-to-liquid and the \ndifferent ways that can be done.\n  As I understand it, those are the three big issues, so I would hope \nMembers who have those issues, whether amendments or whatever else they \nwant to focus their attention on, would do so. The American people want \nus to do something dealing with energy. This is a good bipartisan bill, \nand I would hope Members would understand this is their time to come \nand offer amendments.\n  I would also note, as indicated in the morning press, that Senator \nMcConnell and I met last evening with a bipartisan group of Senators \nregarding immigration, and we now have a pathway forward on that. When \nwe finish the energy legislation, we will move to that legislation. I \nthink we have now an agreed-upon number of amendments that will be \noffered by Republicans and Democrats and we should get to that sometime \nnext week.\n  We are going to finish that legislation and the energy legislation \nprior to our having our Fourth of July recess. I would also indicate to \nall Senators and staffs, it is Friday, and I know that a lot of times--\nI would not say a lot of times but on a number of occasions--I have \nindicated we might have to work weekends. I know this causes a lot of \nstress to folks. But everyone should know that to complete this bill \nand to complete the immigration bill will require next weekend, without \nany question, next weekend, Saturday and Sunday.\n  Now, of course, it is always possible that through unanimous consent \ncertain work that could be done in 1 day could be put over to another \nday, and I understand that. But Senators should understand this is the \nreal thing. If we are going to finish these two bills, which both the \nRepublican leader and I think is absolutely mandatory and essential, \nSenators should be advised that next Saturday and Sunday, which means \nthe preceding Friday, which is a week from today, and a week from \nMonday, we will be in session.\n  We only have 2 weeks left in this work period, and I hope we don't \nhave to run into the Fourth of July recess\n\n[[Page S7780]]\n\nperiod, which is only 1 week long. We have a number of things we are \ngoing to try to do this morning. We are going to get to a couple of \njudges. We hope to pass those. We have a number of other things we need \nto do. We have so many things we need to complete, but a lot of them \nare very complicated and difficult, such as the Energy bill and \nimmigration. At least we have a pathway forward on these, and I think \nwe can work them out.\n  It goes without saying that if we are able to complete these prior to \nthe Fourth of July recess, that would be fine. But if we can't, the \nFourth of July recess will take second fiddle to these important pieces \nof legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/15/senate-section/article/S7780-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, if we are serious about energy security \nand reducing our dependence on foreign oil and our consumption of \ngasoline, we have to, through our energy legislation, encourage a \nvariety of fuels and technologies. Current law requires 5.4 billion \ngallons of renewable fuel in 2008, and 7.5 billion gallons in 2012. The \nunderlying bill on the floor today increases the amount to 8.5 billion \ngallons in 2008 and 36 billion gallons by the year 2022.\n  The underlying bill focuses on renewable fuels, including ethanol \nfrom corn and cellulosic ethanol, and I think that is outstanding. I am \nso proud the State of Tennessee is going to be playing a very large \nrole in our country meeting those objectives.\n  The amendment I am offering expands the renewable fuel standard by \nadding a clean fuel definition so any fuel meeting criteria may be a \npart of the 36 billion gallon mandate. It does not in any way strike or \nreplace the underlying fuels that qualify.\n  To qualify as a clean fuel under this amendment, a fuel must meet the \nfollowing requirements: not be derived from crude oil, and achieve life \ncycle greenhouse gas emission reductions that are better than the life \ncycle greenhouse gas emissions of conventional gasoline.\n  In addition, on top of what I just said, it must meet one of the \nfollowing requirements: achieve a life cycle emission reduction \ncompared with conventional gasoline of two or more criteria pollutants. \nThose pollutants include sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon \nmonoxide, volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter with a \ndiameter smaller than 10 microns; and achieve a life cycle greenhouse \ngas emission reduction of 20 percent compared to conventional gasoline.\n  Under no circumstances per this amendment can a fuel qualify if its \ngreenhouse gas emissions are not less than conventional gasoline and if \nit is derived from crude oil. In other words, crude oil products do not \nqualify and the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions have to be less \nthan conventional gasoline.\n  In addition, a clean fuel may participate in the advanced biofuels \ncarve-out beginning in 2016 if it meets the follow requirements: not \nderived from crude oil, achieves a life cycle emission reduction \ncompared to conventional gasoline of two or more criteria pollutants \nincluding sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, volatile \norganic compounds, and particulate matter with a diameter smaller than \n10 microns and, the other hurdle, achieves life cycle greenhouse gas \nemission reductions of 20 percent compared to conventional gasoline.\n  We have a number of technologies that are being pursued today that \ncould meet the solutions our country needs to pursue. While I am a \ntremendous fan of much of what is happening right now with ethanol--\nagain the\n\n[[Page S7781]]\n\nState of Tennessee playing a big role--we need to allow the \nentrepreneurs in our country to help us solve this problem of \ndependence on oil from foreign sources, especially those that are not \nfriendly to our country. For that reason, ethanol should not be our \nonly solution. What we should try to do as a body is not to pick \nwinners and losers. What we should do is set standards and allow the \nmarket to meet those standards.\n  We have, again, tremendous initiatives going throughout our country. \nWhat we need to do in the Senate is not to define too narrowly what we \nwant to help us be less dependent on foreign oil. If we do that, we \nwill continue to consume more and more gasoline. My amendment is \nfocused on making sure we continue to pursue energy security, that we \nallow our gross domestic product to grow, and we harness that great \nentrepreneurialism that exists throughout our country; that we do \neverything we can to lower greenhouse gas emissions and other criteria \npollutants that also create tremendous damage to people throughout our \ncountry. I think this amendment does that.\n  I ask my fellow Senators to endorse this particular amendment.\n  I notice at this point, after offering this amendment, there is an \nabsence of a quorum, and I wish to set aside my amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to proceed for a \nfew moments in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     THE DEATH OF RUTH BELL GRAHAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to say a word about the \npassing yesterday of a great woman.\n  As a child, Ruth Bell dreamed of surrendering her life to missionary \nwork abroad. Then she gave up that dream so someone else could live it \nin her place. In this and in so many other quiet sacrifices, Ruth Bell \nGraham truly lived the life her husband preached.\n  She inspired generations of men and women with her honest, wise, and \nfaith-filled writings. And she inspired us again at the end by \naccepting with serenity the physical suffering of a long and painful \nillness.\n  Her autobiography told the story of an ordinary woman struggling to \nraise a family while her famous husband wandered the world preaching to \na thousand roaring crowds. But, as she said, ``I'd rather have a little \nbit of Bill than a lot of any other man.''\n  Looking back last night on more than 60 years of marriage, Billy \nGraham remembered his wife with a thankful heart. ``I am so grateful to \nthe Lord that he gave me Ruth,'' he said. As America says goodbye to \nthe First Lady of Evangelical Christianity, we make those words our \nown.\n  Like the Biblical heroine whose name she shared, Ruth Bell Graham \nfollowed her pilgrim's journey wherever it took her. As a mother, a \ncounselor, and the indispensable confidant of the world's most famous \npreacher, she was always content to stay in the background. Her \nmissionary field was her home. And in this, she was a powerful witness \nof the Gospel she loved.\n  We are grateful for her faithfulness. And we mourn with the Graham \nfamily--Billy, Franklin, Nelson, Virginia, Anne, and Ruth--at the loss \nof this good and faithful servant.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay the pending \namendment aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1520 To Amendment No. 1502\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I call up amendment No. 1520 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1520 to amendment No. 1502.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, so many of my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle have come to this floor to talk about the need for this \nNation to become energy independent. In fact, I think each Member of \nthis body believes this country should be energy independent and can \nbecome energy independent. We need to be independent for many reasons.\n  First and foremost is the issue of national security. We should not \nbe dependent for oil upon some country halfway around the world that \ndisagrees with our foreign policy, which affects what we can do \ninternationally. We should be independent for national security \nreasons.\n  We should also be energy independent for economic reasons. Yesterday \nin the Small Business Committee we held a hearing on the impact that \nincreased gasoline prices are having on small businesses in our \ncommunities. It is having an impact on our entire economy. Again, the \nOPEC countries decide what the price of oil will be and it affects \ngasoline prices, energy prices, and our economy. We need to become \nenergy independent for the economic security of America.\n  Yes, we need to become energy independent for environment issues. \nGlobal climate change is a real danger to this country and we need to \nhave an energy policy that will also make us friendlier toward our \nenvironment.\n  For all these reasons we need to become energy independent. We are \nnot today. We import from other countries over one-third of our energy \nneeds in this country and, of course, a significant amount of that is \noil. I believe we can become energy independent in 10 years. I think, \nif we have the national will and the energy policies, it can be \naccomplished.\n  The amendment I sent before this body today sets as our goal \nproducing 90 percent of our energy needs by the year 2017. Each of us \nhas ideas as to how to achieve energy independence. There have been \nmany good suggestions that have been brought forward by my colleagues. \nI have introduced legislation that would require the Federal Government \nto construct its buildings to LEED Silver standards. Buildings \nrepresent one-third of the energy use in this country. Mr. President, \n38 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions come from buildings. That, \nof course, is the major greenhouse gas. Federal buildings consume 40 \npercent of the Federal Government's energy bill, $3.73 billion in 2002. \nThe GSA is already using LEED standards in encouraging Federal \nconstruction, but all new Federal facilities should meet these new LEED \nSilver standards.\n  I ask my colleagues to go down the road here a couple of miles to the \nnew NOAA facility located in Suitland, MD, and see the type of \nconstruction we should be building that gives our Federal Government \nthe necessary facility to conduct its business but also is one that \nwill save us a considerable amount of energy.\n  LEED-certified buildings use 32 percent less energy, 26 percent less \nnatural gas, and 36 percent total less energy used. I mention that \nbecause that is just one way this Nation can move toward energy \nindependence.\n  We know we will be having a debate on the Senate floor next week on \nthe CAFE standards, on the efficiencies of our automobile and light \ntruck engines. Yes, efficiency can save us a lot of energy and can help \nmake us energy independent.\n  Let me mention another example, the automobile tires we use. If we \nused the right tires, we could save millions of barrels of gasoline \nevery year. Public transit, I can tell you in my own State, the Purple \nLine is not only needed to get people from one place to the other in \nthis region, it will save us considerable energy. Investment in public \ntransit will help with efficiency in this country. We need to develop \nalternative and renewable energy sources. There are so many potentials.\n  Solar power. We invented the ability to use solar power for energy. \nThe technologies have come from America. BP Solar, which is located in \nFredrick, MD, is a leading example of what we can do. But we do not use \nsolar energy anywhere near as much as we should in this country.\n  Wind is available, but we do not use that technology as much as we \nshould. Cellulosic ethanol or gasoline is another major potential \nsource for becoming energy independent.\n  Biodiesel. We have a person from the eastern shore, Berlin, MD, who \nhas a biodiesel plant. And that county, Worcester County, uses their \nfleet of diesel trucks and the biodiesel saving us energy. So \nalternatives and renewable sources can help us.\n  We also need to fund new technology for developing clean-burning coal \nand the next generation of nuclear power and the use of hydrogen power. \nI mention that because these are the discussions we are having on the \nfloor of this body, ways in which we can become energy independent by \nbeing more efficient in the use of energy, by developing alternative \nand renewable energy sources and putting our resources into research \nfor the next generation of technology to meet our energy needs.\n  So what does my amendment do? My amendment establishes a commission \nto monitor our program and to keep us on track to accomplish our goal, \nto be energy independent by 2017. It allows for midcourse adjustments \nby the commission, making recommendations on a 2-year cycle, so we can \nmake those cycles of adjustments. We keep control, the Congress keeps \ncontrol of the energy policies of the country. But we have a bipartisan \nway in which we can make sure we live up to our commitment to be energy \nindependent in 10 years.\n  If our constituents know we are going to accomplish this goal, they \nare going to be willing to do what is necessary so we achieve this \nenergy independence. It maintains the responsibility of this body and \nthe other body across the hall. It is our Apollo commitment. I have \nheard more Senators use that term, ``Apollo commitment.'' It is our \nApollo commitment.\n  It took us 10 years. We made that commitment to put a person on the \nMoon, and we succeeded. If we make the commitment today to be energy \nindependent in 10 years, we can achieve that goal. That is what this \namendment does. I hope it will not be a controversial amendment. I hope \nwe can get it done so we put into this legislation our commitment to \ntruly become energy independent.\n  Mr. President, I have a second amendment I want to call up. I want to \nmake sure there is--I know there is a protocol of alternating \namendments. If there is no objection, I was going to ask unanimous \nconsent--I see that the Senator from New Mexico is here.\n  Let me make sure. I have a second amendment I wanted to call up. I \nknow we are alternating.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will be ready with ours in just 1 minute. We will \noffer one. We would object.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, let me say to my friend from Maryland, if you \nwill wait a minute, you do not even have to leave the floor. It will \nnot take very long.\n  Mr. President, I ask the pending amendment be set aside so I might \ncall up the Thune amendment, which we have agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1609 to Amendment No. 1502\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send to the desk amendment No. 1609 on \nbehalf of Senator Thune and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. Thune, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1609 to amendment No. 1502.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

SITING, CONSTRUCTION, EXPANSION, AND OPERATION OF \n                   LNG TERMINALS.\n\n       Section 10 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403), is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking the section designation and all that \n     follows through ``creation'' and inserting the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 10.

Mr. President, this amendment I am introducing with \nSenators Mikulski, Dodd, Reed, Kennedy, Whitehouse, and Snowe would \nrestore the authority of State and local governments to protect the \nenvironment and ensure public safety with respect to the siting of \nliquefied natural gas, LNG, terminals within their States.\n  This measure simply gives our States a say in whether these kinds of \nfacilities should be built within their boundaries and, if so, the \nexact location.\n  The amendment adds a provision to the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. \nUnder that law, the Army Corps of Engineers, acting for the Secretary \nof the Army, is responsible for issuing permits to anyone who wants to \nbuild a structure in and above the waters of the United States. These \nare often called section 10 permits because that is where the provision \nis found in the Rivers and Harbors Act.\n  Currently, the Army Corps issues all such permits. In the narrow \nconditions outlined in our amendment, the Corps would have to get the \nconcurrence of the affected State before issuing a permit to build an \nLNG terminal. That is all, just work with the States. It is just \nfederalism. That is what federalism is all about, the Federal \nGovernment working with the States. The States certainly have a direct \ninterest on the siting of LNG plants.\n  This amendment does not limit the Federal Regulatory Energy \nCommission, FERC. FERC will still be able to make its decisions \nregarding siting, construction, and operation of LNG facilities. FERC \nhas that blanket authority. So be it. But the Army Corps of Engineers \nalso has a say in whether such a facility can be built in the waters of \nthe United States. Today we turn to the Corps for relief.\n  In recent years, the LNG industry has proposed building dozens of new \nLNG terminals throughout the United States, as LNG's share of the \nnatural gas market continues to grow rapidly. Many of these terminals \nare being planned near populated areas or environmentally sensitive \ncoastal areas. We are simply seeking an opportunity for States to have \na meaningful opportunity to take those safety and environmental issues \ninto account.\n  Maryland is already home of one of the six operating LNG terminals in \nthe United States. This bill would have no effect whatsoever on that \nfacility. In fact, that facility is generally welcomed by its host \ncommunity and is supported by county and local elected officials. That \nis how it should be. Companies that want to build an LNG terminal \nshould work with the local community and address all of the safety and \nsecurity concerns. It can be done. We have the proof of it in the State \nof Maryland.\n  This amendment is not designed to stop LNG terminals. It is solely to \nmake sure that such projects are sited properly. Unfortunately, that is \nnot always the case. AES Sparrows Point\n\n[[Page S7784]]\n\nLNG and Mid-Atlantic Express have proposed building a new terminal near \na densely populated area of Baltimore. Our area congressional \ndelegation, Senator Mikulski and I, Governor O'Malley, Baltimore County \nExecutive Jim Smith, and local officials and community leaders believe \nthis project poses unacceptable public safety, economic and \nenvironmental risks, and does not serve the public interest.\n  Yet under current law, FERC now has exclusive authority to approve \nonshore LNG terminal siting applications. But these facilities still \nmust obtain environmental permits, including a section 10 permit under \nthe provisions of the Rivers and Harbors Act.\n  It is vital, in my opinion, that State and local authorities and the \npublic have a meaningful opportunity to participate in the \ndecisionmaking process about where these plants are located. An \naccident or a terrorist act at an LNG terminal could have a devastating \nimpact on the communities nearby, so they should have a voice in the \nsiting.\n  The amendment I am introducing today seeks to restore that authority \nand gives Governors some real clout. The proponents of building LNG \nterminals should have to negotiate in good faith with States and local \ncommunities if they want those communities to bear the risk associated \nwith such operations.\n  My amendment does not prohibit the construction of LNG terminals. It \nmerely levels the playing field with regard to determining where they \nwill be located. It is what federalism should be all about. We should \nrespect that. This amendment moves us in that direction.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we are on the Energy bill. It \nis expected that we are going to have a big fight out here, a political \nfight, regarding the question of miles per gallon--requirements for the \nmanufactured automobiles, light trucks, and then what are medium-size \nand heavier trucks--what the miles per gallon requirements are going to \nbe.\n  A couple weeks ago, I was on an Intelligence Committee trip all \nthrough Africa. Needless to say, there is increasing al-Qaida presence \nin Africa. Indeed, an organization called AQIM--al-Qaida in the Islamic \nMaghreb--is a group that broke through the barriers of the Presidential \npalace in Algiers, Algeria, and a suicide bomber detonated a bomb right \nnext to the Presidential palace, injuring and killing some people, \ndoing damage to the Presidential palace, but the President was not \nharmed.\n  What we have is an increasing threat not only to the peoples of \nAfrica but to the interests of the United States. What is one of those \ninterests? One of those interests is all the places from which we get \noil. One of those places is the Niger River Delta in the country of \nNigeria.\n  I met with the new President of Nigeria. He had just been inaugurated \nsome 5 days earlier, and I believe he understands the significant \nthreat to Nigeria's oil production. Already a good portion of Nigeria's \noil production is siphoned off by bandits and others who are using \nkidnappings, asking for ransom, tapping into the oil wells, siphoning \noff the oil and the gas to the point that they produce about 3 million \nbarrels a day of oil, and yet what they are shipping is only about 2.4 \nmillion barrels a day. So they are losing right there, off the bat, \njust to bandits, 600,000 barrels of oil a day, just in that one \ncountry.\n  But that oil that is shipped is shipped to the United States. That \noil represents 12 to 14 percent of America's daily consumption. What \nhappens if the terrorists strike and a major part of that oil \nproduction is eliminated? Well, you can imagine what America would do \nif it suddenly had 12 to 14 percent less oil per day.\n  Oh, by the way, that is not the only place where we are threatened. \nWe are also threatened, indeed, by a fellow named Hugo Chavez, \nPresident of Venezuela. Venezuela sends us 12 to 14 percent of our \ndaily consumption of oil. Of course, he has been making those threats \nas well. But that is little more of an idle threat, in this Senator's \nopinion, because of the vast infrastructure the Venezuelan oil company \nPDVSA has through their distribution outlets of Citgo gas stations here \nin America.\n  All right, what does this have to do with the Energy bill? It has a \nlot to do with the Energy bill because one of the primary things we \nought to be doing as a matter of Government policy is weaning ourselves \nfrom oil and particularly from foreign oil. What is one of the best \nways to do that? It is to go to the place where most oil is consumed in \nAmerica, and that is in the transportation sector. And where in the \ntransportation sector is most of the oil consumed? It is in our \npersonal vehicles.\n  So if we really want to do something that would affect this ripple \neffect if al-Qaida struck in a number of very sensitive oil-producing \nplaces in Africa, then right here in this Senate, at this moment, \nconsidering the Energy bill, we better be serious about what we are \ndoing for miles-per-gallon requirements.\n  Now, it is almost inexcusable that back when we had the oil embargo \nin the early 1970s and we said we were going to do something about it, \nthat then we went back to sleep. Then again we had another disruption \nof the oil flow in the late 1970s, and we went through the drill again, \nand we said we were going to do something about it, and we went back to \nsleep. All of those mileage standards we put into law kept being \ndelayed and excused and sidelined, and here we are where we are, with \nAmerican automobile companies being some of the worst in dragging their \nfeet, so that higher mileage per gallon has not been achieved, and we \nfind ourselves so dependent on oil and, indeed, so dependent on foreign \noil to the tune of 60 percent of our daily consumption of oil is being \nimported from foreign shores.\n  So what are we going to do about it? All right, the moment of truth \nis coming in a few days because we are going to have a chance to enact \nthis bill and what it has in the bill, which is 35 miles per gallon by \nthe year 2020--that is 13 years in the future--35 miles per gallon on \ncars and light trucks, and then there are some exceptions for medium-\nsize and heavier trucks.\n  In 13 years, can America go from a standard of somewhere around 26 \nmiles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon? If we have the technology to \ndo some of the extraordinary things we have already done in \ntechnology--in energy, in defense, in so many things--do we have the \ncapability, technologically, in 13 years to increase the fleet average \nto 35 miles per gallon? You bet we do. The question is, Do we have the \npolitical will? That is going to be the moment of truth.\n  Now, there are going to be those who are going to come with a \nseductive alternative--Senator Levin, Senator Stabenow. Their seductive \nalternative is: Well, we will do the same number of miles per gallon, \nbut we will stretch it out a little bit further. We will make it 2025 \ninstead of 2020.\n\n  Do we have the political will to make the decision that the time is \nnow to change our oil-consuming habits so we can lessen our dependence \non oil, and specifically foreign oil?\n  This Senator is going to offer an even tougher standard: 40 miles per \ngallon. We have the technology. Do we have the political will? I think \nit is going to be very hard to pass 40 miles per gallon. Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Bingaman, and others came up with what is in the \nbill now: 35 miles per gallon over the course of the next 13 years. I \nthink it ought to be higher. I think we ought to be serious. I will \ntell my colleagues, if al-Qaida ever does strike and cut off that oil, \nthis Senate will be in session and we will be exacting much higher \nstandards, because the political will would be demanded at that point. \nAre we going to look over the horizon and see all of the pitfalls and \navoid them by going ahead and enacting into law a stronger standard?\n  I have had the privilege of representing my State of Florida for the \npast 7 years in the Senate, and I have tried, along with other \nSenators, particularly Senator Kerry, to enact\n\n[[Page S7785]]\n\nhigher mileage per gallon standards on SUVs. We could never get the \nvotes because there wasn't the political will. The clock is ticking and \ntime is running out. It is going to happen because a lot of those \noilfields scattered around the world--and I have given one example of \nNigeria--are vulnerable to attack. The only way we are going to prevent \nthose attacks is our intelligence apparatus, working with the \nintelligence services of other nations, to find out in advance so we \ncan prevent it, because they can't defend it there. The military forces \nof those countries throughout the world are not sufficient to defend \nit. We are only going to prevent it by finding out about it through the \ngathering of intelligence. But our intelligence gathering can't be 100 \npercent foolproof. So the likelihood is it is going to happen.\n  Let's get prepared, I beg the Senate. We have dragged our feet. We \nhave not produced more than about 39 votes in the past to increase \nmiles per gallon standards on SUVs. Will we wake up, America? Will we \nhave the will? It is coming, and it is going to come about next Tuesday \nor Wednesday when we vote on these amendments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, let me congratulate my friend from \nFlorida for his passionate statement on this imperative. As Abraham \nLincoln might say, we are trying to give our Nation a new birth of \nfreedom from the oil addiction that is very much compromising the \nnational security of our Nation. Certainly how we deal with \ntransportation fuels and move forward with higher standards and more \nefficient vehicles is something I hope this body has the political will \nto do through the underlying bill, which will move us to 35 miles per \ngallon within a reasonable time period. I very much appreciate his \nleadership on this effort and I look forward to joining him on this \nbattle next week as we try to move forward.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1524 to Amendment No. 1502\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside, and I call up amendment No. 1524.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar], for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley, Mr. Obama, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Casey, Mr. Ben \n     Nelson, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n     Tester, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Thune, and Mr. Cochran, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1524 to amendment No. 1502.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 1524\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress relating to the use of \n                renewable resources to generate energy)\n\n       On page 27, after line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 113. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO THE USE OF RENEWABLE \n                   RESOURCES TO GENERATE ENERGY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States has a quantity of renewable energy \n     resources that is sufficient to supply a significant portion \n     of the energy needs of the United States;\n       (2) the agricultural, forestry, and working land of the \n     United States can help ensure a sustainable domestic energy \n     system;\n       (3) accelerated development and use of renewable energy \n     technologies provide numerous benefits to the United States, \n     including improved national security, improved balance of \n     payments, healthier rural economies, improved environmental \n     quality, and abundant, reliable, and affordable energy for \n     all citizens of the United States;\n       (4) the production of transportation fuels from renewable \n     energy would help the United States meet rapidly growing \n     domestic and global energy demands, reduce the dependence of \n     the United States on energy imported from volatile regions of \n     the world that are politically unstable, stabilize the cost \n     and availability of energy, and safeguard the economy and \n     security of the United States;\n       (5) increased energy production from domestic renewable \n     resources would attract substantial new investments in energy \n     infrastructure, create economic growth, develop new jobs for \n     the citizens of the United States, and increase the income \n     for farm, ranch, and forestry jobs in the rural regions of \n     the United States;\n       (6) increased use of renewable energy is practical and can \n     be cost effective with the implementation of supportive \n     policies and proper incentives to stimulate markets and \n     infrastructure; and\n       (7) public policies aimed at enhancing renewable energy \n     production and accelerating technological improvements will \n     further reduce energy costs over time and increase market \n     demand.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that it \n     is the goal of the United States that, not later than January \n     1, 2025, the agricultural, forestry, and working land of the \n     United States should--\n       (1) provide from renewable resources not less than 25 \n     percent of the total energy consumed in the United States; \n     and\n       (2) continue to produce safe, abundant, and affordable \n     food, feed, and fiber.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the 25x'25 \nresolution as an amendment to H.R. 6, the Energy bill. I am proud to be \njoined in this endeavor by a broad bipartisan group of Senators. They \ninclude Senators Grassley, Harkin, Lugar, Obama, Hagel, Clinton, \nFeingold, Casey, Nelson of Nebraska, Brownback, Kohl, Kerry, Johnson, \nTester, Cantwell, Thune, and Cochran, all of whom are sponsors of S. \nCon. Res. 3, which we introduced earlier this year.\n  Mr. President, 25x'25 is a critical vision for our energy future that \nwill help reduce our dependence on foreign oil by building a new energy \neconomy here at home. Our amendment establishes a national goal of \nproducing 25 percent of America's energy from renewable sources, such \nas solar, wind, and biofuels, by 2025.\n  The 25x'25 vision is widely endorsed, it is bold, and it is fully \nattainable. If implemented, it will dramatically improve our energy \nsecurity, our economy, and our ability to protect the environment and \ncombat global warming. 25x'25 complements the steps we are taking on \nthe bill before us today which reflects the good work of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee and the other committees that have \ncontributed so greatly to this bill.\n  I am pleased that 17 of my colleagues in the Senate from both sides \nof the aisle are cosponsoring this resolution. In addition, the 25x'25 \nvision has been endorsed by 22 current and former Governors and many \nState legislatures around the country.\n  The Big Three auto manufacturers--Ford, Chrysler, and General \nMotors--are all behind 25x'25. So are many agricultural organizations, \nenvironmental groups, scientists, and businesses, ranging from the \nFarmers' Union and the Farm Bureau to the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, and companies such as John Deere.\n  The breadth of support for the 25x'25 vision speaks to the \nextraordinary economic, environmental, and national security benefits \nthat its achievement will yield. In all, nearly 400 organizations have \nembraced this vision and are working together on a plan to implement \nit.\n  The amendment I am introducing makes the 25x'25 vision a policy goal \nfor our Nation. It sets a challenging but realistic target for our \nlegislative and budgetary work on energy. Our amendment says the \ningenuity and entrepreneurship of the American people should be the \nengine for a new, clean energy economy for the 21st century.\n  I urge every American to join with me and roughly 400 partner \norganizations that are part of 25x'25 to make this goal a reality. \nResults from a recent study conducted by the University of Tennessee \nshow that reaching the 25x'25 goal is, indeed, achievable. The study \nalso shows that 25x'25 would do the following: First, it would increase \nnet farm income in America by $180 billion and, including multiplier \neffects, could result in $700 billion in economic activity annually for \nAmerica. Secondly, it would create 5 million new jobs here at home by \n2025; and third, it would save as much as $15 billion in Government \npayments across America.\n  America's working people can and should be at the center of our \nenergy revolution. Farmers and ranchers in my native San Luis Valley, \nin Sterling, CO, and elsewhere, are already leading the way. They are \nbuilding biodiesel plants and ethanol refineries that help power cars, \ntractors, and trucks. They are building wind turbines in Prowers County \nand biomass generators in Jackson County, and they are searching for \nnew technologies that will allow them to make even greater \ncontributions to our energy supply. These Americans understand we \ncannot continue to import 60 percent of our oil\n\n[[Page S7786]]\n\nfrom foreign countries, many of which are hostile to the United States. \nIf we aim to be strong and secure in this world, we must have this kind \nof bold vision. They know we will have to build a clean energy economy \nfor America if we are to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  A clean energy economy will take root in our farms and in our fields. \nIt will help revitalize a rural America that has been forgotten for far \ntoo long. It will spur our engineers to new developments and designs, \nand it will help establish the United States as a world leader in clean \nenergy technologies. It is time for Congress to take a more active role \nin our clean energy future. Establishing a national goal of 25x'25 is \nan important first step.\n  Americans understand we cannot continue to import 60 percent of our \noil from foreign countries, many of which are hostile to the United \nStates, if we aim to be strong and secure in the world. We must rid \nourselves of this dependency and this addiction. They know we will have \nto build a clean energy economy if we are to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  Today, with this amendment, we are articulating a common vision for \nour energy policy. It is a target that Governors, Senators, \nRepresentatives, State legislators, farmers, ranchers, business people, \nscientists, and automakers all wish to achieve. It is a target we can \nhit, particularly with the policies that are built into this bill.\n\n  I ask my Democratic and Republican colleagues to support this \namendment and to join the millions of Americans who are already working \ntoward the 25x'25 goal.\n  I want to make a comment about the imperative of the energy issue \nthat is before the Senate today. When I look at the 21st century, I ask \nmyself: What is it the people of my State, and what is it the people of \nAmerica want me to do as their Senator, not only for our generation but \nfor the next generation and generations to come? It seems to me the \nchallenges of the 21st century are daunting challenges, major \nchallenges, that face us. We can essentially put them into three, and \nthey are all under an umbrella of security for this Nation and \nultimately security for civilization.\n  The first of those challenges is foreign policy: How can we in \nAmerica move forward and try to put Humpty Dumpty together again when \nwe see so much violence in the Middle East and other places around the \nworld? How can we make sure the dream and vision of the generation of \nWorld War II is something we preserve? How can we say to our children \nand to our grandchildren that the world we are leaving to them is a \nsafer and more secure world? Certainly that generation of World War II \nbelieved they had accomplished that, that they were leaving a world \nwhich was a much safer and a much more secure world for the generations \nthat would come after them. Indeed, we have been the beneficiaries of \ntheir sacrifices. Over half a million Americans gave their lives to \npreserve freedom around the world in World War II, including members of \nmy family who gave their lives on the soils of Europe. They had a \nvision of a more secure world.\n  We have some major challenges in Iraq, as we witness the violence \nthere, and when we see what is happening today in Lebanon where we are \non the precipice of another civil war there, and when we see what is \nhappening in Gaza and Israel where Hamas has now apparently taken over \nthe Gaza Strip and the emergency that we see President Abbas has \ndeclared in the Gaza Strip.\n  We have to somehow figure out this very challenging task of how we \nput the world back together again. How do we secure the vision the \npeople of America want us to have, which is that we create a safer and \nmore secure world for ourselves and for those generations who will come \nbehind us?\n  The second issue which, in my view, confronts America today and which \nis interrelated with some of the violence we see in the Middle East is \nenergy. For far too long we have neglected this issue. I am proud of \nthe fact that in 2005, this body came together in a bipartisan way and \nwe opened a new chapter for energy in America. I am very proud of this \nbill today because it builds on that chapter that gets us to energy \nindependence. We have to look at the failings of America under both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations in the past. Jimmy Carter, \nRichard Nixon--Richard Nixon first--coined the term ``energy \nindependence'' when OPEC was formed. President Jimmy Carter spoke to \nthe Nation late one night back in the 1970s and said: We need to deal \nwith energy with the same kind of moral imperative of war.\n  Yet what happened in the 1980s and the 1990s? The low cost of fuel \nessentially allowed America to go to sleep at the switch. The \nconsequence has been that instead of importing 30 percent of our oil as \nwe were in 1970, today we import 60 percent of our oil. The consequence \nis we have compromised the national security of the United States.\n  I have been on the border of Israel and Lebanon and looked down at \nthe camps of Hamas and the daunting signs of Hezbollah where Hezbollah \nhad captured at that time Israeli soldiers, and they were at that time \ndaring Prime Minister Sharon to go into southern Lebanon.\n  What is it that creates that kind of condition? What is it that \nallows Hezbollah to have over 37,000 rockets in their armory? What is \nit that allows the funding and the creation of a militia of more than \n10,000 militant soldiers within the Hezbollah organization? It is the \noil. It is the oil revenue that is going into some countries in the \nMiddle East, including Iran, that is directly funding those interests \nwho are fighting the interests of America across the world.\n  In fact, we have gotten to the position where those interests have \nbecome so powerful economically that now with the potential of Iran \narming itself with nuclear capabilities, we should all be very \nconcerned about the security not only of Israel but also of the Middle \nEast and of our entire world.\n  What does Iran with nuclear armaments mean to the national security \nof our world? It is a fact that it is our energy dependence, the \nglutton nature of our energy dependence on oil from those countries \nthat has compromised our national security.\n  So when we work on the energy issue of our country, we need to know \nwe are working on an imperative of the 21st century. It is an \nimperative of the 21st century that we get ourselves rid of this \naddiction to foreign oil. That is why we see progressives and \nconservatives coming together, Democrats and Republicans coming \ntogether, to try to tackle this issue.\n  Much of what we have in this legislation before the Senate comes from \nthe efforts of the energy futures coalition that coined the term ``set \nAmerica free.'' ``Set America free.'' Our passage of this legislation, \nhopefully this next week, will be part of that achievement where we as \nSenators will stand and we will say we have taken another bold step in \nthis agenda of setting America free.\n  A second issue that obviously confronts the people of America is \nhealth care. That is an issue for another day. That is an issue we will \nbe dealing with as we look at health insurance for children and a whole \nhost of other issues. But today and next week, we have an opportunity \nto deliver on one of the imperatives of the 21st century for the United \nStates of America, and that imperative is that we move forward with \ncourage and with boldness on the vision of energy independence.\n  Our amendment today on 20x'25 is a critical part of that agenda \nbecause it sets forth a vision that is an achievable one that will get \nus to make sure we are producing 25 percent of our energy from \nrenewable resources by the year 2025.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I understand the amendment I spoke about \nis acceptable to both sides. Therefore, I ask for a voice vote on the \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate? If not, \nthe question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1524.\n\n[[Page S7787]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 1524) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to comment on a couple of issues \ndealing with the Energy bill this morning. We will be back on the \nEnergy bill starting on Monday. Before I do, I wish to mention as well \nthe Washington Post column by Robert Novak yesterday entitled \n``Dorgan's Poison Pill.'' Mr. Novak once again stops just about a page \nor two short of good research. He has the opportunity on the op-ed page \nof a major paper to make his case, and we are so seldom offered that \nsame opportunity by the Washington Post that I thought I would at least \nuse the floor of the Senate to describe accurately what Mr. Novak was \ntrying to write about.\n  He talks about an amendment I offered to the immigration bill. He \ncalls it a ``poison pill'' in the title, and then he says: Dorgan \npushed his ``killer amendment'' by voicing the Great Plains populism of \nhis own State. That is sort of sniffing down your nose at the Great \nPlains populism that exists in some parts of this country.\n  Let me describe what this amendment was. The immigration bill is a \nbill that is complicated, it is controversial, it is a very large bill, \nand it has a lot of moving parts to it. One part of the bill deals with \nthe issue of bringing in guest workers--people who aren't now here, who \nare living elsewhere in other parts of the world--bringing them in to \ntake American jobs.\n  Now, I have great difficulty with the immigration bill as it is \nwritten. My feeling about immigration is we have a problem with illegal \nimmigration. That is true, we certainly do, and we ought to try to \naddress that problem. I think the first way and the thoughtful way to \naddress that problem is to decide we are going to provide border \nsecurity and border enforcement--just do first things first. First of \nall, provide border enforcement, and then we can do the other things.\n  That is not what this bill does. This bill brings in about six or \neight moving parts, and in order to sign up support for it--for \nexample, in order to get the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to support it, \nthey also include a temporary or guest worker program that says we have \npeople who are not now in this country whom we want to bring into this \ncountry to take American jobs because we don't have enough American \nworkers, they claim.\n  In fact, they put together this Byzantine approach that says guest \nworkers will come in, they will be able to bring their family with them \nand stay for 2 years. They have to go home for 1 year, take their \nfamily home, and then they can come back for 2 more years, then go home \nfor 1 year and come back for 2 more years. So they can be here a total \nof 6 years, with 2 years gone, and their family with them their first \nor second tour. And by the way, no one knows whether they are going to \ngo home once they get here. Who is going to keep track of people coming \nin three times in 6 years for 2-year periods each of the three \noccasions?\n  I offered an amendment on that particular issue of guest and \ntemporary workers who would come in to take these jobs. My amendment \nwas very simple. It said: Let's sunset that provision after 5 years and \ntry to understand what has happened as a result of it, what has \nhappened to American workers as a result of bringing in all these \ntemporary workers. Is there downward pressure on American wages? Has \nthis hurt American workers? My guess is it will. What if 80 percent of \nthe people who come in under the temporary worker program never leave? \nThen they are here as illegal immigrants. Maybe that ought to matter. \nMaybe we should sunset this in 5 years and take a look at it.\n  That was my amendment. It passed by one vote on the floor of the \nSenate and is described by Mr. Novak as the ``poison pill,'' the \n``killer amendment.'' That is unbelievable. I know where he got the \nlanguage. He got the language from my colleagues here who were part of \nthe ``grand bargain''--a group of 14, I think it was, who went into a \nroom, reached a grand bargain putting together this Byzantine \nimmigration bill, brought it to the floor, and behaved as if they were \nthe only people out of 100 Senators who had any ideas. There are 14 of \nus who have this idea, they believed, and anybody who offers amendments \nwould not have an idea that would be worthy of improving it; therefore, \nwe must resist and oppose all amendments.\n  That is the way this immigration bill went on the floor of the \nSenate. But it was not a poison pill or a killer amendment or anything \nof the sort. It was a kind of commonsense approach to try to say: Why \ndon't we do this the right way?\n  Mr. Novak points to my colleague, Senator Kyl from Arizona, in his \ncolumn. It is interesting. Mr. Kyl was part of the grand compromise \nand, of course, described my amendment, I think, as a ``poison pill.'' \nMr. Kyl voted for the identical amendment 1 year ago. I offered the \nidentical amendment 1 year ago, and Senator Kyl voted for it then.\n  But those are just facts that Mr. Novak missed because, as I said, \nwhen you stop one page short of good research, you are not going to \nhave the entire story.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. President, let me now talk just a bit about the Energy bill. This \nis important.\n  We live on this little old planet, we circle the Sun, and we have \nabout 6.4 billion neighbors. We live in this little portion of the \nplanet called the United States, and we have built an economy that is \nextraordinary. We have expanded the middle class, created an economic \nengine that is almost unparalleled on this Earth.\n  In this planet we stick little straws and suck out oil. We suck out \nabout 84 to 85 million barrels of oil every single day. One-fourth of \nthat oil must come to the United States and be used here because we \nneed it. We use one-fourth of all the oil every day that is pulled out \nof this earth, and 60 percent of the oil we use in this country comes \nfrom outside of our country. So we use one-fourth of the oil on the \nEarth every day, and over 60 percent of it comes from elsewhere. It \ncomes from the Saudis--Saudi Arabia--Kuwait, Iraq, and Venezuela. Some \ntroubled parts of the world--very troubled parts of the world--produce \na substantial portion of the oil we need for our economy to work. If, \nGod forbid, one morning we woke up and terrorists had interrupted the \npipeline of oil to our country from troubled parts of the world, our \neconomy would be flat on its back, and that is reason we have an energy \nbill on the floor of the Senate.\n  I think this is the first time we have debated the Energy bill in \nwhich we have come to an intersection in understanding that energy and \nclimate change are intertwined, energy and climate change meet at the \nsame intersection.\n  So we discuss all of these things. We discuss renewable electricity \nstandards. Should we require that 15 percent of all electricity \nproduced in this country be produced with renewable energy--wind \nenergy, biomass, geothermal, solar energy? I believe the answer is yes. \nI feel very strongly about that. We will have a vote on that next week, \nand I think it will be very close.\n  Standards that would increase the efficiency of automobiles, we will \nhave a vote on that, and it will be very close. We haven't had a change \nin the CAFE standards for automobiles for 25 years--25 years. \nEverything else about an automobile has changed. There is more \ncomputing power in a new automobile than there was on the lunar landing \nthat put Neil Armstrong on the surface of the Moon. There is more \ncomputing power in one new car than was in the lunar landing. \nEverything has changed--cup holders, music systems, keyless entry--\neverything has changed about these vehicles except efficiency.\n  My wife purchased an automobile some years ago. She purchased an \nautomobile that had a certain mileage standard on the window sticker. \nAfter 10 years, she was going to buy another car, and she looked at the \nnew version,\n\n[[Page S7788]]\n\nthe new car version of exactly what she purchased 10 years earlier. The \nmileage standard on the new car, 10 years later, was identical to the \nmileage standard of the car she had purchased, identical. Everything \nabout the car had changed--the color, the look, I am sure the springs, \nthe suspension--almost everything was changed, and it has cup holders \nand a better music system and keyless entry.\n  By the way, all those car companies opposed seatbelts and airbags and \nhave always opposed CAFE standards.\n  But the point is, regarding efficiency, nothing is changing. So the \nquestion is this: If we are consuming all of this oil--much of it from \ntroubled parts of the world--because we have such an oil-intensive \neconomy and we want to be less dependent on the Saudis, Kuwaitis, and \nothers, and 70 percent of our oil is used in vehicles, then don't we \nhave to insist that this change and that vehicles become more \nefficient?\n  The automobile industry is doing full-page newspaper ads in my \nState--and I assume other States as well--telling people things about \nthe proposal on the floor of the Senate that just aren't true--just not \nso. I think it was Will Rogers who said:\n\n       It is not what he knows that bothers me so much, it's what \n     he says he knows for sure that just ain't so.\n\n  Well, some of the advertising that is going on around the country is \njust wrong. They have these screaming ads saying somebody is going to \ntake your pickup truck away. It is not true. The new CAFE standards--or \nany efficiency standards--aren't like the old ones where if you produce \ntoo many pickup trucks, you have to cut back on pickup trucks and \nproduce far more subcompacts. That is not the case.\n  These new approaches say that for every class of vehicle--and there \nare eight, including the big, heavy trucks--every class of vehicle must \nhave efficiency. You must have increased efficiency for each class, not \nmeasured against another class. You must have increased efficiency in \nthat class, and, yes, that includes pickup trucks. But those who are \nbuying pickup trucks--and a lot of people are--ought to expect more \nefficiency. It is not a case where someone is going to say that you are \nnot going to be able to find a pickup because we have to produce more \nsubcompacts.\n  In my part of the country, it does occasionally--only on rare \noccasions--get cold. In North Dakota, when a rancher is going out in \nlate March, and there is a blizzard and the wind is blowing 40 miles an \nhour and the temperature is 30 below, and he or she is out checking on \nthe calves because it is calving season and they are trying to figure \nout what is going on--they don't want to go out in 40-mile-an-hour \nwinds, with temperatures 30 below; that rarely happens, but \noccasionally--they do not want to go out driving in a Chevette or some \nsubcompact car trying to figure out where they are going to move in the \npasture to find those cattle. They want a substantial vehicle. So they \nwant four-wheel drives and pickup trucks, and I understand that. That \nis why this CAFE or this automobile efficiency standard has been \nchanged and changed in the right way, requiring all classes of vehicles \nto be more efficient. We don't measure them against other classes. \nEvery class is required to meet greater efficiency standards.\n  So that will be debated next week. I know there are people who will \ncome and oppose it because the automobile industry is taking a position \nof: Yesterday forever; let's just keep doing what we have been doing, \nand that will be just fine. It is not just fine as a matter of public \npolicy for this country. This country needs a changed agenda with \nrespect to energy, and part of that changed agenda is increased \nefficiency for automobiles and for vehicles.\n  With respect to the renewable energy standard, the renewable \nelectricity standard, I regret and I have said from time to time that \nmy political party--we are not as good at developing titles and labels \nas the other party. No matter what they come up with, they are good. \nThey come up with something that is probably going to even cause more \npollution, and they call it Clear Skies. They come up with something \nthat will cut down trees, and they call it Healthy Forests. They are \ngood at labeling.\n  We come up with something called renewable portfolio standard. We \ntalk like twits. So we need to improve that. I call it homegrown energy \nor renewable electricity standards.\n  Let me describe what that means. It means we produce a lot of \nelectricity, and we use it. We get up in the morning and the first \nthing we do is turn on a switch and that switch makes all things \npossible for us. It allows you to get hot water from a hot water \nheater, it allows you to plug in an electric razor, allows you to have \nthe lights in your bathroom as you get ready for work. All of these \nthings happen, but it is not automatic. Somebody is out there producing \nelectricity in a coal-fired generating plant perhaps, or a generating \nplant that is fueled by natural gas.\n  What we are saying is, we want to set a standard of 15 percent of our \nelectric energy to be produced with renewable energy. We now have \nunbelievable turbines that can take energy from the wind and turn it \ninto electricity. Yes, you can advance your electricity issue with that \nor, an experiment I have in North Dakota that I am very excited about, \nyou can take the energy from the wind, produce electricity, and with \nthat electricity in the process of electrolysis, separate hydrogen from \nwater and store hydrogen as a vehicle fuel; the wind to hydrogen, all \nrenewable.\n  You can do the same with respect to the renewable electricity \nstandard by requiring that 15 percent of the electricity we produce \ncomes from biomass, solar energy, wind energy, geothermal, and more. We \nshould do that. I know it is a close vote. I know some oppose that. We \nshould do that because it will advance this country's interests.\n  I want to make one additional point. There are some who say: You are \nout here talking about increased efficiency standards, you talk about \nrenewable electricity and so on--what about more production? In fact, I \njust had a person call me a few minutes ago who said the same thing. \nWhat about more production? I believe we ought to have more production \nof energy. I have supported, along with my colleague, Senator Craig \nfrom Idaho--bipartisan--the two of us have supported something called \nthe SAFE Act, which proposes and calls for more production from that \narea offshore that has the greatest potential. No, it is not Alaska, \nnot California; it is the gulf, the Gulf of Mexico that has the \ngreatest potential.\n  I was one who helped open lease 181, which was just opened. But I \nbelieve much more can be done to increase the potential on the Outer \nContinental Shelf on the Gulf of Mexico. I support that. I filed an \namendment--we have not called it up because I don't believe we have the \nvotes for that--but Senator Craig and I are discussing that issue. I \nsupport increased production because I believe it is a necessary part \nof a balanced energy strategy.\n  I think all of these issues are important. I know there are some who \nprobably do not think the Energy bill is as important as it really is, \nbut it is at the root of this country's future economic opportunity. \nThis engine of ours, this economic engine of ours cannot and does not \nwork without energy, and our energy policy has not been a particularly \nthoughtful policy. We waste a prodigious amount of energy in every way, \nevery day. We can make buildings more efficient, we can make \nautomobiles more efficient, we can make appliances more efficient. We \nshould produce more. We should conserve more. There is so much we \nshould do in energy policy.\n  Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici, who are the chair and ranking \nmember of the Energy Committee--I am a senior member of that \ncommittee--but with their leadership they have put together a bill that \nis now on the Senate floor, and I think it will advance our interests. \nBut we need to do a couple of things.\n  No. 1, we need to support the CAFE standards. By the way, that comes \nfrom the Commerce Committee on which I serve. Senator Inouye and \nSenator Stevens are to be complimented for what we were able to do in \nthe Commerce Committee with respect to CAFE standards. Senator Boxer \nand the leadership of the EPW committee has also contributed to this \nbill. But we need to have a 15-percent standard of renewable fuels \ncoming with respect to the production of electricity, and we need to \nsupport the CAFE standards that have come from the Commerce Committee.\n\n[[Page S7789]]\n\n  I do not believe there are others who wish to speak.

Mr. President, I was deeply saddened to hear of the sudden \npassing of my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Craig Thomas. The loss we \nall feel at his passing Craig is tempered by the happy memories I have \nof working with him on so many issues of mutual interest. His efforts \nand his leadership on the panels on which we served together--the \nSenate Finance Committee, Senate Agriculture Committee, and Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee--will remain foremost in my \nmemory. I particularly admired his staunch advocacy for the needs of \nrural communities and farmers. Craig brought a special passion and \nexpertise to issues affecting ranching families. His focus on their \nunique needs spanned the trade, economic, environmental, and public \nlands management issues of rural communities.\n  Craig brought to Congress his vision for the needs of Wyoming and \nrural States, and he became a strong advocate of effective resource and \nenergy policies. I am pleased to have partnered with him in applying \ntechnologies to improving our Nation's energy generation. Although he \nlived his life modestly, he became a leader in national park \nstewardship, and the American people owe him a debt of gratitude for \nhis promotion of the underserved national parks system. I also \nappreciated his long and thoughtful counsel on ways to update the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  In recent months, Craig took a prime role on the Finance Committee in \nworking to simplify the Federal Tax Code and improve entitlement and \nhealth care assistance to the least fortunate. As one who took to heart \nthe importance of protecting the taxpayers' dollars, Craig was a strong \nproponent of restoring the sustainability of our Nation's welfare \nsystem. And Craig understood that economic development in rural States \nlike Wyoming was inextricably linked to trade promotion that ensured \nopen and fair markets abroad. I will miss his stalwart and consistent \nadvocacy for farming communities as the Senate considered trade \nlegislation.\n  As a man who represented a small State in population, Craig towered \nlarge over the landscape of thoughtful conservative Members of \nCongress. I think a fitting tribute and legacy to our late friend would \nbe to adopt his resolution making July 28, National Day of the Cowboy. \nMy thoughts and prayers are with Craig's family and friends. I will \nmiss my good friend and colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/15/senate-section/article/S7789-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7789-S7790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RESPONSIBLE FATHERHOOD AND HEALTHY FAMILIES ACT\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, yesterday, just days before Father's Day, I \nwas pleased to join my colleague and good friend Senator Bayh in \nreintroducing the Responsible Fatherhood and Healthy Families Act. \nWithin the next few days companion legislation will be introduced in \nthe House of Representatives by Congresswoman Carson of Indiana and my \nfriend from Chicago, Congressman Danny Davis.\n  It is time to address the crisis of absentee fathers. We must ask \nourselves why more than a quarter of all American families have only \none parent present, and more than a third live without their father. We \nmust get a handle on why 40 percent of the children in America who live \nwithout their father have not seen him in over a year.\n  There is no question that most single mothers are doing a heroic job \nraising their kids. They are working two and three jobs, dropping their \nkids off at school or daycare or with friends or relatives, responding \nto their illnesses, and, quite frankly, doing the work that is often a \nchallenge these days for even two parents. My appreciation for single \nmothers is unwavering. My own father was not around when I was growing \nup, and my mother and grandparents had to step up to the plate to fill \nmy father's role.\n  But most people would agree that children are almost always better \noff with both parents contributing their fair share, and the data shows \nthis. Children are more likely to be poor and to do worse in school \nwithout both parents in their life. And a healthy relationship between \nchildren and their father is important to healthy growth and \ndevelopment.\n  The Responsible Fatherhood and Healthy Families Act addresses these \nproblems by removing government barriers to healthy relationships and \nresponsible fatherhood. It improves the economic stability of parents \nwho accept their parenting responsibility. Our bill sets a high \nstandard for parents and helps them to reach it with incentives, \nsupport, and tougher enforcement of child support obligations.\n  It takes courage to raise a child. We can't simply legislate that \ncourage and expect all parents to get and stay married. We can't \nlegislate good parenting skills or good behavior role models. We can't \nlegislate economic success for all families. But we can help those who \nare trying to do the right thing and eliminate some of the roadblocks \nthey face. And we can provide some tools to help these courageous \nparents succeed.\n  This act removes government roadblocks by eliminating a perverse \ndisincentive to marriage in the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families \nprogram. Congress is sending the wrong message by telling States that \nthey may be penalized for serving married couples. There should be \nequality for two-parent families receiving TANF, and States should not \nbe required to meet a separate work participation rate for the two-\nparent families in their caseload.\n  This act also makes vital improvements to the child support system, \nwhich affects noncustodial fathers as much or more than any other \ngovernment program. It will restore funding for child support \nenforcement and require States to pass the full amount of child support \ncollected along to the family. Research has confirmed that a father is \nmore likely to pay child support if he knows that the money is going to \nhis kids.\n  We also require States to review the amount of child support arrears \nthat are owed to the state, and we clarify existing state authority to \nforgive such arrearages. A father who earns only $10,000 per year, and \nwho has $20,000 of child support debt because the State billed him for \nthe Medicaid birthing costs of his child, is probably going to work \nunderground and avoid paying child support altogether. It is in the \nbest interest of all members of his family that a father has an \nincentive to get a legitimate job and to begin taking care of his \nfamily.\n  States are also provided funding to assess any other barriers to \nhealthy family formation or sustainable employment created by their \nchild support and criminal justice systems. They are encouraged to \nestablish commissions to propose state law changes that would be in the \nbest interest of children.\n\n[[Page S7790]]\n\n  Another important aspect of this act is fostering economic stability \nfor fathers and their families. This act establishes three employment \ndemonstration programs. One program is supervised by courts or state \nchild support agencies that serve parents who are determined to be in \nneed of employment services in order to pay child support obligations. \nThe court can arrange temporary employment services for the father \nrather than throwing him in jail for nonpayment of support. The second \nis a transitional jobs program that combines temporary subsidized \nemployment with activities that help fathers develop skills and remove \nbarriers to employment. The third program establishes public-private \npartnerships to provide fathers with ``career pathways'' that help them \nadvance from jobs at low skill levels through jobs that require greater \nskills and provide family-sustaining wages and benefits.\n  These programs are modeled on successful initiatives in Indiana and \nIllinois and will be subject to rigorous evaluations to ensure the \ngoals are being achieved.\n  In both the Illinois State Senate and the Senate, I have led efforts \nto expand the earned-income tax credit, EITC, which is one of the most \nsuccessful antipoverty programs in the country to date. It rewards work \nand supplements wages that may be too low to support a family. The \nResponsible Fatherhood and Healthy Families Act would double the number \nof working single adults eligible for EITC benefits, increase the \nbenefit, reward and support parents who are current on their child \nsupport payments, and reduce the EITC marriage penalty which hurts low-\nincome families. Under this plan, full-time workers making minimum wage \nwould get an EITC benefit up to $555, more than three times greater \nthan the $175 benefit they get today. If the workers are responsibly \nsupporting their children on child support, this bill would give those \nworkers a benefit of $1,110.\n  Additionally, this bill improves the Responsible Fatherhood and \nMarriage Promotion programs that were funded by the Deficit Reduction \nAct. Funding is increased, and all Fatherhood and Marriage programs are \nrequired to coordinate with domestic violence prevention services to \nreduce instances of domestic violence and promote healthy, nonviolent \nrelationships.\n  I would like take a final few moments to talk about the breakdown of \nfamilies in the African-American community, because the epidemic of \nabsentee fathers runs deep. Today, around 70 percent of Black children \nare born outside of marriage. Of the 30 percent born to married \nparents, more than half experience a divorce. That means that about 85 \npercent of Black children spend some or all of their childhood in a \nhome without their father. As our children grow up, statistics continue \nto paint a bleak picture. Fewer than 6 of every 10 young Black men are \nemployed, and in some of our urban and rural areas the rate of \nunemployment is over 50 percent. Roughly one-third of young Black men \nare involved in some way with the criminal justice system. And young \nBlack men have the lowest educational attainment among Black and White \nmen and women.\n  These factors contribute to low marriage rates among African-American \nmen. But by age 34, nearly half of black men are fathers. And roughly \ntwo-thirds of all Black men leaving prison are fathers. As hard as some \nof these men try, it is likely that their children will also be denied \nthe advantages of healthy parental relationships and married families. \nTheir children will be more likely to live in poverty and to become \nyoung, unmarried parents themselves. Their children's life chances will \nbe limited. The cycle of poverty and despair will continue.\n  It is important to remember that there is no segment of our \npopulation no income level, no religion, and no race--that is immune to \nthese challenges. Some segments of the population are worse off than \nothers. However, I believe there is reason for hope. At the time of the \nbirth of the child, most fathers are close to both the mother and their \nchild. The challenge is to maintain healthy relationships between \nparents and to strengthen the early bonds between fathers and their \nchildren. The challenge is to improve economic opportunity for all \nparents so they can support themselves and their families. The \nchallenge is to break the cycle by strengthening America's most \nvulnerable and fragile families.\n  That is what this bill does, and it is fully paid for by revenue \nraised by closing tax loopholes. This is a solid first step forward in \nremoving government barriers to healthy family formation, and \naddressing the crisis of fatherhood among our Nation's low-income \npopulations. I urge my colleagues to support the Responsible Fatherhood \nand Healthy Families Act of 2007.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/15/senate-section/article/S7790-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7790-S7791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, at a time when we are witnessing the \ndevastating consequences of ethnic and sectarian division in places \nsuch as Iraq and Darfur, I believe it is vital to recognize the efforts \nof those who work to promote peace and reconciliation. In that spirit, \nI wish to commend the 53 Nobel laureates who signed an appeal by the \nElie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity in support of ``tolerance, contact \nand cooperation between Turks and Armenians.''\n  In their appeal, the laureates call on both Turks and Armenians to \ntake the steps necessary to open the Turkish-Armenian border, generate \nconfidence through civil society cooperation, improve official \ncontacts, and allow basic freedoms. As part of this commitment, the \nlaureates call on Turkey to end all forms of discrimination against \nethnic and religious minorities and abolish Article 301 of the Turkish \nPenal Code. This provision has been used to take legal action against \nthose who speak out about the Armenian genocide, including Nobel \nlaureate Orhan Pamuk and recently murdered Turkish-Armenian journalist \nHrant Dink. There is no question that article 301 contributed to the \ntoxic political environment that led up to Mr. Dink's assassination in \nJanuary.\n  The laureates also note that ``Turks and Armenians have a huge gap in \nperceptions over the Armenian Genocide.'' To address this chasm of \nunderstanding, they call for further study and dissemination of a \nreport prepared by the International Center for Transitional Justice. \nThat impartial analysis of the massacres perpetrated against Armenians \nin the early 20th century concluded that the killings ``can be said to \ninclude all the elements of the crime of genocide . . .'' This finding \nwas corroborated by the International Association of Genocide Scholars, \nwhich issued its own statement in 1997 to reaffirm ``that the mass \nmurder of Armenians in Turkey in 1915 is a case of genocide which \nconforms to the statutes of the United Nations Convention on the \nPrevention and Punishment of Genocide.'' The existence of these \nindependent evaluations of the Armenian genocide and relevant \ninternational law should provide an opportunity for both countries to \naccept the verdict of history and move forward.\n  Mr. President, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has unanimously \npassed S. Res. 65, a resolution echoing many of the sentiments \nexpressed by the laureates and honoring the life of Hrant Dink, a \nleading proponent of Turkish-Armenian reconciliation up until the time \nof his brutal murder. It is my hope that the full Senate will adopt \nthis important measure without further delay.\n  I congratulate the Wiesel Foundation for its work to produce this \nimportant statement and request consent that it be printed in the \nRecord. I hope that the words of these Nobel laureates will encourage \nthe people of both nations to recognize and ultimately transcend the \nlegacy of the Armenian genocide. Once this occurs, I have every \nconfidence that the people of Armenia and Turkey will be able to \nrebuild the ties between their countries and forge a new, enduring \npeace.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   The Elie Wiesel\n\n\n                                      Foundation for Humanity,\n\n                                      New York, NY, April 9, 2007.\n       Dear Friends: We, the undersigned Nobel laureates, issue \n     this appeal directly to the peoples of Turkey and Armenia. \n     Mindful of the sacrifice paid by Hrant Dink, the ethnic \n     Armenian editor of Agos in Turkey, who was assassinated on \n     January 19, 2007, and whose death was mourned by both Turks \n     and Armenians, we believe that the best way to pay tribute to \n     Mr. Dink is through service to his life's work safeguarding \n     freedom of expression and fostering reconciliation between \n     Turks and Armenians.\n\n[[Page S7791]]\n\n       To these ends, Armenians and Turks should encourage their \n     governments to:\n       Open the Turkish-Armenian border. An open border would \n     greatly improve the economic conditions for communities on \n     both sides of the border and enable human interaction, which \n     is essential for mutual understanding. Treaties between the \n     two countries recognize existing borders and call for \n     unhampered travel and trade.\n       Generate confidence through civil society cooperation. \n     Turks and Armenians have been working since 2001 on practical \n     projects that offer great promise in creatively and \n     constructively dealing with shared problems. The governments \n     should support such efforts by, for example, sponsoring \n     academic links between Turkish and Armenian faculty, as well \n     as student exchanges.\n       Improve official contacts. Civil society initiatives would \n     be enhanced by the governments' decision to accelerate their \n     bilateral contacts, devise new frameworks for consultation, \n     and consolidate relations through additional treaty \n     arrangements and full diplomatic relations.\n       Allow basic freedoms. Turkey should end discrimination \n     against ethnic and religious minorities and abolish Article \n     301 of the Penal Code, which makes it a criminal offense to \n     denigrate Turkishness. Armenia also should reverse its own \n     authoritarian course, allow free and fair elections, and \n     respect human rights.\n       Turks and Armenians have a huge gap in perceptions over the \n     Armenian Genocide. To address this gap, we refer to the 2003 \n     ``Legal Analysis on the Applicability of the United Nations \n     Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \n     Genocide to Events which Occurred During the Early Twentieth \n     Century,'' which corroborated findings of the International \n     Association of Genocide Scholars.\n       It concluded that, ``At least some of the [Ottoman] \n     perpetrators knew that the consequences of their actions \n     would be the destruction, in whole or in part, of the \n     Armenians of eastern Anatolia, as such, or acted purposefully \n     towards this goal and, therefore, possessed the requisite \n     genocidal intent. The Events can thus be said to include all \n     the elements of the crime of genocide as defined in the \n     Convention.'' It also concluded that, ``The Genocide \n     Convention contains no provision mandating its retroactive \n     application.''\n       The analysis offers a way forward, which addresses the core \n     concerns of both Armenians and Turks. Of course, coming to \n     terms will be painful and difficult. Progress will not occur \n     right away. Rather than leaving governments to their own \n     devices, affected peoples and the leaders of civil society \n     need to engage in activities that promote understanding and \n     reconciliation while, at the same time, urging their \n     governments to chart a course towards a brighter future.\n           Sincerely,\n       Peter Agre, Nobel Prize, Chemistry (2003).\n       Sidney Altman, Nobel Prize, Chemistry (1989).\n       Philip W.

Dr. Naeem Rahim and \nhis brother Dr. Fahim Rahim, originally from Pakistan, came to \nPocatello, Idaho from New York City in 2005. In less than a year, the \nRahim brothers established a world-class kidney treatment center, the \nIdaho Kidney Institute. Their work has meant improved health and saved \nlives for those suffering from chronic kidney disease, uncontrolled \nhigh blood pressure, postkidney transplant care, internal medicine, \ndiabetes-related kidney problems, anemia and dialysis care. Started in \nPocatello, the institute has offices in Blackfoot and Idaho Falls. The \nRahim brothers have helped people of all ages seeking relief and care \nfor renal diseases, both critical and long-term care.\n  The Rahim brothers have closed a gap in treatment facilities and \nservices for kidney patients in southeast Idaho and, in particular, \nunderstand the need for preventive care. Additionally, they have a \nreputation for delivering their medical expertise with an astute sense \nof care and concern for their patients. Their outstanding work was \nbrought to my attention by a family who had sought care for an ill \nrelative, literally, across the Nation, with limited success. Upon \nlearning of the Idaho Kidney Institute, they sought treatment there, \nand met with overwhelming success. It is good to know that Idahoans \nhave access to such exceptional medical expertise, right at home.\n  Idaho has many gems; Doctors Fahim and Naeem Rahim are two such \ngems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/15/senate-section/article/S7791-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7791-S7792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING WEBSTER P. PHILLIPS\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, Senator Grassley and I \nrecognize Webster Phillips, a distinguished executive at the Social \nSecurity Administration. Web is Associate Commissioner for Legislative \nDevelopment. He is a dedicated public servant who has served his \ncountry for more than 30 years.\n  A native of Illinois, Web served in the U.S. Army in Vietnam. He \nbegan his career at Social Security in the local office in Alton, IL, \nas a claims representative. In 1980, he became an operations supervisor \nin the Rock Island, IL, Social Security office. In 1983, Web was \nselected as a management intern and completed a series of developmental \nassignments in the Chicago regional office and in SSA headquarters in \nBaltimore. In 1987, Web joined the staff of the Office of Legislation \nand Congressional Affairs, and has worked in a variety of assignments \nsince that time.\n  Senator Grassley and I met Web in 1991, when he was assigned to the \nSenate Committee on Finance while participating in the LEGIS-Fellows \nprogram. In 1993, Web returned to the Finance Committee where he \nparticipated in the development of the legislation enacted by the \nCongress in 1994 that established SSA as an independent\n\n[[Page S7792]]\n\nagency. Since 1995, Web has been assigned to SSA's Legislative Affairs \nOffice in Washington. He was selected to serve in his current position \nas Associate Commissioner of Legislative Development in February 1999.\n  The staff of the Finance Committee has had the pleasure of working \nwith Web on many issues relating to Social Security during his tenure \nat SSA. He has always been resourceful, insightful, and forthcoming.\n  Web will retire from the Social Security Administration on July 3, \n2007. He will be sorely missed by his colleagues and his many friends \non the Hill. He will leave behind the numerous individuals he has \nmentored and encouraged over the years and who will now carry on this \nwork.\n  Both Senator Grassley and I feel that it is important that we in \nCongress recognize the many women and men who devote their working \nlives to improving the lives of others. Career civil servants often do \ntheir work in quiet anonymity behind the scenes providing vital service \nto the American people. They are rarely recognized for their many \ncontributions. Webster Phillips is one of those people. His record of \nleadership at the Social Security Administration and his commitment to \nproviding the American people with effective and compassionate service \nis a record of which he can be justly proud.\n  Senator Grassley and I wish Web all the best in his retirement from \nFederal service and thank him for his many years of dedicated \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/15/senate-section/article/S7792-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. BYRD:\n       S. 1633.

A bill to adjust the salaries of Federal justices and \njudges, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Federal \nJudicial Salary Restoration Act of 2007. Since 1969, the salaries of \nFederal judges have significantly declined when adjusted for inflation. \nThis bill would demonstrate our respect and appreciation for our \nhardworking Federal judges by authorizing an immediate and substantial \nincrease in judicial salaries. Our bill recognizes the important \nconstitutional role judges play in administering justice, interpreting \nour laws, and providing the ultimate check and balance in our system of \ngovernment. It is time Congress treated the Federal judiciary with the \nrespect that a co-equal branch of government deserves.\n  Eight years ago, in 1999, the President's salary was doubled to \n$400,000 a year. We are not proposing to increase judges' salaries by \n100 percent, but by half that, by 50 percent. The increase is an \nimportant step in ensuring the independence of the judiciary. Judicial \nindependence is critical for preserving our system of government and \nprotecting the rights of all Americans. Surely we can do half as much \nfor the judicial branch of Government as we did for the executive \nbranch 8 years ago.\n  For too long, judicial salaries have failed even to keep up with \ninflation while public and private sector salaries have surged ahead. \nAccording to information provided by the Administrative Office of the \nUnited States Courts, judicial salaries have declined by nearly 25 \npercent in real terms since 1969. During the same time, private sector \nsalaries have increased by more than 15 percent. In 1969, a Federal \ndistrict court judge earned 20 percent more than a law school dean and \nabout 30 percent more than a senior law professor at a top law school. \nBy contrast, today top law school deans make twice as much as district \ncourt judges, and senior law professors at those schools make nearly 50 \npercent more. Many recent law school graduates will make more in their \nstarting salary at a private law firm than we pay to an experienced \ndistrict court judge. Those in the executive branch have enjoyed \nperiodic raises that have taken their salaries well above those of \njudges. For example, SEC trial attorneys now make up to $180,330, which \nis significantly higher than the annual salary of our Federal trial \njudges.\n  In addition, the workload for Federal judges has increased \ndramatically. Since 1960, the caseload for district court judges has \nclimbed by almost 60 percent and the caseload of circuit court judges \nhas jumped more than 200 percent. Judges who are working to preserve \nthe rule of law in America and to make equal justice a reality should \nbe respected, and their labor should be compensated.\n  Paul Volcker, the chair of the National Commission on the Public \nService, recently noted in The Wall Street Journal that congressional \ninaction on judicial pay could erode the high professional standards \nand independence of the Judiciary. Chief Justice Rehnquist repeatedly \ncalled for an increase in judicial pay, warning that ``[i)nadequate \ncompensation seriously compromises the judicial independence fostered \nby life tenure'' and that ``. . . low salaries might force judges to \nreturn to the private sector rather than stay on the bench.'' Chief \nJustice Roberts pointed to an increasing trend in early retirement in \nhis last ``Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary,'' noting that many \nof those retired judges have gone to work in the private sector. \nJustice Anthony Kennedy testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nin February about similar threats to judicial independence.\n  This bill addresses these concerns by granting a raise for all \nFederal judges. This bipartisan legislation has broad support. \nPresident Bush supports a significant pay raise for judges, as does the \nAmerican Bar Association, as do the deans of 130 of the Nation's top \nlaw schools, civil rights groups, and others.\n  One of the first bills we passed in the Senate this year, S. 197, \nauthorized cost-of-living adjustments for the salaries of United States \njudges. Senators Specter, Feinstein and Cornyn joined me in \ncosponsoring this bill. Unfortunately, that bill has failed to move \nthrough the House of Representatives. Too often during the last several \nyears our Federal judges have not been given a standard cost-of-living \nraise. That, too, has contributed to the diminution in their real \ncompensation.\n  Our democracy and the rights we enjoy depend on a strong and \nindependent) judiciary. During the last few years it has been the \ncourts that have acted to protect our liberties and our Constitution. \nThe independence of the judiciary is compromised, however, if judges \nleave the bench for financial reasons. The quality of the judiciary is \nthreatened if judges' salaries are inadequate to attract and retain our \nbest legal minds. Given the essential role that the judiciary plays in \nour system of government, we should pass this raise to judicial \nsalaries.\n  I thank my Judiciary Committee colleagues, Senator Hatch, Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Cornyn for agreeing to join me in introducing \nthis bill. I also thank Majority Leader Reid, as well as Minority \nLeader McConnell, for their support of this legislation and their \ncommitment to the Federal judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/15/senate-section/article/S7793-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7793-S7794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1610.

ABRUPT CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Program.--The Secretary of Commerce \n     shall establish within the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration, and shall carry out, a program of scientific \n     research on abrupt climate change.\n       (b) Purposes of Program.--The purposes of the program are \n     as follows:\n       (1) To develop a global array of terrestrial and \n     oceanographic indicators of paleoclimate in order to \n     sufficiently identify and describe past instances of abrupt \n     climate change.\n       (2) To improve understanding of thresholds and \n     nonlinearities in geophysical systems related to the \n     mechanisms of abrupt climate change.\n       (3) To incorporate such mechanisms into advanced \n     geophysical models of climate change.\n       (4) To test the output of such models against an improved \n     global array of records of past abrupt climate changes.\n       (c) Abrupt Climate Change Defined.--In this section, the \n     term ``abrupt climate change'' means a change in the climate \n     that occurs so rapidly or unexpectedly that human or natural \n     systems have difficulty adapting to the climate as changed.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Department of Commerce for each of \n     fiscal years 2009 through 2014, to remain available until \n     expended, $10,000,000 to carry out the research program \n     required under this section.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to propose an amendment that \nwould authorize funding for abrupt climate change research. I am very \npleased to be joined on this amendment by Senator Cantwell, Senator \nSnowe, and Senator Murray. Our amendment would authorize $10 million \nper year for the next 6 years for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, in partnership with universities across the \nNation to conduct research into abrupt climate change.\n  I recognize the Senate has reached no consensus with regard to how \nbest to respond to climate change. Nevertheless, I believe there is one \nissue on\n\n[[Page S7799]]\n\nwhich we can agree, and that is the need for a great deal more \nscientific research in order to better understand the potential risk of \nabrupt climate change.\n  Understanding and predicting climate changes are enormous scientific \nchallenges. The challenges are made even more difficult with the \nrecognition that the climate system is capable of dramatic and abrupt \nchanges. Scientists have determined that past global temperatures have \nswung as much as 20 degrees Fahrenheit within a decade, accompanied by \ndrought in some places and catastrophic floods in others.\n  An abrupt climate change triggered by the ongoing buildup of \ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere would also likely result in the \nredistribution of atmospheric moisture and rainfall, with substantial \nimpact for the world's food supply.\n  Unfortunately, we have no satisfactory understanding of what triggers \nabrupt climate change. Both the National Academy of Sciences and the \nadministration's Strategic Climate Change Science Plan identify abrupt \nclimate change as the key priority for additional research. The \nNational Academy has stated that:\n\n       Large, abrupt climate changes have repeatedly affected much \n     or all of the earth.\n\n  The academy went on to state that:\n\n       Abrupt climate changes are not only possible but likely in \n     the future, potentially with large impacts on ecosystems and \n     societies.\n\n  The academy noted we are not doing nearly enough to identify even the \nthreat of abrupt climate change. The amendment the four of us are \nproposing would lay the framework and provide the funds for the United \nStates to better understand and address abrupt climate change. One \nreason this funding is so urgent is we are rapidly losing one of the \ngreatest sources of information, and that is ice cores from glaciers.\n  The University of Maine's Climate Change Institute has one of the \nbest known and best regarded abrupt climate change research programs in \nthe entire world, I am proud to say. The Climate Change Institute uses \nice cores from glaciers and ice sheets around the world to make \ndiscoveries that change the way we think about climate change.\n  Unfortunately, numerous glaciers around the world are melting. When \nthey go, the very record that has given us so much of this critical \nclimate history will also be lost. I have had several terrific \nopportunities to see for myself how scientists are able to use glaciers \nand ice sheets to better understand climate change. Last year, I joined \nSenators McCain and Sununu in traveling to Antarctica to see \ngroundbreaking research taking place on ice more than 2 miles deep at \nthe South Pole. Along the way, we toured some of the University of \nMaine's research sites in New Zealand with distinguished university \nprofessor George Denton. He was the first scientist from the University \nof Maine to be elected to the National Academy of Scientists.\n  According to Professor Denton, 50 percent of the glaciers in New \nZealand have melted since 1860, and this melting is unprecedented in \nthe last 5,000 years. We stood with the professor on sites that had \nbeen buried by massive glaciers at the beginning of the 20th century, \nbut now they are ice free. It was remarkable to see this firsthand.\n  Two years ago, I traveled with a group of Senators to the \nnorthernmost community in the world, Ny-Alesund, in Norway. The \nscientists we met told us that global climate change is occurring more \nrapidly now than at any time since the beginning of civilization. They \nfurther stated that the region of the globe changing most rapidly is \nthe Arctic. In fact, the Arctic, in many ways, is the proverbial canary \nin the coal mine when it comes to climate change. The changes are \nremarkable and disturbing.\n  In the last 30 years, the Arctic has lost sea ice cover over an area \n10 times as large as the entire State of Maine. In the summer, the \nchange has been even more dramatic with twice as much ice loss. The ice \nthat remains is as much as 40 percent thinner than it was only a few \ndecades ago.\n  Senator McCain and others and I witnessed massive blocks of ice \nfalling off glaciers that have already retreated well back from the \nshores against which they once rested. The melting of glaciers and sea \nice, the thawing of the permafrost, the increase in sea levels \nresulting from warming, are already beginning to cause environmental, \nsocial, and economic changes.\n  In Barrow, AK, for example, we met with native people who told us \nthey are seeing insects they have never seen that far north before. \nThey told us the salmon run has changed. We saw telephone poles that \nwere tilted over because, for the first time, the permafrost is \nthawing. The changes were very evident and they are very troubling in \nmany cases. If these changes were to be compounded by an abrupt climate \nchange on the scale seen in our history, the result could be \ndevastating.\n  The amendment I am proposing has passed the Senate twice before, as \npart of the 2001 and the 2003 Energy bills, and was initially included \nin the managers' package this year. I hope this is the year we finally \npass this important provision into law.\n  We need to act now. We need to authorize this funding so we can gain \na better understanding of the possibility of abrupt climate change \ncausing enormous and relatively rapid changes in our climate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/15/senate-section/article/S7799-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JUNE 18, 2007, at 2 p.m.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.
