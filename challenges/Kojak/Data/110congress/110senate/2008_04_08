Mr. President, as we speak, there are extremely important \nhearings taking place on Capitol Hill. General Petraeus and Ambassador \nCrocker are here. The hearings started 35 minutes ago. Clearly, the \neyes of the world will look upon the Senate as General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker testify today before the Armed Services Committee \nand the Foreign Relations Committee. These two committees are chaired \nby two of our most senior Senators and two of our most able Senators, \nSenator Levin and Senator Biden.\n  The appearances of these good and honorable men, General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker, are meant to create an open, honest, and productive \ndialogue with Congress on the state of the war in Iraq and the future \nof military operations in Iraq. I hope it does occur in that manner, \nthat there will be an open and honest and productive dialogue with us. \nAs the American people weigh the testimony and consider the best course \nof action in far-off Iraq, only two questions matter: First, has the \ntroop surge brought us closer to the day when our troops can come home? \nSecond, is the war in Iraq making America safer? Sadly, by all \naccounts, the answer to both questions is no.\n  The stated purpose of the surge, according to President Bush, was \n``return on success,'' meaning that if the surge worked, the troops \ncould come home. Now, the President claims success, but where is the \nreturn? It is clear to anyone that the violence has surged. Eleven \nAmericans have been killed since Sunday in Iraq. Dozens and dozens more \nhave been gravely wounded, including three dozen in one rocket attack. \nAttacks on the Green Zone have intensified. That is supposed to be the \nsafest part of Iraq--the Green Zone. The conflict between al-Sadr and \nal-Maliki shows no signs of progress; in fact, there is deterioration. \nHas the surge brought us closer to the day when our troops come home? \nWe have already heard General Petraeus has requested a freeze of troop \nlevels and that President Bush is likely to accept that request.\n  Has the surge brought us closer to the day when our troops come home? \nClearly, the answer is no. Has the war made us safer? No.\n  Military experts agree our Armed Forces are stretched thin beyond \nsustainable levels. We are taking in--13 percent of our recruits are \nyoung men and women who have committed crimes: felonies, violent \ncrime--13 percent. One out of every eight of the people we are bringing \ninto the military\n\n[[Page S2710]]\n\ntoday are people who have criminal records.\n  Because our manpower and equipment is in Iraq, we are not committing \nthe resources to hunt down our No. 1 enemy: bin Laden and his al-Qaida \nnetwork. Because we are bogged down in Iraq, we are not fully engaged \nin the global challenge of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and the Middle \nEast, among others.\n  The moral authority of our great Nation has suffered grave damage, \nwith our former allies refusing to stand with us in even greater \nnumbers.\n  Has the war in Iraq made America safer? There is no question it has \nnot.\n  The surge may have provided a temporary window for the Iraq \nGovernment to make progress, but it is becoming increasingly clear \nevery day the Iraq Government has squandered that opportunity. Even \nnow, with the war in its sixth year, President Bush has failed to \narticulate an exit strategy.\n  A person running for President, Senator McCain, has said we should be \nthere another 50 or 100 years.\n  President Bush likes to say we will only leave Iraq once victory has \nbeen achieved. It is time for the President to be honest with the \nAmerican people. What does victory look like to President Bush? How \ndoes all this end?\n  We must not commit our courageous troops to the endless task of \npolicing another Nation's bloody civil war. The job of America's Armed \nForces--a job to which they risk and often give their lives and limbs--\nis to protect our country and its interests. It is time to recommit to \nthat crucial purpose and begin a responsible end to this war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/08/senate-section/article/S2710-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I know the main event isn't housing, \nbut I would like to start by thanking the majority leader once again \nfor realizing the only way to address the housing crisis was to do so \non a bipartisan basis, and we are on the verge of doing that. We have \nnow made significant progress, and I am confident that before the week \nis out, we will be able to stand together to announce completion of a \ngood and responsible bill.\n  Most homeowners will be relieved to know one of the earlier proposals \nwe heard from the other side--a proposal to let bankruptcy judges \nrewrite the terms of existing mortgages--will not be a part of the \nSenate's final product. Although well intentioned, this proposal would \nhave led to a sharp increase in mortgage rates for millions of \nhomeowners, and Republicans weren't going to allow that at a time when \nfamilies are already stretched quite thin.\n  The final bill will help neighborhoods that have been hit hard by \nforeclosure with provisions that limit the amount of time empty homes \nsit on the market--a proposal by Senator Isakson. This, along with the \neconomic growth package we passed earlier this year, will put more \nmoney in the pockets of homeowners, and it will help homebuilders climb \nback from the slowdown.\n  Americans don't want to bail out the speculators and those who tried \nto game the system at everyone else's expense, so this is a targeted \nbill that will help homeowners in the short term without jeopardizing \nthe long-term economy. Its likely passage later this week is something \nwe can be proud of on both sides of the aisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/08/senate-section/article/S2710-5", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2710-S2711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRAQ WAR TESTIMONY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, to the testimony on the Iraq war in committees \ntoday. General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will be here, as we all \nknow. This is an eagerly anticipated update on political and military \nprogress being made in Iraq.\n  Less than a year after our counterinsurgency plan went into full \neffect, we have been getting a steady flow of positive reports on the \nsecurity situation in Iraq. Overall violence in Iraq is down. Civilian \ndeaths are down. Sectarian killing is down. Attacks on American forces \nare down. As a result, thousands of U.S. troops have already begun to \ncome back home.\n  Another measure of the Petraeus plan's success is the dramatic \nincrease in Iraqi security forces since the full implementation of the \ncounterinsurgency strategy last June. Between December 2007 and last \nmonth, Iraqi security forces have increased by more than 40,000, \nbringing the total number to more than 530,000. This includes 141,000 \nassigned soldiers and officers and a police force of 347,000 strong. \nOver the last year, the so-called surge of Iraqi security forces has \nbeen three or four times larger than our own surge. As we stand here, \nthe Iraqi security forces continue to expand, with young Iraqis signing \nup for local police forces to protect the border and for special \noperations.\n  As the Iraqis take over more of their own security needs, Congress \ncan help by passing a supplemental appropriations bill that has been on \nrequest for more than a year. These funds are also needed to ensure the \ncombat readiness of the force and our forces over in Afghanistan as \nwell.\n  Increased security in Iraq has led to political progress in Iraq. \nAlthough significant benchmarks remain unmet, progress on other \nsignificant benchmarks that seemed far off a few months ago is now \nunderway. These include such things as passage and approval of \ndebaathification legislation, an amnesty law, and measures leading to \ngreater centralization of the Iraqi security forces. It is also worth \nnoting the Iraq Government has started to meet more of its own \nexpenses, including three-fourths of the costs of its security forces \nand a new jobs program.\n  The success of General Petraeus's strategy is the best reason we have \nfor listening closely to his advice as we move forward. Last August, he \nsaid security and local political progress will enable us to reduce the \nnumber of U.S. troops to presurge levels, and we have reason to hope \nthe progress that has been made, both politically and in security, \nwill, in fact, lead to a reduction in troop levels.\n  But General Petraeus has a better grasp than most on whether the \ngains we have seen are secure enough for a full reduction to begin. For \nthe sake of our long-term security, we should listen very closely to \nwhat he has to say.\n  When Democrats on the campaign trail tout their plans for Iraq and \nAfghanistan, they often cite the need to listen to the generals. The \njunior Senator from New York likes to say one of her first actions as \nPresident would be to convene the Joint Chiefs of Staff to help her \ndraw up a plan for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. If military \nadvice is needed to draw up plans for withdrawal, shouldn't it be \nimportant to draw up plans for success?\n  Our friends on the other side are rightly concerned about military \nreadiness. I share their concern. But the best way to ensure the \nmilitary's readiness is not to scrap a plan that has been working in \nIraq. The best way to improve readiness is to approve the Defense \nsupplemental without arbitrary dates for withdrawal and to fully fund \nthe 2009 Defense appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S2711]]\n\n  As most Americans, I am eager to hear what General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker have to say about the military and political \nprogress in Iraq. These men have spent literally decades mastering \ntheir respective professional fields. They deserve our respect, and \nover the last year they have earned our admiration. I know we will all \nwelcome them and give them the fair hearing they have earned and that \nthis all-important mission certainly deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Hake\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, having returned a few days ago from my \n14th trip in the area, I think it is particularly meaningful to \nremember the life and sacrifice of a remarkable young man, Army Staff \nSergeant Christopher Hake. Chris died on the 23rd of March, 2008, of \ninjuries he sustained when an IED detonated near his Bradley fighting \nvehicle in Baghdad, Iraq.\n  Chris grew up in Enid, OK, with two sisters, Shannon and Keri, and \ntwo brothers, Zachary and Skylar. I was in Enid yesterday. I looked \naround and I could see the area, the type of place where Chris grew up. \nHe spent his time, as most Oklahoma boys did, attending school, playing \nball, driving his car, spending time with family and friends, and going \nto church. His strong faith in Jesus matured during his time at \nOklahoma Bible Academy. While there, he became very involved in his \nyouth group and traveled to Mexico on a mission trip. Unsure of what he \nwanted to do after graduating from Oklahoma Bible Academy, Chris \nenlisted in the Army in 2000.\n  Chris excelled during basic training in Fort Benning and was selected \nto serve as a member of the ``Old Guard''--one of the oldest and most \nrespected infantry regiments in the U.S. Army. As a member of the Old \nGuard, Chris was responsible for guarding the Tomb of the Unknowns at \nArlington National Cemetery and escorting deceased Army servicemembers \nto their final rest in the ``Garden of Stone,'' as Arlington is \nsometimes called. While serving in the Old Guard unit, the Pentagon was \nattacked on September 11. Chris was immediately called upon to clear \nthe Pentagon after the attack. This solidified Chris's commitment to \nthe fight for freedom in the world and to protect the people of \nAmerica. He saw that opportunity in Iraq.\n  In 2004, Chris transferred to the 4th Battalion, 64th Armor Regiment, \n4th Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, GA. \nWhile home during the summer of 2004, he met Kelli Short and it was \nlove at first sight. They married on 21 December 2004, and Chris \ndeployed on his first Iraq tour in January.\n  Chris was disillusioned after his first tour, feeling many of the \ndecisions being made back in DC were negatively impacting their ability \nto accomplish the mission. I know this is true because I talked to the \ntroops when I was over there on the 14 trips I have made. As we speak, \nin the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Petraeus is telling us \nthe truth about what is happening over there.\n  Chris returned to Fort Stewart after his year in Iraq, and on October \n14, 2006, Kelli gave birth to Gage Christopher Michael Hake.\n  Chris was both a loving husband and a proud father. His focus and \nlove was his family--spending time with them, playing games with them, \nsitting for hours just to be with them, working on their house \ntogether.\n  Chris returned to Iraq on his second tour in October of 2007. He \nfought back his emotions as he said goodbye to his 1-year-old son, but \nhe knew what he had to do and why. He loved serving his country. Once \nin Iraq again, Chris saw a difference in the mission and what was \nhappening with the Iraqi people.\n  During his second tour, Chris said he knew he should be there and \ntalked of the love of the Iraqi people for him and the troops. Pete \nHake, Chris's father, remembered him saying: ``You couldn't pay me to \ncome home early.'' That is the kind of dedication Chris and so many \nothers have.\n  On Easter Sunday, March 23, 2008, Chris Hake tragically died of \ninjuries he sustained when an IED detonated near his vehicle in \nBaghdad. Three other soldiers of his battalion and under his command \nwere killed alongside Chris. Chris's father recounted that Chris had \nsaid, ``They would die for each other,'' and they did. They gave the \nultimate sacrifice in serving their country.\n  In a recent e-mail to his mom and dad, he said he wanted to dedicate \nhis second tour in Iraq to becoming a closer follower of Jesus. Chris \nwrote:\n\n       If anything were to happen to me, Gage would always be able \n     to know that his father died so he could live in peace. I \n     know Jesus did the same for me, so it is comforting. I don't \n     have a nervous bone in my body this time. I am more at peace \n     than I have been my whole life.\n\n  On March 31, Chris returned to Oklahoma and was greeted by an honor \nguard from Fort Sill, members of the Patriot Guard Riders motorcycle \ngroup, Airmen from Vance Air Force Base, and a mass of fellow \nOklahomans to honor this American hero. It was obvious he held the \nrespect of so many, and he was a beloved son, father, and husband.\n  I read through some of the comments written in Chris's online guest \nbook, and I would like to share a few of these with you:\n\n       Thank you for your sacrifice--my children will know what \n     men like you have done for them.\n       I am the mom of a soldier serving in Iraq and just wanted \n     to tell you how proud I am of your son, husband, and daddy.\n       Know that 1st Squad will always maintain and exceed the \n     standards you have set. We miss you.\n       I read through all of the entries and cried. I hope it is \n     comforting to know that there are so many of us praying for \n     you.\n       John 15:13--Greater love has no one than this, that he lay \n     down his life for his friends.\n       The ``Spartans'' will keep you close to our hearts forever \n     in time.\n       Thank you for being my son. Thank you for Gage, a little \n     copy of you. Thank you for fighting and making a stand. \n     Goodbye, my son, my baby boy, my U.S. soldier, my pride and \n     joy.\n\n  Today, we remember Staff Sergeant Chris Hake, a young man who loved \nhis\n\n[[Page S2712]]\n\nfamily and loved his country. Chris was doing the Lord's work, and the \nLord is richly blessing him now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, first, I wish to associate myself with \nthe thoughtful and special remarks of Senator Inhofe, a member of the \nArmed Services Committee. He is a champion of our young men and women \nin uniform. I thank him for his comments on behalf of another brave \npatriot who paid the ultimate sacrifice and his tribute to one of \nAmerica's heroes from Oklahoma. Thank you, Senator, for the job you do, \nthank you for your tribute to this young man's life and sacrifice.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Roberts are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to talk \nabout a very special person on my staff. Bill Kamela came on to head my \nHELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workforce Safety about 5 years ago. \nEver since then, he has been a critical part of my staff.\n  Bill is a trusted adviser, and I think what impresses all of us the \nmost is he truly is a visionary when it comes to making the Federal \nGovernment a strong partner in worker training and safety.\n  Thanks to the work of Bill Kamela, across the country today, fewer \nemployees have to worry about the danger of hazards or unsafe working \nconditions that they go to work every day and see. Because of his good \nwork and insistence, more workers today get access to good-paying jobs, \ntraining, and advancement.\n  I come to the floor today because Bill is now preparing to move on to \nthe next phase of his career. While we are all in my office very happy \nfor him, we are all extremely sad to see him go. I wanted to come to \nthe floor today to take just a couple minutes to recognize Bill's \ntremendous contribution on behalf of working families throughout the \nentire country.\n  Bill grew up in Buffalo, NY, where he learned the value of hard work \nand public service. Although he left Buffalo for Washington, DC, many \nyears ago, anyone who has spent time with him knows that his passions \nare all things Buffalo, especially his beloved Buffalo Bills. We know \nwhen it comes to them, they take precedence over anything else that is \ngoing on.\n  Anyone who has worked with Bill also knows that he took to heart \nthose lessons he learned growing up there about the importance of \npublic service. Bill has dedicated his life and his career to helping \nkids and young people and families everywhere find success. He has \nworked with the National Urban Coalition, in the office of Congressman \nGus Hawkins, at the National Safe Kids Campaign, and with a number of \nnonprofits. In every one of those positions, he has worked behind the \nscenes for policies that keep our working families strong.\n  Before he came to my staff, Bill spent 6 years at the Department of \nLabor under President Clinton where he served as chief of staff for the \nEmployment and Training Administration. When he worked at the Labor \nDepartment, one of his responsibilities was to implement the Workforce \nInvestment Act, which is, as we all know, the cornerstone of our \nnational job training system.\n  Since coming to my staff, he has worked diligently on WIA, and thanks \nto him workers today have access to the training they need so they can \nstill be successful in life no matter what happens to them.\n  Bill has been the staff director for my Employment and Workforce \nSafety Subcommittee. His dedication to those working families, as well \nas his passion for public service, has made it possible for us to make \nprogress on the key piece of legislation to which he has devoted so \nmany years, the Workforce Investment Act.\n  What impresses many of us in the Senate is that he works across the \naisle, and he brings people of all kinds to the table to get things \ndone. He has worked tirelessly, as I said, to fund and strengthen WIA \nand other job training programs to help workers find and keep good-\npaying jobs.\n  He also worked extremely hard and impressively on the Miner Act, \nwhich improved safety and ensured coal miners have better access to \nlifesaving equipment, air, and water in case of an accident.\n  But I think one of the things I will remember Bill the most for is \nhis work on helping us to pass in the Senate the Ban Asbestos in \nAmerica Act. He sat with me in countless meetings. He talked to so many \nfamilies. He held the hands of widows whose spouses had died as a \nresult of their exposure to asbestos. And he brought so many people to \nthe table and diligently worked detail after detail after detail until \nwe could bring up this bill in the Senate and, after many years, \nfinally pass it. I owe him a debt of gratitude for that, and I want him \nto know as he leaves my office we are going to keep working under his \nname to get that bill done and to the President so those people he has \nworked with can finally see this bill become law.\n  I have to say again he has been instrumental in our efforts to make \nthe Federal Government a strong partner. He brings together educators, \nworkforce folks, labor, and employers because he knows everyone needs a \nseat at the table so our workforce can compete in this global economy.\n  But his contributions go far beyond legislation. Outside of my \noffice, his attention to building personal relationships has earned him \ntremendous respect and admiration of workforce leaders across my State. \nInside my office, he has earned all of our respect. He is a mentor to \nall of his coworkers. He has never been one to close the door behind \nhim. He is always generous with his time, and he has helped bring up \nthe next generation of staffers who rely on him so much for his sound \nadvice or a good pep talk, whichever they need.\n  Bill has an uncanny knack for keeping everything balanced on staff. \nHe sets realistic expectations, but he does not ever let anyone get \ndiscouraged. I know that will carry him far in this world.\n  So I come to the floor today to thank Bill for his work and for his \ndedication to our country, and I thank him for his personal advice so \nmany times, his enthusiasm, and his passion for working families in my \nState and across the country. I wish him the best as he moves on. He \nwill be dearly missed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/08/senate-section/article/S2712-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2712-S2715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COLOMBIAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, at the conclusion of my remarks, I will \nyield to Senator Stabenow of Michigan who will also talk about trade \nadjustment assistance in Michigan and Ohio and all that our States are \ngoing through in large part because of misdirected trade policies.\n  Yesterday, President Bush announced he would send a proposed \nColombian Free Trade Agreement to Congress for a vote. He does this \nover the opposition of the Democratic leadership in the House and in \nthe Senate, in defiance of our desire to work on a bipartisan basis, \nand in direct opposition to the desires of a growing number of Ohioans \nand Michiganders and Americans all over this country. In doing so, \nPresident Bush has nailed shut the fast-track coffin.\n  As my colleagues know, this agreement was negotiated under the so-\ncalled fast-track provisions. It is an extraordinary procedure provided \nonly for trade agreements, not for any other kind of legislation. Trade \nis that special and that important to a very narrow but very powerful, \nvery influential group of people in this country. Congress decided \nyears ago to delegate an enormous amount of power to the executive \nbranch to negotiate trade agreements. In nothing else does this body, \ncharged under the Constitution with specific duties and \nresponsibilities, give that much power to the executive branch as it \ndoes with these trade agreements.\n  Under the fast-track provisions, once presented to Congress, a so-\ncalled free-trade agreement triggers a 90-day clock for consideration \nof the agreement. No\n\n[[Page S2713]]\n\namendments can be offered to improve it, unlike anything else here. \nCongress is given a take-it-or-leave-it decision.\n  Much of the talk about this agreement centers around the violence and \nimpunity in Colombia, especially as it relates to trade unionists, and \nfor good reason.\n  International organizations and human rights groups look at \nColombia's record with urgency and alarm. Human rights defenders, trade \nunionists, and community leaders in Colombia are today receiving death \nthreats from the rearmed paramilitary group, known as the Black Eagles, \nand are reeling from a new wave of violence.\n  This leaflet blown up, of course, was distributed at a March 6 rally \nin Colombia. The beginning says: Death to the leaders who march for \npeace and justice. This was a peace and justice rally. The Black Eagles \nhanded out this leaflet to state their point of view, if you will. \nBefore, during, and after this countrywide rally on March 6 against \nparamilitary and all forms of violence, at least two march organizers \nwere killed.\n  Union leaders Carlos Burbano and Carmen Cecilia Carvajal were killed \nfor trying to voice their views. At least three other leaders were \nkilled in events also associated with the march. March organizers all \nover the country received death threats such as these. One organizer's \nhouse was attacked with gunfire a week before the rally on February 29.\n  These human rights issues are exceedingly serious. Yet the \nadministration cavalierly casts them aside, barely acknowledging the \nculture of violence and impunity.\n  Just the merits of the Colombian Free Trade Agreement is another \nfundamentally flawed trade pact in the long line of trade agreements \nsuch as NAFTA and CAFTA, in the long line of bad trade policies such as \nPNTR with China. If these are really ``free'' trade agreements, if it \ndid what its supporters tell us, simply knocking down trade agreements, \nit would be a smaller document. It would be a couple of pages, just \ngetting rid of tariffs. Instead, it is many more pages, such as NAFTA. \nNAFTA was 900 pages of rules and regulations, having little to do with \ntrade because instead of simply eliminating tariffs, which we would \nlike to do, these agreements are packed with rules on investment, \nservices, procurement, telecommunications, drug patents, and more.\n  So why do we get thousands of pages of seemingly nontrade issues in a \ntrade agreement? Because these trade agreements are rules to protect \ncorporations, not rules to protect workers. These trade agreements are \nrules to protect the drug companies, not to protect the environment; \nrules to protect hedge funds, not rules to protect consumers; rules to \nprotect Wall Street, not rules to protect Main Street.\n  Notice the word ``protect.'' They--the editorial writers, the Harvard \neconomists, the CEOs, the Wall Street bankers, the corporate lobbyists, \nthe big-time lawyers, the hedge fund managers--try to label people such \nas us ``protectionists.'' I guess it depends on whom, Mr. President, \nyou want to protect.\n  NAFTA, CAFTA, and Colombia protect the drug companies and the \ninvestment banks. They protect the corporate interests. Theirs is sort \nof a high-class protectionism. But protecting labor, protecting \nconsumers, that is not protectionist. That is the duty of Government.\n  Many in this Chamber will recall the debate on the Central American \nFree Trade Agreement. We had a coalition of religious people, consumer \nadvocates, environmentalists, small business, medium-size \nmanufacturers, and organized labor in opposition to CAFTA. CAFTA's \nproponents said if it did not pass, poverty would get worse in Central \nAmerica. CAFTA, they promised, would promote economic growth and curb \nthe violence in Central America and would serve as a model for \nstrengthening democracy.\n  The U.S. Trade Representative, Mr. Zoellick, said ``if CAFTA \nstumbles, labor rights in Central America will not be strengthened,'' \nas if anybody in this administration really wanted to strengthen labor \nrights. The reality is that there have been disturbing developments in \nthe region, including the recent passage by the Honduran Government of \na law to create exception zones that will allow foreign factories to \npay less than the national minimum wage.\n  How does that help Honduran workers that there is a zone in which \nthey pay a subminimum wage?\n  Labor ministries in Central American countries still lack the \nstaffing and the resources to implement their programs. In many cases, \nbudgets have actually been reduced since the passage of the Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement.\n  Consistent with its history of repeating the same act and expecting \ndifferent results, the administration now wants Congress to approve a \ndeal with Colombia, a country where there are increased and continued \ndeath threats against labor activists, followed by assassinations of \nlabor activists, followed by nothing, followed by no prosecution, no \nattempts to find the killers, continued excuses from President Uribe, \nand continued excuses from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative and, frankly, yesterday, President Bush himself.\n  The administration has shown no willingness to enforce labor and \nenvironmental rules at home, so it is hardly surprising it would ignore \nviolations among our trading partners.\n  There have been well-documented abuses of sweatshops in Jordan, \ndespite the supposedly better labor standards in that agreement. \nJordan, to its credit, has taken steps to crack down on these companies \nand work with nongovernmental organizations and others in promoting the \nstandards intended in that agreement.\n  It is important to note that the Bush administration, however, did \nnot use the enforcement tools available to it in that trade agreement \nto require labor compliance. So why do we think they will use the \nprovisions in this trade agreement, the Colombian Free Trade Agreement, \nto require labor compliance? Of course, they won't. But when there is a \ncommercial dispute or a drug patent dispute, the administration comes \ndown on a country with all the fury it can muster. Protect the drug \ncompanies? The administration says yes. Protect workers? No thanks. \nProtect oil interests? The administration says, of course. Protect the \nenvironment? The administration says, no thanks. Protect the banks and \nthe financial institutions? The administration says: Where do I sign \nup? Protect food safety for our children, protect toys for our \nchildren, food safety for our families? The administration is not \nparticularly interested.\n  Why then should we consider a trade agreement with a country such as \nColombia which is known as the most dangerous country in the world to \nbe a union activist? In fact, Colombia has an unbroken record in recent \ndecades of leading the world in trade unionist killings. Violence \nagainst unionists continues at extremely high levels. The vast majority \nof trade union assassinations remains unsolved.\n  Preliminary figures show that between 12 and 17 trade unionists were \nkilled in the first 3 months of 2008. Among those murdered was Carmen \nRamirez, a teacher and member of the teachers union. She was killed on \nher way to work on March 4.\n  Gomez Rozo Leonidas, the director of the National Union of Bank \nWorkers, disappeared on March 5 and was found dead 3 days later.\n  A subunit of the attorney general's office was established in 2006 in \nBogota to accelerate resolutions of assassinations of trade unionists. \nDespite more resources for these cases, convictions have lagged behind \nmurders, leaving the unsolved murder/conviction rate at 98 percent. Of \nthe 2,283 murders between 1991 and 2007--2,283 murders of union \nactivists in that 17-year period--there have been 50 convictions. There \nhave been 50 convictions out of 2,283. Does that sound like the \nGovernment really is interested in going after hate groups like this?\n  We need to craft trade policies that deliver the long-term results we \nneed, not just the short-term profits a few multinational companies \ncrave. When it comes to trade and the Bush administration, idealogy \ntrumps outcomes. Special interests always--always--trump U.S. \ninterests.\n  Congress needs to reject this agreement. The Senate needs to make a \nclear statement that we stand for a better approach to trade, one based \non using our market as leverage to raise\n\n[[Page S2714]]\n\nliving standards in Latin America, in Michigan, in Montana, in Ohio, \nand our whole country.\n  Mr. President, joining me today is Senator Stabenow of Michigan, who, \nduring her almost 7\\1/2\\ years in the Senate and time in the House, has \nbeen a stalwart advocate for workers in Michigan and across this \ncountry, and she is particularly interested in this trade adjustment \nwork, with the problems in Michigan. She has stood strong, and we are \njoining together today.\n  I yield to Senator Stabenow.\n  Ms. STABENOW. First of all, I thank Senator Brown for his eloquence \nand his comments and his conviction. I know he would agree with me that \nwe want trade; we just want to export our products, not our jobs. That \nis what we want to export.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that the administration, one more \ntime, is getting the cart before the horse. We hear all the time about \nthe interest in beefing up trade enforcement and passing Trade \nAdjustment Assistance or dealing with currency manipulation and so on. \nYet those things are not happening, and the administration comes \nforward one more time with another trade agreement without those things \nin place.\n  Now, I first wish to thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for \nspeaking out very strongly about this and for introducing the \nbipartisan Trade Adjustment Assistance bill that he has indicated must \nbe passed before this trade agreement is even considered. I appreciate \nthat very much and his willingness to report from the Finance \nCommittee, on which I am honored to serve, a bill dealing with currency \nmanipulation. We have a trade enforcement bill as well.\n  But the reality is that we have not received support from the \nadministration, and we have not seen the willingness to make this the \npriority it needs to be in terms of our families. I know it is a \npriority for our leader. I know it is a priority for the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee and the majority of us on that committee. Yet \nstill today we are here one more time with an administration that, \nrather than listening to the leadership, the Speaker, rather than \nlistening to our leadership and being willing to address the needs of \nworkers who have lost their jobs because of trade, sends up another \ntrade agreement. And as my friend from Ohio has indicated, it is not \none that focuses on what is right in terms of workers--either the \nworkers in Colombia or the workers in Michigan or Ohio or Montana or \nacross the country. From my perspective, it is hard to imagine that \nsince the beginning of this administration, almost 8 years ago, we have \nlost 3.6 million manufacturing jobs--million. That means 3.6 million \nfamilies who had great middle-class jobs with health benefits and \npensions now find themselves either unemployed or underemployed in many \nsituations. In my home State of Michigan, we have lost 425,000 jobs. I \ndon't know how many folks are in Montana for sure, but my guess is that \nwould be a pretty big percentage of the folks who live in a State you \nlove dearly and advocate for every day--425,000 people in the last 7\\1/\n2\\ years.\n  Again, we know the economy is changing, and we are focused on \nadvanced manufacturing. We are focused on new technology. Michigan is \nbecoming a leader in alternative energy and will be a leader in \nalternative energy, but we have to continue to make things in this \ncountry. That is what manufacturing is about. I happen to believe that \nan economy doesn't grow unless you make things and grow things and then \nyou add leverage to it and you add value to it. That is how you have an \neconomy. That is how we have had an economy and a middle class that has \nbeen the envy of the world.\n  Frankly, when we look at creating a level playing field, we ought to \nbe talking about bringing other countries up to us, not racing to the \nbottom. Americans have been told: If you only work for less, lose your \nhealth care benefits, lose your pension, we can be competitive. Senator \nBrown talks about Colombia setting up zones, or other countries, where \ncompanies don't have to even pay minimum wage in those countries. If \nthey come in as an American company or a company from another part of \nthe world, they can come in and pay workers less. That is a race to the \nbottom. That is not a race we can win, and I don't want to win it \nbecause if we win that race, we have lost the American dream. We have \nlost the middle class of this country. What we want is a race up, and \nthat means education, innovation, changing the way we fund health care, \nand, yes, it means a level playing field on trade.\n\n  I believe that before we can go further with trade agreements, there \nare four things we have to make clear we are going to get done on \nbehalf of American workers and American families:\n  Trade Adjustment Assistance. There is an excellent bipartisan bill \nwhich has been introduced in the Senate which is a bill that would \nextend and improve upon trade adjustment assistance. This was set up so \nthat if somebody loses their job because of trade, they are going to be \nable to go back to school and they are going to have their health care \nbenefits continued for a couple of years while they get retraining to \nbe able to go into that new economy we all talk about.\n  Secondly, we have to have a stronger trade enforcement operation in \nthis country. Mr. President, we have some 230 different trade \nagreements. According to former Secretary of Commerce Mickey Kantor, \nwho came before the Finance Committee, we have the smallest trade \nenforcement office of anyplace in the industrialized world--the \nsmallest trade enforcement office. So we need to beef that up. Again, \nwe have legislation to do that. We just need to pass it and get it \nsigned into law and hear the President will support it. It includes a \nprovision that Senator Lindsey Graham and I have been working on, a \nbipartisan agreement we have worked on for years, to create what we \ncall a U.S. Trade Prosecutor but basically is a chief enforcement \nofficer--a place for business to go when their patent is stolen or \nthere is an unfair trade practice against them so we have somebody \nfighting for American businesses and American workers. That needs to \nget done.\n  We need the strongest possible currency bill to address what is, in \nfact, against the law and creating an unfair advantage--particularly as \nregards China but in the case of the auto industry, Japan as well--\nwhere they are manipulating their currency and selling products to us \nthat get anywhere from a 5-percent up to a 40-percent discount right \noff the top because of the valuation of their currency. That needs to \nchange. That is called a level playing field.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we need to make sure we extend unemployment \nbenefits for folks who have been unemployed due to our inaction on \ntrade or through other parts of the economic upheaval we have been in, \nin so many parts of the country, and which, unfortunately, is growing \nacross the country. I think Michigan was the canary in the coal mine, \nin many ways. We were hit hardest first--the epicenter of \nmanufacturing--but this is now spreading across the country. We need to \nmake sure the middle-class person who has lost their job has the \nopportunity to at least put food on the table and pay the mortgage \nwhile they are continuing to look for work.\n  I believe those things need to be put in place before we send any \nmore trade agreements forward--a trade agreement that we don't have the \ncapacity to enforce, where we are not helping the workers who have lost \nor will lose their jobs, and where we are not addressing the broader \nissues that have cost us jobs every single day.\n  I am stunned. We got the new numbers on Friday for what has happened. \nLast week's dismal jobs report was released. It was reported that our \nNation lost 83,000 jobs last month--83,000 jobs last month. We know \nwhat is happening. We know we are in a recession. We have known it in \nMichigan for a long time. Yet President Bush's Chief Economist, Edward \nLazear, said:\n\n       I don't focus too much on the monthly unemployment rate \n     because it has been a bit volatile.\n\n  A bit volatile? Three weeks, 4 weeks ago, we were hearing: Well, the \nunderlying fundamentals of the country are good. We have a little \nhousing problem, but the underlying fundamentals are good.\n  With all due respect, I don't know what planet these folks are on, \nbut the reality is that we have seen a convergence of issues, from the \nhousing situation, to the broader financial markets,\n\n[[Page S2715]]\n\nto trade imbalance, trade deficits, huge deficits in our budget; we \nhave seen a lack of enforcement on trade agreements; jobs lost, 3.6 \nmillion manufacturing jobs alone; and I think this is more than just a \nlittle bit of volatility in the economy.\n  So, Mr. President, I am extremely hopeful that we will say no to this \nColombian Free Trade Agreement and that we will stand up for Americans, \nthat we will stand up for Americans who have lived their lives working \nhard, trying to play by the rules, and who expect us to stand up for \nthem, and American businesses that have done the same thing. Let's pass \nTrade Adjustment Assistance the right kind of way. Let's make sure we \nhave a strong policy on currency manipulation. Let's make sure we \ntoughen our trade enforcement laws. And let's most certainly recognize \nthe tens of thousands--millions at this point--of those who are on \nunemployment insurance and who are asking us to extend those benefits, \nas has been done in every other time of recession, so that they have \nthe ability to be able to care for their families while they are \nlooking for a job.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will value the dignity of work and what \nmillions of Americans are going through every day now and understand it \nis our job, first and foremost, to fight for them.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I know many people have been watching \nGeneral Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker reporting on what is going on \nin Iraq. Obviously, it is very important information, and I would hope \nwe would heed what they are saying.\n  Regrettably, I must say that too many in the Democratic Party remain \nin denial over the progress being made in Iraq and still remain \npolitically vested in defeat. We have heard the leaders of the party \nsay: Oh, we have already lost. They believe that might give them an \nadvantage in the November elections. That is certainly a bad way to \ndecide what our strategy should be to defend the security of the United \nStates.\n  We have made great progress in our fight against terrorism. The war \nis far from won, but today there is no question that the central \nbattleground in the global war on terror is Iraq. Our men and women in \nthe military are fighting the al-Qaida terrorists there in Iraq, where \nOsama bin Laden and Ayman Zawahiri say they are going to establish \ntheir caliphate. We are fighting that war so that future generations \nwill not have to fight them on our own soil.\n  For my colleagues who argue we should not be fighting them in Iraq \nbut in Afghanistan, let me get you a little bit of intelligence \nnews. Al-Qaida is not in Afghanistan. Al-Qaida left Afghanistan after \nwe deposed Saddam Hussein. What we are fighting there are the \nindigenous Taliban insurgents, not al-Qaida.\n\n  More than anyone else, our brave veterans who are fighting in Iraq \nagainst the al-Qaida know the dangers of defeat. They know what they \nand others like them have done. Their word to us is: We as a nation, \nbut more specifically we as your military, have made too many \ncontributions and too many sacrifices to walk away from this essential \nbattle for our freedom and declare defeat.\n  My own son, a marine, returned last fall from his second tour of Iraq \nwith his scout snipers. He returned on success because they cleaned al-\nQaida out of Falluja and Al Anbar, and they turned the job of keeping \nsecurity over to the Iraqi Sunni Citizens Watch and the police.\n  If my colleagues will listen today to the voices of veterans who are \non the Hill in their tan golf shirts, they are the voice of people who \nhave been in the field--the Vets for Freedom, with whom I have had the \nhonor of being this morning, and to General Petraeus and Admiral \nCrocker--these are the people we need to listen to, not the voices of \nmoveon.org and the Code Pink extremists. We need to bring our troops \nhome, but we need to bring them home on success. That is what they \nfought for; that is what they are there for.\n  As one man in the field reported today: You can't be for us, for the \ntroops, and against the war because we are the war.\n  Despite the evidence of progress in Iraq, the media seems trigger \nhappy to report bad news. Less than 48 hours after Iraqi security \nforces began their campaign against the militant Shia factions in \nBasra, the media already was declaring the operation a failure. The \noperation initiated on March 25 was designed to quell rogue factions of \nMuqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi army. In covering the fighting, the press \ndisplayed its previously seen penchant for quickly throwing in the \ntowel when the military operation does not instantaneously achieve its \ngoals. If the operation were a failure and didn't meet its goals, then \nwhy did Muqtada al-Sadr order a cease-fire? I don't know of any \ncommander who has declared a cease-fire when he is winning.\n  Right now, General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker are \ntestifying before the Senate on the progress being made in Iraq. I \nexpect that testimony will show that the new counterinsurgency, or COIN \nstrategy, backed up by the surge, has been working and has brought \nIraqi citizens to our side in the fight against al-Qaida.\n  Since the surge forces began operating under this new policy in mid-\n2007 and the adoption of the COIN strategy, there is some important \nsecurity progress to point to. Overall violence in Iraq, civilian \ndeaths, sectarian killings, and attacks on American forces are all \ndown. Coalition forces have captured or killed thousands of extremists \nin Iraq, including hundreds of key al-Qaida leaders and operatives. \nAmerican troops are beginning to return home on success.\n  In addition to security progress, the Iraqis are also making critical \npolitical progress. While this front has been the slowest--and we must \ncontinue to demand that the Iraqis assume greater control--the \nGovernment has taken several important steps. The Iraqi Government has \nenacted a pension law that keeps the promises made to Sunnis. It has \nenacted a debaath- ification law that allows midlevel Baath Party \nmembers to reenter political and civic life. It has passed a budget \nthat focuses spending on security reconstruction projects and \nprovincial governments. It has enacted an amnesty law, and it has \nreached agreement on a provincial powers law that will ensure the \nIraqis the right to be heard in upcoming elections.\n  Democrats are in denial of the progress in Iraq despite this evidence \nof both security and political gain. Their rejection of the reality in \nIraq does not extend just to the current Petraeus and Crocker \ntestimony, however. Some who favor retreat and defeat in Iraq have also \ntaken issue with the classified Iraq National Intelligence Estimate, or \nNIE, distributed to lawmakers last week.\n  Always quick to tout and cherry-pick information from a NIE that can \nbe twisted to support their motives, the retreat-and-defeat gang has \noutright rejected the latest Iraqi intelligence report. They claim it \nis ``too rosy.''\n  Unfortunately, this denial is no more than rhetoric and fodder for \nthe mainstream media because we know that defeat in Iraq would have \nserious national security implications and do great harm to our image \naround the world, an image that so many of our colleagues on the other \nside say they wish to repair. Iraq is the central battleground in the \nwar on terror. In addition to giving al-Qaida safe haven, defeat in \nIraq would embolden a possibly nuclear-armed Iraq. The intelligence \ncommunity has stated in an open hearing before the Intelligence \nCommittee earlier this year that if we withdraw from Iraq before their \narmy and police can maintain security, violence and chaos will spread \nacross the region.\n  This has been a tough fight. We have lost over 4,000 of our bravest \nand finest men and women. The surest and most fitting way to honor \ntheir memory and their service is to ensure victory, not defeat.\n  Mr. President, I have several Members on my side who have been \nwaiting for time in morning business. What is the situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republicans control 9 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia is also \nwaiting to speak, so I would like to be notified at 4\\1/2\\ minutes, and \nI will split it down the middle with the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak about General Petraeus' \ntestimony. I was able to watch a little bit of it before I came over \nhere. I was beginning to see, of course, the questioning from the Armed \nServices Committee. I think it is so important that we look at the big \npicture and what General Petraeus is saying. Also, of course, we have \nAmbassador Crocker who is doing a terrific job over there.\n  I was there at the end of February, just 6 weeks ago. I met with both \nof them. But what I saw was an incredible change from the other time I \nhad been in Iraq. As General Petraeus said himself, from June 2007 \nthrough February 2008 deaths from ethno-sectarian violence in Bagdad \nhave fallen 90 percent. American casualties have fallen sharply, down \nby 70 percent. In the last year, the number of high-profile attacks \nhave fallen by 50 percent.\n  All of us believe one American death is not worth the price we would \npay if we had a choice. But every one of those who are there understand \nour mission and how important it is. Every one of those with whom I \nhave met, both the people who have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan \nand the families of those who have lost loved ones, say: Do not leave. \nDo not leave without a victory, without seeing through the successes \nthat we have gained.\n  They understand this mission. Unfortunately, it does not seem that \nthe majority in the Congress see it as those who are on the ground and \nwho have suffered the most do. As recently as February, the Senate \nleadership was trying to stop the surge by requiring an immediate and \narbitrary withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq when we didn't even have \nthe results. Yet those of us who have been there recently have seen the \nresults.\n  I went to a police station with our embedded forces and to a security \nregional center with embedded forces. I did that because I was very \nconcerned. I wanted to see it myself. I was very pleased with the fact \nthat our troops embedded there were causing the Iraqis to come forward \nand do more and help us.\n  The Sons of Iraq, which are now 91,000 strong, are serving as \nneighborhood watches. They are manning the checkpoints. They are taking \nus to the weapons caches. Do you know that, since the beginning of this \nyear, we have found, because of the Sons of Iraq's cooperation, more \nweapons than we discovered in all of 2006? We are making progress. Mr. \nPresident, 21,000 of the Sons of Iraq have now been accepted into \nsecurity forces or government work. It is amazing that we are seeing \nmilitary gains, and we are seeing political gains. It is not as fast as \nwe would like to see it, of course, but it is progress. It is in the \nright direction.\n  The consequences of leaving precipitously are consequences that would \nbe unthinkable. People talk about the cost of Iraq, the cost of the war \non terror, as if the costs are prohibitive. The costs are high. But the \ncost of leaving and letting al-Qaida have a base in Iraq are much more \nexpensive. We are talking about 9/11 costing over $1 trillion, if you \nput it in monetary terms, which I don't think we should--this is not \nthe thing that we should even be considering. We should be supporting \nour troops, and we should be supporting the effort that would require \ncomplete success for our country. This is the United States of America.\n  I met with the Vets for Freedom who just met by Senator Bond as well. \nThey are the patriots who have been there, who know what it is like, \nand who are saying stay and fight and win. It is the right thing for \nthe United States of America to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas for \nallowing me part of the time. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished \nSenators from Texas and Missouri. I am grateful for great Americans \nsuch as David Petraeus, and I am particularly grateful for the young \nmen and women, Americans who volunteer day and night, who go to defend \nliberty, peace, and freedom around the world. I come to the floor now \nfor just a few minutes to speak on the housing bill pending, coming \nback, and the stimulus bill coming to the floor, and a cloture vote \nthat is going to take place at 2:15.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/08/senate-section/article/S2716-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2716-S2717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HOUSING CRISIS\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I come to the well specifically today to \ntalk for a few minutes about the tax credit proposal that is included \nin the base bill as introduced by Senators Dodd and Shelby and approved \nby the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, and Senator Baucus. To that \nend I want to pay particular thanks to the staff of the Finance \nCommittee for the tremendous work they did with respect to the housing \ntax credit amendment which is now part of the base bill.\n  I come here today, though, to correct some misinformation that has \nbeen appearing in the media particularly over the past weekend and in a \ncouple of national publications and Washington newspapers with regard \nto the housing stimulus and tax credit being inappropriate or wrong. \nThe presumptions of those who have written are absolutely inappropriate \nand wrong. Although they are attempting, I am sure, to contribute to \nthe debate, they are in fact contributing to a tremendous \nmisunderstanding about the reality of what the tax credits will do.\n  For the sake of discussion, the tax credit is a $7,000, $3,500-a-year \ntax credit that goes to any family who buys and occupies as their \nresidence any home that has been foreclosed upon or is owned by a bank \nor lender, new or resale, and any resale owned by an owner occupant who \nis fending foreclosure.\n  There have been two comments made about what is wrong with this \nproposal that are exactly the opposite of what is really right about \nthis proposal. No. 1, in one editorial it said it is rewarding people \nwho did not pay their payments and punishing people who are making \ntheir payments. It is not rewarding anybody. If you are purchasing a \nforeclosed-upon house, the damage has already been done to the \nborrower. The family who didn't perform is not rewarded. In fact, they \nhave already suffered their punishment. But everybody else in the \nneighborhood is suffering punishment because that vacant house sits \nthere deteriorating and causing declining house values.\n  Secondly, it does not punish the homeowner who is in their house \nmaking their payments because the truth is, that home owner is hurt \nmore when a foreclosure sits vacant and unsold than it is when that \nproperty is taken, bought by a homeowner, reestablished, the lawn is \nkept, the values are stabilized.\n  The fact is, we have an obligation at this critical time in our \neconomy to do what we can to stimulate the market to solve our \nproblems, not have a plethora of government solutions to problems. \nStimulating the market to go back, absorb these houses, get them back \nin owner-occupied hands, get them out of REO inventory is precisely \nwhat we need to do.\n  Now, I do not come to this opinion as someone who has no experience; \nI come to it based on experience 33 years ago, in 1975. I was in the \nbusiness. The United States had gone through a serious decline in \nhousing. We had a problem. We had a 3-year supply of new houses \nstanding unoccupied on the market. Buyers retreated because they did \nnot know where the bottom was. The economy went down. Everything was in \na mess.\n  Gerald Ford, a Republican President, and a Democratic Congress came \nto this very floor and introduced a $2,000-a-year tax credit to any \nfamily who went and bought one of those standing vacant new houses \nonly--not any house, the standing vacant new houses that were there, \nthe problem houses. They passed the $2,000 tax credit. The market \nimmediately responded. Within the 1-year window of opportunity for that \ncredit, two-thirds of the standing inventory was absorbed, home values \nstabilized and began to go up, and the economy returned to vitality.\n  So I ask those who are writing in criticism about a bill rewarding \npeople\n\n[[Page S2717]]\n\nwho did bad things and punishing people who did it right, they are \nexactly the opposite; the damage has already been done when the \nforeclosure has taken place, and the reward is to stabilize \nneighborhoods for those who are in their homes and paying.\n  I think the wisdom of the Finance Committee and the Banking Committee \nto incorporate this provision is an insurance policy that we in \nCongress can do good things to drive the market, to help solve \nproblems. You hear all those problems about us making payments for \npeople and doing things to take money from one American and give it to \nanother in a time of trouble. That only postpones the inevitable. It \ndoes not solve the problem. But stimulating buyers back to the \nmarketplace to absorb those houses that have been foreclosed upon or \nare pending foreclosure addresses specifically the housing crisis in \nthis country, absorbs specifically the houses that are causing us \nproblems, reestablishes values in our neighborhoods, and stabilizes the \nvalues of those people who are in their homes making their payments, \ndoing what is right.\n  So with all due respect to those who have opined over the weekend, \nthey are absolutely incorrect and wrong in terms of the applications of \nthis credit. It will, in fact, be a boost to the economy, a boost to \nthe housing market, and a stabilizing factor on home values and \nequities in the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I will.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I have a question exactly about not only those \nheadlines but what people have asked me over the weekend. I want the \nSenator to know, first of all, we value his extensive experience in the \nreal estate field--he was a well-known realtor in his own community--\nand, of course, his ongoing method of civility in this body.\n  Here is my question: This is a $7,000 tax credit if you buy a \nforeclosed home in a neighborhood; is that correct?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. That is right, $3,500 a year for each of the first 2 \nyears you occupy it as a resident.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Here is the question: There are two houses for sale. \nOne is a foreclosed property and one is a regular homeowner ready to \nsell. The question I get from non-profits and people is: Is the tax \ncredit going to depress by $7,000 the house that is not in foreclosure? \nIn other words, that it acts as a damper on price, and if you are in \ngood standing, you have a good mortgage but you are ready to sell for \nwhatever reasons, you are putting your house on the market, and next to \nyou is a foreclosed house and that is going to get a $7,000 tax break, \nthey are saying: I am going to have to eat $7,000 to sell my house.\n  Can the Senator answer that question for me and for all who I think \nare puzzled about the possible unintended consequences of this tax \nbreak?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The Senator's question is right on target. My answer to \nyou is not an opinion, it is a statement of what actually happened in \n1975. In 1975, there was no demand for housing because the plethora of \nhouses that were on the market that had been foreclosed on that were \nbuilt new were not being sold. Nobody was in the market. When the \n$2,000 tax credit was established and those houses began to be \nabsorbed, the housing values stabilized. So there was not a \ndisadvantage to the person who was trying to sell who was in the house, \nit was actually an advantage.\n  The disadvantage you have right now is nobody knows where the bottom \nis. Because foreclosures are taking place, the values are going down. \nThose values, because of the cost-to-replace method of appraising, \nwhich is used by all lenders, decline the value of appraisals of houses \nthat are pending on the market. It is a domino effect that affects \neverybody. The tax credit, by absorbing those houses that have been \nforeclosed upon and are vacant and are bringing down values, undergirds \nthe market and raises those values for everyone.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Stick with me.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I am here.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Real-world situation. This house is foreclosed, which \nmeans it already is going on the market at a depressed value, OK? The \nconsequence of a foreclosure is a melancholy event, not only for the \nperson who is losing their home, but the community feels it could lose \na neighborhood. I believe that is the gentleman's point, and it is also \na great concern to me. But because the foreclosed house is already \ndepressed, then a $7,000 tax credit comes in. The question is, for the \nnon-foreclosed, I do not understand how the price of the non-foreclosed \nhome is not dampened, and we, ourselves, are helping create a new \nbottom.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Well, two or three points. The first one I made is still \nthe valid point; that is, as those foreclosures are absorbed, values \nstabilize and go back up, and that supports the values that were there \nin the neighborhood for the people who are making their payments, not \nin foreclosure. That is No. 1.\n  Forget about the tax credit. You ride through any neighborhood where \nsomebody is in a house that is in trouble and look at the sign. It will \nsay ``Drastic Reduction.'' ``Reduced.'' ``Foreclosed Property.'' ``Fire \nSale.'' ``Thirty Percent Discount.'' All you have to do is open any \nnewspaper in any urban area in American, and you can read the \nclassifieds and see that today. That is what is doing the terrible \ndamage. That is because those numbers are growing. So if the incentive \nis to absorb those that have been foreclosed on, then you lessen that \ndownward pressure, you underwrite the house values, and the \nneighborhoods begin to restore.\n\n  Remember this: The tax credit is only good for a year. It is only a \nfinite period of time to drive people to the market in hopes that they \nwill absorb those houses because if they do not, the only way they get \nabsorbed is through deeper discounts because regulators are going to \nforce those lenders to dump them. The deeper the discount, the more \ndepressed values are, and the more difficult it is for anybody to sell \ntheir house at a reasonable value.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Well, first of all, I thank the Senator for explaining \nthis. You can understand the origin of these questions. It is not only \nwhat I feel, but those working in our communities, those trying to sell \nhomes, they all feel pretty much the same way. But I thank the Senator \nfor answering that question, and we thank him for the expertise he \nbrings to this debate.\n  Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time for morning business is \nabout to expire.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, let me state that we are waiting for \nSenator Dodd to come from the Foreign Relations Committee so that we \ncan report the bill and continue moving on the housing bill.\n  I have an amendment I wish to offer. I know the Senator from Vermont \nhas a modification. I know the Senator from California also has some \nthings she wants to do on this bill. But while we are waiting for \nSenator Dodd I wanted to say a few things about housing. I want to say \na few things about this bill. I have an amendment I wish to offer, but \nI have a lot on my mind about this housing bill. First of all, I have \nvery serious questions about the bill itself. The original bill that \nhas been brought to the floor takes care of the sharks and the whales, \nbut it does not take care of the little people, the minnows. The \nMaryland General Assembly did more in their 90 day session that just \nadjourned than this body has been able to accomplish all year.\n\n[[Page S2718]]\n\n  When you look at that which will actually help ordinary people work \ntheir way out of the foreclosure mess, the legislation is quite \nSpartan. We lost the bankruptcy provision that would have allowed \nfamilies to put the pieces back together. The original housing bill had \n$200 million going to the nonprofit agencies that are working every day \nwith people in those communities to be able to work out their problems. \nNow, this bill is being held hostage by the other party for more tax \ncuts we do not need, bigger bailouts for those who do not need them, \nand it does not help the 8,000 people a day who face foreclosure. We \nneed to improve this bill.\n  Now, I am so disappointed that Senator Durbin's amendment to amend \nthe Bankruptcy Code to allow workouts did not occur. I know Senator \nMurray has an amendment to add more money to the front-line groups \nworking with families. I want to thank Senator Murray for offering this \namendment and I will have a second-degree adding legal help for the \nalready overburdened nonprofit counselors.\n  I have seen what this housing crisis means, not by reading the Wall \nStreet Journal but by getting out there and talking to my own \nconstituents, holding roundtables on this subject. What we see is that \nthe subprime housing crisis is a code red emergency. Thousands in my \nState got caught up in schemes and scams. They were not Wall Street \nspeculators we give a bailout to, they are Main Street Americans who \nneed a workout plan.\n  My State was hit hard, so at these roundtables we talk to the people \nwho were most affected, the people who actually are facing bankruptcy, \nto get their stories, get a picture book of what is going on, talk to \nthe nonprofits. But we also talked to the brokers and the Realtors and \nothers in their community. I listened and I learned.\n  So while everybody here wants to talk about the big macropicture, I \nwant to talk about the macaroni-and-cheese issues. I am on the side of \nthe little people. I talked to a police officer who works every day, \nputting himself in the line of fire. Because he got into a home equity \nscam and scheme, he is about to lose his home. I talked to a mother, a \nsingle mother who thought she was part of the American dream, and now \nshe is part of the American nightmare.\n  If you listen to the nonprofits, housing people, like St. Ambrose \nHousing in my own State, they are trying every day to help people work \nthis problem out. What is it that they need? They need a plan to be \nable to do a workout. That is why the bankruptcy amendment was a big \nhelp. It would have enabled people to responsibly work out their \nproblems. But at the same time, those nonprofits are being overwhelmed \nby the sheer magnitude of the caseload.\n  When you look in my own State, there are thousands and thousands of \nbankruptcies. In 2006, there were 3,000 foreclosures in Maryland. But \nguess what. In 2007, there were 23,000--23,000 Marylanders are in the \nforeclosure line. The sheer magnitude of the problem these nonprofit \norganizations--many of whom are faith-based--have to come to grips with \nto help these families with advice and counseling shows that we are in \ngreat difficulty.\n  This is why I so support Senator Murray's amendment to add more \nfinancial resources to these nonprofits to bring on the staff. I salute \nSenator Murray because she brings expertise in housing. But where she \nis a real expert is on people and the suffering people have.\n  We believe in working with nonprofit organizations that are out there \nclosest to the people to do this. Now, in listening to them, so many of \nmy constituents were steamed and scammed. They faced predatory--\npredatory--lending procedures. Some people get mugged when they walk \ndown a back alley. Here, they got mugged when they sat down to sign up \nfor their mortgage or their home equity loan. They were mugged big \ntime.\n  If you are mugged, you get a lawyer. But if you are in foreclosure, \nyou cannot get one. Legal Services barely can help anybody because the \nmeans testing means that that for a family of four, if you have an \nincome over $26,500, you cannot get a legal aid lawyer. Well, if you \nhave that kind of income, you were unlikely to be own housing at least \nin many areas of the country.\n  But NeighborWorks can offer help. I will offer an amendment later on \nthis morning that will add $37.5 million as a second-degree amendment--\n$37.5 million to the NeighborWorks effort.\n  This NeighborWorks will do three things.\n  First of all, they are going to hire more lawyers and more paralegals \nto help the counseling groups help people work out of these predatory \nschemes. Why paralegals? They will maximize the lawyers we already \nhave. They will hire more lawyers, particularly those who are \nsemiretired or those young lawyers eager to build their skills, and so \non. NeighborWorks and the experienced lawyers will train them.\n  It will provide money to legal organizations to train more attorneys \nin foreclosure law. We have lawyers who want to come forth, but they \nneed their training expenses taken care of.\n  There are paralegals who are looking to not only work for a law firm \nbut to also work for these nonprofits.\n  Then for the lawyers in foreclosure law, this would allow them to \ntrain counselors in some of the basic foreclosure law.\n  My amendment, I will offer at a later time, is very simple and very \nstraightforward, but wow is it needed. We need to give help to those \nwho are trying to practice self-help to the people who are in \nforeclosure, to the nonprofits that are trying to help them, and to the \nlawyers who are trying to advise them.\n  Remember, if you were mugged in a back alley, you could have access \nto a lawyer. But if you were mugged when you sat down for a settlement \non buying a home, you are going to be on your own. You know what. We \ncannot have that. I want to have people feel that we are on their side.\n  Again, we do not seek bailouts. We seek workouts. We want to be able \nto help those families be able to restore their financial credit, to be \nable to work out and stay in their home.\n  When you have foreclosure on a home, it is a terrible tragedy for the \nfamily. But it is also a terrible tragedy for the community. So let's \nall work together. Let's pass a housing bill that helps those who are \nin need, those who are losing their home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator withhold the \nsuggestion of an absence of a quorum?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I withdraw my suggestion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout an amendment which I have to the housing bill. It is amendment \nNo. 4392. It was discussed last week.\n  The essence of the amendment would provide authority to the \nbankruptcy court to deal with variable interest rate mortgages, where \nwe find people have been surprised by the acceleration of obligation. \nIt is illustrated by a mortgage where the monthly payments were $1,079 \nand then raised to $1,444--an increase which was not expected by the \nborrower. Another illustration of a variable interest rate mortgage is \nwhere the monthly payments were $1,400, which were raised to $1,900 a \nmonth.\n  This would give the bankruptcy courts authority to deal with these \nchanges. Under these circumstances, the borrowers did not know how much \nthe payment would be increased. Frequently, there is misrepresentation, \nand on some occasions there is even fraud.\n  This amendment was distinguished from the amendment offered by \nSenator Durbin, which would have provided for bankruptcy courts to have \nauthority to modify the principal. That was defeated largely because it \nwould have created a problem for lending in the future when prospective \nlenders would not have confidence their contracts would be fulfilled.\n  I was looking for an opportunity to vote on this matter on Thursday \nafternoon but was called away in my capacity as ranking member on \nJudiciary because of the absence of any other Republican to preside at \nthat time.\n  I have talked earlier today with the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee with a request I have an opportunity to vote on this before \ncloture is imposed, before the cloture vote is taken. I note there are \na number of\n\n[[Page S2719]]\n\nSenators who have amendments which they wish to offer, and it would be \nmy hope and projection that these amendments would not be foreclosed. \nFrequently, on this side of the aisle, the point is raised that we will \nnot agree to have cloture to cut off further amendments when our \nMembers have not had an opportunity to present their amendments.\n  This is a very important bill. The bill is lopsided in favor of Wall \nStreet over Main Street. We have seen the situation with the bailout of \nBear Stearns. This bill contains provisions which will help the big \nguy, so to speak, with the credit for purchases of homes, with the tax \ncredit for those who buy homes in foreclosure, and with the provisions \ncarrying losses forward.\n  This bill, as noted by Senator Dodd, does not adequately take care of \nthe so-called little guy. The amendment which I wish to have voted upon \nwould be a significant move in that direction. So I hope we will have \nan opportunity to vote on my amendment and to give other Senators an \nopportunity to present amendments to give better balance to this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a Chinese proverb asks: How can one beam \nalone support a house?\n  The same can be asked about the housing market. The housing market \nincludes homeowners, home buyers, and homebuilders alike. To support \nthe entire housing market, one does best to support each of its several \nparts.\n  That is why I worked with my colleague, Senator Chuck Grassley, and \nother members of the Finance Committee to craft the housing tax \nprovisions in the pending substitute amendment. These provisions \naddress the several parts of the housing market. Our legislation would \nhelp homeowners, home buyers, and homebuilders. In so doing, our \nlegislation would provide sounder support for the market as a whole. In \ntoday's economy, many homeowners are having difficulty paying the \nmortgage. About 4 percent of first-mortgage debt is delinquent. Another \n1 percent is in default.\n  Last year, nearly 1.5 million homeowners defaulted on their first \nmortgages. That is up from 900,000 in the year before and 800,000 in \nthe year before that. Defaults and foreclosures have contributed to the \ndecline in housing prices. They have destroyed more than $2.5 trillion \nin household net worth in the space of a year.\n  Our legislation would help homeowners with a property tax deduction \navailable for people who do not itemize their tax deductions. This new \ndeduction would alleviate some of the burden of local property taxes, \nat a time when homeowners are struggling to pay their mortgages.\n  This new property tax deduction would provide a standard deduction \nfor up to $500 for single filers and $1,000 for joint filers. It would \nbe available to the more than 28 million families who pay property \ntaxes but who do not itemize their deductions. These are middle- and \nlow-income households. These are some of the same families in the \nhousing market who most need relief.\n  For home buyers, our legislation includes a home buyer credit and \nmortgage revenue bonds. The home buyer tax credit provides a $7,000 tax \ncredit for the purchase of a home upon which foreclosure has been \nfiled. The tax credit rightfully excludes second-home purchases and \nrental investments. It focuses on the principal residences of \nstruggling families.\n  By targeting foreclosed properties, our provision would get families \ninto vacant homes. By targeting homes that are near foreclosure, our \ncredit may steer home buyers to those homes. That may make enough \ndifference to help some families to get out of foreclosure and out of \nharsh eviction proceedings.\n  Our legislation also includes mortgage revenue bonds. We would \nprovide an additional $10 billion of tax-exempt private activity bond \nauthority. States could use these bonds to refinance subprime loans, to \nprovide mortgages for first-time home buyers, and to provide \nmultifamily rental housing.\n  This substantial increase for the States comes at a critical time. \nStates are directly experiencing the effects of the economic downturn. \nWith the financial crisis tightening up lending, this cash can provide \nmuch needed financing. That financing will once again help low- to \nmiddle-income households.\n  The subprime mortgage crisis and declining housing sales have forced \nmany homebuilders to lose money. According to the most recent Labor \nDepartment report, construction and manufacturing are the hardest hit \nsectors of the economy. Construction shed 51,000 jobs so far this year, \nand manufacturing shed 48,000 jobs so far this year.\n  Construction employment alone is down 182,000 jobs since November. It \nis down by 356,000 jobs over last year. Overall, the private sector has \nlost 296,000 jobs over the last 3 months. That is a loss of 97,000 jobs \na month.\n  For homebuilders, our package would allow businesses to carry back \nlosses to profitable tax years. That would help the homebuilders hit \nthe hardest by the housing market crisis. The pending amendment would \nallow troubled businesses to carry back net operating losses for 4 \nyears, for tax years 2008 and 2009. That would allow them to receive \nquick tax refunds.\n  This tax relief would slow losses. These businesses would then have a \nquick cash infusion to meet payroll and other current expense \nobligations. We hope this relief would encourage these businesses to \nrehire some of those workers who have lost their jobs. This provision \nbenefits both employers and employees.\n  As well, the net operating loss provisions in the pending amendment \nwould allow homebuilders and other distressed businesses to take the \nbook benefit of a net operating loss before claiming the amount on \ntheir tax return. This would help distressed businesses to obtain \nadditional financing.\n\n  Now, these provisions alone would clearly not solve the housing \nmarket woes facing this Nation, but by helping homeowners, home buyers \nand homebuilders, we would take a significant step in the right \ndirection. No one piece of legislation can solve all of our problems \nbut inaction most certainly will solve none of our problems. That is \nwhy we must act. We should bring debate to a close. We should invoke \ncloture this afternoon. We should pass this much needed tax relief.\n  Let's not rely on one beam alone to support an entire structure. \nLet's pass this help for home buyers, homebuilders, and homeowners, and \nlet's provide this much needed support for the housing market.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/08/senate-section/article/S2719-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2719-S2720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, John F. Kennedy once said: ``Let us not \nseek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right \nanswer.''\n  President Bush has said that he intends to submit the implementing \nlegislation for the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. \nHe did so against the will of Congress, and he thus did not seek the \nright answer. He did not even bother with the Republican or the \nDemocratic answer. The administration simply chose the easy answer. The \nadministration's easy answer is also the wrong answer. It is the wrong \nanswer for American workers. It is the wrong answer for the \nadministration's relationship with Congress. It is the wrong answer for \nColombian workers.\n  The Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement is a good trade agreement\n\n[[Page S2720]]\n\nthat will level the playing field for America's exporters. It will open \nthe new export market for American products, including Montana beef, \nwheat, and barley, and it will bolster a close ally in a troubled \nregion.\n  Expanding trade and supporting Colombia are important priorities. \nThat is why the administration should have handled this agreement the \nright way. Had the administration sought the right answer, it would \nhave worked harder to support my top priority: American workers. Had \nthe administration not rushed forward with the easy answer, we could \nhave had trade adjustment assistance in place before considering this \nagreement. We need expanded and effective trade adjustment assistance \nfor America's workers. That is clear. That means ensuring that \nAmerica's service workers--not just its manufacturers and its farmers--\nreceive the help they need.\n  Service workers make up 80 percent of our workforce. They have helped \nto build and support the knowledge-based economy that is the engine of \nAmerica's growth. They work hard. They deserve our support in return.\n  Expanded and effective trade adjustment assistance must also cover \nworkers whose jobs have been shipped offshore, not just as a result of \ntrade agreements but others as well. It must raise the health care tax \ncredit to make it affordable and accessible, and expanded and effective \nTAA--trade adjustment assistance--must double the training funds \navailable to our workers.\n  Were the administration serious about this agreement, it would not \nhave resorted to the easy procedural answers either. In high school \ncivics class, they teach that the Constitution grants Congress the \npower to regulate foreign commerce. Congress entrusted this power \ntemporarily--and, I might add, importantly, conditionally--to the \nadministration under something called trade promotion authority; that \nis, Congress did not write a blank check. By submitting the agreement \nnow and against Congress's will, the administration abuses the power \nCongress granted it. By forcing Congress to consider this agreement \nnow, the administration offends the trust of Congress and violates the \ncompact that is the essence of fast track; that is, trade promotion \nauthority.\n  When Congress extended trade promotion authority--or, as people call \nit, fast track--they did so on the condition that the administration \nwould consult with Congress about the text of proposed agreements \nbefore it sent them up. Congress set up an informal markup process to \napply before the administration formally sent up the legislation. That \ninformal procedure is very important. It was to be conducted, again, \nbefore the administration formally sent up its legislative language. \nThe administration has now completely bypassed that process. Now \nCongress has no opportunity to affect the language of the proposed \nagreement. This administration has said: It is my way or the highway.\n  Procedural checks and balances are the cornerstone of the \ncongressional-executive relationship. It is the cornerstone of trade \npromotion authority. Democratic and Republican administrations have \nboth respected this cornerstone. But today, this administration \nshattered this cornerstone. By so doing, they further diminish our \ntrust.\n  By sending up the implementing bill today; that is, before \nconsultation in the right way, the administration has failed to deliver \nthe right answer for Colombia's workers. Colombia's workers must know \nthat they can safely pursue equality and justice in the workplace, free \nfrom the violence that has plagued Colombia in the past.\n  The Colombian Government has made great strides in this area. The \nenforceable labor provisions in the United States-Colombia trade \nagreement are a critical step to ensuring further progress. We must \nmake sure the Colombian Government takes these obligations seriously. \nThey must show that these obligations are not just paper promises.\n  The normal congressional fast-track process of hearings and formal \nmarkups--which the administration has short-circuited--is an important \ntime for Congress to air concerns, exercise its leverage. It allows \nCongress to ensure that the Colombian Government is committed to \nprosecuting labor violence. These hearings are important to accomplish \nthat objective. It gives us real leverage to seek commitments from the \nColombian Government and the administration to create a work \nenvironment in Colombia grounded in law and backed by action. It also \nallows Congress the chance to help the Colombian Government, through \nfunding provisions included in the implementing bill, to create an \nenvironment where those who seek a better life through employment can \nflourish. Short-circuiting the process and forcing a premature vote on \na trade agreement does nothing to help Congress accomplish these goals.\n  The President's unprecedented handling of the United States-Colombia \nFree Trade Agreement raises extraordinary questions about how we can \nmove this agreement forward. For America's workers, for the \nrelationship between Congress and the President, for the Colombian \npeople, Congress must now find answers. Finding the right answer has \nnever been easy. By submitting this agreement as it did and when it \ndid, the administration has sought the easy answer, but in the end, the \nadministration has simply made it harder to find the right answer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday I made a few remarks about an \namendment Senator Kyl and I have offered to an Ensign-Cantwell \namendment, and today I wish to place in the\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\nCongressional Record a couple of documents.\n  In May 2007, I requested that the Energy Information Administration \nconduct a study of Federal subsidies of electricity, including a \ncomparison of subsidies for different fuel types. Last week, I received \na 250-page study in response to my request.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following: \na copy of my May 17, 2007, letter to the EIA Administrator, Guy Caruso; \na copy of the April 2, 2008, cover letter from Mr. Caruso that arrived \nwith the EIA's 250-page study; and finally, a table titled ``Federal \nSubsidies of Electric Power'' that is based on information that was \nincluded in the executive summary of EIA's study.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 2007.\n     Hon. Guy Caruso,\n     Administrator, U.S. Energy Information Administration, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Caruso: I am writing to request that the Energy \n     Information Administration (ETA) conduct an analysis of \n     federal subsidies of the electricity industry, including a \n     comparison of subsidies for the different fuel types (e.g., \n     coal, natural gas, petroleum, nuclear, wind, solar, etc.). I \n     am interested in learning--for each fuel type--both (1) the \n     overall annual cost of those subsidies, and (2) the annual \n     cost per unit electricity generated (e.g., cost per kilowatt-\n     hour). My staff is familiar with the EIA report Federal \n     Financial Interventions and Subsidies in Energy Markets 1999: \n     Energy Transformation and End Use and understands that this \n     new analysis will serve as an update of significant portions \n     of this prior analysis with a focus on subsidies available to \n     electricity and primary fuels used in electricity generation.\n       To expedite its completion, the analysis should be limited \n     to subsidies provided by the federal government, those that \n     are energy-specific, and those that provide a financial \n     benefit with an identifiable federal budget impact. Broad \n     policies or programs that are applicable throughout the \n     economy need not be considered. The analysis should include \n     the following types of subsidies: tax expenditures (such as \n     deductions, credits, and loan guarantees); direct \n     expenditures (such as direct grant programs and the Low \n     Income Home Energy Assistance Program); federal research and \n     development programs targeting electricity and its fuel \n     inputs; and federal electricity programs (such as support for \n     the Bonneville Power Administration).\n       The report should include an estimate on the size of each \n     subsidy over a recent, representative year. Where there has \n     been a significant change in the amount or scope of a \n     particular subsidy since the 2000 report, it would be useful \n     for the report to provide an explanation for the change. If a \n     valid methodology can be developed, a forecast of subsidy \n     impacts would be very informative as well. To be most \n     helpful, I would appreciate it if the report could be \n     completed by November 30, 2007.\n       Thank you for your assistance with this matter.

Mr. President, today General Petraeus comes to the \nSenate. I suggest that we listen to the General. When he reported to \nthe Senate last September, some Senators were unwilling to listen. One \neven said that she thought that in order to believe the reports from \nIraq it required a willing suspension of disbelief.\n  Let us remember what has happened since then. I can remember last \nAugust visiting with General Petraeus in Baghdad. I handed him a paper \nthat said: It is time for a new strategy in Iraq. I had been urging \nPresident Bush and the Senate to adopt the Iraq Study Group \nrecommendations. In my view, what General Petraeus has done since that \ntime has been to adopt the Iraq Study Group recommendations with some \namendments.\n  We are acknowledging that it is time to shift the mission from combat \nto support, province by province. We are acknowledging that there will \nbe a long-term presence of the United States in Iraq, but as General \nPetraeus said, it is steadily diminishing. We are acknowledging that \nthis is an important step-up in diplomatic and political efforts.\n  As General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker speak today, the questions \nwe should ask are: What progress are we making down this new path to \nbring this war to a successful conclusion? Second, now that there is \nwidespread agreement that there has been success since last summer with \nan American-led military surge, what are the prospects for an Iraqi-led \npolitical and diplomatic surge, letting the Iraqis invite their \nneighbors to embassies in Baghdad, reconciling their differences among \nthemselves, and paying for more of their own bills?\n  So instead of suspending our disbelief, let's listen to the General \nand to Ambassador Crocker, acknowledge the progress they are making and \nmake it easier for them to progress on the diplomatic and political \nfronts.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for their courtesy.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

What is the pending amendment, Mr. President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Murray amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Maryland wishes to speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4494 to Amendment No. 4478\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4494.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4494 to amendment No. 4478.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To make additional funds available to the Neighborhood \n  Reinvestment Corporation to increase legal assistance available to \n     homeowners at risk of foreclosure and assistance to community \n      organizations working to preserve homeownership and prevent \n                      foreclosure, with an offset)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. _____.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the amount \n     appropriated under section 301(a) of this Act shall be \n     $3,862,500,000 and the amount appropriated under section 401 \n     of this Act shall be $237,500,00: Provided, That, of amounts \n     appropriated under such section 401 $37,500,000 shall be used \n     by the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (referred to in \n     this section as the ``NRC'') to (1) make grants to counseling \n     intermediaries approved by the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development or the NRC to hire attorneys trained and \n     capable of assisting homeowners of owner-occupied homes with \n     mortgages in default, in danger of default, or subject to or \n     at risk of foreclosure who have legal issues that cannot be \n     handled by counselors already employed by such \n     intermediaries, and (2) support NRC partnerships with State \n     and local legal organizations and organizations described in \n     section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and \n     exempt from tax under section 501(a) of that Code with \n     demonstrated relevant legal experience in home foreclosure \n     law, as such experience is determined by the Chief Executive \n     Officer of NRC: Provided further, That for the purpose of the \n     prior proviso the term ``relevant experience'' means \n     experience representing homeowners in negotiations and or \n     legal proceedings aimed at preventing or mitigating \n     foreclosure or providing legal research and technical legal \n     expertise to community based organizations whose goal is to \n     reduce, prevent, or mitigate foreclosure: Provided further, \n     That of the amounts provided for in the prior provisos the \n     NRC shall give priority consideration to counseling \n     intermediaries and legal organizations that (1) provide legal \n     assistance in the 100 metropolitan statistical areas (as \n     defined by the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget) with the highest home foreclosure rates, and (2) have \n     the capacity to begin using the financial assistance within \n     90 days after receipt of the assistance.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I spoke earlier about the compelling \nneed for this amendment. It would add money to NeighborWorks to be able \nto help them add more legal staff to help people workout a plan to stay \nin their homes. This amendment adds $37.5 million to the bill for the \nNeighborWorks Program to do three things: Help counseling groups hire \nmore attorneys and paralegals to help with the foreclosure crisis, it \nwould also provide money to legal organizations to train more attorneys \nand paralegals in foreclosure law, and also hire the people to train \ncounselors and nonprofit groups in basic foreclosure law to help people \ndo their workouts.\n  Many of my constituents and also constituents nationwide were victims \nof predatory lending practices, schemes, and scams. It is because of \nthe complexity of dealing with these foreclosure increases that \nnonprofit counseling organizations need more legal help. That is why I \nam offering this amendment. It is to help those trying to have workouts \nto their foreclosure problems, while we are giving considerable \nbailouts to the people who caused the problem.\n  This is a second-degree amendment to the Murray amendment. I know it \nwill be considered at the appropriate time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4401, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I seek recognition to modify Sanders-\nDurbin amendment No. 4401, and I send the modification to the desk.\n  The original amendment I offered would cap all interest rates on \nconsumer loans using a similar formula that Senator D'Amato used when \nhe offered an amendment to cap interest rates on credit cards in 1991.\n  Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect to the \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is standing.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, that amendment passed on the floor by a \nvote of 74 to 19. The modification I have sent to the desk would only \ncap interest rates on mortgages insured by the Federal Housing \nAdministration. If this amendment were in law today, interest rates for \nmortgages insured by the FHA could be no higher than 14 percent, which \nis 8 percentage points above what the IRS charges to income tax \ndeadbeats.\n  The reason I am modifying this amendment is because if cloture is \ninvoked on this legislation, capping interest rates on all consumer \nloans would not be germane. But capping interest rates on mortgages \ninsured by the FHA would be germane to the underlying bill. In the \nfuture I will have more to say about this amendment. That is where we \nare.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n[[Page S2723]]\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a maximum rate of interest for loans insured \n  under title II of the National Housing Act, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 6, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n       (c) Maximum Insured Mortgage Loan Rate.--Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, the annual percentage rate \n     applicable to any loan that is insured under title II of the \n     National Housing Act may not exceed by more than 8 percentage \n     points the rate established under section 6621(a)(2) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4485\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I call up Sanders amendment No. 4485.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4392\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss with \nthe chairman of the committee the status of the bill and the pendency \nof my amendment No. 4392. This is a very important amendment which \nwould give relief to homeowners with variable rate mortgages where \nthere is foreclosure action, where they suddenly find the monthly \npayments increased unexpectedly from as much as $1,400 to $1,900, which \nthey cannot afford and then their house goes into foreclosure. The \nborrowers do not understand that, and frequently there is \nmisrepresentation, fraud.\n  This amendment differs markedly from the Durbin amendment, which was \ndefeated, which would have had a serious impact on the availability of \nlenders to put up money if there is undue interference with the \ncontractual rights.\n  This amendment protects the homeowners. It does little harm to the \nfluidity of the availability to get loans.\n  We are moving toward a cloture vote at 2:30 p.m. By all indications, \ncloture is going to be invoked, although I intend to fight it, to talk \nabout it in the caucus which will be held in a few minutes.\n  On the Republican side, we talked about denying cloture in order to \ngive Members an opportunity to have their amendments heard and voted \non, and I intend to press that issue. I was prepared to vote on this \namendment last Thursday, when I was taken from the floor to go to a \nJudiciary Committee hearing because the expectation of another \nRepublican covering it was not fulfilled. So I had to go over to the \nhearing as ranking member because we had a number of nominees in the \nJudiciary Committee hearing. Now I find we are moving to cloture, and \nthere is no opportunity for a vote.\n  In my judgment, that is not the way this place ought to operate. I \nknow the chairman of the committee is bound by leadership decisions, \nbut I hope we can find a way to get a vote on this amendment. I know \nthere are other Members who have amendments who want votes.\n  May I ask the chairman for a response?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague from \nPennsylvania, I appreciate the substance of the idea he has offered \nand, of course, the amendment by Senator Durbin as well. I will not \nbelabor my colleagues with the history of why it is that provision \nexists.\n  There were about 10 or 12 of us who strenuously objected to the \nbankruptcy reform bill. So I had problems with that bill across the \nboard. I will not go into all that here. Let me try and frame this \nagain.\n  The majority leader, back about a week or so ago, talked with the \nRepublican leader about the possibility of us breaking this logjam that \nexisted, where nothing could even be debated on the housing issue. So \nthe idea was Senator Shelby and myself were designated by our \nrespective leaders to try to come up with a consensus package of ideas, \none Republicans and Democrats, by and large, could support to come out \nwith as a core, and from that other amendments would be offered and \nadded along the way, and if there was consensus, we would try to add \nthose.\n  It is a complicated process, but it was the only way we were going to \nmove beyond the gridlock that was allowing no debate whatsoever.\n  I am in the position, obviously, of trying to accomplish what our \nleader is trying to achieve--and he should and I applaud him for it--of \ntrying to get us moving on this issue. We are losing 8,000 people a day \nin foreclosure and the country and the economy is suffering terribly \nand we were in gridlock on this issue.\n  There are some very meritorious ideas. Those who have been in this \nposition of managing legislation, of trying to get it through, know \nfrom time to time you are confronted with substantively agreeing with \nwhat a colleague is offering but find yourself in the position of \nwhere, to move the product along, you do not agree at that particular \ntime to deal with the issue for a variety of reasons.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. Let me finish the thought. The idea is we are watching the \nlegislation, quite candidly, because it is a tax bill, with which \nSenator Grassley and Senator Baucus are dealing. All of a sudden, we \nfound ourselves dealing with other issues. That is not to say this is \none. This is one that could clearly relate to the subject matter. There \nare others dealing with energy policy and the like. It is one of the \nfew vehicles that may move. So I understand the frustrations people may \nhave about putting something on this bill.\n  The fact is, we could be here endlessly and fail to get a housing \nbill--albeit short of what I would like or others would like--to get us \nto a conference with the House to do something about this issue. We can \nstay the rest of this week or next week and debate a variety of \namendments or try to get moving to get something accomplished.\n\n  That, I believe, is the motivation behind the majority leader, and I \nwill let Senator Shelby talk for the minority leader. That is the \ngeneral thought. That is not to suggest these other ideas do not have \nmerit or do not have value, including the idea promoted by the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. There is a reason why the leadership is responsible \nfor trying to move product through here that may not include every idea \neveryone has that they would like to see added to legislation.\n  My hope is cloture will be invoked, that we can go forward, and there \ncan be amendments in postcloture, and if they are germane and deal with \nthe issues at hand, then we will try to accommodate them and, where we \nhave consensus, add them and come to some closure and move forward.\n  This is not the end of the debate. This is not the end of ideas. We \nwill have hearings this week in the committee. We have proposals we are \ngoing to bring up in our committee in markup in the next couple weeks, \nand we will be back on the floor with other ideas directly related to \nthis subject matter. We are merely trying to move this subject along to \nachieve some of the results involved.\n  I admire what the Senator is trying to do. He and I have worked on a \nlot of issues over the years and certainly this idea. As my colleague \nfrom Alabama knows, when Senator Durbin's amendment was offered, I told \nmy colleagues this is one area where I am going to be supportive of \nthat effort to deal with primary residences.\n  I agree with what my colleague wants to achieve, but there are other \nconsiderations we are trying to accomplish with this legislation.\n  I will be happy to respond to a question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the problem with the argument by the \nchairman is that looking to the future, the reality is that nothing \nwill happen. It is a long way from the representation, which I know the \nchairman makes in very good faith, to have a bill come out of committee \nand come back to the floor, in light of what has happened on the \ncalendar. It is just that the chances are so small, it cannot remotely \nbe relied upon.\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\n  When the chairman makes the comment about postcloture germaneness, \nthe Senate rules on what is germane are so arcane as to be un-\nunderstandable, just un-understandable. Here we have a housing bill. \nWhat could be more material to a housing bill when foreclosures are \nhappening across the country as we speak? The Senator from Connecticut \ncomments about the high rate of foreclosures, and this is an amendment \nwhich seeks to stop the foreclosures, and it seeks to stop the \nforeclosures where the lender has provided an instrument, which is a \nvariable rate mortgage, that the borrower does not understand; it has \nnot been explained; there are probably misrepresentations in many cases \nand probably fraud in many cases. That is why this amendment opens up \nthe court to make a determination of that.\n  It does not impede upon the fluidity of the market and the \navailability of capital, such as the Durbin amendment did, which \nchanged the principal sum.\n  The legislation which is coming out of the Congress and what is \nhappening on the administration is very heavily tilted to Wall Street \nand not to Main Street. Those are the expressions. It is the little guy \nwho is not being taken care of.\n  I have admired what the Senator from Connecticut has had to say about \nthat. This bill is imbalanced--a bailout of Bear Stearns but you cannot \nprotect the borrower who has a variable rate mortgage which he did not \nunderstand, where the rates have ballooned and he is being foreclosed. \nThat is not fair, and that is not right.\n  This bill is not balanced. It has a loss carried forward, which I \nthink is a good provision, but that does not help the little guy. It \nhas a tax credit for somebody who buys a house where the mortgage is in \nforeclosure, but that does not keep the homeowner in the house. I don't \nthink the Senate ought to move ahead. This is not half a loaf, this is \na crumb. This bill is a crumb.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have been notified that at least one \nMember, on the side of my good friend from Pennsylvania, will object to \nany process going forward. So maybe he can spend some time in his \nconference lunch to convince some of his colleagues to be more \nsupportive of some of these ideas.\n  This is not a crumb, let me say to my colleague from Pennsylvania. \nThe idea we are modernizing the FHA is critically important. The fact \nwe have money in here for disclosure, we have resources for counseling, \nthe fact we are getting resources back to the States, $4 billion to \nassist them as they try to deal with the problems in their local \ncommunities, the fact we are providing some tax support for people to \nmove into foreclosed property so we don't add to the supply is \ncritically important as well. These are some very solid ideas.\n  There are some provisions in the bill, I will be the first to admit, \nfrankly, had I written this all by myself without having to deal with \nother people who care about some of these issues, I would not have \nincluded.\n  This is far more than a crumb in terms of trying to deal with this \nissue. More needs to be done, but the suggestion somehow that the \ncommunity development block grants, counseling, disclosure, and \nmodernization of the FHA and raising loan limits and the like are \ninsignificant is to fail to understand what is in this bill.\n  More can be done, I do not disagree. But the suggestion that what we \nhave done falls into that category is a vast exaggeration in terms of \nwhat we have been trying to accomplish, and more will be done with this \nissue as well.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, metaphors are meant to be extreme. We \ncannot quantify a crumb as opposed to a loaf of bread. But no one would \nsay this is half a loaf. The criticism of this bill has largely come \nfrom the chairman of the committee who has said it does not go far \nenough.\n  Mr. DODD. Agreed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. When we have foreclosures across the country on variable \nrate mortgages and no action is being taken to deal with them--let me \nask the Senator from Connecticut: If we consider the action which has \nbeen taken by the Fed on Bear Stearns and otherwise and we consider \nwhat this legislation is, isn't it significantly out of balance between \nMain Street and Wall Street?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nwhat was done in the Bear Stearns-JPMorgan Chase issue, I would argue \nalternatives may have been available. In the final analysis, what was \ndone that Sunday night to allow the merger of Bear Stearns with \nJPMorgan Chase--and this is the conclusion, I think, unanimously of our \ncommittee, having had a hearing on it--was probably the right decision, \ngiven the alternative of bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and what could have \nhappened on that Monday had the action not been taken by the Fed, the \nTreasury, and the New York Fed. That is one separate issue. It is a \nlegitimate point to say, shouldn't we do something where we can help \nout communities and individuals and to get this economy moving in the \nright direction.\n  I made that case for a year now, not just in the wake of Bear \nStearns. We had our first meetings on this matter in March of last year \ntrying to get something done. I am not going to take a backseat to \nanyone who discovered this issue in the last couple days and how much \nthey care about it. I have been at it for 13 months, trying to get \nthings moving in this area.\n  We are doing some things here. My colleagues know very well what \nobjections there have been to doing anything in this area: Let the \nmarket take care of it; the problem has been contained; no further \nproblems. Quite the contrary. We are now down to the business of doing \nsomething about it, and I regret we are not accommodating everyone on \nevery idea they have the moment they want it considered.\n  We are doing our best, Senator Shelby and I and members of the \ncommittee, to come out with something. Four weeks ago, we couldn't do \nwhat we are doing now. We couldn't even debate the issue, I say to my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania.\n  I am suggesting to the Senator from Pennsylvania this bill does a lot \nmore than provide crumbs. It goes to the heart of very significant \nissues that need to be dealt with. There are other matters that need to \nbe dealt with.\n  As my colleague knows, I agree with him about what bankruptcy courts \ncan do with primary residences. I also understand the history of the \nseventies, why that provision was included, but I believe the times \nhave changed, and under this fact situation, we ought to allow a \nbankruptcy judge to be able to modify that agreement to allow that \nindividual to stay in their home.\n  I thought Senator Durbin was right with his idea. The Senator from \nPennsylvania has a more modest idea in this area and may attract a few \nmore votes than the 36 we got with Senator Durbin's amendment. So I am \nwilling to support that, but the idea of trying to come to some closure \nis also important so we can move on, get with the House, resolve some \nof these matters, and come back. That is what this chairman is trying \nto accomplish. That is what we were doing last week when we were \ndirected to do so by the leaders of our respective parties.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, a final word. I don't disagree with what \nthe chairman has had to say about what was done with Bear Stearns. I \nthink we are all opposed--I certainly am opposed--to bailouts when \nhighly sophisticated Wall Street operators are looking for big profits \nand their judgment is bad and they lose money. They ought not come to \nthe taxpayers for a bailout. I do recognize the situation with Bear \nStearns could have had a domino effect, which could have been \ndevastating. So I don't disagree with that action.\n  I am not going to retreat from my crumb metaphor, but let the record \nshow that on the question to the chairman as to whether there was not \nsubstantial imbalance between what has happened with the Fed and what \nis happening with proposals in the Congress, substantial imbalance \nbetween Wall Street and the Main Street, the chairman did not deny \nthat, did not deal with it.\n  Let me close with a question, if the chairman would give favorable \nconsideration to my amendment when he reconvenes the Banking Committee \nand take up this issue in the future.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we will be happy to consider it. It is a \nmatter\n\n[[Page S2725]]\n\nunder the proper jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, of which the \nSenator is a member, and it is not in the jurisdiction of the Banking \nCommittee. That is one of the other issues we face. If he is unable, as \na leading member of that committee, as a former chairman of that \ncommittee, to have that adopted by his committee and come forward, we \ncertainly would consider it.\n  I point out we only had 36 votes for the Durbin amendment. I regret \nthat. We only had 12 of us who opposed the bankruptcy reform bill for 6 \nyears around here. Those matters we widely endorsed and supported, \nincluding the efforts, as my colleagues may recall, that I tried to do \nwith credit card companies that are gouging the public on a daily \nbasis. So I will take a back seat to no one in my determination to get \nfar better reforms out of the bankruptcy proceedings in the country, \nand we will certainly do our best. But I want to be realistic with my \ncolleague as well. Unfortunately, the Senator from Pennsylvania and I \ndon't represent a majority in this body when it comes to that issue. \nThe realities are that we only have about half of us who seem to agree \nwith the two of us on this matter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if the Judiciary Committee did report out \nthe Durbin amendment favorably, and my amendment on a second degree was \ndefeated along party lines, it is true there is primary jurisdiction in \nthe Judiciary Committee. But when this matter comes up before the \nBanking, Housing and Urban Development Committee, these ideas could be \nincorporated, and I would urge my colleague to do just that.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I know there have been a number of \nother amendments, Mr. President, and I have just been informed that \nobjection will be expressed on every amendment, I guess, that is being \noffered by a Member of the other side on this matter. So I would inform \nmy colleagues where we stand procedurally.\n  We are going to have our caucus luncheons where, I am sure, this will \nbe the subject of some discussion as we try to move forward, but, \nagain, I thank Senator Reid, the majority leader. He has a thankless \njob when it comes to these issues, and he asked Senator Shelby and I to \ntry to do our best to come up with a consensus package. Granted, now \nthe subject matter has become of great interest to everyone, and it \nshould, and we have tried to do just that, to put together a consensus \npackage--not an easy thing to accomplish in this body, but we tried to \ndo that. Again, we will try to move forward with other ideas that we \ncan incorporate through our committee and others.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas wants to be heard on this \nmatter as well, and I thank her for her patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, do I need to ask unanimous consent for \nmore time?\n  I ask unanimous consent to extend the time for an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I apologize to my colleagues. I know I \nam taking up time now when folks are ready to leave and do other things \nand then come back, but I do feel strongly about this amendment and I \njust wanted to voice my concerns.\n  This is an amendment that Senator Smith and I are offering, along \nwith Senator Snowe and many others--Senators Kerry, Stabenow, Levin, \nSchumer, Kennedy. It is a good amendment, and it will encourage our \nemployers to provide group legal service benefits with an emphasis on \nreal estate counseling for their employees. This is something which \ngroup legal service plans--which have been around since the 1970s--were \nintended to do and exactly what the Center for Responsible Lending said \nshould be one of our top priorities in this effort in dealing with the \nhousing crisis. We should be encouraging and incentivizing preventive \nlegal services.\n  What the center had cited increasing are those incentives for \nmortgage counseling legal services. It is a key policy recommendation \nfor dealing with what we find ourselves in now--the crisis situation we \nare in. Borrowers need affordable and available legal review \nof mortgages, mortgage-related documents, and financing and loan \nmodifications. These are complex transactions and sometimes, \noftentimes, folks in States such as Arkansas and Montana have nowhere \nelse to go. Legal services provide them that kind of proactive \ninvolvement in making sure they are making the right decisions.\n\n  We should be giving the average American homeowner access to that \nlegal advice so he or she can feel confident in the mortgages they are \ngetting into, so that when, if, unfortunately, God forbid, things do go \nwrong, they can receive advice about their rights and responsibilities \nand what they are dealing with in foreclosure, what options are \navailable to them in dealing with these crises.\n  This is a good addition to this bill. It is positive. It is all of \nwhat we have been talking about that we need. It is consumer friendly. \nIt is something we have used in this country. Unfortunately, section \n120 of the Internal Revenue Code has lapsed. That section of the code \nwas intended to provide the tax incentives so that our employers could \nset up and offer group legal service plans. Since it has lapsed, \nvirtually no new group legal benefit plans have been created, and many \nemployers are dropping those that do exist.\n  So I would encourage us all to look at what we are trying to \naccomplish in this bill; not to just throw things overboard because \nsomebody else didn't get what they wanted, but that we look at what we \nare trying to do for the American people. We should encourage these \nplans that provide our working Americans with access to legal advice. \nThey review those mortgage documents, they assist those individuals in \nworking with the lender to modify those loans, creating forbearance \nagreements and assistance in the restructuring of loans, and it \nprovides that much needed counseling in foreclosure litigation when it \nis needed.\n  I thank Chairman Dodd and the ranking member, Senator Shelby, for \ntheir patience because I know they see all of us in these frantic modes \nof wanting to improve the bill and wanting to provide something that we \nknow has been beneficial to the people we represent, and we know it can \nbe beneficial again, and this is the appropriate place to put it.\n  So I just encourage that working through legal services, particularly \nin rural States such as mine, it is one of those places where people \nhave to go. They do have the confidence of going to their neighbor, \ntheir country lawyer, and being able to get those services. They may \nnot have a big, huge housing agency they can go to for the kinds of \ncounsel they need, and these are good services that have proven \nthemselves in years passed. Yet we find that employers cannot afford to \nprovide them because we have lost that section in the Internal Revenue \nCode.\n  So I do thank all my colleagues who have cosponsored this amendment. \nWe have worked on this for quite some time. I say a big thanks also to \nthe groups that have endorsed our amendment--the American Bar \nAssociation, the American Prepaid Legal Services Institute, the \nInternational Union, UAW, AFSCME, and the laborers. So many different \ngroups realize hard-working Americans who get caught in these \ncircumstances need this kind of assistance.\n  I thank the Chair for his indulgence, and certainly my colleagues, \nthe chairman, and the ranking member for trying to work with us. And I \nguess, Mr. President, and Mr. Chairman, my only option is to ask for a \nunanimous consent; is that correct? Is there something we can work \nthrough? Can I ask unanimous consent for regular order with respect to \nmy amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is not in regular \norder.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to take every \nconsideration as they move forward in putting together this bill; that \nif there is any possible way we can work through making sure these \nindividuals who really have nowhere else to go will be able to have the \ntypes of services they are used to having in years passed, and \nproviding the incentives the employers need in order to be able to \nprovide those services because they are clearly not providing them now. \nIt is not something small businesses can do.\n\n[[Page S2726]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will ask for 2 additional minutes, if I \ncan, to respond to my colleague from Arkansas.\n  First of all, I agree with her totally about the value. Over the many \nyears I have been a long-time supporter of these legal services offices \nand the job they do on behalf of people all across the country, \nparticularly in rural America, and the difference they make. So I am in \ncomplete agreement with her about the value of this approach.\n  I would inform her that the regular order would be asking consent, \nafter cloture has been invoked, to bring up the matter she wants to \nbring up. It is a tax matter and one that would require the consent of \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member. So it is \na matter where we are leaving it up to that jurisdiction to respond. So \nI want to be careful. I don't know how Senator Baucus feels about that. \nI don't want to put words in his mouth at all. I suspect he has the \nsame sort of reaction as I do, and it is a positive one.\n  I am grateful for my colleague's understanding the situation we are \nin, trying to accommodate as many ideas as we can and to move from here \nto the next stage and deal with other aspects of the legislation. We \ncouldn't have gotten here without the majority leader insisting, and \nreally with the minority leader, to come together and allow us to bring \nup this package. So there are a lot of very good ideas and ones I \napplaud and welcome, but in the interest of trying to move forward, we \nare not going to be able to accommodate all of them.\n  I am not suggesting that will happen in this case, but I again \nappreciate her recognition that what we are trying to accomplish and \ndeal with here is difficult. It is serious. As she points out, we have \na lot of people suffering every single day--I have been making that \ncase for 12 months--and we haven't been able to have a debate about \nthis subject until last week. So to the extent that we have gotten that \nfar along, that is some achievement.\n  I hope now that we are in the debate we can do some valuable and \nworthwhile works that will make a difference, and her suggestion \ncontributes to that. So my hope is we will be able to accommodate this \nin the package as well.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the chairman for his comments, and I certainly \nwant to express this is a time-appropriate solution to the problems \nthat exist, and I hope we will give every consideration to it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/08/senate-section/article/S2726-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:42 p.m., recessed until \n2:16 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer \n(Mr. Carper).\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment \nso I may offer an amendment.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am most surprised to hear my colleagues \non the other side object to my request to call up an amendment, to have \nit called up and be heard. I thought the Senate was here to do \nbusiness. I think it is reasonable as part of doing that business that \nwe should address the largest item in this bill that involves passing a \ncost on to our children, which is the net operating loss proposal.\n  Now, the way this net operating loss works is that homebuilders--that \nis who it is directed toward, although anybody can take advantage of \nit; I do not think it is limited to the homebuilders who built all of \nthose homes and made these massive amounts of money by offering people \nsubprime mortgages which they then took the proceeds from over the last \n4 or 5 years, which subprime mortgages have now caused this Nation to \ngo through a massive contraction and which have created one of the \nlargest bubbles in the history of Government, in the history of \ncommerce. Those folks, having made a huge amount of money--I mean \nmassive amounts of money, and, in fact, in the last quarter, they were \nthe largest earning sector in our economy--those folks are now asking \nthat they get an additional $20 billion bailout, $20 billion bailout by \nallowing them, now that they are losing money, to go back and take a \ntax deduction of their losses against the gains which they had in prior \nyears.\n  This is as if you said to someone in business, say somebody running a\n\n[[Page S2727]]\n\nsmall grocery store: OK, if you make money for 4 years, make a lot of \nmoney, and then you find you cannot compete or you have made some \nbusiness error in your judgment and you lose money for a couple of \nyears, we, the Government, are going to come in and give you insurance \nso you never lose money. You are able to go back during the years when \nyou made money to recover the taxes you paid and use it today to give \nyou profits.\n  My goodness, I think Adam Smith would be rolling over in his grave to \nhear this concept of economics. This is Komisar economics where nobody \ncan lose, except for the taxpayer in the next generation who has to pay \nthis bill. Remember, this $20 billion is going to be paid by somebody \nbecause it is being spent around here in the operation of the \nGovernment. And who is going to pay it? Well, it is obviously not going \nto be the homebuilder, the large corporations which ran up these huge \nprofits. They are actually going to take that money in, take it in as \nincome. No, that is going to be paid for by John and Mary Smith, John \nand Mary Smith working for a living today, or their children because it \nwill go on the Federal debt--$20 billion on the Federal debt as a \nresult of this little piece of chicanery.\n  It is unbelievable that we would claim this was a stimulus to begin \nwith. In fact, if we are in an economic slowdown and if that economic \nslowdown is tied to the housing industry, none of these revenues will \nbenefit that economic slowdown because they do not come in this year. \nThey will be claimed this year, and they will be reimbursed next year. \nI think the estimate is that almost all of these recovery costs, \nrecovery of taxes owed and paid as a result of getting this extra loss \ncarryback, will occur in the next budget year, 2009. So, as a practical \nmatter, it is not going to help in the next 6 months, which is when all \nof the major economists who have discussed this issue say we need some \nstimulus in the economy. No, it is not. It is simply a bonus payment \nfrom one group of people, the American taxpayers and their children, \nhard-working Americans, to another group of people, the speculative \nhousing industry that ran up these huge expansions in the housing \ninventory over the last 3 years and then sold them in the subprime \nmarket in a way which many people have said in many instances were not \nappropriate, that they took advantage of the borrowers and then took \nthose proceeds in as income, paid taxes on them, and now they want \ntheir taxes back because they are suddenly losing money.\n  Well, if you made money for 3 or 4 years--and a lot of money--you \nshould not have a bonus given to you during the years when you are not \nmaking money simply because you happen to be one sector of this economy \ncalled the housing industry. In fact, just the opposite should happen, \nquite honestly. The market should be allowed to work here relative to \nthe large housing manufacturers.\n  There is some legitimacy for doing something about homeowners who got \nhit with a subprime mortgage which is resetting at a rate that is \nastronomical on them today and they are willing to pay and could pay \nfor and maintain their home if they had a reasonable mortgage rate. \nThere is some reason for arguing those folks might and should get some \nsupport, or at least some assistance so they can stay in their homes, \nthey can continue to pay their mortgages.\n  But there is no practical commercial argument which justifies taking \ntax dollars from working Americans and paying them to homebuilders \nbecause homebuilders suddenly start to lose money--after they had great \nyears. It is not like this has been a distressed industry over a long \nperiod of time. This is an industry which has always been cyclical.\n  This cycle was a creation of their excess, nothing else. They were \ngreedy. They built a lot of homes the market did not need. They sold \nthem to people who could not afford them. They sold them with \ninstruments which were totally inappropriately structured: the subprime \nmortgages. Then they took all that profit, and they used it. But, \nunfortunately, they had to pay taxes on that profit. So now they want \ntheir taxes back, and they want the American people to subsidize them \non it.\n  Well, under no color of an open market, of a capitalist system--of \neven a marginally capitalist system; I do not think even France would \naccept this as a concept--should somebody who made a huge amount of \nmoney, created a speculative bubble, benefit from the taxpayers when \nthat bubble bursts.\n  Yes, the people who were harmed inappropriately, the folks who bought \nthose subprimes and did not understand the nature of them and maybe \nwere misled relative to the nature of them, they justifiably could have \nsome support, as long as they are the primary owners of that home and \nit was not bought for speculation and they are able to support a \nreasonable mortgage rate. Maybe there is some way to adjust that.\n  But this bill does not do that in this area. This net loss carry-back \nis simply a gift--pure and simply a gift--to one segment of our \nindustrial community which participated in a very lucrative few years \nand now is having a hard time, created the problem which we now \nconfront, and now wants to be given a gift. Unfortunately, this gift \nhas to be paid for, as I said before.\n  We are going to run, this year, it looks like, a deficit somewhere of \naround $400 billion to $420 billion. That is the deficit we are going \nto run. That is up from a deficit which was under $200 billion last \nyear. That is a huge increase in our deficit.\n  Now, who pays a deficit? Who pays for a deficit? Well, our children \npay for it. All this goes on to our children's backs. They are the ones \nwho pay the cost of paying off the debt, which is borrowed in order to \nfinance a deficit.\n\n  So why would we want to say to them: OK, future Americans--young \npeople coming through school today, going to college, thinking about \nstarting a family, thinking about maybe having children and sending \ntheir kids to college--why would we want to say to them: We are going \nto stick you with a $20 billion bill so we can take care of the large \nhousing manufacturers in this country who basically created a major \ndisruption in our economy by putting on the market a massive inventory \nof homes we did not need and then using practices which were at the \nmargin to draw people into buying those homes through subprime mortgage \nlending?\n  Why would we say that to them? How can we possibly, as a government, \njustify doing that to the next generation? But that is what we are \ngoing to do with this bill. We are putting $20 billion on their backs. \nWhere is the money going? It goes into the pocket, primarily--at least \nthat is the game plan; it is not specifically written so--it will be \ntaken advantage of solely by manufacturers of homes. And I suspect \nthere are going to be some other industries which will suffer losses in \nthis economy that may take advantage of it. But it was written \nprimarily to take advantage of the homebuilder industry, which is \nobviously an honorable industry, but it is also an industry which goes \nthrough cycles.\n  In this cycle, there is no reason we should be stepping up with this \nspecial gift to that part of our economy when we do not have any money \nto make the gift with, when we have to borrow the money to pay for the \ngift.\n  So that is why I have offered this amendment--or tried to offer this \namendment. Now, it seems to me if everybody is so comfortable with this \nlegislation and this idea of a net loss carry-back being extended and \nexpanded, they should be willing to vote on this amendment. Is there no \ncourage on the other side of the aisle? Are the sponsors of this \nconcept afraid to vote and stand up for this bill with this proposal? \nIt appears so.\n  I am not offering an alternative. I am just saying let's have an up-\nor-down vote on whether we should give a $20 billion gift to one \nsegment of our commercial society at the expense of the next generation \nthat has to pay the debt for this bill. I am just saying, stand up and \nbe counted, so to say, as to whether you are for or against this \namendment.\n  So, again, I will renew my request. I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside and that my amendment relating to net \nloss carry forward, which strikes the provisions of the net loss carry \nforward, be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I object.\n\n[[Page S2728]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, I guess that makes the point. It is too bad. I would \nhope people would ask why. Why can't we have a vote? What is the fear \nout there? Are we so concerned about this segment of our industry that \nwe are not willing to vote up or down on whether this type of a $20 \nbillion event should occur? I hope not. It seems to me it is reasonable \nthat the Congress should vote on that. The Senate should vote on that.\n  Mr. President, $20 billion is a lot of money. Do you know $20 billion \nwould run the State of New Hampshire for 5 years? This is a lot of \nmoney. This is big-time dollars. Twenty billion dollars is going to \ncost our children a lot because it compounds with interest. You just do \nnot borrow it. You borrow it and have to pay interest on it. Of course, \nthe interest gets paid to the Chinese or the Indians or the Saudis \nbecause they are the ones who probably buy the debt.\n  So not only do we end up with a $20 billion bill we pass on to our \nkids, but we end up with our kids having to pay interest to the Saudis \nor the Chinese to support that debt. Also, that one segment of our \nsociety which participated in the robustness and the excitement of \nlarge economic expansion, and maybe inflated that expansion rather \ndramatically, does not have to bear the burden of their excesses.\n  Well, as I said, Adam Smith would be a little stunned to find this is \nthe way the market has worked and the Government of the United States--\nwhich is allegedly the Government of a capitalist system--functions. So \nI will probably renew this request later on because it does seem to me, \nsince this is by far the single biggest spending item in this bill, or \ntax item in this bill, it should have an up-or-down vote and an open \ndebate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, just a couple comments about the points \nmade by the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  No. 1, it is not a $20 billion bill. That is not accurate at all. It \nis, first of all, about $6 billion. It is over 10 years. So it is much \nless than what the Senator makes it sound like it is.\n  Second, we all know the housing problems that occurred in this \ncountry--the subprime mortgage problems, as well as other mortgages in \ndistress and home buyers in distress. The figure I saw was that about \n10 percent of American homes are underwater, meaning the value of the \nhomes for 10 percent of Americans is much less than the mortgage on \ntheir homes.\n  This is a very complicated problem. It requires a complicated \nsolution. Senator Dodd is to be commended for the Banking Committee's \nprovisions in this housing bill. We in the Finance Committee wrote the \ntax provisions in this bill, and they are designed to help lots of \ndifferent areas, lots of different people, in lots of different ways.\n  One is the mortgage revenue bond provisions, which helps States \nfinance new mortgages for people, homeowners. Another is the tax credit \nfor distressed homes. That helps people. That helps home buyers. That \nis in this legislation.\n  Another is to help give a little break to people who do not itemize \ntheir income tax returns but have property taxes so they can get a \nbreak on their property taxes. So we provide in this bill that if you \nhave property taxes, you get at least a $500 deduction against your \nincome taxes if you are single, $1,000 if you are married, irrespective \nof whether you itemize or use the standard deduction. That helps \npeople.\n  There is a business provision in here to give a break to \nhomebuilders. Why? Because homebuilders are going out of business. This \nis not a typical homebuilders' housing cycle we are in now. This is \natypical.\n  A lot of areas in our country are very distressed. A lot of \nhomebuilders are distressed, laying off a lot of people. The number of \nconstruction jobs is down--in the hundreds of thousands. For \nhomebuilders' jobs, it is of a similar magnitude. These are people with \nhammers and nails going out building houses who no longer are building \nany houses, and they are laid off.\n  So this bill--basically, in that one provision with respect to \nhomebuilders--kind of evens things out a little bit so homebuilders do \nnot have to lay quite so many people off and they can still keep \nbuilding some homes, which helps prevent a further deterioration of the \nvalue of the homes in a certain area. This is nowhere close to solving \nthe problem, but it helps a little bit. That is why this is in this \nlegislation.\n  So we have several provisions we in the Finance Committee passed out \nto help individuals. This one helps businesses in the business of \nhomebuilding and homebuilders employ people, and those are the people \nwho have lost their jobs.\n  So we are trying to help that sector a little bit so those people who \nbuild homes--some of them--can get back to work and not be laid off and \nalso so some homes that might otherwise not be built might now be built \nto help alleviate the problem.\n  Homebuilders are not the cause of the problem. The problem, frankly, \nis worldwide where cash was slushing around, which helped create this \nsituation where lenders were very easily lending money. The terms were \nvery easy. People were enticed into buying homes. Mortgage brokers, for \nexample, were very aggressive in encouraging people to buy homes with \nno downpayments and whatnot.\n  But homebuilders--they are not the problem. They are building the \nhomes. Now, they are feeling the pain, as a lot of other Americans are, \nand I believe--and I think the Finance Committee believes--this is one \nof several provisions which will help address the housing crisis a \nlittle bit. That is why I think it should be in this bill, and I very \nmuch hope the Senate approves the bill if not today, by tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for the utmost urgency of recognizing the University \nof Kansas basketball team's accomplishments last night.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Recognizing the University of Kansas Basketball Team\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am delighted my colleagues granted me \nthis special privilege to speak as in morning business on something so \nimportant. This is a bit personal if you are a Kansan. The sport of \nbasketball was invented in Kansas by James Naismith in 1891, and last \nnight it was perfected by the University of Kansas basketball team.\n  I don't know how many people got to watch it. What a fabulous game. I \nwas able to be there, which was a great delight. It went into an \novertime game with less than 3 seconds to play and a three-point shot \nby Mario Chalmers sent it into overtime. It was a classic of college \nbasketball. The whole place was in pandemonium. There were great teams \non both sides--Memphis and KU--playing this game. At the end of the \nday, Kansas came out with a victory. It was a fantastic night.\n  I congratulate the NCAA on the Final Four and the tournament. I think \nthey do a spectacular job of bringing people together and having a \ngreat venue. This game was in San Antonio last night, a fantastic \ncelebration of amateur athletics. These players are phenomenal in all \nthey can do. It is certainly a great day to be a Kansan, a great day to \nbe a Jayhawk.\n  My law school degree is from the University of Kansas. It is a great \nbasketball school, with four national championships, one added last \nnight. They have a great tradition of basketball at the school. I think \nwe have one of the best mascots in the country, the jayhawk, which most \npeople would recognize, being at the University of Kansas, but not \nknowing what it is. It has a civil war legacy in the fight over \nslavery, where Kansas was the State that started the fight on slavery, \nbeing settled by abolitionists. One of the\n\n[[Page S2729]]\n\nthings the proslavery forces were calling Kansas was jayhawkers, in a \nderisive way, but that then became a symbol much for the State and for \nthe University of Kansas. I like the heritage of that symbol as well.\n  Twenty years ago was the last time we won a basketball championship. \nThat one was Danny Manning and ``the miracles.'' He was a guy who went \non to play very well at the professional level. Danny Manning is now \ncoach at the University of Kansas. I can't name anybody else on that \nteam, but he was one who carried them forward.\n  Last night was a great team effort by a balanced team. I recognize as \nwell coach Bill Self. This was his first Final Four, and he wins it. \nAlong the way, he beat a rival school in basketball for Kansas. In \nNorth Carolina, there has been a long connection between North Carolina \nand Kansas. Dean Smith, a long-time coach at North Carolina, was from \nKansas. Roy Williams, a long-time coach at Kansas, was from North \nCarolina. There were a number of people in Kansas, in my State, who \nwere not particularly forgiving of Roy Williams going back to North \nCarolina even though he had given us a number of good years. I think on \nSaturday there was a lot of forgiveness. This was the first match \nbetween Kansas and North Carolina since he had left Kansas, and we were \nfortunate enough to be successful in that game. It was a great \ntournament overall.\n\n  As a wise sportsman famously said: ``It's never over until it's \nover,'' especially if Mario Chalmers has one more shot to take. \nSometimes big games are disappointments, but last night was certainly \nnot the case, as the Nation was treated to a classic in college \nbasketball. From James Naismith, as I mentioned, who invented the game \nin 1891, to the Kansas Jayhawks of 2008 that perfected the game, our \nschool has had a great history and a great legacy of basketball. \nThrough players like Wilt Chamberlain and Danny Manning, KU now has 13 \nFinal Four appearances and 3 national championships. It is fantastic \nwhat they have been able to accomplish.\n  Again, congratulations to the University of Kansas men's basketball \nteam for a great season, for a thrilling championship game, for writing \nanother amazing chapter in the storied history of Jayhawk basketball. \nAnd what goes along with that rich tradition is a number of different \nchants, but the one that has the most lasting memory with Jayhawkers is \n``Rock Chalk, Jayhawk,'' which we don't get to say on the Senate floor \nvery often. Congratulations to a fabulous team and a fabulous effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to speak about a housing matter. I \nhave two amendments, but I am only speaking about them today, I will \nnot be calling them up. I did want to speak very briefly and very \ngenerally about both of them.\n  There are two very important matters that come before us as parts of \nour debate on housing. The first involves appraisals. We know that one \nof the biggest concerns a lot of people have in attacking the problem \nof subprime mortgages and the aftermath of a lot of bad loans was that \nfaulty and sometimes fraudulent appraisals were part of that. The first \namendment I will speak of today deals with the question of how do we \nget a second independent appraisal for properties that are so-called \nflipped properties.\n  When you have a property that may go into foreclosure and then it is \nsold later, sometimes we have instances where property is sold at a \ngrossly inflated price that does not reflect the true value, and then \ndown the road another purchaser, a homeowner, would buy it, and then \nyou have extraordinary inflation, often fraudulent inflation of the \ncost of a property. Our office has worked closely with Senator Martinez \non this as well. What this amendment does is to make it very clear \nthat, in those instances where you have a house flipped within 180 days \nof the date of purchase, there will, in fact, be a second independent \nappraisal done.\n  Some of the work on this in the other body has been done by \nRepresentative Paul Kanjorski. He has worked on these issues for years. \nI commend him for his work in Congress on these and other matters that \npertain to housing and to the financial questions that arise with \nregard to affordable housing.\n  First of all, we want to make sure, in those instances that a second \nindependent appraisal is done, it would have to be by a qualified \nappraiser. That would mean the appraiser has to be certified in the \nState or somehow licensed in the State. And second, that the appraisal \nis performed in conformity with uniform standards of professional \nappraisal practice to make sure it is done the right way. We want to \nmake sure consumers are given a copy of that appraisal, that it is done \nthoroughly, and that a statement is made by the creditor that any \nappraisal prepared for the mortgage is for the sole use of the creditor \nand that the consumers may choose to have a separate appraisal \nconducted at their own expense.\n  There will be heavy penalties imposed for those who violate this. It \nis one way to deal with one of the various problems we encounter when \nit comes to the difficulties so many families are confronting right \nnow. The worst thing that can happen to a homeowner who saves money and \nborrows money to fulfill a dream of owning a home is to be presented \nwith a situation where they buy a home that has been grossly and \nfraudulently inflated beyond its value and they don't find out about \nthat until those who perpetrated the fraud are far away and have \nalready made their money. This will hold people in the market \naccountable, as they should be held accountable.\n  We will have more time to talk about it later.\n  I want to make another point about a separate amendment. In the city \nof Philadelphia, as in many of our major urban areas, housing is a \nterribly difficult challenge for so many people. In the city of \nPhiladelphia, we have more than 80,000--as HUD, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, officials would call them, clients--more than 80,000 \nclients in the city of Philadelphia who rely on HUD and the housing \nauthority there to provide affordable housing in that city.\n  A dispute has arisen about a number of things. We don't have to go \ninto the reasons for those disputes, but because of that dispute, now \nthere is an agreement that was worked out between HUD and the housing \nauthority called the Moving to Work Agreement which has allowed people \nnot just to have the benefit of an agreement that provides them with \nthe opportunity to live in housing that is safe and affordable, but \nalso this agreement has allowed the Philadelphia Housing Authority to \nuse the leverage of this agreement to borrow money and to finance other \nhousing priorities in the city of Philadelphia.\n  Because of that, because of the importance of that agreement, we want \nto make sure the agreement stays in place at least for a year. That is \nwhat the amendment Senator Specter and I have been working on does. \nThat is the reason for it, to give a 1-year extension so that the \nMoving to Work Agreement in the city of Philadelphia, with the U.S. \nHousing and Urban Development agency, stays in place for 1 year so we \ncan continue to work out an arrangement between the housing authority \nand HUD.\n  Unfortunately, we have not been successful in working for many months \non this. But I think it is critically important not to allow a \nbureaucratic fight between a housing authority and a Federal agency to \ninterfere with important services that are provided to Philadelphians \nwho benefit from this; some more than 80,000 Philadelphians.\n  Those are the two amendments I wish to speak about. We will have time \nlater as we proceed to deal with them more directly. I wished to make \nsure we make both thorough and accurate and independent appraisals a \npriority as well as to make sure that when we are dealing with a local \nhousing authority, we do not let a dispute prevent Philadelphians from \ngetting the benefit of the services provided in this case by the Moving \nto Work Agreement.\n\n[[Page S2730]]\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Colombia Free Trade Agreement\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today the administration sought to \nstrengthen America's ties with an already close ally by moving forward \nwith the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. Now it is up to Congress to \npass this very important piece of legislation.\n  The Colombia Free Trade Agreement is more than an act of friendship \nbetween allies. It would strengthen our security and strengthen our \neconomy. It would send a strong and unmistakable signal to our other \nallies in Latin America that the United States stands with those who \nsupport strong markets and free societies, especially in the face of \nthreats.\n  Colombia's support for free markets and Democratic reform under \nPresident Uribe has made it an even stronger ally of the United States \nin recent years, a very sharp contrast to its next-door neighbor, \nVenezuela. We cannot allow election-year politics in the United States \nto make a resurgent Colombia more vulnerable to its anti-America \nneighbor.\n  America got a closeup of Venezuela's dictator at the U.N., when he \nlikened an American President to the devil and predicted America's \ndemise. His anti-Americanism has not softened since that speech, nor \nhas the threat Hugo Chavez poses to regional stability. Chavez is a \ncorrosive influence in South America. He embraces state sponsors of \nterrorism such as Iran, for example, and he is aggressively courting \nlike-minded leaders of other Latin American countries in order to draw \na line in the sand between himself and his allies and America and its \nallies.\n  Now, most Latin American leaders such as President Uribe know allying \nthemselves with Chavez is harmful in the long run. Unfortunately, \nUribe's government has been severely tested by Chavez and his allies. \nEcuador supports, for example, terrorist proxies in Colombia. Chavez \nhas made it quite clear he supports Ecuador's efforts when he recently \nsent troops to the Colombian border.\n  Colombia has made tremendous progress. Not long ago, it appeared on \nthe verge of collapse. Entire regions of the country were essentially \nungoverned. Yet President Uribe, to his great credit, has pulled the \ncountry back from the brink.\n  The Colombia Free Trade Agreement is an important acknowledgment of \nthe strides Colombia has made. And its passage would send a strong \nsignal America is committed to Colombia's continued success and the \nsuccess of our other allies in the region.\n  Now, as important, the Colombia Free Trade Agreement would strengthen \nthe U.S. economy, our economy, at a time when Americans are searching \nfor some economic good news. Some seem to think our economy can somehow \ngrow without the trading partners. These people who are arguing that \nnonsense also say we are best served if we trade only with ourselves. \nHow absurd is that? In fact, the opposite is true. America needs \ntrading partners to buy the goods we are making in our country. This is \nespecially true when there is an imbalance in market access. The \nimbalance between the United States and Colombia is startling indeed.\n  Today, more than 90 percent of Colombian exports to the United States \nenter our country duty free. So they are getting 90 percent of their \nimports into our country duty free, even as American exporters face \nsteep barriers to selling American-made goods to Colombia.\n  Democrats and Republicans agree it was important for Colombian \nexporters to enjoy the benefits of increased access to our markets. Why \nwould we not want to give American products made by American workers \nthe same opportunity we are giving Colombians already in our market?\n  The current situation is totally unfair. Virtually all U.S. farm \ngoods are slammed with tariffs on their way down to Colombia, while \nvirtually all Colombian farm goods coming here enter the United States \nwithout any tariffs at all.\n  The beneficiary of this arrangement is abundantly clear, and it is \nnot U.S. workers or the economy they support. We hear a lot of rhetoric \nabout the need for fair trade. Permitting equal access to Colombian \nmarkets is the very essence of fair trade. That is what this free-trade \nagreement would do.\n  Looking at my own State, for example, more than one-sixth of all \nmanufacturing jobs in my State rely on exports. Kentucky exports about \n$15 billion in manufacturing goods every single year, including $67 \nmillion in exports to Colombia last year--a figure that is all but \ncertain to go up after this free-trade agreement is ratified.\n  In these economic times, we should be expanding overseas markets for \nAmerican-made products and American-grown goods. Now, some have argued \nlabor conditions in Colombia are reason not to support the Colombian \nFree Trade Agreement. That is a total red herring. How does maintaining \nhigh tariffs on goods of the United States shipped to Colombia reduce \nviolence against union jobs down there?\n  How does rejecting an ally that has helped reduce homicides against \nunion members by 79 percent improve trade union safety? What nonsense \nthese arguments are. I mean even the Washington Post, no bastion of \nconservatism, has called the issue completely bogus.\n  Today the L.A. Times, again not a bastion of conservatism, said the \nsame thing, noting pressure from human rights groups and labor \norganizations has prompted Colombia to already do what the Democrats in \nCongress have urged, which is to improve the country's dismal labor \nrecord.\n  If Senators truly wish to help Colombia's union members, they need to \nvote for this agreement, reward Colombia for its improvements in this \narea, and encourage Colombia to draw even closer to the United States.\n  I would close by noting this free-trade agreement comes nearly a \nyear, a year after an agreement was struck between the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, the House Democratic leadership, and the House Ways and \nMeans Committee on a plan to move forward with all the free-trade \nagreements this Congress.\n  The deal stated: In return for USTR negotiating unprecedented new \nlabor and environmental standards, House Democrats would proceed with \nfree-trade agreements for Peru, Panama, Korea, and Colombia. The USTR \ndid its part. Yet the Democratic Congress has not lived up to its end \nof the bargain. So far only the Peru agreement has been passed.\n  We should reject an isolationism that limits economic growth and \nstunts job creation here at home. We should support this important \nLatin American ally. The time is long past for Congress to do what it \npromised and move forward on America's trade agenda.\n  Congress must reaffirm its commitment to an invigorated Colombia and, \nin the process, help our own economy at a difficult economic moment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Sanders amendment.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be set aside so I may speak on the bill itself for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may speak on the bill without \nsetting aside the amendment.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is an unusually bad bill, and I have opposed it \nfrom the very start. The course it has followed almost guarantees that \nit will be filled\n\n[[Page S2731]]\n\nwith the worst kind of gimmickry, and it is. The Senate may be the most \ndeliberative body in the world, but this bill is anything but the \nproduct of deliberation. It is a jumble of disjointed ideas, unlikely \nto solve the crisis at hand, and it is unpopular. It turns out that the \nAmerican people do not like the idea of bailing out banks and their \nneighbors who gambled on home prices. The voters understand what is \ngoing on in Washington better than we do.\n  What is more, several of the complicated tax provisions in this bill \nnever benefited from a full review by the Senate Finance Committee. \nNormally, this is a critical part of the Senate's deliberation.\n  One example of a provision that could use more review is the new \ndeduction for State property taxes. While it may be well intended, this \nnew provision will complicate life for millions of American homeowners \nwho will have to calculate their taxes twice to find out which method \nresults in a lower tax. This complicates tax filings, and any Senator \nwho has said the Tax Code is too complicated should be ashamed to vote \nfor this provision.\n  Because the Senate has not had any serious review of this provision, \ncolleagues also may not know that this provision also allocates more of \nthe Nation's tax burdens to residents of States that impose an income \ntax, such as Kentucky.\n  The State with the highest income taxes faces the biggest relative \ntax increase, and this is illustrated in the chart that supporters of \nthis provision hastily distributed to us. For example, the chart shows \nthat 59 percent of Texan homeowners but only 23 percent of Maryland \nresidents will benefit.\n  The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, on which I serve, is \nnot even managing this bill, even though tax provisions account for \nabout two-thirds of its cost. That is kind of hard to explain to the \naverage Senator on the Finance Committee.\n  Another provision that deserves far more scrutiny is the $4 billion \nin community development block grants that will be allocated to the \nStates and local governments to buy foreclosed properties. To begin \nwith, this current program is very poorly managed. The Wall Street \nJournal called it among the worst run programs in Washington, and there \nis a lot of competition for that title. The White House called the \nprogram ineffective just 2 months ago, and when the HUD inspector \ngeneral testified before Congress in 2006, he explained that his agency \nhad recently indicted 159 individuals and recovered $120 million of \nmisappropriated funds. GAO also has criticized the targeting of grant \nrecipients, which is a polite way of saying that the money is going to \nthose with political connections and influence in local governments. \nAdding money to this program is risky at best.\n  Let's have no illusions. This extraordinarily unwise grant of \ntaxpayers' money is really just a bailout for banks in disguise. It \ngoes to States, but the ultimate beneficiary will be banks that made \nrisky loans.\n  Instead of selling foreclosed properties on the open market, these \nbanks will have the luxury of selling to local officials with whom they \nmay already have a relationship. These officials will be buying \nproperties not with their own funds but with OPM--OPM stands for \n``other people's money''--and in this case, the OPM comes from you and \nme, the American taxpayers, and the millions of unborn Americans whom \nwe are saddling with even more debt.\n\n  Another provision that could benefit from more thoughtful \ndeliberation is the $100 million spending on counseling. Yes, \ncounseling is a good idea before a homeowner signs a loan they can't \nafford. But afterward, the real problem is financial. It is too late \nfor counseling.\n  We also don't know all that much about the nonprofit groups that will \nget the money. Are some of these groups funded mostly by credit card \ncompanies? Are they? If so, will they have a clear conflict of \ninterest? Maybe they will actually advise people to abandon their home, \nto foreclose, in order to pay credit card debt. That would make the \nforeclosure situation worse, not better. One thing is certain: no \namount of counseling is going to put money that they do not have into \nhomeowners' pockets.\n  Now, I have an amendment that I have tried to get a vote on that \nwould do so--put money into homeowners' pockets--and that is why I \nthink it is appropriate to redirect these public funds toward helping \nhomeowners with the cost of refinancing. If we are going to give away \n$4.1 billion--I will say it one more time--if we are going to give away \n$4.1 billion in this bill, let's give it back to the taxpayers and do \nso in a way that encourages homeowners to restructure their mortgages \nand keep them out of bankruptcy and foreclosure. My amendment would do \nthis. It would use the $4 billion in funding this bill uses to bail out \nbanks and give it back to taxpayers while simplifying the Tax Code as \nwell.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation says that this amendment would be \nrevenue-neutral over 10 years. It is entirely paid for within the four \ncorners of this legislation.\n  This change in the tax law that my amendment contains is strongly \nsupported by the Mortgage Bankers Association because it would get to \nthe heart of the housing crisis. Let me try to explain.\n  Often, when people are searching for a home, they are more concerned \nabout qualifying for financing than getting the best possible terms on \nthat loan. Millions of homeowners have taken out an adjustable rate \nmortgage that has a low interest rate for a short period of time, often \n2 or 3 years. These loans adjust to a much higher rate after the \ninitial period. The assumption of many homeowners has been that they \ncan refinance later in a conventional fixed mortgage loan for 30 years. \nBut the Tax Code creates an obstacle to this.\n  According to Bank of America research, published in the Wall Street \nJournal, more than $510 billion worth of adjustable mortgages, \nincluding prime and subprime loans, will reach the end of their fixed \nrate period before December of this year. For the holders of these \nloans, the options are stark: Refinance or default. It is unlikely that \nmany of them can long afford the high interest rates on these mortgages \nafter the fixed rate period expires.\n  Unfortunately, our tax law has this exactly backward. It encourages \nhomeowners to spend lavishly on first-time financing, but it exacts a \npenalty when homeowners find they are living beyond their means and \nneed to refinance. My amendment would have changed all this. It would \nallow homeowners to currently deduct the mortgage interest points that \nlenders typically charge in connection with a home mortgage refinance. \nFor example, under my amendment, if a homeowner has a $200,000 \nadjustable rate mortgage and refinances into a 30-year fixed mortgage, \npaying 1 percent in points, the homeowner would have a $2,000 tax \ndeduction for home mortgage interest paid. That is under my amendment. \nUnder present law, the homeowner would only be allowed to deduct $66. \nThere is no good reason to allow the deduction for home purchase \nmortgages and to deny it for those who need it to refinance.\n  My amendment would remove a significant financial obstacle to \nrefinancing that would allow struggling borrowers to keep their homes. \nIt would help Americans to get out of first mortgages that they have \nentered into without being able to shop for the best possible mortgage. \nUnlike some of the other provisions in this bill, it truly would help \nprevent foreclosures for many who are about to have their homes \nforeclosed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today has been a fairly significant day \nhere in the Congress. General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have \nflown back to the United States from the country of Iraq, and they have \nreported to both the Armed Services Committee and also the Foreign \nAffairs Committee. I have not had a chance to listen to their \ntestimony--I don't serve on either of those committees--but I know the \nnews will carry the testimony, and I\n\n[[Page S2732]]\n\nam sure I will see portions of it and will certainly read their \ntestimony tomorrow morning, but I wanted to make this point.\n  While General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have come here today \nand I am sure have talked about the progress that results from the \nsurge--although there has been a substantial amount of violence, and \ntragically, I believe 11 U.S. soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq \njust in the last few days--I think there is no question that the extra \nsoldiers, the additional 30,000 or 40,000 soldiers they took to Baghdad \nand to the streets of Iraq, dampened down the violence some. Yet there \nis so much discussion about Iraq and so little discussion about \nsomething else that matters a great deal to our lives.\n  This is the 2,400th day since 9/11, and 2,400 days later, Osama bin \nLaden is still at large, the same Osama bin Laden who boasted the day \nafter 9/11--a day when thousands of innocent Americans were killed--\nOsama bin Laden boasted about having engineered the murders of these \nAmericans. Two thousand four hundred days later, he is not only at \nlarge, but he is reconstituting the leadership and the al-Qaida force, \nincluding building training camps to train additional terrorists.\n  Now, Mr. President, are some moments in history where I just remember \nwhere I was. I remember where I was as a very young boy when John F. \nKennedy died. I remember the day. I remember the day astronauts walked \non the moon. And I remember 9/11 very clearly. And it occurred to me on \n9/11 that surely our country bring those who were responsible to \naccount. When thousands of Americans were murdered and al-Qaida and its \nleader, Osama bin Laden, boasted about having engineered that murder, \nit occurred to me that Osama bin Laden is not long for this world, or \nat least Osama bin Laden will certainly be brought to justice and get \nhis due rewards for murdering so many Americans. Yet, 2,400 days later, \nthat has not happened. Now, one might ask the question: Why? And does \nit have to do with the detour into Iraq?\n  I want to point out that in July of last year, the last time a \nNational Intelligence Estimate was given to us by all of the combined \nintelligence services in our Government, here is what they said:\n\n       Al-Qaida is and will remain the most serious terrorist \n     threat to the homeland.\n\n  Let me read that again. That is the assessment of our National \nIntelligence Estimate in our country, the official assessment.\n\n       Al-Qaida is and will remain the most serious terrorist \n     threat to the homeland. We assess the group has protected or \n     regenerated key elements of its homeland attack capability, \n     including a safe haven in the Pakistan Federally Administered \n     Tribal Areas, operational lieutenants, and its top \n     leadership.\n\n  Al-Qaida is the most serious threat to us, No. 1. No. 2, it has \nregrouped and regenerated key elements of its attack capability. No. 3, \nit is in a safe haven in Pakistan.\n  Now, who would have guessed that 2,400 days after our country was \nattacked, an attack that Osama bin Laden boasted about having \nengineered, that there would be 1 square inch of ground on this planet \nthat would be called a safe haven for someone who murdered over 3,000 \nAmericans? Who would have believed that to be the case? Not me. Almost \ncertainly I would have thought he would have been brought to justice.\n  Here is an October 3 story from last year by Griff Witte of the \nWashington Post. It quotes top military officials in Pakistan talking \nabout al-Qaida.\n\n       ``They've had a chance to regroup and reorganize,'' said a \n     Western military official in Pakistan. ``They're well \n     equipped. They're clearly getting training from somewhere. \n     And they're using more advanced tactics.''\n\n  This is from CIA Director Hayden, a week ago, on ``Meet the Press'':\n\n       It is very clear to us that al-Qaida has been able, over \n     the past 18 months or so, to establish a safe haven along the \n     Afghanistan-Pakistan border area that they have not enjoyed \n     before; that they are bringing operatives into that region \n     for training.\n\n  Now, I have flown over that Afghan-Pakistan area. I have been in an \nairplane at 20,000 feet and looked down. I understand there is no \nboundary. You don't know where Afghan ends and Pakistan begins. I \nunderstand it is a tough area, tribally controlled areas. But what I \ndon't understand is how, 2,400 days later, we are told by our top \nintelligence officials that the greatest threat to our homeland here in \nAmerica is al-Qaida and its leadership--the greatest threat to our \nhomeland is al-Qaida and its leadership--and they are in a safe haven, \nquote-unquote. There shouldn't be 1 acre of ground on this planet that \nis safe for those who murdered Americans on 9/11.\n  So what happened? What has caused this to happen? Well, this country \ntook a detour. President Bush told the American people and Secretary of \nState Colin Powell in a presentation to the world and the United \nNations told us about the alleged threat posed by the country of \nIraq. He made the case for a military attack against the country of \nIraq. They made the case that Saddam Hussein was a bad guy. They got no \nargument about that. Saddam Hussein was in many ways a brutal dictator. \nThere were football-field-size graves that were unearthed in Iraq with \nthousands of people who had been murdered by Saddam Hussein. So there \nis no argument about Saddam Hussein.\n\n  The fact is, there are a number of bad leaders in this world. That \ndoesn't mean we go invade their country.\n  After 9/11 the case was made that Iraq was a threat to the United \nStates of America. They said Iraq was trying to get yellowcake from \nNiger and build a nuclear capabilities; Iraq was buying aluminum tubes \nfor the purpose of reconstituting its nuclear capabilities; Iraq has \nmobile chemical weapons laboratories to produce weapons of mass \ndestruction, which threatened this country.\n  That is all pretty ominous. Colin Powell, at the request of President \nBush, showed all the evidence to the world. Then, of course, in the \nyears since discovered that evidence was false. The yellowcake from \nNiger was from a forged document. Yet it purported to tell the world \nthat Saddam Hussein was trying to reconstitute his nuclear capability \nby buying yellowcake from Niger--a forged document. No one has ever \ndescribed to us where that forgery came from.\n  The aluminum tubes, Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley, and others sat \nidly by while in their offices they received reports from other parts \nof our Government saying those aluminum tubes were not for a \nreconstitution of nuclear capability. That information was withheld \nfrom Congress and the American people.\n  Mobile chemical weapons laboratories? That came from a man named \nCurveball; a man named Curveball. Curveball was an informant who was \nbeing held by the Germans. Curveball used to be a taxicab driver in \nBaghdad, largely considered a drunk and a fabricator by the German \nauthorities. This country, this administration, this President, and \nthis Secretary of State used Curveball as an example and a source--a \nsingle source, mind you--to describe mobile chemical weapons \nlaboratories that existed in Iraq and therefore threatened this \ncountry.\n  It turns out it was not true. It turns out that thin thread, one \nperson held by German authorities--again, considered to be a drunk and \na fabricator, a former taxicab driver from Baghdad--was cited as a \nsource, just an unidentified source to the entire world, to support the \ncontention that what Saddam Hussein was doing in Iraq threatened this \ncountry.\n  So the President, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Stephen Hadley, and \nespecially, of course, the neocons--Vice President Cheney, Douglas \nFeith--all of them. They all got what they wanted. This country went \ninto a detour, and the detour was right into the middle of Iraq. It was \ngoing to be a very simple operation, last only a very short amount of \ntime. The fact is, we have been there now fighting in Iraq longer than \nthe Second World War lasted, and we have reports today by the top \ngeneral in Iraq, General Petraeus, a U.S. general, and by the U.S. \nAmbassador, Ambassador Crocker--both good Americans--who come to us to \ndescribe progress, progress in Iraq.\n  I don't know how progress is being measured. I hope we have a lot of \nprogress. I hope we have enough progress so we can begin withdrawing \nAmerican troops from Iraq.\n  But the fact is, Saddam Hussein is dead. He was executed. The Iraqi \npeople had the ability to write a new constitution and then vote for \nit. They had the ability to vote for a new government, which they have. \nAnd they had the ability to receive two-thirds of a trillion dollars \nfrom the American taxpayers, which we have spent in Iraq\n\n[[Page S2733]]\n\nand a smaller amount in Afghanistan. We have spent $16 billion of that \ntraining military and police capability for able-bodied Iraqis. Four \nhundred thousand able-bodied Iraqis have been trained for military and \npolice work.\n  The question remains now, in my judgment, if 400,000 Iraqis who have \nbeen trained by using $16 billion of our money, and been trained by our \npeople, if they don't have the will to provide the security in the \ncountry of Iraq that is their country, not ours, then we can't stay \nthere 2 years or 4 years or 20 years or 100 years, as some have \nsuggested. We must begin to bring troops home and say to the Iraqis: \nThis is your country, not ours. This is your responsibility, not ours. \nYou have a new government. We spent the money to train able-bodied \nIraqis. Now you have to have the will to take back your country.\n  My point about Iraq, however, is that we will not only have been \ndetoured in terms of two-thirds of a trillion dollars-plus, we have \nbeen detoured here and bogged down in a long-term civil strife in Iraq \nthat has been deadly for this country and deadly for the Iraqis at a \ntime in which the greatest threat to America and greatest continuing \nthreat to our homeland comes from al-Qaida. Don't take that from me. \nTake that from the top military experts in our Government.\n  If that in fact is the top threat to our homeland, why, 2,400 days \nafter 9/11, is Osama bin Laden in a safe haven? Why is there a safe \nhaven anywhere on Earth for Osama bin Laden? That ought to be the \nquestion that is asked today. That ought to be the question that is \nanswered for the American people.\n  I think all of us understand that the terrorist threat exists. It \nremains, and likely will remain for some time, but we didn't eliminate \nthe terrorist threat and didn't address the terrorist threat by sending \nsoldiers to Iraq. The purpose of sending soldiers to Iraq was to \nrespond to what we now know to have been largely untrue, the threat \nthat Iraq represented a threat to our country. But we do know now, as a \nresult of our National Intelligence Estimate, that Osama bin Laden is a \nthreat to our country. We knew that on 9/11. We knew that on the day he \nkilled 3,000-plus innocent Americans. Everybody knows that. You don't \nneed some intoxicated former taxicab driver from Baghdad to tell us \nthat. We know Osama bin Laden is a threat. We now know that 6 years \nafter he engineered the 9/11 attack that our intelligence estimate says \nhe or his al-Qaida organization is the most serious terrorist threat to \nour homeland.\n\n  Were there any hearings today on Capitol Hill asking questions of the \npeople who are supposed to be doing this, What kind of progress are you \nmaking? Are you really going after him? Is this job No. 1? Or is all \nthe spotlight on the same spot, that is Iraq, while Osama bin Laden \nover here in northern Pakistan is rebuilding training camps, recruiting \nnew terrorists, and reconstituting his al-Qaida leadership to once \nagain remain the most serious threat to this country's homeland?\n  My only point is there is nothing Republican or Democrat or \nconservative or liberal about any of this. This is all about common \nsense. What is the greatest threat to this country? The National \nIntelligence Estimate says it is the al-Qaida leadership. So what are \nwe doing about that? Is there any progress?\n  Were there any hearings today asking whether there is progress? Were \nthere any hearings asking whether we are bringing Osama bin Laden to \njustice, calling in officials who ought to be working on this? It seems \nto me, after 2,400 days the American people have a right to expect some \nanswers.\n  Again, I think it is good that we have hearings today. We will no \ndoubt read about the hearings, the testimony of General Petraeus who, \nby all accounts, is a wonderful American soldier. I met Ambassador \nCrocker when he was Ambassador in Afghanistan. He is a good American \ndiplomat. We will no doubt hear a lot of discussion about what they \nsaid today.\n  All the talk today is about Iraq. That is a very important subject. \nBut I assume what will not be discussed today is anything about the \nmost serious terrorist threat to our homeland, and that is the person \nand the leadership and the organization that engineered the attack that \nmurdered thousands of innocent Americans on 9/11. I hope those hearings \nare held soon. I hope this administration gives us a report from time \nto time on what we can expect.\n  Will there be another 2,400 days? Another national intelligence \nreport telling us that the person who engineered the 9/11 attack is in \na safe or secure--by the way, that word has been used as well--safe \nhaven or secure haven? There ought not be anyplace safe or secure on \nthis Earth for those who engineered the 9/11 attack, but it certainly \nhas been safe and secure for 2,400 days.\n  My hope is we will not be on the floor of this Senate talking about \nanother 2,400 days. We should be focusing on bringing to justice those \nwho perpetrated the 9/11 attack. That goal, in my judgment, has taken a \nback seat to the detour that took us to Iraq all these many years, and \nI hope that will change soon.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in just another couple of minutes, there \nis an amendment I believe has been filed to the underlying housing \nbill. I want to make a comment on it. It is an amendment that would \nextend the renewable energy tax credits. It is a very important \namendment. I wish we would extend the renewable energy tax credits for \na lengthy period of time. I am not sure if that amendment will be \nconsidered germane. If it is, we need to pass it. But I want to make \nthis point.\n  This country has a history now going back to 1992 with respect to \nrenewable energy for wind energy through the production tax credit and \nthings we put in place to encourage renewable energy. We have a history \nof kind of a pathetic and anemic response to all this.\n  Let me describe what we did with oil. Once we decided we wanted to \nencourage people to look for oil and gas, we were at it. In 1916, \nCongress put in place deep, aggressive tax credits and incentives for \npeople to go drill for oil and gas. So for almost 100 years our \ncountry's policies have been for going out to drill for oil and gas. \nGod bless you, we are going to give you some big tax breaks. We want \nyou to do that. That has been America's policy: find more oil and gas.\n  In 1992, the Congress put in place a provision that said: Now we want \nto encourage renewable energy. With oil we put in place permanent, \nrobust tax incentives that have lasted almost a century. What did we do \nwith renewables? When it came to renewable energy, it was kind of a \npathetic, lackluster response. It was temporary and short term. We \nwould extend it a little bit here and then we let it expire. We have \nextended it five times, and let it expire three times. What a pathetic \nresponse.\n  What this country has an obligation to do with respect to wind and \nsolar energy and the basic renewables is to say to this country and \ndevelopers: Look, here is where America is headed. For the next decade, \nhere is where we are going, and you can count on it because this is \nAmerica's policy. We ought to do that.\n  We are doing 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years at a time, but the \nproduction tax credit ought to be extended for 10 years. We should say \nhere is where we are headed, and you can count on it. We are not going \nto want to be 2 years, 5 years, or 10 years from now 70 percent \ndependent on the Saudis and Kuwaitis and Iraqis and Venezuelans for our \noil. That makes no sense. Yet the only way we are going to get out of \nthis box is to say we are going to begin providing renewable energy in \na very aggressive way. But we don't do that with the incentives we put \nin place. We just start and stop, stutter-start, stop, and every time \nwe stop for a year, the whole investment cycle blows off. It goes to \nzero. So you have all kinds of projects on the shelf that sit there and \nnever get deployed.\n  In solar, for example, we are way behind in solar because you can't \ndo solar and put a tax incentive in for 1 year. You can't do that. It \ntakes a number of years to get a solar project up and running. You can, \nif you get a short-term\n\n[[Page S2734]]\n\nwind turbine up perhaps. You can have a shorter time line on that. But \neven with that, it seems to me that for wind or solar or any number of \nthese renewable technologies, this country has a responsibility to get \nserious about becoming less dependent on Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and \nIraq and all those countries.\n  The Lord did something really interesting: He put oil over there \nunder the soil and put all the demand over here, with the blessings of \na country that expanded and produced a great economy. You know we put \nlittle straws in this Earth every day and we suck oil out. We suck 84 \nto 85 million barrels of oil a day out of this Earth, and we use one-\nfourth of it here in the United States, 21 million barrels a day, and \n60 percent of it comes from off our shores. If you don't think that is \na dangerous dependency, then there is something wrong. I think that is \ndangerous and we have to fix it. How do you fix it? You make a \ncommitment to renewable energy. My colleague from the State of \nWashington was on the floor, Senator Cantwell, who has dedicated a lot \nof her time and effort to this subject, and I commend her for it.\n  You know, you have to focus around here on so many things. Senator \nCantwell has focused substantially on these issues. I wished to work \nwith her. I want whatever she is proposing to succeed. We are working \ntogether in the Energy Committee. I am also the chairman of the Water \nand Energy Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  We need to do a lot. But, most importantly, we need to get this \nCongress on the side of policy that this country can be proud to say: \nWe are going to make a commitment for the next decade, here is where we \nare headed in America. We are in support of renewable energy. You can \ncount on us because we are going to put policies in place that will \ntell you we are in support of it.\n  We cannot keep doing what we have been doing. It is unfair, unfair to \nthis country. So my hope is that when we consider this amendment, that \nwe can approve it. But my hope is we will go much further this year. \nThe minimum we should do on the production tax credit is a 5-year \ncommitment--minimum.\n  I have a bill that says we ought to provide the PTC for 10 years. You \nknow, it is one thing to talk about these things, it is another thing \nto be serious and enact public policies that demonstrate to the country \nand the world you are serious. We have not done that on renewable \nenergy. It is time, long past time we do it. I hope perhaps we will \nsupport with the first step tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for such time as I might consume but probably in the \nneighborhood of 8 or 9 minutes for anybody else who might be wanting to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Colombia Free Trade Agreement\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Today, President Bush submitted the Colombia Trade \nPromotion Trade Agreement Implementing Act to Congress. This bill, as \nthe title implies, would implement our pending trade agreement with \nColombia, which the administration and Colombia signed in November \n2006.\n  This is an important agreement that deserves our support. Some of the \neconomic reasons for supporting this trade agreement are that the \neconomic rationale is obvious. In my view, the economic rationale is \nundeniable. That is because Colombia is a beneficiary of two of our \nunilateral trade preference programs: The Andean Trade Preference Act, \nand the Generalized System of Preferences.\n  Now, all this means is Colombia already gets duty-free access to U.S. \nmarkets for the vast majority of its goods. Now, meanwhile, less than 3 \npercent of our exports to Colombia, and not a single U.S. agricultural \nexport, receives duty-free treatment from Colombia. Our exporters face \nColombian tariffs as high as 35 percent for nonagricultural goods and \neven much higher tariffs for agricultural goods.\n  The Colombian trade agreement would thus eliminate this disparity or, \nas we like to say so often, level the playing field for American \nexporters, thus giving American workers the same access to Colombian \nmarkets that their workers get to the U.S. markets; in other words, \nbeing fair, leveling the playing field.\n  Now, the U.S. International Trade Commission has found that leveling \nthe playing field will increase our exports to Colombia by $1.1 billion \nper year. That is as a result of eliminating the duty on goods. That \nmeans real benefits for American farmers, for American manufacturers, \nfor American service suppliers.\n  One of the chief benefits is it will help keep good-paying jobs in \nthe United States. So I would ask my colleagues and the American people \nto think about this whole proposition about the Colombian Free Trade \nAgreement this way: Either we maintain the status quo or we create new \nopportunities for American exporters.\n  At its heart, that is what this debate is all about. Last year, \nexports accounted for more than 40 percent of our total economic \ngrowth. We should be doing everything we can do to grow our exports \neven further. That is what we did last December when the Senate voted \nby this wide margin of 77 to 18 in favor of a free-trade agreement with \nPeru.\n  The Colombian trade agreement is very much like this Peru agreement, \nand the Colombian market is bigger than the Peru agreement. If it makes \nsense to approve the Peru agreement, it makes even more sense to \napprove the agreement with the country of Colombia.\n\n  Economic considerations are not the only reason to support the \nColombian agreement. I say this because too often we measure trade \nentirely in economic terms. But there are a lot of ways to measure \ntrade other than in dollars and cents. Because in this instance and in \nso many instances, trade agreements are about an important national \nsecurity priority.\n  There is one very specific reason for doing this with Colombia. \nBecause as my Senate colleagues know, Colombia is a strong Democratic \nally in a very dangerous neighborhood. For many years, it has been \nunder assault from the FARC, a group of narcoterrorists fighting to \noverthrow the democratically elected Government in Colombia. It is \nincreasingly under pressure, as Colombia is, from Venezuela's President \nHugo Chavez. You have seen a lot of this in the news in the last month.\n  President Chavez of Venezuela is using oil wealth to divide Latin \nAmerica. He is trying to lure allies to his Socialist vision and, most \nimportantly, to promote his anti-U.S. agenda. He is fiercely opposed in \nthis process to anything that Colombia's President Uribe does in \ncooperating with the United States or even having a friendship with the \nUnited States.\n  There have been troubling reports that President Chavez may be \nworking with the FARC. Last month, he tried to create a diplomatic \ncrisis over a border incident that did not even involve Venezuela. He \ntook the side of the FARC against the Colombian Government. At a \nchallenging time such as this, the United States has a responsibility \nto provide strong, principled leadership. Our agreeing to the Colombian \nFree Trade Agreement is one way of showing strong, principled \nleadership in support of a friend in South America.\n  We must stand by our allies. We must help to promote economic \nstability, security and, most importantly, the rule of law, whether it \nis in trade or nontrade areas. President Uribe has made it clear that \none of the most important steps we can take in this regard is then to \nhelp him, through our implementation of the Colombian Trade Agreement \nthat levels the playing field for America, for America's manufacturers, \nservice providers, so we can get our products into Colombia on the same \nbasis as Colombian farmers or manufacturers or whatever have been able \nto get their products into this country without duty.\n  Our leaders in Latin America are watching us in this process. They \nsee our approach to Colombia as a proxy for the overall attitude toward \nLatin America. If Congress rejects this trade\n\n[[Page S2735]]\n\nagreement, or if we were to refuse to vote on it, our allies in Latin \nAmerica might well conclude that the word of the United States is no \ngood. That will not help Latin America, and it surely is not good for \nour country.\n  I know some of my colleagues have concerns about this agreement. One \nof those concerns is the issue of violence by Colombia or within \nColombia against labor leaders. Anti-union violence has been a serious \nproblem in Colombia for years.\n  If the Colombian Government were ignoring this issue, that might be \nreason to oppose this agreement. But Colombia and President Uribe are \nnot ignoring the issue. To the contrary, Colombia has made massive \nstrides in its fight against anti-union violence. Moreover, I have yet \nto hear a convincing reason why voting down the Colombian agreement or \nrefusing to vote on it will help to reduce violence against labor \nleaders.\n  If we want to help Colombia reduce violence, and if we want to assist \nin the demobilization process, we should be doing what we can to \nenhance economic growth and create new opportunities for a legitimate \neconomy. One way we can advance that objective is to vote to implement \nthe Colombian trade agreement.\n  Now, the one other concern I have heard is the administration should \nhave waited to submit the agreement until it reached a procedural \nagreement with the congressional leadership. The fact is, we have been \nwaiting for Congress to take up this issue for over 10 months. On May \n10 of last year, there was a great, grand deal made about our \nbipartisan compromise on trade that would pave the way for the \ncontinuation of pending trade agreements, including the Colombian \nagreement, including Peru, which has been passed, and including Panama, \nwhich still is on the agenda.\n  Now, since May 10 of last year, there has been no action on Colombia. \nThis inaction violates the compact between the legislative and \nexecutive branches of our Federal Government on trade. The \nadministration negotiated the Colombian trade agreement under the \nBipartisan Trade Promotion Authorization of 2002.\n  Under the trade promotion authority procedures, the administration \nhas an obligation to consult with Congress during the course of the \nnegotiation and to conclude an agreement that meets the negotiation \nobjectives specified in that statute, the Bipartisan Trade Promotion \nAuthority Act of 2002.\n  Now, the administration has done all those things required by that \nact. The administration even went further by reopening the agreement to \nimplement the enhanced labor and environmental provisions that were \ndemanded by the new Democratic majority after the elections of 2006, \nwhich was their right to do.\n  These agreements then on labor and the environment were part of the \nMay 10 bipartisan trade deal. Colombia has agreed to accept those \nprovisions. But the trade promotion authority places a firm \nresponsibility on Congress as well, the responsibility to process a \ntrade agreement for an up-or-down vote once it has been concluded.\n  Congress has had over 10 months to engage the administration and \ncommence that process. In that time, we have not even had a hearing on \nthe Colombian trade agreement. So the time for that process ran out.\n  Now, this is the position the administration is in. In order to \npreserve sufficient time under the trade promotion authority to assure \na final vote this year, the President has now submitted the agreement \nand implementing legislation to this Congress. But that does not mean \nCongress must vote tomorrow.\n  Today's action by the President starts the 90-day legislative clock \nin the House and Senate under that Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority \nAgreement of 2002.\n  So there remains plenty of time to work together on a bipartisan \nbasis to reach consensus. For example, I am engaging in intense \ndiscussion with the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus \nof Montana, on a consensus bill to reauthorize our trade adjustment \nassistance programs. We will certainly continue that effort. Trade \nadjustment assistance is the top priority of Senator Baucus on the \ntrade agenda this year. I have agreed to work with him to advance his \npriority that I also have an interest in advancing. But my priority is \nimplementation of the Colombian trade agreement. I expect to see a vote \non that as well. I think Congress can address both priorities. I think \nCongress can meet both responsibilities. I think Congress can \naccomplish them in a bipartisan way.\n  It is time to stop playing politics with our Nation's vital economic \nand foreign policy interests. It is time to level the playing field \nbetween the United States and Colombia on free trade. That level \nplaying field is going to benefit the United States. It is not going to \nbenefit Colombia much more, although it will benefit them some. \nAmerican workers deserve a fair opportunity to sell our products and \nservices abroad. Colombia deserves recognition for the tremendous \nprogress it has made over the past few years. It is time for Congress \nto demonstrate leadership and to meet our responsibility in the \neconomic and foreign policy areas.\n  The United States-Colombia trade promotion agreement deserves an up-\nor-down vote this year. This debate will continue. I hope that before \nthe end it becomes more of a dialog than a debate because I think \ndialog is what foreign trade is all about.\n  This issue is too important. The stakes are too high. We must find a \nway forward, and we need to find it together. I think we will.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thought I might take a couple of minutes \ntoward the close of the day and share with my colleagues where we stand \non the matter of the housing proposal we have been on since the middle \nof last week. I wish to again thank Majority Leader Reid. Without his \nleadership, we would not be here. We would not be in a position to \nactually do some things that are critically important to work our way \nout of this mess our country is in when it comes to the foreclosure \ncrisis, the problems Americans are facing, not to mention the contagion \neffects that are moving this issue beyond housing into other aspects of \nour economy. It was Majority Leader Reid who reached out to the \nRepublican leader, suggesting we try to get together, Democrats and \nRepublicans, on a compromise proposal to move to and then deal with \nother issues where we could, where there was some consensus, to then be \nable to meet with the other body to see if we couldn't resolve \noutstanding questions dealing with the issue of housing and \nforeclosure.\n  As I have said over and over for the last week since Senator Shelby \nand I spent that 24 hours we were given--not a great deal of time, \nconsidering the number of issues involved in this question--to come \nback with a package that represented Democrats' and Republicans' common \npoints on this question, there were a lot of issues Democrats wanted, \nthat I wanted, there were issues Republicans wanted that the other side \nwas not willing to agree to, and that was the charge we were to avoid, \nto come back with a package on matters we could agree on, which is not \nalways easy in a Senate that is divided 51 to 49, where the margins are \nnarrow and the differences are significant. But nonetheless, we did \nthat.\n  This package includes positive provisions. One, we are going to get \nan FHA modernization bill. That has been kicking around for a long \ntime. We took those loan limits from, I think it is $362,000 up to \n$550,000. There were some 19 States that would have been excluded from \nthe FHA program or at least parts of States that would have been \nexcluded, such as California, my own State of Connecticut, candidly, \nMassachusetts, New Jersey, many States, New York. There are pockets in \nthese States where even the average cost of a home is higher. So the \nloan limits went up. FHA modernization does other good as well, an \nimportant point.\n  The issue of counseling, last year we appropriated $42 million \nnationwide for counseling services to deal with the housing crisis--\nhardly enough to deal\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\nwith the demands people had on counseling. Senator Bond and I offered \nan amendment last year and got $180 million for counseling services \nwhich we thought contributed, and it did, to assisting groups across \nthe country, nonprofits to work with those facing foreclosure or in \nhighly distressed mortgages to work out those differences.\n  I would have liked to have added $200 million more to the counseling \nprogram. That is a proposal Senator Murray, who cares deeply about this \nissue, Senator Schumer, who cares about the issue, and others wanted to \nbring up. When we sat down to negotiate that issue, there was little or \nno appetite for any additional money in the counseling area. So we \ncompromised between the 200 and zero and came up with $100 million. I \nwould have liked more. But again, we were directed and asked by the \nleadership to try to develop a set of consensus ideas. Again, there may \nbe other amendments--there was on this--to add additional funds to it.\n\n  We provided money for community development block grants to assist \ncommunities that have a lot of distressed properties or foreclosed \nproperties. I have made the case over and over what this can do to a \ncommunity and neighborhood. When you have a single foreclosed property, \nthe value of every other home in that neighborhood or the surrounding \narea can decline in value immediately. What you don't need is more \nsupply out there. Right now we are overloaded with supply. It is one of \nthe reasons why the market is not doing as much in correcting this \nproblem, because of the oversupply of housing. So when we do what we \ncan to clean up housing, to get it back on the market and hopefully get \npeople into that housing, it not only benefits the people who get to \npurchase a home, but it also does a lot to increase the value of the \nsurrounding homes, not to mention, of course, stabilizing a declining \nproperty tax base, which supports police, fire, social services, all \nthe other issues that are adversely affected when you have a foreclosed \nproperty or properties in your neighborhood or community. So that was a \nmajor achievement in this bill.\n  I would have liked some additional funds for community development \nblock grants. It is a very good program. It works very well. To target \nthese resources into that area is something we can applaud in this \nlegislation.\n  We also have offered some tax credits for people who move into \nforeclosed properties. It is a 2-year deal. It involves about $3,500 a \nyear in tax credits. The idea is to get this property back on the tax \nrolls, to get people into the property so, again, you stabilize \nneighborhoods before you end up with further declining values and \nerosion in these areas, blight, all the other problems that happen.\n  How big a problem can that be? Let me tell you how big that can be. I \nhave one community in my State that I have talked about where there are \n6,000 foreclosures in a city of 100,000 people. Let me tell you what \nthat looks like in a city. Imagine if you end up with 6,000 boarded-up \nproperties in a city of 100,000 people or less. Obviously, the value of \nevery other home in that city is going to be adversely affected. So \nwhile people said: I don't think you ought to be providing a tax credit \nto get owner-occupied people into these homes, well, you can make a \ncase for that, but I think we all benefit if we can get someone into \nthat property, clean it up. That is taxes coming into the community. \nThe value of surrounding homes I think are benefited from it. So again, \nI think that is a good provision. It was offered here. It has to be \nforeclosed property. You have to live in the house for a period of \ntime. It doesn't invite speculation or involve new properties. It is \nforeclosed properties.\n  We also had a number of provisions to deal with veterans. Again, I \nthank Senator John Kerry, Senator Dan Akaka of Hawaii, Senator Coleman, \namong others, Senator Sanders of Vermont. All had ideas on how we could \nassist our men and women in uniform who are facing not only the \ndifficulty of being in the military service today, potentially serving \nin Afghanistan and Iraq, but also facing potential foreclosures. We \nhave done a lot in this bill to make sure they are not going to be \nadversely affected.\n  It may not seem like much or a lot of people, but the fact that we \ncould do something to help mayors and local governments with foreclosed \nproperties, as well as providing some way for people to get into these \nhomes, is a positive step, not to mention the FHA modernization, the \nmortgage revenue bonds, $1.6 billion, not exactly a small amount of \nmoney, designed specifically to get people into fixed rate affordable \nmortgages that they can work out. That is going to be a tremendous \nasset to people.\n  There are some related matters we probably have to deal with in the \nTax Code so it could be even more potent, but it is a major \naccomplishment in this bill that is something we can applaud again and \ncelebrate as being very helpful. In fact, this is the $10 billion in \nmortgage revenue bond authority included in this proposal.\n  There are other provisions in the bill. Frankly, there are some that \ngo too far. I am the first to admit it. But I was asked to try to put \nsomething together. In doing so, I wished to have a provision in here \nthat I cared deeply about and that is the home preservation idea, where \nwe could forestall the ability of people. In the ultimate situation, \nwhere you provide money to mayors to clean up, why not stop foreclosure \nin the first place. I have talked about it since January. There is, I \nthink, sort of a growing constituency that understands this and has \noffered some ideas on how to be supportive. But I couldn't get my own \nidea in this bill as the negotiator. I tried to convince my good friend \nfrom Alabama and others this was a provision I thought we ought to have \nin this bill.\n  He has some very legitimate questions about it. A good set of \nhearings probably will accomplish it. This Thursday, we are going to \nhave a hearing on this idea and other ideas in the Banking Committee \nand a hearing the following week as well because we would like to have \na couple hearings on it. My hope is that at the conclusion, we can have \na markup and, along with some other provisions the Presiding Officer is \naware of, as a member of the committee, we can bring back as a package, \nhopefully, in a bipartisan way, that we can move through this Chamber \nthat will contribute some answers to this economic crisis that has as \nits center the foreclosure crisis.\n  My own provision is not part of this package as much as I wanted it \nand argued for it. But I couldn't get it included at all. So there are \nthings I would have liked to have had in this bill that are not here.\n  There are some things in this bill that I think go too far. I will be \nthe first to admit it. But I have learned over the years that if you \nwait for the perfect, you don't get much. In this body with 100 \nMembers, with very different views on a lot of these matters, you do \nyour best. Particularly when you are divided 51 to 49, it is hard to \ndevelop that kind of consensus. But that is what it is, and that is how \nyou get legislation passed. You begin to have to move on it. That is \nwhy I am urging my colleagues and I am grateful for the vote on \ncloture. I don't like to cut off debate for anyone on matters where \ncertain amendments may not then survive a postcloture motion. But we \nneed to come to some closure on this.\n  I would say to the Presiding Officer as well that there are about 15 \nor 20 amendments that are going to be worked out, I think, that various \npeople have offered in addition to what is in the core provisions here \nthat we are working hard on, the adjoining staff, to try to accommodate \nwhere we can. So in addition to the core provisions, there are other \nideas that have come forward that we hope to have included in this \nfinal product that we can produce, hopefully, by tomorrow.\n  But we are pretty much done with the debate. We have debated this a \nlot. People know or can find out whether their amendments are germane \nor survive postcloture or would avoid an objection being filed against \nthem. If that is the case and they want to come over and let Senator \nShelby and me talk about them and listen to people's ideas, it is still \npossible some additional ideas can be included.\n  I have been told there are some people who are just going to object \nto anything that comes up. I would wish that would not be the case, but \nthat is a right Members have. They have the\n\n[[Page S2737]]\n\nright to object to anything because it takes unanimous consent to bring \nup these matters. If you do not get the consent, it does not come up. \nSo I know the Democratic leader, working with the Republican leader, is \ntrying to convince those Members who have blanket objections to \nanything to remove those objections and to allow some of these ideas to \ncome up to be considered as part of this package.\n  We then have to go through the process of meeting with the other \nbody. Congressman Barney Frank, the chairman of the Financial Services \nCommittee of the House, is working on a similar package or related \npackage. I am never going to get there to work out some differences, \nsome of the different ideas that may become a part of this legislation, \nif I do not leave here. We cannot solve this problem by talking to \nourselves. We are going to have to sit down and talk with people who \nhave different points of view on this if we are going to come up with \nsome common answers.\n  So that is sort of the status of play here at 6:30 this evening. \nThere is no reason why we need to exhaust 30 hours. There is a lot of \nother work to be done in this body on other matters. This is not the \nonly issue that is before this Congress.\n  So my hope would be that tomorrow morning, for those who have \nadditional ideas who want to come over, for those who are waiting to \nsee if we can get some answers, that we do that. I am prepared to spend \nthe time to try to work things out where we can and to say to those \nwhere we cannot work it out: I am sorry, I cannot accommodate every \nMember who has an idea on this bill. Beyond that, we need to come to \nclosure and move on. My hope would be we would not have to wait until 9 \np.m. tomorrow night to arrive at that point.\n  I am more than happy to yield back time under the 30 hours, as I am \nconfident Senator Shelby would be, but we do not want to do that \nwithout giving our colleagues an opportunity to be heard on these \nmatters.\n  So I will urge colleagues in the morning, if they would come over and \nbring their ideas or at least if they have amendments to bring them up. \nWe can vote on some of these. Some may carry, some may not, but allow \nus to move forward and have a final vote on this package and then go \nback to work in the committee to bring out these additional ideas we \nhave been talking about, as well as to get to a conference with the \nother body to try to resolve what is in this bill and what they will \noffer themselves.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nKohl and Carper as cosponsors to amendment No. 4489, as submitted by \nSenator McCaskill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I would like to commend the hard work of \nChairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby for putting together a \nbipartisan package of housing provisions.\n  If we have learned anything from the current economic situation, it \nis the need for improved oversight of the lending industry. There is a \nneed to restore investor and consumer confidence in the housing market. \nAlthough this bill goes a long way to helping families and communities \ndeal with issues related to foreclosure, there's still a critical \ncomponent missing--regulatory reform of government-sponsored \nenterprises.\n  I would like to take a moment to remind my colleagues what \nprecipitated the need for Congress to consider GSE regulatory reform.\n  In May 2006, OFHEO published a special report detailing egregious \nmanagement and accounting scandals that highlighted a corporate culture \nof greed and corruption. I would like to read a few excerpts from the \nsummary of that report:\n  Fannie Mae senior management promoted an image of the Enterprise as \none of the lowest-risk financial institutions in the world and as \n``best in class'' in terms of risk management, financial reporting, \ninternal control, and corporate governance. The findings in the report \nshow that risks at Fannie Mae were greatly understated and that the \nimage was false.\n  During the period covered by the report--1998 to mid-2004--Fannie Mae \nreported extremely smooth profit growth and hit announced targets for \nearnings per share precisely each quarter. Those achievements were \nillusions deliberately and systematically created by the Enterprise's \nsenior management with the aid of inappropriate accounting and improper \nearnings management. A large number of Fannie Mae's accounting policies \nand practices did not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting \nPrinciples, GAAP.\n  The Enterprise also had serious problems of internal control, \nfinancial reporting, and corporate governance. Those errors resulted in \nFannie Mae overstating reported income and capital by a currently \nestimated $10.6 billion. By deliberately and intentionally manipulating \naccounting to hit earnings targets, senior management maximized the \nbonuses and other executive compensation they received, at the expense \nof shareholders.\n  Earnings management made a significant contribution to the \ncompensation of Fannie Mae chairman and CEO Franklin Raines, which \ntotaled over $90 million from 1998 through 2003. Of that total, over \n$52 million was directly tied to achieving earnings per share targets. \nFannie Mae consistently took a significant amount of interest rate risk \nand, when interest rates fell in 2002, incurred billions of dollars in \neconomic losses.\n  The Enterprise also had huge operational and reputational risk \nexposures.\n  Fannie Mae's Board of Directors contributed to those problems by \nfailing to be sufficiently informed and to act independently of its \nchairman, Franklin Raines, and other senior executives; by failing to \nexercise the requisite oversight over the Enterprise's operations; and \nby failing to discover or ensure the correction of a wide variety of \nunsafe and unsound practices.\n  The board's failures continued in the wake of revelations of \naccounting problems and improper earnings management at Freddie Mac and \nother high profile firms, the initiation of OFHEO's special examination \nand credible allegations of improper earnings management made by an \nemployee of the Enterprise's Office of the Controller.\n  Senior management did not make investments in accounting systems, \ncomputer systems, other infrastructure, and staffing needed to support \na sound internal control system, proper accounting and GAAP-consistent \nfinancial reporting. Those failures came at a time when Fannie Mae \nfaced many operational challenges related to its rapid growth and \nchanging accounting and legal requirements. Fannie Mae senior \nmanagement sought to interfere with OFHEO's special examination by \ndirecting the Enterprise's lobbyist to use their ties to Congressional \nstaff to generate a congressional request for the inspector general of \nthe Department of Housing and Urban development, HUD, to investigate \nOFHEO's conduct of that examination; and insert into an appropriations \nbill language that would reduce the agency's appropriations until the \nDirector of OFHEO was replaced.\n  While I will concede that the Enterprises have made great strides in \ncleaning up their acts, Congress must enact regulatory reform to ensure \nthat such deliberate and egregious practices can never happen again. \nThis legislation achieves that objective and it is high time we take \naction to pass it.\n  If we really want to assist our fragile markets, we cannot forego the \nopportunity to include meaningful and comprehensive GSE reform in this \nhousing package. I have spent the past five years advocating for GSE \nreform, first as Secretary of HUD and now here in the Senate. There has \nbeen a great deal of talk about reforming GSEs, but we haven't closed \nthe deal.\n  The junior Senator from Delaware and I are offering this amendment \nbecause we believe the housing legislation before us represents the \nbest opportunity for Congress to pass GSE reform.\n  There has been a great deal of uncertainty lately in the housing \nmarket, and as one of the most reliable resources for homeowners, we \ncannot afford to let the future of GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nto remain equally as uncertain.\n  The combined obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal \nHome Loan Banks exceed $6 trillion. The Fed's bailout of Bear Sterns \nlast month would look like a drop in the bucket compared to what would \nhappen\n\n[[Page S2738]]\n\nif one of these institutions were to fail. This is a risk we simply \ncan't afford to take without giving the U.S. taxpayer every opportunity \nto ensure safety and soundness--a world-class regulator gives us that.\n  Last year, the House passed a bipartisan GSE reform bill, and our \namendment mirrors that legislation. This amendment is broadly supported \nby those within the financial sector as well as the Treasury Department \nand OFHEO. It contains the essential components necessary for \noverhauling GSE oversight and for providing stability and strength to \nour housing finance system.\n  And given Congress's recent action raising conforming loan limits and \nOFHEO's decision to lower Fannie and Freddie's capital requirements, \nGSE reform is more critical than ever. We passed an economic stimulus \npackage that increased the maximum size of a mortgage that Fannie and \nFreddie can purchase this year to almost $730,000 in high-cost areas, \nand recently OFHEO lowered their capital surplus requirements from 30 \nto 20 percent.\n  While I agree that these were necessary steps given the current \nmarket conditions, I am very concerned about the additional risk Fannie \nand Freddie will assume given these changes.\n  I am committed to ensuring the long-term sustainability of the GSEs \nand regulatory reform is critical to that effort. In terms of current \nregulation, OFHEO has done a great job with the tools at its disposal, \nbut the problem is the regulator needs greater powers--like those of \nother Federal banking regulators. We need a world-class regulator to \nensure the GSEs continue to operate in a safe and sound manner and that \nthey remain focused on their affordable housing mission.\n  One of the most important elements of this proposal is the creation \nof a new regulator that is both politically independent and funded \noutside of the appropriations process. In order for this regulator to \nbe credible, they cannot be subject to the annual budget machinations \nof a committee or the political influence inherent in Washington.\n  Part of its broad responsibility would be to ensure a more coherent \nregulatory framework, better enforcement, and a more consistent and \naggressive effort on affordable housing. The regulator would have the \nability to monitor the agency's portfolios--and direct the enterprises \nto acquire or sell any asset in order to maintain risk consistent with \ntheir missions. The regulator would also have the ability to set both \nminimum and risk-based capital levels for the GSEs--in other words, the \namount of capital an enterprise would be required to hold would be \ndirectly related to the amount of risk they have undertaken.\n  The regulator would posses enhanced enforcement powers and be able to \nprovide prompt corrective action, including the authority to set and \nenforce prudential management and internal control standards. It would \nalso have the ability to put a GSE into receivership, and exercise a \nrole in the authority over safety, soundness and mission. Finally, it \nwould have a say in new product review and approval.\n  I know many of my colleagues have concerns that this legislation does \nnot go far enough in its regulation of the enterprises or that the \ninclusion of an affordable housing fund is nothing more than a \n``political slush fund.'' Funds would be allocated to and distributed \nby the states, rather than the GSEs, under a formula to be developed by \nHUD.\n  The most important component of reform legislation is the \nestablishment of a stronger, more credible regulator--which is greatly \nneeded. Homeowners are frustrated and consumers are worried about what \nlies ahead for our housing market.\n  We have an opportunity to inject some much-needed confidence into a \nsagging portion of our economy, and I believe it would be irresponsible \nto further delay addressing this important issue. Ensuring the \nsoundness of Fannie and Freddie will give market participants the \nconfidence they need to continue investing in mortgage products. That \nconfidence is critical for the proper functioning of our financial \nmarkets. In the same bipartisan spirit that helped us come to an \nagreement on the housing bill, I would urge my colleagues to follow the \nsame course of action in passing this necessary bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am not only deeply concerned that \nincreasing foreclosures threaten the dream of home ownership, but it is \nalso critical to understand that the housing crisis that the Senate is \ncurrently grappling with affects every corner of this country, \nincluding both small and large States.\n  Therefore, I have introduced an amendment that would ensure that \nStates with low populations receive their fair share of the increase in \nmortgage revenue bond allocations provided for within the Dodd-Shelby \nsubstitute amendment.\n  Under current law, there is a small State floor that sets a minimum \nlevel of allocations of mortgage revenue bonds that any one State will \nreceive. These bonds provide State housing finance agencies, like the \nMaine Housing Authority, that provided $134.4 million of loans to \nfirst-time homebuyers in 2006, a financing source for low-cost loans to \nfirst-time homebuyers.\n  It is imperative that we understand the magnitude of mortgage \ndifficulties facing our Nation. By 2009, more than a trillion dollars \nof mortgages originated during the subprime lending boom will reset to \nhigher interest rates. Currently, according to the Mortgage Bankers \nAssociation, 43 percent of subprime ARMs are already in foreclosure. \nThis exceptionally high number is expected to skyrocket over the next \nyear once the next wave of ARM loans reset and borrowers' mortgage \npayments increase by 30 to 50 percent. In December, the Center for \nResponsible Lending predicted that 2.2 million families with subprime \nloans will lose their homes to foreclosure.\n  High foreclosure rates harm communities, create blighted areas, and \nstunt local and national economic potential. Consequently, it is in the \nbest interest of all of the parties involved in the subprime crisis \nthat Congress act to preserve home ownership, and minimize \nforeclosures.\n  Appropriately, the housing stimulus legislation currently before the \nSenate extends for 2008 the availability of these low-cost mortgages to \nrefinancings in addition to first-time homebuyers. This proposal, based \nfrom legislation, S. 2517, introduced by Senator Smith, and of which, I \nhave joined as a cosponsor, will help provide a low-cost refinancing \nalternative to those struggling to meet their payment obligations as \ntheir subprime loans begin to reset. It only makes sense to offer such \nan alternative to foreclosures.\n  Additionally, the proposal increases the authorization level of the \ntax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds by $10 billion for 2008. But, \nhowever, the proposal failed to apply the floor provided for under the \ncurrent authorization levels to the increase for this year. My \namendment addresses this inequity by providing an additional $930 \nmillion of authorization that ensures that more populous States will \nreceive no less than what they are receiving under the Dodd-Shelby \ncompromise while at the same time increases the allocation for smaller \nStates to levels that they should receive if the floor were applied to \nthe $10 billion authorization increase. So no State will be worse off \nby my amendment while making sure that smaller States are treated \nfairly.\n  According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, Maine, with a \npopulation of only 1.3 million, has a foreclosure rate of 2.4 percent \nwhile the national average is 2 percent. As you can see, Maine's \nforeclosure rate is well above the national average and goes to show \nthat homeowners are struggling in small States as well as large States, \nand my amendment simply addresses the current housing crisis in a way \nthat is fair to all States, both large and small.\n  Mr. President, I am committed to this issue, and urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this critical amendment that is a matter of \nequity and fairness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/08/senate-section/article/S2738-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I opposed going to war in Iraq. I \nopposed the escalation of American troop levels. And I still do.\n  When the Bush administration proposed the escalation of U.S. forces \nin Iraq, the President said it would enable the Iraqi government to \nachieve political reconciliation. Our troops have done their part. Yet \nas we ask our troops to do more, the Iraqi government does less.\n  While we were fighting the surge, the Iraqi parliament was on \nvacation. While our troops were wounded, dying, and away from their \nfamilies, Prime Minister al-Maliki was running up a budget surplus.\n  The Iraqi government has failed to make their country safer or more \nstable; they have failed to hold provisional elections, reform their \noil laws or disarm the militias. This is a failure in leadership. The \nbattle of Basra was a disaster. We know that many members of the Iraqi \nmilitary fought bravely and steadfastly. But we also know that more \nthan 1,000 deserted or refused to fight. Once again, American troops \nhad to step forward to salvage the operation.\n  Our troops have performed bravely and effectively. Yet a great \nAmerican military cannot be a substitute for a weak Iraqi government. \nIt is time to come home. We must bring our troops home, swiftly and \nsafely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/08/senate-section/article/S2739-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  In the early morning of July 15, 2007, Miranda Greer, an openly \nlesbian woman, was brutally attacked in a Jackson, TN, bar. Greer had \nbeen dancing when a man approached her and, using a homophobic slur, \nasked her to leave. The man had apparently mistaken Greer for a gay \nmale. When she clarified that she was a lesbian, the man punched her in \nthe face. He then used the bottom of a beer bottle to jab her left eye, \nand broke it over the back of her head. Greer ended up with a blind \nspot in her left eye after the attack. Police have issued a warrant for \nthe arrest of Tyler Mansfield, who was identified as a suspect \naccording to the Jackson Police Department.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nprotecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens \nalready covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/08/senate-section/article/S2739-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CAMERON GULBRANSEN KIDS AND CARS SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on February 29, 2008, the Cameron \nGulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act was signed into law, marking a \nhistoric moment for children, families and safety advocates across the \ncountry.\n  Nearly every other day in the United States, a child dies in a \nnontraffic vehicle accident. This legislation will ensure that cars in \nthe United States are properly equipped with safety technology to \nprevent unintentional harm to children, promising safer cars, and safer \nchildren in New York and across the country.\n  I am honored to have championed the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars \nSafety Act in the Senate, named in remembrance of a 2-year-old Long \nIsland boy who was killed when he wandered behind the SUV his father \nwas backing into their driveway. With this legislation we honor his \nmemory, and the memory of all children taken from us by these tragic \nand preventable auto accidents.\n  I have met many parents, sisters, and brothers who have lost a loved \none to a nontraffic-related incident. Their presence in this fight \nrepresents a true testament of courage. I would also like to thank the \nadvocacy community--KIDS AND CARS, Consumer's Union and the Advocates \nfor Highway and Auto Safety--for their unwavering support throughout \nthis push for passage. Together, these families and advocates played a \ncritical role in raising awareness of this issue throughout Congress \nand across the country. Thanks to their tireless work, countless \ntragedies will be prevented in the future.\n  I would also like to thank all my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who joined me in supporting this important measure, especially \nChairman John Dingell who was instrumental in helping this bill achieve \npassage in the House. Together we have shown that by working hard and \nfinding common ground, we can produce legislation that will make a real \ndifference in the lives of Americans.\n  As safety advocates and families gather in our Nation's Capitol to \ncelebrate this seminal moment, I add to the chorus of thanks and praise \nfor this long-awaited victory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/08/senate-section/article/S2739-4", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 FAMILY SERVICE ASSOCIATION OF REDLANDS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I want to recognize the \nFamily Service Association of Redlands as it celebrates 110 years of \nservice and support to the communities of southern California.\n  As a nonprofit community service organization located in Redlands, \nCA, the Family Service Association has been a hallmark institution of \nassistance and guidance to all who have sought its support. Founded as \nthe Associated Charities of Redlands by community leader A.K. Smiley in \nFebruary of 1898, this organization has a long history of care and \nconcern for the needs of its local communities. After spending its \nfirst few years using funds from local contributors to assist the less \nfortunate, the organization opened a wood yard in 1909 to provide \nemployment for those out of work. Later, contributors would donate \nbuildings that enabled the organization to expand and establish the \nfirst community hospital, enabling more and more community needs to be \nmet.\n  Today, the Family Service Association of Redlands provides a variety \nof services and programs to benefit needy populations of inland \nsouthern California. Their Home Again program has made a significant \neffort to address the growing issues of poverty and homelessness, \nthrough providing homeless families with permanent housing, employment, \nand family stability. Their Family Support program has made a similar \ndramatic effort at bringing fundamental goods and services to families \nin need; these include clothing distribution, rental and mortgage \nassistance, utility bill assistance, motel vouchers, emergency medical \nassistance, dental and vision screening programs, educational and \ntraining programs, case management services, and many others.\n  As the Family Service Association of Redlands celebrates 110 years of \nservice and support to the communities of inland southern California, I \nam pleased to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing their more \nthan a century of accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/08/senate-section/article/S2739-5", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2739-S2740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JACK AND JAN McGOWAN\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I highlight the importance of \nacknowledging and celebrating extraordinary efforts by ordinary \nAmericans who have led the way in protecting and preserving America's \nnatural resources. I am honored to congratulate two inspiring ``natural \nresource heroes'' in my State of Oregon, Jack and Jan McGowan.\n  Jack and Jan McGowan have served as the executive director and \nassociate director respectively of an organization called SOLV, which \nstands for Stop Oregon Litter and Vandalism. Jack and\n\n[[Page S2740]]\n\nJan's 18-year career with SOLV has seen many changes to the \norganization. Founded in 1969 by Oregon Governor Tom McCall, SOLV has \nfocused on bringing together government agencies, businesses and Oregon \ncitizens to work together on programs and projects that were meant to \nenhance the livability of our State. When Jack and Jan assumed \nleadership of SOLV in 1990, they worked out of their home and operated \na very small organization of volunteers. Today, SOLV is the largest \nvolunteer non-profit agency in the Northwest and has provided \ninspiration to similar organizations around the country and the world.\n  Oregonians pride themselves in doing their part to protect and \nconserve the State's treasures and natural resources. The first beach \ncleanup in the United States was held in Oregon in 1984. Since then, \nannual beach cleanups now occur all along the west and east coasts of \nour country and in over 100 countries around the world. Just last \nmonth, SOLV organized Oregon's 24th annual spring beach cleanup. All \n362 miles of Oregon's coastline were canvassed by almost 4,000 \nvolunteers who accumulated over 110,000 pounds of trash.\n  As a young Boy Scout, I was taught that one's duty was to respect and \nprotect the world around you. I believe that we have a responsibility \nto encourage efforts in conserving our natural resources by responsibly \nusing them, not abusing them. Jack and Jan McGowan have made major \ncontributions to a proud Oregon pioneering spirit of innovation and \nconservation. What they have given back to their community is \ninvaluable, for they have taught us that everyone doing their small \npart can achieve huge successes. I wish Jack and Jan well as they \npursue future endeavors in their retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/08/senate-section/article/S2740-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING BLACK HILLS STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Black Hills State \nUniversity as they celebrate their 125th anniversary.\n  Throughout the past 125 years, Black Hills State University, BHSU, \nhas served the State of South Dakota by providing a quality educational \nexperience. BHSU's commitment to education began in 1883 when the \nschool was founded as the Dakota Territorial Normal School. With only \n40 students and a 2-year budget of $2,000, BHSU began its journey in \nbecoming a premier educational institution in South Dakota.\n  The school underwent a name change in 1941 and became the Black Hills \nTeacher's College. In the early 1940s, the rise of World War II \nresulted in a nationwide decline in university enrollment. In response, \nBHSU chipped in and hosted the training operations for Air Corp Cadets \nfor the Manpower Commission to assist the war effort. After the war, \nthe school rebounded and enrollment increased rapidly with the help of \nthe G.I. Bill of Rights and BHSU's addition of graduate courses to its \nuniversity catalogue.\n  Black Hills State University received its present name in 1964, and \nsince, has continued to thrive in the South Dakota educational \ncommunity. Now with three different colleges, an excellent academic \nenvironment, and many athletic opportunities, I am confident that BHSU \nwill continue to serve the Spearfish community and the State of South \nDakota for the next 125 years.\n  It gives me great pleasure to rise with the students, faculty, and \nalumni of Black Hills State University on this milestone anniversary \nand wish them continued success in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/08/senate-section/article/S2740-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING THE LOUISIANA HONORAIR\n\n Mr. VITTER.

The Agreement represents an historic development in our \nrelations with Colombia, which has shown its commitment to advancing \ndemocracy, protecting human rights, and promoting economic opportunity. \nColombia's importance as a steadfast strategic partner of the United \nStates was recognized by President Clinton's support for an \nappropriation in 2000 to provide funding for Plan Colombia, and my \nAdministration has continued to stand with Colombia as it confronts \nviolence, terror, and drug traffickers.\n  This Agreement will increase opportunity for the people of Colombia \nthrough sustained economic growth and is therefore vital to ensuring \nthat Colombia continues on its trajectory of positive change. Under the \nleadership of President Alvaro Uribe, Colombia has made a remarkable \nturnaround since 1999 when it was on the verge of being a failed state. \nThis progress is in part explained by Colombia's success in \ndemobilizing tens of thousands of paramilitary fighters. The Colombian \ngovernment reports that since 2002, kidnappings, terrorist attacks, and \nmurders are all down substantially, as is violence against union \nmembers.\n\n[[Page S2741]]\n\n  The Government of Colombia, with the assistance of the United States, \nis continuing its efforts to further reduce the level of violence in \nColombia and to ensure that those responsible for violence are quickly \nbrought to justice. To speed prosecutions of those responsible for \nviolent crimes, the Prosecutor General's Office plans to hire this year \n72 new prosecutors and more than 110 investigators into the Human \nRights Unit. These additions are part of the increase of more than \n2,100 staff that will be added to the Prosecutor General's Office in \n2008 and 2009. To support these additional personnel and their \nactivities, Colombia has steadily increased the budget for the \nProsecutor General's Office, including by more than $40 million this \nyear, bringing the total outlay for that office to nearly $600 million.\n  In negotiating this Agreement, my Administration was guided by the \nobjectives set out by the Congress in the Trade Act of 2002. My \nAdministration has complied fully with the letter and spirit of Trade \nPromotion Authority--from preparation for the negotiations, to \nconsultations with the Congress throughout the talks, to the content of \nthe Agreement itself. In addition, my Administration has conducted \nseveral hundred further consultations, led congressional trips to \nColombia, and last year renegotiated key labor, environmental, \ninvestment, and intellectual property rights provisions in the \nAgreement at the behest of the Congress. By providing for the effective \nenforcement of labor and environmental laws, combined with strong \nremedies for noncompliance, the Agreement will contribute to improved \nworker rights and higher levels of environmental protection in \nColombia. The result is an Agreement that all of us can be proud of and \nthat will create significant new opportunities for American workers, \nfarmers, ranchers, businesses, and consumers by opening the Colombian \nmarket and eliminating barriers to U.S. goods, services, and \ninvestment.\n  Under the Agreement, tariffs on over 80 percent of U.S. industrial \nand consumer goods exported to Colombia will be eliminated immediately, \nwith tariffs on the remaining goods eliminated within 10 years. The \nAgreement will allow 52 percent of U.S. agricultural exports, by value, \nto enter Colombia duty-free immediately, with the remaining \nagricultural tariffs phased out over time. This will help to level the \nplaying field, as 91 percent of U.S. imports from Colombia already \nenjoy duty-free access to our market under U.S. trade preference \nprograms.\n  My Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the \nCongress on a bipartisan path forward to secure approval of this \nlegislation that builds on the positive spirit of the May 10, 2007, \nagreement on trade between the Administration and the House and Senate \nleadership, and the strong bipartisan support demonstrated by both \nHouses of Congress in overwhelmingly approving the United States-Peru \nTrade Promotion Agreement last year. The United States-Colombia Trade \nPromotion Agreement represents an historic step forward in U.S. \nrelations with a key friend and ally in Latin America. Congressional \napproval of legislation to implement the Agreement is in our national \ninterest, and I urge the Congress to act favorably on this legislation \nas quickly as possible.\n                                                      George W.

A resolution transmitted by a private citizen \n     relative to the Uintah Treaty; to the Committee on Indian \n     Affairs.\n        POM-301. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     enact legislation to change the computation of the State \n     Federal Medical Assistance Percentage; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 243\n\n       Whereas, the Federal Medicaid Assistance Percentage (FMAP) \n     determines the distribution of federal matching funds for \n     medical assistance programs, including Medicaid. The United \n     States Department of Health and Human Services calculates the \n     FMAP annually for each state. The formula for calculating the \n     FMAP is determined by a state's per capita income as \n     calculated by the United States Department of Commerce. In \n     2003, the state lost about $160 million in federal Medicaid \n     funds when General Motors made a one-time $16 billion payment \n     to its underfunded pension plan. This one-time payment was \n     included and skewed the calculation of the state's per capita \n     income; and\n       Whereas, recent contract negotiations between three \n     domestic automakers and the UAW will generate large one-time \n     payments beginning in 2010 to a Volunteer Employee Benefits \n     Association (VEBA) trust fund to be administered by the \n     union. These payments will be similar in character to the \n     payment made by General Motors for underfunded pension \n     liabilities that skewed the FMAP calculation of state per \n     capita income in 2003; and\n       Whereas, State and local governments are encouraged to \n     prefund their retiree health benefits as a result of the \n     Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) 45 reporting \n     requirement. These payments will be similar in character to \n     the General Motors one-time payment for underfunded pension \n     liabilities that skewed the FMAP calculation of state per \n     capita income; and\n       Whereas, the combined contributions of the automobile \n     companies will result in over $60 billion that will overstate \n     the state's personal income by billions of dollars. The \n     prefunding of public employee retirement by state and local \n     governments will result in an exponential increase in this \n     overstatement. This would place the state at risk of a \n     decline in its FMAP for the three years that these \n     contributions affect personal income calculations; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize Congress to enact legislation to change the \n     computing of state Federal Medical Assistance Percentage by \n     disregarding employer contributions toward retiree health \n     care in calculating Medicaid; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n[[Page S2743]]\n\n       POM-302. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to \n     eliminate provisions of law which reduce social security \n     benefits for those receiving benefits from government \n     retirement systems; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    House Concurrent Resolution No. 7\n\n        Whereas, the Congress of the United States has enacted \n     both the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the \n     spousal and survivor social security benefit, and the \n     Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), reducing the earned \n     social security benefit for persons who also receive federal, \n     state, or local retirement; and\n        Whereas, the intent of Congress in enacting the GPO and \n     the WEP provisions was to address concerns that a public \n     employee who had worked primarily in federal, state, and \n     local government employment might receive a public pension in \n     addition to the same social security benefit as a worker who \n     had worked only in employment covered by social security \n     throughout his career; and\n        Whereas, the purpose of Congress in enacting these \n     reduction provisions was to provide a disincentive for public \n     employees to receive two pensions; and\n        Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a spouse or survivor \n     receiving federal, state, or local government retirement \n     benefits who would also be entitled to a social security \n     benefit earned by a spouse; and\n        Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor \n     social security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     federal, state, or local government retirement benefit \n     received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases completely \n     eliminating the social security benefit; and\n        Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned \n     federal, state, or local government retirement benefits, in \n     addition to working in covered employment and paying into the \n     social security system; and\n        Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned social security \n     benefit using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula \n     and may reduce social security benefits for such persons by \n     as much as one-half of the uncovered public retirement \n     benefits earned; and\n        Whereas, because of these calculation characteristics, the \n     GPO and WEP have a disproportionately negative effect on \n     employees working in lower-wage government jobs; and\n        Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort to improve the \n     quality of life of its citizens and to encourage them to live \n     here lifelong. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to review the \n     GPO and WEP social security benefit reductions and to \n     consider eliminating them. Be it further\n       Resolved,  That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/08/senate-section/article/S2743-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. KENNEDY, from the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions:\n       Report to accompany S. 1858, A bill to amend the Public \n     Health Service Act to establish grant programs to provide for \n     education and outreach on newborn screening and coordinated \n     followup care once newborn screening has been conducted, to \n     reauthorize programs under part A of title XI of such Act, \n     and for other purposes (Rept.

A bill to reauthorize the Federal Trade Commission, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal Trade \nCommission Reauthorization Act of 2008. I am joined by Senator Inouye. \nWe seek with this reauthorization to give the Federal Trade Commission, \nFTC, what it needs to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive \npractices and unfair methods of competition.\n  The agency has a very important mission, but needs more resources and \nauthority. The number of FTC employees has been greatly reduced from \nits pre-1980 high of 1,746, and the agency currently has approximately \n1,102 employees. We need to make sure that they have the manpower and \nthe technology to protect consumers.\n  I'd like to take a second to highlight one of the areas where the FTC \nneeds authority most. The subprime loan market was an orgy of greed \nfrom a large number of lenders who knowingly put borrowers in mortgage \nloans that they could not afford--while at the same time loading up \nthese loans with provisions that trigger large fees and penalties.\n  The mortgage brokers ran ads from coast to coast--you have seen them: \n``Do you have bad credit? Do you have trouble getting a loan? Have you \nbeen missing payments on your home loan? Have you filed for bankruptcy? \nIt doesn't matter. Come to us; we will give you a loan.''\n  Many borrowers were brought in by teaser rates, interest-only \npayments, no payments for 12 months, etc. Loans had quick resets to \nhigher and unaffordable interest rates. Loans had prepayment penalties. \nMarketed loan payment amounts did not include escrowed amounts, taxes, \ninsurance, and other financial obligations. These unfair and deceitful \nadvertisements are still on Web sites for lenders across the country \ntoday. The FTC needs the authority to stop this practice and resources \nto investigate and go after the bad actors.\n  Let me tell you a bit about what the bill does. The bill provides for \na 7-year reauthorization starting in 2009. We set the fiscal year 2009 \nfunding at $264 million and increase it by 10 percent per year. In \naddition, we give them an additional $20 million to be used by the \ncommission to improve technology in support of its competition and \nconsumer protection missions.\n  We give the FTC independent litigating authority so they won't have \nto refer their cases to the Department of Justice. We also give the FTC \nthe authority to give preference in the hiring process to \nadministrative law judges who have experience in their issues.\n  We provide the FTC the authority to commence a civil action to \nrecover civil penalties in a district court for any violation of the \nFTC Act.\n  We extend their jurisdiction to allow them to go after nonprofit \nentities as well, so bad actors cannot hide behind nonprofit status, \nand we allow them to go after those aiding and abetting an FTC \nviolation.\n  We also give them the authority, by majority vote of the full \ncommission, to waive their current rulemaking requirements for any rule \ninvolving a consumer protection matter.\n  We require the FTC to conduct a rulemaking under the Administrative \nProcedures Act, APA, which is faster than their current Magnuson-Moss \nauthority, in the area of subprime loans. The commission has sent 200 \nwarning letters to mortgage advertisers and is conducting several \ninvestigations of mortgage advertisers and subprime lenders. In \naddition, the FTC has brought 21 cases in the last decade. But they \nhaven't had the opportunity to review the bad practices and create a \nrule preventing their reoccurrence. We give them authority to create a \nrule preventing unfair or deceptive behavior by lenders and allow the \nState attorneys general to enforce the rule.\n  Finally, we repeal the common carrier exemption as the FTC has long \nbeen requesting. There are too many problems in the telecommunications \nworld that need to be addressed by the FTC--consumers should not be \nleft unprotected. We also make sure that the State Do Not Call laws are \nnot preempted by Federal regulations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2831\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 505, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 505) commending the University of \n     Kansas men's basketball team for winning the 2008 National \n     Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I basketball \n     championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is my privilege today to submit S. \nRes. 505, along with Mr. Brownback. It is my hope it will be considered \nhot-lined on both sides and passed later this afternoon.\n  This resolution is a commendation resolution on behalf of the \nUniversity of Kansas Men's Basketball Team for winning the 2008 \nNational Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, Division I, basketball \nchampionship as of last night.\n  This might be a little unique in that I am a graduate of Kansas State \nUniversity, home of the ever-optimistic and fighting Wildcats. \nSometimes we are rivals. In this particular case, all of Kansas, \nincluding every K State fan, stands in salute of the Jayhawks. It is \nclearly ``Rock Chalk, Jayhawk'' time in Kansas.\n  Mr. President, I will skip to the bottom line of the resolution, \nwhere it says:\n\n       Whereas, the families of the players, students, alumni, and \n     faculty of the University of Kansas, and all the supporters \n     of the University of Kansas, are to be congratulated for \n     their commitment to, and pride in, the basketball program at \n     the university: Now, therefore be it resolved the Senate \n     commends the University of Kansas men's basketball team for \n     winning the 2008 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship.\n\n  The Secretary of the Senate will transmit enrolled copies of this \nresolution to the University of Kansas so they can display it; the \nchancellor of the university, Bob Hemenway, a great friend; the \nathletic director of the university, Lew Perkins; and the head coach of \nthe team, Bill Self, who should remain at the University of Kansas. \nThose remarks were not prepared, but that is my advice.\n  For those of you who did not see the game last night--and it started \nat 9 p.m. and I know most Senators are probably asleep at 9 o'clock at \nnight--trailing 60 to 51, with 2:12 seconds left in regulation, Kansas \nclosed the second half with a 12-3 run, capped off by a Mario Chalmers' \nthree-point basket, with 2.1 seconds remaining to force overtime. \nKansas then outscored Memphis 12 to 5 in overtime to claim its third \nnational championship.\n  As General Petraeus is here testifying before four committees in \nregard to national security and the war with Iraq, and when this Senate \nis considering a housing bill and stimulus package to help the economy, \nlet us hope the example of the University of Kansas men's basketball \nteam, in regard to their perseverance and dedication, will enable us to \nachieve our goals as well.\n  If you listen hard, from the mountains from which our acting \nPresiding Officer is so familiar, from Montana and further west, on to \nthe high plains, to the Midwest, across the Appalachians, and clear to \nthe east coast and our Nation's capital--if you listen hard, you can \nhear that chant, ``Rock Chalk, Jayhawk, KU-U-U.'' If we listen hard, \nmaybe we can work together, follow their example of perseverance and \nunbelievable heroics to win the NCAA championship. Thus, sayeth this \nchampion of Kansas State athletics on behalf of the University of \nKansas and their basketball team.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on April 8, 2008, by the President of \nthe United States: Amendments to the Constitution and Convention of the \nInternational Telecommunication Union (Geneva, 1992), (Treaty Document \nNo. 110-16.)\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the treaty be considered as \nhaving been read the first time; that it be referred, with accompanying \npapers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be \nprinted, and that the President's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the amendments to the Constitution \nand Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (Geneva, \n1992), as amended by the Plenipotentiary Conference (Kyoto, 1994) and \nthe Plenipotentiary Conference (Marrakesh, 2002), together with the \ndeclarations and reservations by the United States, all as contained in \nthe Final Acts of the Plenipotentiary Conference (Antalya, 2006). I \ntransmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the \nDepartment of State concerning the amendments.\n  The Plenipotentiary Conference (Antalya, 2006) adopted amendments \nthat, among other things: clarify the functions of certain \nInternational Telecommunication Union (ITU) officials and bodies; \nreduce the frequency of certain ITU conferences; clarify eligibility \nfor re-election to certain ITU positions; enhance oversight of the ITU \nbudget and provide for results-based (as well as cost-based) budget \nproposals; expand the scale of available contribution levels for Member \nStates and Sector Members; and, clarify the definition of and role of \nobservers participating in ITU proceedings.\n  Consistent with longstanding practice in the ITU, the United States, \nin signing the 2006 amendments, made certain declarations and \nreservations. Subject to those declarations and reservations, I believe \nthe United States should ratify the 2006 amendments to the \nInternational Telecommunication Union Constitution and Convention. \nThese amendments will contribute to the ITU's ability to adapt to \nchanges in the global telecommunications sector and, in so doing, serve \nthe needs of the United States Government and United States industry. \nIt is my hope that the Senate will take early action on this matter and \ngive its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W.
